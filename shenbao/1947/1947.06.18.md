### National Army Troops Advance Southward on Two Routes; Threat to Tianjin is Lifted; Communist Troops in Eastern Hebei Constantly Harass

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 17th] Communist troops on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway (Jinpu Railway) have begun to retreat. The National Army is advancing southward on two routes. One route is advancing on the front line and has already entered Daxiaobozhuang and Chaozongqiao, which are under the jurisdiction of Jinghai County on the north bank of the Jian River. Several thousand communist soldiers have completely retreated. The other route is pointing south along the railway, crossing Chenguantun. The main force of the communist troops in that area is fleeing westward to Dacheng area. The military has announced that the threat to Tianjin has been lifted. Communist troops in eastern Tianjin are still appearing frequently. Yesterday, several thousand communist troops gathered across the Hai River from Tanggu and had contact with nearby salt police. In addition, more than 3,000 communist troops under the command of Wu Hong of Ninghe County, northwest of Tanggu, occupied Chijian Beach on the 16th, attempting to approach the Xinhe River in Tanggu and disrupt traffic.

Yesterday, they successively captured Tangjiatun, Renguantun, and Xingji. Jinghai and Qingxian are currently under siege, and the fighting is fierce. Related parties stated that the main forces of the communist troops in western Hebei, central Hebei, and Taihang have all moved eastward. A large number of communist troops have also occupied the triangular area of Ping, Jin, and Bao. The judgment on their actions is: (1) to echo the main battle in the Northeast, emphasizing mobility and harassment; (2) to threaten Pingjin; (3) to cut off various railway lines and obstruct military deployment.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 17th] According to news received on the evening of the 16th, although the battle on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway is still taking place south of Chenguantun, which is 60 kilometers away from Tianjin, the strength of the National Army has become stronger and stronger after repeated deployments in recent days. It is expected that there will be a major development in the war situation in three or four days. According to the military authorities, the main force of the invading communist troops has been identified as Nie Rongzhen's troops, with a total number of no more than 30,000 to 40,000 people.

### Northern Travelogue Three; Wind and Sand in Huai Ren Tang

By Bu Shaofu

(Picture: Wangfujing Street, Beiping)

The wind and sand bring迷蒙, and the Great Wall could not stop this侵袭. We southerners are quite unaccustomed to this kind of confusion that fills the sky and the earth. At this moment, it is even more symbolic of chaos, entanglement, and unclearity.

The Pingjin Railway line is interrupted every two or three days. Tongxian seems to be a duckweed floating on the sea. A guard platoon leader at the Xiyuan Airport pointed to the mountains far behind and said to me that there are small groups of 出没 thirty miles away. This year, even kind men and women did not dare to pay their respects to the gods at the Miaofengshan incense meeting on the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month.

The people of Beiping are very calm. Although everyone knows that they seem to be in a笼城, they are used to living in the wind and sand.

I arrived in Beiping during the peak of the student潮. No one dared to predict what would happen in this student city with a glorious historical tradition of student movements. But the result was surprisingly satisfactory. There were only a few minor conflicts during the three weeks of continuous turmoil. Beiping's students are the best in the country. The various aspects shown by Beiping's students in this turmoil were not more intense than those in other places. People may ask who created this satisfactory result. Anyone in Beiping can answer you: it is General Li Zongren and his Chief of Staff, Wang Hongshao. This is a fair judgment of society. I dare not assume what the evolution of the situation would be if General Li Zongren were not responsible for the當局, because this assumption is superfluous and wasteful.

Students are, after all, students. General Li Zongren commanded the three armies and dominated the battlefield during the Battle of Xuzhou. He knew how to fight and how to command troops. Now, he also understands practical politics. He did not treat students and soldiers the same. He was kind-hearted and applied情 and理 with tolerance, and the result was naturally a state of self-comfort and comfort to others.

One windy and sandy day, a friend and I went to the行辕 in Zhongnanhai to visit him. I said that old novels often provide stories of coincidences between people's names and place names. Zhongnanhai has居仁堂 and怀仁堂, but now it is the office of the Director of the行辕. I am afraid that this was not expected by Mr. Li at the beginning.

During the most tense period of the student unrest, Hu Shih, Lu Zhiwei, Li Zheng and others were frequent guests in the Hall of Grace. Li not only won the sincere cooperation of the university presidents with his sincere能度, but also supported the opinions of the university presidents with concrete actions. However, this vast and quiet garden made General Li Delin feel a sense of national郁闷. He had his own心曲, perhaps the water flowing潺溝前 can潺沟地他 流鸣!

Mayor He Siyuan is also a frequent guest in Huai Rentang. He has been in office for less than a year. As far as I know, his greatest achievement is the work of clearing the穢土 (garbage) in the urban area. According to reports, the 穢土 accumulated in Beiping for more than ten years was completely cleared in two months and thirteen days, totaling 2,100,973 tons of 穢土 cleared. The average daily mobilization was 188,200 people, mobilizing a total of 5,540 cars, 4,315 手車, 420 trams, and 68 train carriages. The cost was more than 1.12 billion yuan. The 秽土 accumulated for more than ten years; once cleared, it made the city of Beiping look brand new, and even more able to show the beauty of this园林化都市.

It is said that Mr. He Siyuan once expected himself to be a civilian mayor, but some people said that he was very good at being an official. In today's Chinese society, mentioning the word "官" almost represents sin. This popular concept is the most dangerous and can destroy everything. In this kind of atmosphere, everyone is fearful and keeps themselves clean and good. Under the same atmosphere, good public servants are even抹煞 by everyone. Officials have their official duties. Being good at being an official means that they cannot abandon their official duties at the very least. Therefore, being good at being an official should not be considered a bad thing. If a person wants to be good and strives for public reputation, at least the motivation is not bad, and society should not hesitate to give encouragement. Because rewarding people for being good, the negative meaning is贬责 bad people.

Mr. He Siyuan is outspoken and豪爽. His speech at the founding meeting of the Manchu Cultural Promotion Association in Zhongshan Park was脍炙故都人士之口, and the Manchu compatriots in particular were satisfied. However, sometimes, the temperament is a bit impatient. Once, he convened representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, trade unions, farmers' associations, and other units to give instructions. In the middle of one paragraph, he said:

Now everyone is骂 so-called: "是官皆责," but even if you are greedy, you have to have an opportunity! And the newspapers are also scolding貪汚, which is like a person who only looks at his own茅房奥, the kitchen is not clean, and feels煩. If there are guests, let them sit in the living room, and what they see is not just as beautiful? So it is best for us to 應客, and not only look at the 厠所 and 厨房.

Therefore, some people put forward a "客應政治论" slogan.

This pair of important northern towns, the emperors of all generations, are安谧 in the inside, and their scope is limited to thirty miles from the city, even in the peaceful and serene atmosphere of the city, you can always smell the gunpowder around you. One day, the following news appeared in the society column of the newspaper:

A young woman lives in the apartment of a Swiss businessman at No. 137 South Entrance of Wangfujing Street. The interior equipment is luxurious, and the demeanor is also very阔绰. The hotel music inspection督导组 received a密报 saying that the young woman is a Japanese woman, or a person engaged in espionage work, and sent Wang Chen, the second组长, to check. The young woman spoke fluent Chinese. She claimed to be named Yang Huiming and was a译 for the Americans in the Military Mediation Department, and had also served in the Changchun Forward Command Post. Her original籍 was from Fujian, but when she asked her mother and sister-in-law again, they could only answer in Japanese-style Chinese, so the three mothers and daughters were 解送 to the稽查處 for interrogation.

Beiping is in迷离.

The wind and sand is a product of nature. Friends say that the momentum in autumn and winter is even more alarming. I hope that人事 will not use it as a symbol, and maintain the simplicity, purity, and grandeur of the northern mountains, rivers, customs, and people, and seek progress in stability. However, this is only a wish.

籠城, how can we 修谈政情!

Upon graduation, students will receive two qualifications and diplomas: one as a formal military officer and one as a Bachelor of Science. However, prospective students must pass a rigorous entrance examination to be admitted. It is currently reported that the academy plans to begin enrollment this autumn.

### Far East Economic Conference: Second Day; Delegates from Various Countries Deliver Speeches; Philippine Delegate Elected Vice Chairman

[Our Dispatch] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its second day of meetings yesterday. The meeting began at 10:30 AM. According to the agenda, the fourth item to be discussed was the election of the Vice Chairman of the Conference. However, because the Soviet delegate, Mr. Stetsenko, repeatedly proposed at the previous day's meeting that this election should be held after the delegates from each country had delivered their speeches, the American delegate, Mr. Davis, suggested yesterday morning that agenda item five, "Determination of Provisional Agenda," should be discussed before item four. This would include short speeches from delegates who wished to present reports on the economic surveys of their respective countries. This proposal was seconded by the Soviet delegate and passed by the conference. Chairman Jiang Tingfu then invited the Indian delegate to speak first. However, the Indian delegate, Mr. Nehru, stated that he was not prepared and requested to speak in the afternoon.

The British delegate, Mr. Crowe, then delivered a speech, followed by delegates from Thailand, France, Australia, and other countries. The morning session then adjourned.

The session continued at 3 PM with speeches from delegates from India, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. At this point, the speeches of the ten national delegates were completed, and the election of the Vice Chairman began. The French delegate, Mr. Mourinon, first nominated the Philippine delegate, Mr. Guaderno. He stated that Mr. Guaderno was highly talented and experienced and was suitable for the position of Vice Chairman. He was not only a lawyer but also a financier who had served as the Deputy Manager of the Philippine National Bank and was currently the Philippine Minister of Finance. This proposal was seconded by the Thai delegate. However, the Soviet delegate, Mr. Stetsenko, expressed his dissent: "I have stated earlier that the Soviet delegation arrived in Shanghai late and has not had sufficient time to consider the candidate for Vice Chairman. As far as I know, the candidate for Vice Chairman was decided outside the meeting by other delegates before the conference opened, but the delegates from our country did not participate. Therefore, I am not bound by this decision and should nominate another candidate. In addition, the qualifications of the Vice Chairman should be considered. In addition to the economic qualifications mentioned by the French delegate, attention should also be paid to geographical and other relationships. However, since the other delegates have now made a different decision, the Soviet delegate can only remain silent on this matter."

The Thai delegate then proposed that the discussion be closed. The Chairman then announced that the Philippine delegate, Mr. Guaderno, had been elected Vice Chairman of the conference. Mr. Guaderno then rose to express his gratitude and thanked the conference on behalf of the Philippines.

The conference adjourned at 5 PM. This morning's meeting is still scheduled to be held at 10:30 AM.

The Research and Review Subcommittee on Provisional Rules of Procedure of the conference held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in the lounge on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel.

The speeches of the delegates from various countries are recorded below:

British Delegate

Mr. Crowe stated briefly: "The organization of this conference still needs to be gradually developed. It is not appropriate to make the task too burdensome when starting work. The main task at present is still to exchange information so that various proposals can have a solid foundation. I hope that all countries can be open and honest and provide each other with information. At the same time, the delegates of each country can strictly adhere to the scope and not seek irrelevant information." Mr. Crowe also stated: "The holding of this conference in Shanghai is of great significance. China and Shanghai suffered great losses during the war. It is appropriate to discuss reconstruction plans here today."

Thai Delegate

Mr. Arsanayuq Ditthi stated: "The Thai authorities deeply hope to establish close ties with this conference in order to improve Thailand's economic situation. Since the Japanese occupied Thailand, it has suffered extreme destruction in recent years. At present, transportation, industry, and agriculture all need to be restored, and there are many difficulties. Although we are in all kinds of difficulties, we are still willing to take on a part of the responsibility for the economic reconstruction of Asia and make our best efforts to establish close ties with various countries."

French Delegate

Mr. Mourinon, in his speech, expressed the gratitude of the French delegation to the Chinese government for allowing the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East conference to be held in China. He expressed the French delegation's determination to cooperate to the best of its ability in the main work of the conference: research and investigation.

Australian Delegate

Mr. Wootton (Deputy Delegate) stated in his speech: "One of the tasks of this commission is to seek long-term economic cooperation plans in order to submit concrete recommendations to the Economic Council." Mr. Wootton also stated: "Economic cooperation between countries does not necessarily have to have a fixed plan. Under both state-owned and commercial modes, it is hoped that there can be various similar methods. When studying these plans, this commission should not use political theory as the principle of decision."

Indian Delegate

Mr. Nehru stated in his speech: "In order to establish a new economic foundation for Asia and the Far East, the first thing that deserves our attention is to promote international cooperation and realize true democracy, freedom, and equality. This responsibility should be fulfilled by the United Nations." Although the political backgrounds of the countries in Asia and the Far East are different, the goal of rebuilding the economic foundation and improving the lives of the people is the same. At this conference, after studying the various reports and proposals, we should seek a perfect economic plan for adoption and implementation by the United Nations.

US Delegate

Mr. Davis stated briefly in his speech: "The US delegation has three main points: (1) The conference should first comprehensively study the working reports of the various subcommittees in detail. (2) Formulate methods for rebuilding the economic foundation of Asia and the Far East. (3) Study the needs of each country separately and focus on practical work." He finally added: "Since we firmly believe in the importance of economic reconstruction, we must not neglect the improvement of transportation, the increase of food production, and international trade, as these all have a great impact on economic improvement."

Soviet Delegate

In his speech, Mr. Stetsenko made a clear statement on the Soviet Union's position. The main points are as follows: (1) In order to implement the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter, this commission must respect the sovereignty of each country, absolutely not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and, in particular, must act in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and not take any action against any country without the permission of the country concerned. (2) This commission must pay close attention to the assistance given by each country to friendly countries and not use assistance as political pressure. (3) The Soviet Union will do its best to assist other countries in their reconstruction while also implementing its socialist economic organization and its five-year plan. (4) In the work of striving for peaceful reconstruction, the main goal is to prevent reactionary forces and fascism from having the opportunity to create war again. (5) The task of this commission is to assist countries with abundant resources to develop their productive forces and achieve their economic independence. At the same time, this commission must also assist these countries in their political and national independence.

### Raising the Status of Women: Working Hard for Equality; The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Issues Declaration

[Our Dispatch] The Far East Economic Commission conference received a declaration from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. This declaration was proposed by fifteen women representatives of the United Nations Economic Commission, each representing a different country, demanding that women obtain equality in all sectors: political, economic, civil, social, and educational, as well as improvements in their lives. The declaration stated: "Since entering the 20th century, the promotion of women's rights has been noticed and valued by all parties. Today, countries are increasingly promoting the movement to seek equal rights and equal status for men and women. In some countries, women have already obtained equal rights with men in politics, economics, and human rights, but in many countries, women have not yet achieved liberation and equality, and the work of promoting the women's rights movement is not progressing effectively. In order to achieve the goal of raising the status of women, the United Nations calls on all countries around the world to work hard for equality between men and women."

### I Need a Stable Life: Li Qian States the Hopes of the Chinese People

The Deputy Delegate of our country, Mr. Li Qian, stated in his speech: "Before making my main remarks, I would like to first state a few points, that the views of the Chinese delegation can be said to be completely consistent with those expressed by the other delegates. The Chinese delegation strongly agrees with the scope of work proposed by the Australian and American delegates, and the principles of work proposed by the Soviet delegate are also what the Chinese delegation wants to suggest.

In addition, the Chinese delegation is very honored that Dr. Jiang Tingfu of the Chinese delegation has been elected as the Chairman of the Conference, but the Chinese delegation has lost a representative who can truly speak for the people. I have no choice but to express some opinions on behalf of Dr. Jiang.

What I want to report to you is the hope of the Chinese people. Looking back on the Japanese invasion of Asia, China was its target. Although it later invaded Southeast Asia and other countries, the battlefields it opened up were all centered on China. According to surveys, the number of soldiers and civilians who died in China due to the war is estimated at 12.1 million, 439 cities were damaged, of which 43 were almost completely destroyed, and the loss of public and private property amounted to approximately 5.85 billion US dollars. This shows the significant losses suffered by China due to the war, and the extent of economic destruction is unimaginable. The post-war economy is still facing many difficulties. Although it has been almost two years since the victory, recovery will not be easy in the next few years. China, like other countries, is experiencing inflation, which has caused political and social instability.

What the Chinese people need most today is a stable life and increased production. We hope that the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East conference can formulate a plan to help China become self-reliant, promote production, and achieve the simple goal of "improving life."

To achieve this goal, (1) production must be organized reasonably, and (2) goods must be distributed and circulated reasonably. To this end, the Chinese delegation specifically recommends the following points: (1) Increase agricultural production, especially food production, and cooperate with international food organizations to avoid setting up too many institutions. (2) Promote a balanced industrial production system to achieve reasonable procedures. (3) Improve transportation. (4) Promote international trade in the Far East and worldwide.

The Chairman said in his speech yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) that whether politics can be clarified and society can be stabilized all depends on the economy. Since society is unstable, it reflects the importance of economic construction. Therefore, China sincerely hopes that the conference can contribute valuable opinions and provide assistance.

Dutch Delegate

Mr. Staesgen stated: "I am very pleased that this conference can be held in Shanghai, as China suffered great hardships during the war." He also said: "The Netherlands and Indonesia also suffered significant destruction during the war, and the Netherlands needs a lot of external assistance for its domestic construction. I sincerely hope that this conference can decide on a plan and method for building the economy."

Philippine Delegate

Mr. Guaderno stated briefly: "The delegates from various countries have expressed many opinions, and I agree with them all, so I will not repeat them. But I can guarantee that the Philippine Republic can give the greatest cooperation to this conference. I also hope that in a short period of time, the Philippine delegation can submit a research proposal on the scope of the meeting to the conference for discussion."

### Japan's Priority Reparations Only 1.56 Million Tons; China Gets Half, 780,000 Tons

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to Chinese sources, the 30% of priority reparations based on temporary measures amount to 3.5 million tons. Mr. Li Dechen, a Chinese reparations representative, stated that this figure is an exaggeration. The total tonnage of temporary reparations has been revised several times. The first stipulation was in September of last year, totaling 12 million tons. In November, it was reduced to 5.5 million tons. Before January, the General Headquarters Reparations Executive Office re-fixed it at 5.2 million tons. The 30% priority reparations based on temporary measures totaled 1.56 million tons, not 3.5 million tons as reported. China received half of the priority reparations, totaling 780,000 tons, not 1.75 million tons. The scope of reparations will be decided by the Far East Commission, which includes 13 industries and over 1,000 factories. The main reasons for the delay in the relocation of reparations are: (1) The Soviet Union removed some machinery and equipment from Northeast China, which should be regarded as reparations, but the Soviet Union insisted that it was a victory, so there was a conflict of opinion. (2) The ratio of reparations is difficult to determine.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The investigation of machine tool factories in northern Japan by our country's Reparations Committee has ended. The members of the committee visited seven factories in Niigata and Toyama during their visit to northern Japan. During their inspection of southern Japan, they visited eight factories in Kyoto, Osaka, and other places. They will continue to inspect factories in Nanto next week, including about ten factories located in and around Tokyo. According to the committee, 29 factories were inspected this time, and 13 factories were inspected at the beginning of this year.

Editorial

### Facing the Subtle Relationship Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union

Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace delivered a speech in Washington yesterday, advocating that the heads of state of the U.S. and the Soviet Union meet to eliminate all differences between the two countries in order to avoid the outbreak of a third world war. He also proposed six concrete measures: (1) If the heads of state of the U.S. and the Soviet Union can meet frankly and discuss everything, it will not be difficult to reach an agreement on any issue; (2) The Soviet Union should also be able to share a portion of the vast oil fields controlled by Britain and the U.S. in the Near East; (3) The U.S. should ban international arms sales in order to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the issue of controlling atomic energy; (4) Abolish the Truman Doctrine and its armed forces, and the policy that the Soviet Union considers hostile towards governments; (5) The U.S. should also provide credit loans to the Soviet Union for post-war reconstruction in exchange for the Soviet Union's raw materials for American industrial production.

Wallace's proposal, made at a time when U.S.-Soviet relations are tense, is worth studying from any angle. We believe that the core of the post-war world problem lies in the reversal of U.S.-Soviet relations. The Allies won the victory, but failed to create a successful peace. The only crux is that the U.S. and the Soviet Union not only cannot cooperate sincerely and jointly devote themselves to creating world peace, but instead, they are mutually suspicious and stand in opposition everywhere. The breakdown of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference is the superficial manifestation of the U.S.-Soviet conflict reaching its peak, making everyone believe that if there is no hope for improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, there can be no peace in the post-war world. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world earnestly hope that the politicians of the U.S. and the Soviet Union will use their political wisdom to eliminate all misunderstandings and suspicions between the two countries, and be able to cooperate sincerely and jointly devote themselves to the creation of world peace, in order to achieve the lofty ideals envisioned by the United Nations organization. However, observing the words and deeds of the U.S. and the Soviet Union after the war, it is not difficult to prove that the two countries have parted ways and are moving further and further apart. Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson delivered a speech to students at Middleton University on the 15th, condemning the Soviet Union for adopting policies that violate international understanding and world recovery, and pointed out the concrete facts of the Soviet Union's obstruction of world peace: (1) In the Far East: The Soviet Union moved away the industrial equipment of the nine northeastern provinces of China, maintained its control over the port of Dalian, and opposed the unification of Korea; (2) In the Middle East, the Soviet Union incited the northern province of Azerbaijan to secede from Iran and encouraged Greece's neighbors to support the Greek Communist armed rebellion against the Greek government; (3) In the Balkans, a coup d'état suddenly occurred in Hungary when the treaty was being implemented, and the Soviet Union should bear full responsibility; (4) In Germany and Austria, the Soviet Union did not hesitate to violate the Potsdam Agreement, stubbornly obstructed the unification of the German economy, and tried every possible means to hinder the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty. Acheson's remarks can be regarded as the reason why the American people are dissatisfied with the Soviet Union. On the Soviet side, there are also many things about the words and deeds of the U.S. government that they are not satisfied with. Soviet newspapers, magazines, and radio stations often publish remarks attacking the current policies of the U.S., which can be summarized as follows: (1) The U.S. maintains the secret of atomic energy and refuses to fully disclose it, harboring the intention of threatening other countries with atomic energy, making the Soviet Union feel uneasy; (2) The U.S. still wants to maintain its military bases all over the world after the war, no less than having the ambition of imperialists to control the whole world; (3) The U.S. uses financial diplomacy to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries in Europe and Asia; especially the aid to Greece and Turkey is entirely aimed at the Soviet Union; (4) The Truman Doctrine clearly has the intention of preventing communism and opposing the Soviet Union, which should not be tolerated by the Soviet Union; (5) The U.S. adopts a lenient policy towards defeated countries, which is especially opposed by the Soviet Union, believing that the U.S. is no less than adopting a policy of supporting Germany and Japan.

The suspicion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not only deepening, but the division of the post-war world into two worlds is also becoming increasingly clear. Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover even advocated that the U.S. should abandon the Soviet Union and conclude a peace treaty with Germany and Japan alone. Although this extreme proposal was not adopted by the U.S. diplomatic authorities, it was taken very seriously by U.S. public opinion. The general psychology of the American people can also be seen. However, as long as people appeal to common sense and conscience, they will all understand the seriousness of the post-war world situation. If no attempt is made to reverse the adverse trend between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, not only will there be no peace in the world, but mankind will move towards a new war one day, which is approaching "heaven." This is not intentionally alarmist, but a definite feeling we have gained from facing reality squarely. The most noteworthy feature of the European economic cooperation plan recently proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall is not that the U.S. continues to aid European countries suffering from war disasters in order to prevent their social economy from collapsing, but that it also includes the Soviet Union in the scope of European economic cooperation, thereby diluting the emotions of the people of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Therefore, this plan has very important significance from a long-term perspective. As Republican presidential candidate Stettinius said: "Whether world war and economic panic can be avoided in the future depends on the world economic policy adopted by the United States."

Suspicion between countries is of course caused by many factors; the elimination of suspicion also depends on the joint efforts of many parties. Although the current U.S. diplomatic authorities have the intention of improving U.S.-Soviet relations, whether this good plan can be effective depends on whether the other party can accept it. British Foreign Secretary Bevin has already flown to Paris yesterday to discuss the European economic cooperation plan with the French authorities. At the same time, there are also rumors that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit France. However, the hope that the Soviet Union can also agree to the U.S. plan is very slim, because in the past few days, Moscow Radio has either criticized Secretary of State Marshall for promoting the Truman Doctrine or refuted the U.S. plan, attempting to use the dollar to oppress other countries. Therefore, at present, if Soviet politicians cannot reflect on themselves and thoroughly realize the situation, it seems impossible to turn hostility into peace between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Wallace's proposal, although it sounds very moving, is ultimately a beautiful fantasy that does not conform to reality!

### British Foreign Secretary Arrives in Paris, Holds Preliminary Consultations with French Foreign Minister, U.S. Aid to Europe Plan is the Focus of Negotiations

[United Press, Paris, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault held "exploratory" talks today to respond to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European economic recovery. At the same time, France urged European countries to participate in a specialized international committee to cooperate with the U.S. in drafting a unified aid procedure. However, France rejected the method of convening a European economic conference, believing that this move was too complicated and time-consuming.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] Foreign Secretary Bevin and thirteen economic experts, including Earl, Stevens, and Waley, flew to Paris this afternoon to discuss concrete steps to implement the Marshall Plan for European recovery with the French authorities. Before Bevin boarded the plane, reporters asked whether he was optimistic about the outcome of the negotiations, given that the Soviet Union had already expressed its non-participation in the plan. Bevin replied: "I have never been so optimistic in my life. I will proceed calmly, and the result is difficult to predict." He then turned to the photographers and smiled, saying: "Don't waste too much film." The Foreign Office also issued a warning, saying that the Anglo-French negotiations were "exploratory" in nature and should not be expected to reach a rapid agreement. However, London believed that a joint communiqué on the outcome of the negotiations could be expected to be issued on the evening of the 18th.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to host a banquet at the British Embassy tonight for French Prime Minister Ramadier, Foreign Minister Bidault, and economic experts from both countries. Discussions on the Marshall Plan will begin during the banquet. Bevin will return to London on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning to participate in Thursday's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, at which time he may report on the progress of the Paris talks. The method of exchanging views between British and French experts will be decided by Ramadier, Bidault, and Bevin tomorrow evening. Technical discussions can begin on Wednesday within the scope determined by the two foreign ministers. According to a dispatch from Geneva from this agency, personnel from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe hope that the commission will be able to assist in the implementation of Marshall's aid plan for Europe, but the scope of its assistance still depends on the attitude of Eastern European countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] Alfin, the French representative to the United Nations Conference, told the press that France had proposed to the United States the establishment of various economic committees in Europe to determine the economic needs of Europe and the materials that the United States will supply. Regarding France's proposal on implementing the Marshall Plan for European economic aid, the U.S. Ambassador Factory Lai has also been instructed to submit it to the U.S. State Department last Saturday. Arshi said: If countries do not work hard themselves, Europe cannot recover. This effort cannot be replaced by external aid. The European economic committees proposed by France today should be composed of (1) representatives of European production countries and (2) representatives of the United States of the "United States." Their tasks are two: (1) In order to restore Europe's productivity, we must first adjust the equipment that Europe urgently needs, study the strength of mutual supply among European countries, and then determine the amount of assistance required from the United States; (2) In the "recuperation period" before Europe's production is restored, we should also determine the amount of consumer goods that Europe can produce. If the amount is insufficient, we should seek it from the United States.

### France Asks Molotov to Come to Paris, Soviet Government Has Not Yet Replied

[Reuters, London, 16th] Although Moscow's "Pravda" today criticized Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for Europe as "political pressure under the assistance of the dollar," French people are optimistic about the talks that the foreign ministers of Britain and France will begin in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the implementation of the Marshall Plan. According to the French Foreign Ministry today, the French government received a suggestion from Foreign Secretary Bevin to come to Paris and immediately sent a letter to Moscow to inquire whether the Soviet government is willing to exchange views with the foreign ministers of Britain and France on the Marshall Plan. If they agree, they will ask Molotov to come to Paris to participate in the meeting, but the Soviet government has not yet replied. The British government also sought the Soviet government's opinion on responding to the Marshall Plan before, but judging from the remarks of "Pravda" today, the British government's attempt will undoubtedly fail. The Soviet Union's reaction to the Marshall Plan is very important. If the Soviet Union is prepared to participate, the appearance of European economic cooperation is often the brightest since the end of the war. If the Soviet Union refuses, the division between East and West will inevitably become more apparent.

[Associated Press, Paris, 16th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that the Foreign Ministry had not heard of the rumors that Soviet Foreign Minister Moyutov would come to Paris.

### U.S. Economic Policy is the Decisive Factor for World Security, Stettinius Agrees with Marshall Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Snow Sermount, Pennsylvania, 16th] U.S. Republican presidential candidate Stettinius made a speech to students at Swarthmore University today, saying that the opportunity to avoid world war and economic panic depends on the United States' world economic policy. I fully agree with the opinions recently expressed by Secretary of State Marshal Marshal at Harvard University, advocating that European countries implement economic cooperation with the help of the United States. The United States should provide a large amount of assistance to European war-torn countries in the next ten years or longer to ensure peace. The United States can take immediate action in some areas without waiting for economic negotiations between European countries. European countries urgently need the coal mines in the Ruhr area. This problem can be solved only if Britain and the United States reach an agreement. The United States should also pay immediate attention to Britain's lack of dollar problems.

### World Bank Agrees with European Plan

[U.S. News Service, Quebec, 16th] International Development Bank Chairman McCloeh said this evening that the bank "is not only prepared but also eager to cooperate fully with any positive overall economic plan to develop Europe within its powers." According to Mai, he made a speech at this year's annual meeting of the New York State Bankers Association here. Qu Zhichen pointed out that the World Bank's responsibility is to create and develop the means of production of member countries, focusing on whether the loan is sound and reasonable, and what the nature of its production is.

### Churchill Leaves Hospital

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] Churchill recently had surgery in the hospital for a hernia and has recovered and left the hospital today and returned to his private residence in Hyde Park.

### Ramadier Receives U.S. Ambassador to France

Discuss Marshall Aid to Europe Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] It has been learned from reliable sources; Prime Minister Ramadier met with U.S. Ambassador Caffery this morning and discussed the Marshall Economic Aid Team Asia Plan, especially the economic needs of France. In addition, the visit of British Foreign Secretary Bevin to Paris to hold talks with French Foreign Minister Bidault was also discussed.

### Viet Minh Asks France to Officially Recognize Independence

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 17th] The Kwaimeng Radio today broadcast a statement by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly, stating that under certain conditions, it can cooperate with France within the French Federation of the West, the conditions being: (1) Officially recognizing the independence of Chunan; (2) The unification of the North Central Region and the South Region; (3) Vietnam has the right to be treated as a member of the French Federation.

### President Truman Vetoes Income Tax Reduction Bill, The Bill Will Be Reviewed by the Senate and House of Representatives

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman vetoed the Republican-proposed $4 billion income tax cut bill today, arguing that this would increase inflationary pressure. Unexpectedly, the House of Representatives will almost abolish its veto, but the Senate will support it.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The tax bill, which has been passed by Congress to reduce domestic taxes by about $400 million annually, was vetoed by President Truman today. Since the Republican Party controlled Congress, it was the first time that the President had vetoed a bill passed by Congress. The President pointed out that the case sacrificed the ultimate good tax policy and offered risky and unstable benefits. From the government's financial point of view, it is quite insecure. This is the first major conflict between the President and Congress. Congress should review the case tomorrow. According to the Constitution, a case vetoed by the President must be maintained by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses. It is still difficult to determine whether the Republican Party can obtain the support of a two-thirds majority in both houses during the review to maintain the original case.

### U.S. House of Representatives Passes Wool Import Tax Increase Bill

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The wool bill, together with the increase in wool import tax, has been passed by the House of Representatives today. Government leaders had previously warned that approving the increase in wool import tax or restricting the quantity of foreign wool imports would hinder the success of the Geneva Trade Conference and hinder the smooth implementation of U.S. diplomatic and economic policies. The case may be submitted to the President this afternoon for signature or veto.

### U.S. Vows to Help Free Countries Resist Aggression by Totalitarian Countries

[This newspaper] San Francisco 17th broadcast: President Truman delivered a speech at Princeton University today, saying: "The United States will definitely help free countries resist aggression by totalitarian countries and will implement universal military training. It has been a full month since the end of this great war and is in urgent need of recovery and reconstruction. Our current task is to establish an orderly world in the midst of chaos. This task is arduous and cannot be accomplished by the United States or any one country alone. Peace-loving countries must work together to achieve success. But unless there is strength as a backing, a stable world cannot be realized, and the people of all countries will not be able to decide their own destiny according to their free will. The United States' spiritual leadership must have strength as its backing. If the United States shows weakness, small countries will think that we have given up our responsibility to lead the world, and they will mistakenly believe that we have no intention of fulfilling our promises to help free and independent countries maintain their freedom. Under this unstable situation, these small countries will inevitably be unable to resist the intrusion of totalitarian pressure, and we must not disappoint friendly countries." Regarding the implementation of universal military training, the U.S. President said: "Our purpose in training young people is not to win the next war, but to avoid war."

### Wallace Advocates Convening a Meeting of Two Giants, Du and Shi, The Movement to Form a New Party is in the Brewing

[Slightly Leaking News Agency, Washington, 16th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace gave his most surprising speech here at the "Watergate" Grand Theater today after his European tour, asking President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to invite Marshal Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov to a meeting in Berlin to solve the German and Austrian problems. Wallace also urged the United States to propose to the United Nations an international arms control program to break the deadlock in atomic energy control negotiations. He also advocated that the Democratic Party lead the movement to nationalize the U.S. arms industry so that no one can profit from it when fulfilling the patriotic responsibility of defending the country.

Wallace also threatened to form a third party in the 1948 presidential election, declaring that "if the two major parties continue to pursue suicidal policies towards war and collapse, a third party will be formed, regardless of whether this third party has hope of success in the 1948 presidential election." Hua said: "If the United States wants to avoid economic depression, it really needs a socialist Europe and the Soviet Union market. If Truman and Marshall can frankly discuss each other's economic needs with Stalin and Molotov, an agreement can be reached. If we can remember that socialism has no criminal component, we can trade with a socialist Europe in peace."

### Wallace is Preparing to Participate in the Next Presidential Election

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace advocated that the two giants, Truman and Stalin, meet in Berlin to resolve U.S.-Soviet disputes and is now waiting for an official response, while the movement to elect Wallace as president has gradually taken shape today. This movement was initiated in California, and Hua said that he knew nothing about it. According to former California Attorney General Kenny in Los Angeles, the movement to elect Wallace will be held at a meeting in Falaise, California, on July 19. Hua will not attend, but will send a telegram to the meeting.

### U.S. Aid to Other Countries Should Be Within Its Means

Ex-U.S. President Herbert Hoover's Opinion

[Washington, D.C., U.S. Information Service, 16th] Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover recently wrote to Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, stating that the U.S. should continue to aid the people of other countries, but at the same time, it must take steps to avoid its own economy from rapidly disintegrating due to the heavy burden of aiding other countries. Hoover also said that the U.S. should "strongly urge" some countries to jointly find ways to alleviate this burden.

### U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike Shows Expanding Trend

Railway Freight Transportation Also at Risk of Stoppage

[New York, United Press, 16th] The strike of seamen on U.S. foreign ships has today affected all seaports nationwide, and railway freight transportation is also at risk of stoppage within 48 hours. There seems to be no hope of resolving the strike. A union spokesman said that the strike would halt 2,000 ships, and if negotiations completely fail, oil tankers will also be drawn into the vortex. Undersecretary of Labor Gibson has been ordered to arrive here to mediate with shipowners.

[Washington, United Press, 16th] The Department of Labor has sent a special representative, Mr. Schanrenbach, to San Francisco to participate in the West Coast shipping mediation talks.

### Hungarian Liberal Party Rally Disrupted by Communists, Conflict Erupts, Five Liberal Party Members Injured with Clubs and Forks as Weapons

[Szeged, Hungary, United Press, 10th] Approximately 150 communists, armed with hard objects stuffed into rubber hoses as clubs, steel rings on their fingers, or axe-shaped Hungarian tools, disrupted a Liberal Party rally here today. The purpose of the rally was to prove whether Hungary still has freedom of speech and assembly. Approximately 700 Hungarian men and women participated, resisting the communists with their bare hands. A bloody battle ensued, and one communist was pushed out of a third-story window. The number of injured is unknown. According to official reports, five Liberal Party members suffered severe head injuries from being stabbed with large forks and were sent to the hospital for treatment. The organizer of the rally, Liberal Party leader Mr. Suriok, originally announced as the main speaker, did not attend at the last minute. The Liberal Party rally was held on the third floor of a dance hall here. Thirty police officers were present to monitor the event. After the meeting, several full-scale conflicts occurred. The police used gun butts to strike the faces of those involved in the conflicts. A large number of police arrived and dispersed a crowd of approximately 1,000 people in the square outside the dance hall. Earlier, the communists pushed aside the gatekeepers and stormed into the meeting hall. Several British and American reporters were present. The first conflict occurred when the chairman introduced Member of Parliament Mr. Vencinaghi, who is unrelated to former Prime Minister Nagy but is just as vehemently anti-communist as Mr. Suriok. Nagy was interrupted by communists cheering and shouting "Long live Stalin." The Liberal Party countered by cheering "Long live Suriok." They then noticed the American reporters in the guest seating and cheered "Long live America."

### Car Driver Detained, Plum Yoong-Tjo's Official Duties Obstructed

[Tokyo, Central News Agency, 17th] Plum Yoong-Tjo, the Chinese judge of the International Military Tribunal, was late to the war crimes trial this morning by about an hour because his driver was detained by military police. Mr. Plum intended to sit in the car designated for his use as usual this morning, but later learned that his driver had been "detained." Mr. Plum managed to find transportation within an hour, but was still an hour late. Mr. Plum immediately informed Chief Justice Weber of the reason for his lateness. Mr. Weber was very angry and ordered the trial to proceed, declaring that the matter was almost contempt of court and did not consider the delay of almost an hour for Judge Plum to be accidental. The military police did not announce the reason for the detention of Mr. Plum's driver this morning.

### Indonesian Situation Gradually Becomes Clear, Sjahrir Goes to Batavia

Rumored to Meet with British Authorities

[Batavia, United Press, 17th] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir will travel from Linggajati to Batavia tomorrow at the invitation of a certain foreign country. He has been staying there ever since the Indonesian cabinet meeting concluded and drafted the May 27 memorandum in response to the Netherlands. It is widely believed that Britain is the country inviting him here. It is expected that Sjahrir will meet with British authorities in Batavia, and Britain may ask Sjahrir to cooperate in order to change the attitude of the Indonesian government.

[London, Reuters, 16th] A Foreign Office spokesman said: British Consul-General to Batavia, Mr. Mitcheson, recently traveled to Yogyakarta in central Java, the capital of the Indonesian Republic, to obtain information on the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations. After completing his mission, he has returned to Batavia and submitted a report to the British government. Mr. Mitcheson may have contacted Sjahrir, but reports that Mr. Mitcheson suggested British mediation have been denied by authorities in London.

### France Proposes Definite Number to Participate in International Police Force

[Lake Success, United Press, 17th] France has notified the United Nations organization that it can only provide one infantry division to participate in the international police force at present. Among the five major powers, France is the first to propose a specific number for the international police force. The Soviet Union insists that all countries should provide equal manpower, aircraft, and warships to maintain a smaller international police force. China, Britain, and the United States agree that the international police force should be organized according to their respective strengths, with the British and American navies and air forces and the Soviet army making more contributions.

### Japanese Newspaper's Sinister Motives, Advocates Recalling Ryukyu Islands, Rumors that MacArthur Indeed Intends to "Adjust" the Status of Ryukyu

[Tokyo, Agence France-Presse, 17th] Today's Asahi Shimbun correspondence column published a letter from a resident of Okinawa Island, supporting Foreign Minister Ashida's proposal on the 5th of this month to determine the status of the Ryukyu Islands, especially Okinawa Island. The letter strongly argues that Japan needs to express goodwill to the residents of Okinawa Island, especially to the Okinawans currently residing in Japan. The letter points out that 80% of the Japanese repatriated from various parts of the South Pacific are from Okinawa Prefecture. If the Japanese authorities want to acquire the islands, why not help the suffering people of Okinawa, assist in the island's reconstruction, and aid the millions of impoverished people? Observers attach importance to this letter. Well-informed sources agree with Ashida's view but consider it untimely and likely to hinder MacArthur's plan. MacArthur intends to adjust the status of the Ryukyu Islands after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, at which time a referendum will likely be held.

### Soviet Newspaper Severely Criticizes Ashida's Shamelessness

[Moscow, Agence France-Presse, 16th] Regarding Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida's denial that he recently demanded that part of the Kuril Islands be returned to Japan, Soviet commentator Leontiev published an article in today's Pravda, calling it a shameless roar. The article stated: Ashida clearly made this request in a speech on the 5th of this month, and now he pretends that Japan did not participate in the Yalta Conference, causing Japan to feel uneasy about the final decision on the fate of the Kuril Islands. It must be known that the Yalta Agreement was signed by the Allied countries that defeated Japan and imposed unconditional surrender on that country. There is absolutely no room for Japan to participate. However, it is futile to explain such basic things to Ashida. It would be more helpful to find out who allowed Ashida to forget the fact that Japan surrendered unconditionally.

### Burmese Constituent Assembly Passes Resolution on Political System

[Reported by this newspaper] London, Broadcast on the 17th: The Burmese Constituent Assembly passed a resolution today declaring that the future political system of Burma will be an independent democratic republic, called the "Union of Burma."

### Execution of Wolves and Tigers Causes Citywide Stir, Tens of Thousands Line Streets to See Two Demons, Each Leaves a Last Testament to Console Mother and Instruct Children, Shimoda's Attitude Haughty, Yonekura's Words Cunning, Even in Death They Still Extol "Sino-Japanese Friendship"

[Reported by this newspaper] Yonekura Kiki, the "Wolf of Party Heat," and Shimoda Jiro, the "Tiger of Jiangyin," two Japanese war criminals who committed heinous crimes, were executed by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense at the Jiangwan execution ground at 5:05 p.m. yesterday. The two criminals remained unchanged in appearance and calm in attitude until their deaths. Before the execution, they were paraded through the city in prisoner vehicles. Along the way, tens of thousands of people lined the streets to watch, and traffic was interrupted. The citizens saw these two murderous evils walking the path to blood debt, and all clapped and cheered. The public sentiment is recorded below: At 12:30 p.m. yesterday, Military Tribunal Prosecutor Fu Shude, Prosecutor Kuang Jun, Translator Luo Jie, Chief Clerk Li Yechu, Clerk Yuan, Clerk Wang Shushen, and others were ready and departed for the Shanghai Prison with military police. When the vehicles arrived at the gate of the prison, the crowd of tens of thousands stirred, and the walls and utility poles were full of people. When they saw the military vehicles arrive, shouts erupted. The prosecutors entered the prison and set up a temporary court in the patio at the entrance of the women's prison, ordering that Shimoda and Yonekura be brought in. After hearing the news in their cells, the two criminals requested to bathe, shave, and straighten their military uniforms, which took more than an hour. At 2:00 p.m., Shimoda Jiro was brought in first. Shimoda's attitude was haughty, but there was a slight look of sorrow.

### Nodding and Smiling Bitterly, Sitting Upright to Write Last Testament

Prosecutor Fu informed him that he would be executed today. The criminal nodded. He was then asked if he had any last words. Shimoda immediately asked for a pen and paper. He sat upright at the prepared desk and chairs and began to write directly. The pen was a fountain pen belonging to Translator Luo Jie, and the paper was the official paper of the Military Tribunal. When Shimoda wrote to the second sheet, the ink ran out, so he asked for another pen to continue writing. It took him twenty-five minutes to finish writing two letters, one to Lieutenant General Jukawa, commander of the Japanese military police, and one to his mother (details below). The prosecutor asked again if he had anything else to say. Shimoda said: "This case really has nothing to do with me. It will be clear in the future." When asked if he wanted to take a numbing injection, Shimoda arrogantly said, "No need." He was immediately bound. At that time, the criminal's body trembled slightly, as if he wanted to cry, but he forced a bitter smile and said: "Please tell the military police not to tie me too tightly. I won't run away." At 2:35 p.m., Shimoda was first escorted onto the prisoner vehicle. Yonekura Kiki was brought in next. Yonekura entered with a bitter smile and nodded to both sides. Prosecutor Fu also informed him that he would be executed today and asked if he had any last words. Yonekura also asked for paper and a pen to write. When he wrote to the second page, he stopped writing in the middle and asked for another piece of paper to rewrite. It took him thirty minutes to finish writing three letters, one to Lieutenant General Jukawa, one to his son, and one to An Weinan, the former county magistrate of Changshu who is now a speaker (details below).

Shimoda Jiro (right) and Yonekura Kiki (left) were paraded through the streets and escorted to the Jiangwan execution ground.

### A Few Questions and Answers, Escorted onto the Prisoner Vehicle

After writing, the prosecutor asked again if he had anything else to say. Yonekura said: "The residents of Changshu and Taicang hope to take me to Changshu for execution. It is not good to execute me in Shanghai today." After thinking for a moment, he said: "I really have nothing to do with this case. A detailed investigation will reveal the truth." Yonekura also refused to take a numbing injection. Before being bound, he said: "If there are any family members of the Chinese who died tragically here today, please say hello for me." Prosecutor Fu finally asked if he knew where the remains of many of the victims were, since they were unknown. Yonekura said: "It is best to investigate this in Japan. I don't know." He was immediately escorted onto the prisoner vehicle.

### Crowds Surge at Execution Ground

At 3:15, the prisoner vehicles, led by motorcycle police vehicles and guarded by machine gun vehicles and military police vehicles at the rear, drove out of the prison. The crowd outside the gate roared like thunder, and the shouts shook the sky. The procession passed Dongdaming Road, crossed Baidu Bridge, passed East Zhongshan Road, East Nanjing Road, West Nanjing Road, and turned into North Zhongzheng First Road, Central Linsen Road, South Xizang Road, and the Great World, then turned into East Zhongzheng Road, Central Sichuan Road, North Sichuan Road, and went straight to the Jiangwan execution ground. The road was packed with people who wanted to see the real faces of this tiger and wolf. The crowds surrounding the execution ground surged even more.

### Death with One Shot Each

Arriving at the execution ground at 4:45, the military police did their best to maintain order and cordon off an open space. At 5:00 p.m., the two criminals were escorted off the prisoner vehicles and walked to the open space. Yonekura initially refused to kneel, but was forcibly pushed down. At this time, the signal sounded, and two shots were heard. The wooden-barreled guns of the execution military police Liao Jiaqing and Jiang Wujun had pierced the heads of the two criminals. Fresh blood spurted out, and the tiger and the wolf died together. Applause erupted from all around, and the people were very happy. The two prosecutors immediately stepped forward to examine the bodies. Shimoda's bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the left side of the head. Yonekura's bullet entered from the back right of the head and exited from the lower jaw on the left. The two corpses were then covered with white cloth, waiting to be claimed by the local Japanese residents.

### Last Testaments:

Shimoda

Last Testament, one addressed to Lieutenant General Jukawa and others, the general meaning in Japanese is: "I have been thinking day and night about someone saving me, but now that I have reached this point, I am not afraid at all. I die for the country, but I am infinitely moved when I think of my old mother. This is also fate. Please convey my regards to those I have troubled before. When I was in office, I did not involve myself in love, fame, glory, money, which I feel quite comforted by. Today the country has failed, and the innocent are also being executed, but this is the cornerstone of the country's revival. 橘 poem says: For the sake of 毕上, we sacrifice, forward, straight forward! I did not obtain my military status in various environments. Finally, I thank the Holy Spirit." Another letter to his mother said: "When you hear the news of my execution, you must be shocked and saddened, but as the mother of a soldier, please don't be sad. I also planned to write a few words to my older brother and other family members, but due to various things in prison, I was unable to write them. However, the name of my Jiro will forever be the pillar of the Shimoda family, and it will never open up, and it will surely make the family prosper. Please greet the gentlemen of Kugumiyaoka and Ishihara and other relatives. This letter was written one quarter of an hour before going to the execution ground. Please forgive me for not being able to be filial to my old mother. Please don't forget the vow at the Itsukushima Shrine."

Yonekura

One of the last testaments says: "To Lieutenant General Jukawa, Lieutenant General Ban, Major General Shihou, and everyone in Jiangwan: The scheduled execution date has arrived. I am deeply grateful for all the kindness you have shown me during my life. This result is whether my subordinates (Yonekura calls himself) are loyal enough. Here, I wish you a long life. If I have not been loyal, please take care of me when you have the opportunity. Today, my death can maintain my loyalty. Please forgive me for not doing my best." The second letter to his son, Yonekura Katsusuke, says: "The time to say goodbye to you forever has come. My life will be clear to others. Don't be sad. Everyone has unfortunate encounters. You must overcome them to succeed. I am dying now. I believe that you, your mother, and your children will be able to follow what I often say. Loyalty and filial piety are the duties of subjects. You should never forget them in your dreams. There are many noble people among the Chinese. I got along well with these people in my life. There should be no prejudice between ethnic groups. This incident can create the opening of East Asian nations in the future. Say hello to Ishikawa Yoshiaki and other former team members."

### Unwelcome Kindness

The third last testament addressed to the current Changshu Magistrate An Weinan said: "I am convinced that your family's sense of justice is the foundation for future Sino-Japanese friendship. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Changshu is my second hometown. After I die, my soul will surely come to Changshu to protect the people of Changshu. Please convey my regards to the fathers and representatives of the entire county," and so on. His unchanging foolish loyalty and filial piety overflowed between the lines. Citizens watching at the scene said: "Considering the countless compatriots of mine who were brutally killed by this criminal's hands during the Lunar New Year, it is too cheap for the two criminals to die with one shot today."

### Gunshots in the New China Dance Hall, Self-Inflicted Wound Due to Drunkenness

Comforting Teams

Divided into material and spiritual types.

### Female Painter Suspected of Being a Traitor, Li Qingping Declared Not Guilty, Still Detained on the Same Day Awaiting Release After Confirmation

[Reported by this newspaper] The Hankou City Police Bureau believed that female painter Li Qingping had colluded with the enemy's naval reporting minister Matsuo and Shioda during the enemy puppet period, providing important information. It sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, which arrested Li at the New Life Club's exhibition last October and transferred her to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. She was prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. After eight months, the High Court finally concluded the case. The case was pronounced in the High Court yesterday morning. After Chief Judge Xiao, Associate Judge Qiu Ding, and Prosecutor Ye Yushao took their seats, they asked the court supervisor to bring Li to the court. Chief Judge Xiao stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Li Qingping is not guilty." The court informed her that she would still be detained today. If the prosecutor did not apply for a retrial, she would be released immediately after confirmation. Li only said yes. Li was wearing a light green women's western suit, jade silk stockings, and cream-colored leather shoes. She had two short braids and looked better than at the previous trial. When she was taken back into custody, she frequently covered her mouth with a handkerchief, seemingly unable to hide the joy in her heart.

### Four Pilot Post Offices, Beautiful Style, Regular Service

[Reported by this newspaper] In view of the large population and vast area of this city, the General Post Office believes that the existing branches cannot meet the needs of citizens, but it is difficult to realize the addition of branches due to difficulties in funding and housing. In order to divert the congestion of branches, facilitate citizens, and expand business, it has been decided to set up 15 post offices in the city. After consulting the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and soliciting opinions, four locations have been temporarily designated for pilot implementation: (1) Bund of Nanjing Road; (2) New World of Racecourse; (3) In front of the Huangjin Grand Theater in Eight Immortals Bridge; (4) In front of the Zhaofeng Public Country Gate. The post office is still a novelty in this city. According to its design, the top of the post office has a streamlined shape, 7 feet 6 inches high and 5 feet 4 inches deep, and is square, accommodating two postal workers. The whole body is dyed white and inlaid with light line stripes, which is very beautiful. The whole is made of wood and is equipped with sun protection equipment. If there are no unexpected obstacles, the four post offices are scheduled to start operating on the 25th of this month. Except for remittances and parcels, other businesses in this post office are the same as in the post office branches.

### Continued Hearing of the Tragedy of the Fu Po Battleship: Witness Testimony, Details of the Accident

[Our Newspaper's Report] The trial of the Fu Po battleship tragedy continued in the local court yesterday morning. More than forty family members of the officers and soldiers who died in the disaster sat in the public gallery of the Second Criminal Court early in the morning, waiting for the court to open. The order was quite good. After Judge Zhong Xianda took the bench, he summoned five passengers from the Hai Min transport ship to testify. However, only Li Xiuming appeared in court yesterday. According to Li's testimony: a Guangdong native residing at No. 1, Lane 61, Xudu South Road, engaged in import and export business. On March 19th, he took the Hai Min transport from Shantou to Shanghai. At around 12:10 a.m., he felt the ship shake violently. He went to the upper deck to observe and could no longer see the Fu Po battleship at this time. However, in the darkness, he heard a chaotic clamor on the sea, with cries of "Help!" The Hai Min ship continued to sail forward. Later, passengers questioned Captain Dai, asking why he didn't help, so he turned back to the original location to salvage. However, from the collision to the rescue, about four and a half hours had passed, so only Jiao Dexiao was rescued. After the witness finished his testimony, the defendant's lawyer requested the court to summon Senator Ye Daoyuan as a witness. The court ordered a postponement of the trial, and said that the debate trial will be opened next month to conclude the case.

### Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents, Dragon Boat Festival Gift Money, Municipal Government Also Holds Reception, Inviting Dependents to Dine and Watch a Play

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government has decided to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers on active duty by issuing preferential grain once during the Dragon Boat Festival. The methods are as follows: (1) The preferential grain is based on the standard of two shi of yellow grain per year for each impoverished military dependent and each self-sufficient military dependent household, as stipulated. It is proposed to issue an average of one shi per person, and an average of three people per household, and instead issue cash, calculated at half the current limited price of rice, 168,000 yuan per shi, for a total of 252,000 yuan for three shi. (2) Those who receive the cash for preferential grain must hold a preferential certificate from the Municipal Government, and are limited to the spouse and direct relatives and minor siblings of the soldier on active duty. The order of priority for receiving the cash for preferential grain is: spouse if there is a spouse, children if there is no spouse, parents if there are no children, grandparents if there are no parents, and minor siblings if there are no grandparents. (3) The issuance of preferential grain will be carried out by the Municipal Government printing two copies of a receipt, which will first be handed over to the district office for distribution to the families of soldiers on active duty to sign and seal, and the district Baojia chief will affix his seal as proof. It must be brought along with the preferential certificate when claiming the grain during the Dragon Boat Festival.

The Municipal Government will also hold a reception at 9:00 a.m. on the Dragon Boat Festival, inviting all military dependents, having a luncheon at noon, and issuing preferential grain cash at the same time. In the afternoon, movie theater tickets will be issued to invite them to watch a play.

### Bodies from the Da Feng Ship Disaster, Continued Handling of Funeral Arrangements, One Body of a Jiaotong University Student Retrieved by Family for Burial, Body of Unknown Major Adjutant Awaits Claim

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the bodies of the Da Feng ship disaster passengers were successively discovered in the river waters of Baoshan and Taicang counties, the Da Feng Shipping Bureau immediately notified the families of the deceased to come and identify them, while Pushan Villa handled the collection, encoffining, and burial matters. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Pushan Villa continued to dispatch three cars, carrying coffins, workers, and the families of the deceased, to Taicang and Binshan counties to continue identifying, collecting, and burying the bodies together with the Da Feng Shipping Bureau.

Identification Difficult Due to Prolonged Decomposition

One car heading to Baoshan returned to Shanghai at around 4:00 p.m., bringing back five bodies. Among them, the name of one of the deceased was Ju Yinsheng, and he has been identified and claimed by his family. The remaining four are of unknown names. However, one of them was a soldier, identified by his shoulder insignia as a major adjutant. These four are temporarily housed in the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau. There are still twelve bodies on the beach of Shizi Ridge in Wusongkou Taiwan. More than thirty others were salvaged by local villagers and buried shallowly on the spot. Guanshan Villa is scheduled to send workers again today to exhume these bodies for family members to identify. However, the bodies have been floating in the water for many days, and most of them have already decomposed, making identification particularly difficult. One of them, before burial, had already been identified as Sun Qi, a 20-year-old Jiaotong University student. His family then personally encoffined him.

On-site Burial in Taicang

On the Taicang side, the bodies were discovered in the fields of Yanglinkou and Qiyakou. The nearby villagers salvaged more than forty bodies. Because the bodies were rotten and smelly, more than half had already been buried by the local Bao chiefs and others. The Taicang County Local Court has also sent prosecutors to inspect. Yesterday, only four bodies were recorded. Because the riverside areas such as Yemaoyan are far from Taicang City, the car burial team of Pushan Villa still stayed there, waiting for the families to finish identifying the bodies. The remaining unclaimed bodies will be buried on the spot and will no longer be transported to Shanghai.

### Silk Weaving Industry Index Dispute, Will Be Transferred to the Assessment Committee for Handling

The Social Affairs Bureau now intends to transfer the case to the Labor-Management Assessment Committee for handling.

### Lead Printing Industry Association Holds Emergency Meeting

The Shanghai Municipal Lead Printing Industry Association held an emergency temporary members' meeting yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, chaired by Zhu Wenxian. Resolutions: (1) Cancel the 13.5 yuan living allowance for workers' families. The reason is that the cost of living index has been unfrozen, the current environment has changed, and only a few colleagues actually implement this allowance. Some issue 8 yuan or 5 yuan, so it should be uniformly canceled to show fairness. (2) Continue to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to designate one union for the industry's occupational and industrial unions to avoid ambiguity. (3) Demand the restoration of the end-of-year salary for 1936. (4) Wages should be issued according to the index of the previous month. The meeting also discussed the occurrence of strikes among various members. It was unanimously resolved that each member who has gone on strike should report to the meeting for handling. Workers on strike will not be provided with meals or wages, which was unanimously passed.

### North-South Goods Industry Labor-Management Dispute, Temporarily Concluded After Mediation

The following methods were initially formulated: (1) Both labor and management will petition the Municipal Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for arbitration on the May cost of living index. (2) Before the labor and management have resolved the issue, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided that the May salary and allowance will be calculated based on the index of 16400 times from now on, and three-quarters of the salary and allowance will be issued first. (3) Labor and management will organize a price assessment council to adjust and unify commodity prices, to be established on July 1st. In the above situation, the employers have agreed to notify all member stores to implement it first, and during this dispute period, workers must not be dismissed to avoid further disputes.

The case was interrogated by Prosecutor Fang Zheng at the local procuratorate yesterday. Senator Xie Qingbai, a related person, was summoned for questioning. According to Xie, "Zhou Yinchun, the husband of Cheng Xiaoshi, had a dispute with District Chief Bao over the construction of a house. Senator Zhou Chengxiang and I were both entrusted to mediate. It was entirely out of a desire to resolve the problem. It is true that we invited District Chief Bao to dinner, but the rumors of extorting 10 million yuan are definitely not true." The court hearing ended here, and the case was postponed for further investigation.

### Necessary Goods Factories Have Insufficient Working Capital, Social Affairs Bureau Willing to Assist in Contacting for Loans

[Our Newspaper's Report] A reporter interviewed Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday. After the cost of living index was unfrozen, many factories were unable to bear it. The reporter asked whether the Social Affairs Bureau intends to petition the government for loans to provide relief. Director Wu replied: "Considering the many abuses of industrial loans in the past, we are unwilling to take this action again. However, if factories that produce essential goods have insufficient working capital or are truly unable to maintain operations, they can contact the Social Affairs Bureau, which is very willing to assist in contacting the Four Joint Offices to provide loans. The Social Affairs Bureau knows the internal operations and production status of various factories in detail, and it is also convenient to supervise the use of loans after they are issued." Many factories have already contacted about this matter. However, various factories also need to reform their personnel system and management in many ways. Otherwise, it will be like a bottomless pit, and loans will be futile and still unable to save their crisis.

### Federation of Labor Unions Sends Representatives to Meet with Director Wu, Opposing the Restoration of the End-of-Year Salary for 1936

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the cost of living index was unfrozen and the May cost of living index for workers was released, the industry and commerce sectors in the city have felt unable to bear it. After several discussions, it was decided to request the government to restore wages to the end-of-1936 levels and other points, and Luo Qinghua was sent to Beijing to petition the relevant departments for remedies. The Municipal Federation of Labor Unions was shocked by the news and also intends to send representatives to Beijing to petition. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, five representatives, Shui Xiangyun, Liang Yongzhang, Ye Bang, Fang Rusheng, and Gui Fusheng, visited Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and expressed their opposition to the points raised by the Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, demanding that the status quo be maintained. Director Wu received them and replied as follows: (1) Regarding the employers' request to restore the end-of-1936 salary, I have never agreed to it or promised to consider it. This is a contractual issue between labor and management, and the administrative authorities cannot interfere. If the employers want to abandon the self-made contract, they can file a lawsuit in court. If the employers say that they were coerced into signing the contract by the labor party, then since they did not declare it invalid afterward, the government considers it to be legal. (2) I am willing to consider the employers' request to issue the current month's wages according to the previous month's index separately. If they are losing money and cannot afford it, it can be considered, but this does not refer to one industry, but to each factory individually. There is another situation, such as orders for the machinery industry and the shipbuilding industry cannot be delivered immediately, and it is quite difficult to estimate the cost. It can also be considered, and the details will be discussed at the Labor-Management Evaluation Meeting on the 19th. (3) The employers' request to dismiss workers and issue wages in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law can be considered because there is a legal basis and they have the right to make this request. Director Wu also advised the Federation of Labor Unions not to go to Beijing to petition. If necessary, he will go to Beijing to ask the central government for instructions.

### Seaside Bathing Beach Not Yet Repaired, Strictly Forbidden to Go Swimming

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Gaoqiao seaside bathing beach was the only summer resort before the war. Now that the weather is getting warmer, there are rumors that the municipal authorities are planning to repair it. A responsible person from the Municipal Public Works Bureau denied this yesterday. According to him, the old site of the seaside bathing beach has been unmanaged during the war, resulting in its desolation to this day. It has been almost completely washed away by the tide. At present, a deep gully has formed between the inner beach and the outer beach at the new site. In June last year, seven people entered the sea for swimming, and five of them drowned. Currently, due to the city's financial difficulties and the considerable cost of repairs, the Public Works Bureau has not yet received orders for repairs. It is hoped that before the bathing beach is repaired, people will be strictly forbidden to go swimming to avoid danger.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

(1) Dissolution of Marriage Contract

Mr. Chen Jianshan asks: I am 25 years old. Last autumn, my parents arranged an engagement with a Ms. Zhang. At that time, I did not give my consent. Now I know that the other party is poorly educated and has a bad temper. I intend to dissolve the marriage contract, but I am not familiar with the legal procedures. Please give detailed instructions.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, a marriage contract shall be entered into by the man and woman themselves. Since this marriage contract was not entered into by yourself, it is invalid and you are not bound by it.

(2) Marriage Contract Dispute

Chen Zhengwu asks: My relative, A, is female. At the age of sixteen, her mother arranged for her to be betrothed to a man, B, through a matchmaker. At that time, A did not give her consent. Now A has another interest, C, and wants to dissolve the original marriage contract. Now there are several legal questions, please provide answers. (1) Was the marriage contract entered into by A's mother on her behalf when A was a minor valid? (2) Can A publish a statement in the newspaper denying the marriage contract as invalid because she is under the legal age? (3) How should we deal with B if he uses illegal coercion? (4) How should we deal with B if he does not agree to dissolve the contract? (5) Does the person who proposes to dissolve the contract have to compensate the other party for losses? (6) How should the bride price be returned? (7) If B finds out about the relationship between A and C, can he file a lawsuit? (8) Before A and B dissolve the marriage contract, can C enter into a marriage contract with A? (9) Before A and C enter into a marriage contract, can C assist in dissolving the contract?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] (1) According to the provisions of Article 972 of the Civil Code, this marriage contract is invalid. (2) This marriage contract is naturally invalid and there is no need to publish a statement in the newspaper. (3) Should be dealt with according to law. (4) Since it is invalid, B has no right to interfere. (5) Since the marriage contract is fundamentally invalid, there is no need to go through the dissolution procedure. (6) Return the original amount. (7) It is not illegal. (8) Since the marriage contract is invalid, it is the same as not being engaged. C can naturally enter into a marriage contract with A. (9) There is no need to assist in dissolving the contract.

### Difficulties with Tongji University's Resumption of Classes: Dean of Academic Affairs and Others Resign Jointly to Apologize to the School; President Dong Xifan Traveled to Beijing Last Night to Seek Instructions

[Central News Agency Dispatch] Since the outbreak of the student movement at Tongji University, most departments and faculties have gone on strike. President Dong Xifan, in order to prevent students from wasting their valuable time and studies, repeatedly urged them to resume classes, but to no avail. Dong himself felt ashamed and regretful for his ineffective supervision of education and misleading students, and also stated that his physical strength was insufficient to cope with the heavy workload. He submitted his resignation to the ministry three times in succession, but although the ministry earnestly tried to retain him, his determination to resign remained firm. The heads of various administrative departments of the school jointly submitted their resignations the day before yesterday due to the students' lack of sincerity in resuming classes. After Mr. Dong's attempts to retain them proved unsuccessful, he traveled to Beijing that night to seek instructions from the Ministry of Education. Currently, the school's administration is in a state of standstill. The following is an excerpt of the school's announcement and the resignation letters of the administrative heads:

Announcement

"Since this school has been affected by the student movement, only the Freshman Academy and the senior classes of various faculties, as well as the affiliated Senior Nursing School, the affiliated Vocational Department of Acoustics Inspection, and the affiliated Mechanical Engineering Specialization Course, have either continued classes without interruption or have already resumed classes out of concern for their studies. The other classes have been on strike for more than three weeks, arbitrarily sacrificing valuable time, which is extremely regrettable! This school cannot bear for the students' studies to suffer losses for so long, and in order to restore the school to its normal state as soon as possible, we convened a meeting of student representatives to give instructions. The students were able to understand and accept the school's painstaking efforts to persuade them, and expressed that they would resume classes immediately. However, after the meeting, there was a resolution to attend classes on a trial basis, which shows their lack of enthusiasm for their studies. Subsequently, the student union denied the resolution and submitted a request to postpone classes pending a re-vote. Such contradictory words and actions are disheartening to the teachers. The heads of the administrative departments of the school have expressed extreme disappointment with this frivolous behavior, and in accordance with their statement made to the students on that day, have jointly submitted their resignations. After earnest attempts to retain them proved unsuccessful, the school's administration was immediately plunged into a state of standstill. A school with forty years of honor is now on the verge of collapse, for which the students cannot shirk their responsibility. In addition to my traveling to Beijing overnight to personally seek instructions from the Ministry of Education, I am hereby publishing the joint resignation of the heads as follows. I urge the students to quickly realize their mistake, resume classes uniformly and immediately, so that the school situation can gradually return to peace and restore the proper course of education, and not fail to live up to the deep expectations of all the teachers and staff. This announcement is of utmost importance. President Dong Xifan, June 17th."

Resignation Letters

"To President Dong Xifan: The students of this school have been on strike for over a month. We have recently heard that they will cease the strike starting tomorrow, but they do not call it a resumption of classes, but rather a 'suspension,' which clearly shows that the students have no intention of resuming their studies. After the students went on strike, you twice issued notices ordering them to resume classes immediately, and we colleagues have also repeatedly advised them to focus on their studies, but our earnest words were ignored. How can we not sigh deeply! We colleagues are holding positions without fulfilling our responsibilities, and have failed the school. We hereby resign from our administrative positions to apologize to the school. We hope for your understanding. We respectfully wish you good health. Dean of Academic Affairs Xie Cangli, Dean of Student Affairs Ye Xuean, Dean of General Affairs Zhou Guanjun, Dean of the College of Engineering Jiang Hong, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Gu Baochang, concurrently Principal of the Affiliated Middle School Jiang Hong, concurrently Principal of the Affiliated Vocational School Hu Zhaoying."

### Seven Major Cities in the World Compete for the Next World Games; The International Olympic Committee Opens

[United Press, Stockholm, Kurts, 6th] The International Olympic Committee opened here today, with a one-week session and an agenda of 27 items. One of the items is the issue of canceling the traditional Olympic salute, because it is similar to the fascist salute. According to the Secretary-General of the Committee, Swiss representative Ma Yi, Belgium advocates canceling the original salute, and Switzerland proposes replacing it with a new salute with the head turned to the right and both hands on both sides. Another item on the agenda is to choose the location for the 1952 Games. Ma Yi said that at least seven cities have applied to be the host. Representative delegations from the Finnish capital, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Detroit in the United States have been busy contacting each other before the committee meeting in order to obtain sponsorship. Committee members have lifelong tenure, so Germany and Japan are still among the 43 participating countries. Ma Yi said that the two countries were not invited and will continue to be ignored until their Olympic committees are fully restored.

[Reuters, Stockholm, 16th] The number of American cities competing to hold the 1952 Olympic World Games has increased to five. Philadelphia has also applied to hold the Games that year. Previously, there were Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit, and Los Angeles. Lake Placid in the United States and Da Peicha in Italy have requested to host the 1952 Winter Olympics. Sir Burgley, President of the British Olympic Association, is here to attend the International Olympic Committee and denies rumors that London's preparations for next year's World Games are inadequate. Bren Tai, Chairman of the US Olympic Committee, also confirmed that London's preparations are proceeding on schedule and expressed satisfaction.

[Reuters, Stockholm, 16th] The International Olympic Committee will meet in the Knights' Hall (formerly the Swedish Upper House) here on Wednesday, with 70 representatives from 23 countries participating. The selection of the location for the 1952 World Games is expected to be a fierce competition at the conference. Representatives from Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Detroit, and other cities in the United States have brought films and other promotional materials for the election. The 1932 World Games were held in Los Angeles, and the 1928 World Games were held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The 1940 World Games were originally scheduled to be held in Helsinki, Finland, but were not held due to the outbreak of the war. However, the sports fields have already been built, so Helsinki has a better chance of being elected. The British representative has expressed his willingness to support Finland, believing that Finland has produced a lot of sports talent, and the Olympic movement should not only be based on money, but should also give small countries an equal opportunity. However, other representatives feel that Finland's political situation is unstable, so they are skeptical about whether Finland will succeed. Stockholm also intends to compete for the election, but does not want to compete with Helsinki, so it does not intend to take any action until it knows whether Helsinki has applied.

[Associated Press, Stockholm, 15th] On the eve of the meeting of the International Sports Federation Committee, delegations from various countries have gathered here. According to Nordic observers, American delegations are vying fiercely for the location of the 1952 Games, but Helsinki may be designated as the location of the Games. Bernard, the chief British representative, said: "Today's sports are too focused on money, and the Berlin Games were completely focused on propaganda. This is mostly the case for the Games held in big countries. Therefore, it is best to hold the Games in small countries. From now on, we should strive to restore the ancient spirit of the Games."

### Second Division Table Tennis League: Jing Wu Sweeps to Victory; Tonight Siming Green Team Competes for Fourth Division Runner-Up

The third Shanghai Table Tennis League finals were held the night before last at 8:00 PM in the Central Auditorium between Jing Wu and Hua Lian Hua from the Second Division. Over 500 spectators attended. Chen Linsheng and Shen Bohong served as referees. Hua Lian Hua's morale was dampened due to the absence of their team captain, Li Feixiang, resulting in reduced fighting spirit. Moreover, their lineup was predictable, making victory difficult. However, the second and third matches were extremely tense. Hua Lian Hua veteran Zhou Weixin fought valiantly against Jing Wu's main player, Zhang Fuzhang. Zhang Fuzhang, young and strong, excelled in both smashing and cutting. His skills are now approaching those of a first-class player. Despite facing the threat of the opponent's fast close-range blocking, he ultimately relied on his hard smash to win 3-1. In the third match, Jing Wu's defensive player Chen Zengliang performed poorly and was constantly behind due to the opponent Xu Zhibo's fierce attacks. The two fought fiercely for five games, and Chen managed to secure the final victory thanks to good luck. In the fifth match, Jing Wu's defensive player Shui Hanguo also succeeded. In the sixth match, Hua Lian Hua captain Li Feixiang arrived and defeated Jing Wu captain Han Dexuan 3-0, scoring a point and making amends for his absence. As a result, Jing Wu defeated Hua Lian Hua 6-1, winning the Second Division championship, while Hua Lian Hua finished as runner-up.

### No Personnel Issues for the Textile Adjustment Committee; Establishment Possible This Weekend; Zhang Jia'ao Invited Committee Members to Exchange Views Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Economic Affairs Ministry's Textile Industry Adjustment Committee has been steadily progressing towards its establishment. All personnel issues have been resolved. The official establishment date will be this weekend. Minister Chen of the Economic Affairs Ministry will personally come to Shanghai to preside over the event. The committee's office will be located at 24 Tumingyuan Road in this city.

### Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks; Yong Yarn Awakens Alone

Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw continued rumors about the prospects of delivery, making the overall situation even more chaotic. Despite repeated increases in margin by industry insiders, the upward trend was not widespread. Only Yong Yarn progressed steadily, while other stocks declined. This is due to the authorities' neglect of the stock exchange, creating uncertainty. Outside investors remain hesitant. The phenomenon of Yong Yarn's lone strength is also unsustainable. Before the settlement date, there is a lot of floating stock. Futures brokers raised interest rates to as high as 3.45 and 3.9 fen. Further rapid progress is unlikely. The sudden increase in Yong Yarn near closing was purely the work of major players and is not worth mentioning.

The market opened slightly weak due to the National Bank's intervention the previous day and reports that senior officials from the Securities Exchange had been summoned to Beijing, with unfavorable rumors circulating. After Yong Yarn opened, brokers 2, 160, 220, 200, and 172 sold down to 6950 yuan. Brokers 85, 106, 23, 119, 97, 89, 83, 223, 163, 148, 76, 125, 207, 122, 231, 1299, 224, and 217 all bought aggressively. Within fifteen minutes, the market price suddenly jumped by over 500 yuan, with deferred water yarn rising to 7500 yuan. Brokers 143, 94, 54, 126, 76, and 188 sold at the high price of 7370 yuan. Brokers 143, 207, 89, 152, 117, 223, 107, 104, and 44 also bought. Lianhua Real Estate continued to hit the price limit, and deferred Yong Yarn rose back to 7500 yuan. Brokers 181, 8, 65, 160, 85, 185, and 102 sold again at 7320 yuan. Later, broker 152 bought spot Yong Yarn, and brokers 224 and 105 also bought up to 7500 yuan. However, as speculative stocks and miscellaneous stocks declined across the board, Yong Yarn was ultimately unable to sustain the gains. Moreover, spot brokers offered interest rates as high as 3.45 to 3.9 fen. Brokers 83, 65, and 89 sold again at 7320 yuan. Afterwards, rumors suddenly spread that the settlement could be extended to the end of September and that the Securities Finance Corporation would use a combination of 30% cash and U.S. dollar bonds. If the account balance exceeded 6 billion, an additional 20% of stock would be required. At 10:45 AM, buying interest resurged, with brokers 199, 224, 232, 119, 97, 152, and 85 buying up to 7550 yuan. Brokers 76, 148, 156, 142, and 157 sold within the range of 7300 yuan, and broker 94 bought slightly. There was a pause of about half an hour at this time.

### Wang Zhixin and Others Return to Shanghai; Secret Remains Unbroken; Many Rumors Circulating in the Market

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Securities Exchange, along with Assistant Managers Yang Pu and Gu Shanchang, returned to Shanghai yesterday from Beijing. It is reported that Wang and his colleagues had detailed discussions with Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance; Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department; Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commerce Department of the Economic Affairs Ministry; and the relevant section chiefs from both ministries.

The two ministries stated that they should wait quietly for the ministry's orders to be issued and implemented regarding new measures for the Securities Exchange.

Furthermore, it is widely rumored among brokers: (1) Deferred transactions will be extended for another three months until the end of September of this year. (2) For the deposit portion of deferred transactions, cash and U.S. dollar bonds can still be used simultaneously. (3) For deferred transaction amounts exceeding 6 billion yuan, an additional 20% deposit must be paid, and this additional deposit can be paid with listed stocks and U.S. dollar bonds. When the reporter inquired with a spokesperson from the Securities Exchange about these rumors, the spokesperson stated that they had not heard anything about it.

### National Bonds and Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak

Government bonds were slightly weak yesterday, with a turnover of only over 4 million, and narrow price fluctuations. Unified Class C bonds opened at 7300, reached a high of 7500, a low of 6900, and finally struggled around 7300. Foreign firms and room 503 were buying, while rooms 360 and 230 were selling.

### Floating Capital Flows from Tianjin to Shanghai, Reaching Over Tens of Billions of Yuan

In recent days, a large amount of floating capital has flowed into the Shanghai market from Tianjin. Commercial banks and money shops have received a large number of remittances from there every day. The exact amount is impossible to estimate, but it is believed to be in the tens of billions of yuan. It is reported that this floating capital is all flowing through Shanghai to escape to Hong Kong. It does not stay in Shanghai for long and continues to escape to Hong Kong by various means. Therefore, it is unlikely to put pressure on Shanghai prices. It is reported that part of this floating capital originated from the Northeast and flowed to Tianjin before being transferred, and part of it is funds from Tianjin and other cities in northern China.

### Future Silk Exports Will Primarily Be Based on Barter; Government Decides to Support the Development of the Silk Industry

[Report from Our Newspaper] The purchase of spring cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has come to an end. Dried cocoons have also been entering warehouses one after another, ready for silk reeling. The issue of outlets for the reeled silk is currently being planned by relevant agencies such as the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Silk Corporation. It is reported that future export methods will be based on barter with foreign countries.

Currently under consideration is bartering with the United States for rayon and bartering with Vietnam for rice. The barter plan with the United States proposes to export 1,500 piculs of raw silk to the United States each month. Based on the current price difference between American raw silk and rayon, approximately 7,000 boxes of rayon can be obtained each month. China is currently experiencing a shortage of rayon, and market prices are soaring. It is estimated that exporting 10,000 piculs of raw silk to the United States will be sufficient to meet the national demand for rayon for one year. (Currently, China's monthly consumption of rayon is only 3,000 boxes). Therefore, with this barter supply of rayon, a portion of the raw material problems for the silk weaving industry can be solved.

It is reported that the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economics will also establish a design committee to study the barter of raw silk with foreign countries, so that the results of the research can be offered to the authorities for adoption and implementation.

Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Silk Corporation, stated that the government will not hesitate to invest heavily in supporting the development of the silk industry, as this move is related to the revitalization of the rural economy and can increase exports.

This year's spring cocoon purchase considered the costs of silk farmers, and the future of the silk industry has shown a glimmer of hope. Silk farmers have regained their original interest in the cultivation of mulberry trees and other aspects. Therefore, it is estimated that the future cocoon production will exceed pre-war levels.

The authorities' adoption of silk fabrics and rayon helps silk exports, so they are doing their best to facilitate it. However, in the future, the rayon needed by the industry must contribute to exports, and at least the same amount of foreign exchange should be recovered. In addition, the company is planning to support the revival of the silk industry in various parts of Guangdong. The company will send two technicians to work there.

### Rice Market Stabilizes; Cooking Oil Prices Rise

### Six District Cotton Textile Association Submits Policy Recommendations

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association recently submitted four recommendations to the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, hoping that the committee would review and adopt them. They are recorded as follows:

1.  Under the principle of free operation of the textile industry, the committee, under the mandate of the government, shall supervise state-owned and private factories, plan for the increased production and supply of raw cotton, adjust the supply of finished products to stabilize market prices, and strive for foreign markets to achieve the rational development of the entire textile industry.

2.  To ensure the cooperation of state-owned and private factories, the supervisors of the committee should be jointly involved in the work with private factories.

3.  Regarding finance, fuel coal, raw materials, sales, and withdrawal, under the principle of fairness, private factories should receive the same treatment as state-owned factories regarding the convenience obtained by the former state-owned factories.

4.  The measures of the former Textile Management Committee that are inconsistent with the adjustment principle should be abolished immediately.

### Local Needle Manufacturing Industry Production Far Below Previous Levels; Raw Material Shortages Significantly Impact Costs

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the current production of the local needle manufacturing industry is only 54% of its highest output, and there is still room for active improvement. The main raw materials for the needle manufacturing industry are wire rod and wire rod skin. Before the war, domestic production was not possible, and all were imported from countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Belgium. After the government implemented import controls after the war, the source has become increasingly tight. In addition to the raw materials stored by each factory, the only way to purchase them is at a high price from households, which has a significant impact on the cost of products. The only hope now lies in the resumption of work of domestic public and private steel plants, so that they can supply the necessary raw materials.

As for sales, it can be discussed in three aspects: (1) The sales of sewing needles. Before the war, it was about 28,800 boxes per year, of which 60% were sold to India and Southeast Asia, and the rest were used domestically. The supply and demand situation has changed slightly after the war. The annual output in 1946 was 9,600 boxes, a quarter of which were for domestic sales, and the rest were all for export. Calculated at the current average market price, each box is calculated at 4.5 million yuan, and the total value can reach over 34.5 billion yuan, equivalent to about 2.8 million US dollars; if calculated at the highest output, exports can reach more than 17,200 boxes, and the total value is about 6.5 million US dollars.

(2) The sales of hosiery needles and knitting needles. Before the war, the annual output was 48 million to 60 million pieces. Because domestic demand exceeded supply, there were no exports. After the war, domestic demand decreased, and there was a surplus for export. The current domestic and foreign sales are roughly equal. According to the statistics of 1946, the total export value can reach 10 billion yuan, equivalent to 830,000 US dollars; calculated at the maximum output, the export value can be increased to 81.5 million yuan. (3) Safety pins and phonograph needles, because the output is not enough for domestic sales, there are currently no exports.

### Coarse Yarn Sales Market Warming Up

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw strong demand for 20-count coarse yarn from Hankou and other out-of-town dyehouses and textile factories, so the spot price rose to 8.9 million, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Double horse yarn rose by 150,000 yuan. Sales of 42-count and 40-count fine yarn were sluggish, with only slight increases. The rest of the 20-count and 16-count yarn rose by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan overall.

Spinning Construction Sells Cloth

[Report from Our Newspaper] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth yesterday as usual, selling a total of 26,465 bolts of cloth and 280 blankets. Domestic manufacturers submitted 67 purchase orders, purchasing a total of 3,625 bolts of cloth. Cloth merchants submitted 853 purchase orders, purchasing a total of 23,840 bolts of cloth and 280 blankets.

Furthermore, according to Director Jiang of the China Textile Construction Company's business department, the supply of 12-pound Nengtou fine cloth will be temporarily suspended, because it must be allocated to the Central Bank for purchase and export. Other fine cloths are supplied as usual. The time when supply will resume depends on future circumstances.

### Cotton Market Conditions Stable

Yesterday, the cotton market saw improved actual sales of cotton yarn, and yarn prices continued to rise from Monday's upward trend, so confidence was firm. Holders were unwilling to sell easily, and yarn factories and out-of-town merchants were also adding to their inventories, so market conditions showed a stable trend. Transactions were the same as the previous day. In the afternoon, the opening price for Indian cotton white Luoke was 1.67 million, and N.T. was 1.695 million yuan, Lingbao was 1.63 million, Huo Ji was 1.135 million yuan to 1.15 million yuan, Nantai Cang was 1.22 million, and Tongzhou coarse velvet was 1.24 million yuan. The above are all factory prices. The spot price was 1.535 million yuan to 1.57 million, Huo Ji was 1.09 million to 1.15 million, Tongzhou group velvet was 1.24 million, Chongtong was 1.20 million, Tongzhou wooden frame was 1.20 million, Haiti Jian was 1.075 million yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 190,000 to 210,000 per group (60 catties per sima scale).

### Jinan Cotton Industry Calls for Assistance

[Jinan, 17th, Our Telegram] The Jinan Cotton Industry Association stated that since the ban on the export of cotton from the city in April, the association's more than 60 cotton merchants have suffered losses of as much as 7 billion. Because of the cotton shortage in Shanghai and Qingdao, they have ordered American cotton from abroad. After many appeals, the ban has recently been lifted, but the Four Banks and the Rain Bureau have suddenly stopped cotton industry loans, putting the industry in a dying state. The association has invited the press to appeal for assistance on their behalf.

### Cigarette Market Conditions Sluggish

The cigarette market opened yesterday with a flat and weak market sentiment. It is reported that the stocks of British American Tobacco are abundant, and Wing Tai and has been distributing goods. After the afternoon, it began to pay for goods, and the money market for the industry was tight again. Foreign counterparts in the market were not enthusiastic about preparing goods for Hartmen, and the number of buyers was very small. Therefore, the price of the top ten British cigarettes was 6.34 million yuan, down 90,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife brand cigarettes were also down 110,000 yuan, and Wu Hua brand was down 50,000 yuan. Hartmen fell sharply by 200,000 yuan due to oversupply. The trend of the cigarette market throughout the day was downstream again. The price of Chinese merchant strip cigarettes also fell by 100 to 800 yuan. Higher-end cigarettes such as Da Nan, Da San Pao, and others were also being sold off, falling by 1,500 to 3,000 yuan. American cigarettes such as Six Horsepower were still selling well, especially Six City.

### Unified Issuance of Import Permits for Special Imports

[Report from Our Newspaper] The fourteenth regular meeting of the Special Committee of the Import Control Commission was held on the afternoon of the 16th at 3:00 PM. After discussion, it was decided to finalize the import regulations for: (1) goods imported by diplomatic personnel, (2) goods imported by religious, charitable, and educational institutions, and (3) goods imported for personal and household use. It was decided to unify the issuance of import permits for these imports and authorize the offices of the Import Control Commission in various districts to review and issue permits in accordance with the regulations in order to simplify procedures.

### Soap and Matches Both Decline

Yesterday's market for household soaps saw few resale transactions. It is reported that a peer sold a large quantity of Huang Xiang Mao soap at a price of 55,000 yuan, and the market sentiment suddenly became strong and the market became weak. Afterwards, Huang Xiang Mao soap was down 4-5,000 yuan compared with the previous day, and 160-piece white Xiang Mao was also down 2,000 yuan. Gu Ben soap was down 3,000 yuan. Arrow Knife soap had insufficient chips and sales were good, so the market was uniquely firm. Other brands saw declines of 2,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Sales of matches were not very smooth. Colleagues were under pressure from money and all took a wait-and-see approach, resulting in declines of 10,000 to 3-45,000 yuan. Only the Mei Li brand market was firmer.

### Miscellaneous Round Longan Continue to Rise

Miscellaneous large round longan continue to rise because the arrival stock is extremely scarce and the production area inventory is about to be cut off, so the trend is still tight even though sales are small. Yesterday, several hundred pieces were opened, and it rose another 4-50,000 yuan.

### After the Resumption of Private Trade by Japan, Sino-Japanese Trade is Unlikely to Expand: Yang Jinsheng Returns to Shanghai and Discusses Three Major Difficulties

Mr. Yang Jinsheng, Deputy Manager of the Central Trust Bureau and Commercial Advisor to the Delegation to Japan, recently went to Japan on official business. After a month and a half, he returned to this port by ship on the 16th. According to Mr. Yang, speaking to a reporter from the United Credit Information Service, the negotiations with MacArthur's headquarters on barter trade were extremely successful. Whether there will be new developments in the future will depend on government policy. Rayon is still being shipped continuously. The amount of salt to be exported to Japan this year is estimated at one million tons. However, due to transportation issues, this has been affected, and at most one million tons can be shipped this year. Regarding the opening of private trade with Japan, Mr. Yang said that the US government has decided that the distribution of official representatives on August 15 will be determined by the Allied Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Trade Bureau. After the representatives of the merchants are determined, they can contact Japanese manufacturers without restriction. The types, quantities, and prices of trade goods are all determined by MacArthur's headquarters. Furthermore, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen will not be fixed in advance but will be determined after the circulation of various commodities. Before the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, this is a partial lifting of the economic blockade against Japan. Mr. Yang then expressed his views on the prospects of our imports and exports after the resumption of private trade by Japan. Mr. Yang believes that there are still many difficulties: (1) There is no foreign exchange rate. During trade, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen is uncertain, and our foreign exchange is controlled by the government. Our importers cannot deliver US dollars or British pounds to exchange for Japanese goods. (2) The prices of goods traded with Japan must be approved by MacArthur's headquarters. Currently, the cost of our export commodities is very high. If MacArthur's headquarters does not calculate according to the actual cost during trade, our merchants will suffer huge losses. (3) China and Japan need mostly the same goods. Currently, Japan is willing to export raw silk, textiles, etc., and our exports to Japan are roughly the same. As for fuel and food, we cannot meet their needs. This is the biggest difficulty after the resumption of private trade by Japan. Mr. Yang also said that under such circumstances, most of the trade will still be conducted between governments.

In another report, it is learned that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan has decided to partially open Japanese trade in August this year, which is of great concern to the people of our country. It is understood that since Japan's surrender, although there have been trade exchanges with our country, they have all been conducted through barter. The Central Trust Bureau is responsible for overall planning. After the opening of Japanese trade this autumn, our trade relations with it can still maintain the existing mode, with internal government control. Although there are private exchanges, they must be strictly reviewed by the government. Therefore, the general concern that Japanese industrial manufactured goods will be imported in large quantities is an overstatement.

### Fierce Wind Sweeps Away Dirty Clouds: Henan Province Actively Launches Anti-Corruption Campaign

— Dispatch from Kaifeng, 13th. Our reporter, Wang Shoumei

The Cloud of Corruption

In today's political sky, shrouded in corruption, the officials and people of Henan have jointly launched an anti-corruption campaign, which is very exciting. Many people are watching with sharp eyes, waiting for the possible effects of this campaign.

The Henan Provincial New Life Movement Association has designated next week as the anti-corruption campaign promotion week. Starting from the 15th, every afternoon at 8:00 PM, leaders of the party, government, and organizations, as well as leaders from all walks of life and social activists, will be invited to give radio speeches in turn. Chairman Chen Ling of the Provincial Party Headquarters will give the first day's broadcast, talking about eliminating corruption and changing social customs. On the second day, Director Hu Changyi of the Youth League Branch will talk about eliminating corruption and the New Life Movement. On the third day, Speaker Ji Xue of the Provincial Assembly will discuss eliminating corruption and revitalizing China. On the fourth day, Director Zhang Xinnan of the Civil Affairs Department will talk about how to eliminate corruption. On the fifth day, Secretary-General Ma Lingfu of the Provincial Government will talk about eliminating corruption and purifying officialdom. On the sixth day, Supervisor Guo Zhongkui of Henan and Shandong will talk about eliminating corruption and building the nation. On the seventh day, President Zhou Yuzi of the High Court will talk about eliminating corruption and rectifying people's hearts. From these broadcast topics, people commonly feel that no matter from which aspect, corruption should be eliminated as soon as possible! Therefore, in theory, "eliminating corruption" has almost become a universally shared requirement. What people urgently demand is the practical implementation.

The Henan Provincial Assembly has never neglected this point. In order to protect the government and to protect the locality, they have not only vociferously called for the elimination of corruption in theory, but they have also not been negligent or sloppy in action. They have organized an investigation team, which has been meeting day and night recently to discuss work steps. After several discussions, they decided to first investigate the Henan Provincial Health Department.

The assembly members participating in this investigation are Liu Yan, Lü Yunru, Dai Xiangqu, Wang Junjie, Zhang Xiran, Qiao Zhaoran, Lu Jili, etc. Because they needed to thoroughly investigate the accounts of the department, they also invited Li Chaoyang from the accounting office of the Provincial Government Secretariat and Gao Jiannong from the accounting office of the Accounting Department to go together. At the same time, they also invited Shangguan Wu, the director of the Provincial Kaifeng Hospital, Yan Zhongyi, the director of the Provincial Zhengzhou Hospital, and Gan Yi, the director of the Infectious Disease Hospital, to the department at 9:00 AM yesterday for investigation.

This group of iron-faced and selfless representatives of public opinion marched into the Health Department. According to Director Shi Guopan of the department, Cao Huanzhang, the warehouse manager of the department's pharmacy, had escaped the day before yesterday. The investigation team had to focus on investigating the warehouse. Therefore, Sun, the chief of the department's second section, accompanied them to inspect the medicines in the warehouse. In the four dark and small warehouses, there were only a few crude medicines, arranged in a mess. The original vouchers were gone, and the payment figures were also unclear. Warehouse manager Sun Ji and secretary Zhi were vague and evasive. They did not know the details of all the accounts. The team had no choice but to seal up the warehouse, take away eight volumes of registration certificates for existing drug receipts and issues, and are now checking them. The team also held a meeting on this matter in the morning. According to the China Times here today, Shi Guopan of the Health Department is suspected of serious corruption.

The report stated, "...Shi Guopan, a native of Jiangsu, was appointed director of the Health Department in the 31st year of the Republic. At that time, the provincial government was still located in Luoyang. A special committee was established to handle the receipt and distribution of medicines, and Shi, as the chairman, was responsible for convening meetings. However, after the provincial government moved to Xiangshan, Shi claimed that it was not easy to convene meetings, and the committee became a mere formality. At that time, the medicines of the International Red Cross Society were constantly arriving, and ordinary medicines such as quinine pills and aspirin often numbered in the hundreds of thousands of tablets each time. After the provincial government moved to Wanxi for the third time, the traffic between Wanxi and Xi'an was frequent, and the Health Department also often sent people back and forth between Henan and Shaanxi, which inevitably raised suspicions. After the restoration, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration also often delivered medicines to the department for distribution to various counties, but those who came to the counties to collect them often returned disappointed. For example, penicillin, which the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration originally designated as non-saleable, was delivered to the department in 800 doses for free injection to patients, but now its whereabouts are unknown, and the loss of other medicines is even more impossible to calculate."

According to a colleague of the investigation team, Shi Guopan is indeed suspected of corruption based on evidence. The escape of warehouse manager Cao Huanzhang was also instigated by someone. Before escaping, he had handed over 18 boxes of medicines to Guangji Pharmacy to sell on his behalf.

This case is currently under investigation. This case is also the beginning of the investigation team's work. The government is assisting them, and the people are supporting them. Their work may proceed smoothly and achieve satisfactory results. As long as the determination is consistent, it is believed that this huge wind will surely sweep away the dirty clouds of corruption, allowing the clear blue political sky to reappear over Henan.

### A Glimpse of Tanggu New Port (Part Two)

— Dispatch from Tianjin, 8th. Xing Qixin

Three-Year Plan

The New Port project, after inheriting the unfinished work and the stagnation and destruction by the Japanese, slightly started in the 35th year of the Republic. However, for the completion of the entire project, it is necessary to lay its foundation within the initial three years to open the way for future expansion. The work during these three years will focus on dredging and breakwater construction. Other supporting projects such as completing the dry dock, expanding the shipyard, paving railways and highways, and purchasing machinery and ships are also urgent tasks. In addition, it is necessary to coordinate and connect with the railway and highway aspects at any time to complete water-land combined transportation, so as to build and operate simultaneously to achieve the effect of investment. After the completion of this three-year plan, the future direction will be determined based on the industrial and commercial development of Tianjin and Tanggu to achieve the task of completing the port construction.

The quantity of work in the three-year plan and the overall effects after completion are briefly described below:

Important Tasks

(1) Breakwater: Consolidate the existing south breakwater with a length of 4,500 meters and the north breakwater with a length of 3,800 meters. Speed up the completion of the unfinished stone dike, estimated to require 120,000 cubic meters of stone and 12,000 cubic meters of cement blocks, and drive single-line steel sheet piles for 1,650 meters.

(2) Navigation Channel: Dredge the main channel in the port to a width of 70 meters and a depth of 6 meters. Deepen the area in front of the first wharf to 6 meters, deepen the area in front of the second wharf to 8 meters, and deepen the east and west entrances of the ship lock to 5 meters.

(3) Wharf: The second wharf has two original coal loading machines, which will be repaired and used. The barge wharf to the east is 370 meters long and is about 25% complete. It is planned to be completed this year for use. In addition, the dredged silt will be used to fill and build a material wharf. This year, a 300-meter revetment will be built first.

(4) Filling: The wharf base is filled with dredged mud and sand using mud discharge pipes. It is estimated that 1.7 million cubic meters will be completed this year. Calculated at an average height of 4 meters, it can provide more than 700 mu of wharf land. However, this newly filled land will not be usable until three years later.

(5) Ship Lock: Leveling the ground near the ship lock still requires 20,000 cubic meters of earth. The electrical equipment in the existing ship lock control room is temporary equipment. It is planned to bring in the original designed electrical control equipment from Japan to replace it. In addition, two sets of floating boats for water blocking should be prepared on both sides of the ship lock for use in repairing the gate when it is damaged.

(6) Land Equipment: For loading and unloading equipment, it is planned to add two 3-ton and two 25-ton cranes first, and the existing 10 kilometers of railway will be consolidated. If necessary, it is planned to build another 11 kilometers. It is also planned to build another 5 kilometers of highway.

(7) Electrical Equipment: When the Japanese built the port, they built a second transformer station with 12,000 KVA capacity and high-voltage lines, etc. It was originally designed for dredgers to work at the eastern end of the port wharf, far from the shore. It has long been completely destroyed. Currently, there is only one 2,400 KVA transformer station. Not only can all the dredgers not be started at the same time, but even after the machine factory is expanded, it may only be able to meet the needs of the machine factory's work. Therefore, it is necessary to add a 6,000 KVA transformer station and add four sets of 1,000 KVA generators to generate electricity by themselves to facilitate work.

(8) Dock and Ships: Dredging work is extremely important to maintain the smooth flow of the port channel, even in peacetime. In addition to repairing the existing ships, it is planned to purchase or lease one or two large suction dredgers. In addition, for winter freezing, it is planned to purchase one or two icebreakers for dredging and icebreaking. However, for the repair of damaged ships, the Japanese previously used docks at Dagu Shipyard and Taikoo Dockyard. After the victory, each of these docks was recovered by the original owner. The new port has no such equipment at all, making ship repair extremely difficult. This year, it is planned to complete a 2,000-ton dry dock that was not completed by the Japanese and add a simple shipyard. Add machine factory working machinery and ships for soil transportation and water supply to cooperate with the progress of the project. In addition, more than ten barges and tugboats will be added to facilitate transportation and complete water-land combined transportation.

(9) Water Supply and Drainage Equipment: Add a water pool and bury 5,000 meters of water pipes.

(10) Navigation Markers: Add 22 buoys, 11 self-luminous buoys, 2 lighthouses, 2 fog signals, 6 light beacons, and 3 signals, which will be distributed in the port to facilitate navigation.

Various Effects

After the completion of this year's project, the following effects can be achieved:

(1) 3,000-ton ships can pass through the ship lock to and from Tianjin at any time.

(2) The first wharf can simultaneously berth five to seven 3,000-ton ships or ships with a draft of less than 5 meters, with an estimated annual loading and unloading volume of approximately 1 million tons.

(3) The coal loading yard at the second wharf can load and unload approximately 1 million tons of coal annually. Coal produced from Datong and Jingxing mines can be loaded and transported for export through the new port.

(4) The barge wharf can be completed.

(3) Filling: Use dredged soil to fill 1.6 million cubic meters.

(4) Railway: Build 4.5 kilometers of railway.

(5) Loading and Unloading Equipment: Add four 3-ton cranes, two 10-ton cranes, six 1- to 3-ton cranes, and one 150-ton crane.

After the completion of the work plan in the 38th year, the following effects can be achieved:

(1) Four 30,000-ton ocean giants can be berthed in the port at the same time.

(2) The breakwater is completely completed, and the port base is gradually stabilized.

(3) The port's shipping facilities are completed.

(4) Coastal ships can be repaired and built.

(5) The sea-land transportation plan is completed.

Future Prospects

The original purpose of the Japanese in building the new port was to export mainly bauxite and other materials to Japan and import finished products to China. It had nothing to do with China's economy and international trade. Now that the new port has been taken back and built by our country, we should consider our country's economic situation, foreign trade, and the needs of industry and commerce in North China, examine its gains and losses, measure its urgency, and revise the project plan. According to the opinions of Chinese and American experts and the results of surveys and research, it is generally believed that the new port project should first focus on basic facilities and lay the foundation for future expansion, so as not to deviate from the principles of economic construction.

In the 35th year of the Republic, the New Port project only reorganized damaged equipment and houses and completed a part of the project that had been started but not completed by the Japanese. In the next three years, efforts will be made to build the basic facilities of the New Port project to meet the transportation of passengers and goods in the North China area. After that, the expansion plan will be determined based on the transportation situation between Tianjin and Tanggu and the prosperity of industry and commerce in North China so as to suit the actual situation and gradually develop.

As for the throughput of goods, the original plan of the Japanese was quite large, with the goal of building an annual throughput of 27 million tons of coal, salt, iron ore, bauxite, and sundries. The first phase of the project was aimed at 8 million tons, and the construction was less than half completed in five years. Now, according to the three-year plan, the annual throughput will be 2 million tons after completion. If the loading and unloading equipment is complete, it can reach 4 million tons. In the future, more wharves will be built, and transportation facilities will be strengthened, which is expected to increase to 12 million tons, occupying a very important position among the ports in the country.

The unfinished base left by the Japanese in building the port is quite vast. In the future, it will be gradually repaired and coordinated with urban construction, which will surely become a prosperous urban area. Then, it will develop northward to Beitang at the mouth of the Ji Canal, and the area will be further expanded. Therefore, the future new port will surely become an important port for international trade in the North Pacific.

### The Magnificent Righteousness and Abundant Reason: A Scene of the Chengdu Student Movement

— Dispatch from Chengdu, 11th. Our reporter, Zhou Xueduan

The nationwide student movement that shook the country was not as enthusiastic in Chengdu as imagined by some conspirators. The righteousness of the students washed away the ambitions of the schemers. Furthermore, the automatic discovery of the student community exposed the international student movement conspiracy, forcing the schemers to disappear and calming Chengdu, which finally passed peacefully through this student movement.

Amidst the Student Movement

Chengdu's Special Performance

While the student movements in Beijing and Shanghai were boiling and intense, the student community in Chengdu showed calmness and reason. Although a small number of middle schools once醞釀 (yùnniàng - brewed) a strike, they were soon persuaded by the righteousness of the students in all universities and middle schools. During this period, the student unions of universities such as Sichuan University, West China University, and Chenghua University, as well as vocational schools such as the Provincial Accounting School, Art School, and Sports School, sent telegrams to students in Beijing and Shanghai, hoping that they would understand the country's difficulties, not be used by parties, and maintain the glorious achievements of the student movement since the May Fourth Movement. After the central government announced measures to maintain social order, 24 cultural and academic organizations in Sichuan University and Chenghua University sent telegrams expressing their support and advising students in Beijing and Shanghai not to take radical actions, stop striking, and wait for the government to handle the matter fairly. At the same time, all schools in the city expressed a unanimous opinion, resolutely opposing the use of strikes and parades as a means to disrupt young people's studies. As a result, the schemers' tricks of discord could not be used.

The Strike Conspiracy

Did Not Materialize

On the eve of "June 2nd," some conspirators attempted to instigate strikes and parades in some schools on "June 2nd." Fei Erbu, a Western professor at Huada, presided over a rally to mobilize strikes among students from major universities and middle schools. However, few people attended, only 26 students from five schools including Huada, West China High School, and Zhonghua Women's High School. They decided to launch a strike and parade on "June 2nd" and expand the creation of bloodshed. Disputes arose on the spot due to differences of opinion. At the same time, many passionate university and middle school students were extremely indignant upon hearing the news and immediately drafted and posted hundreds of emergency bulletins throughout the city, listing the contents of the meeting and the donation conspiracy. As a result, anger spread throughout the student community. On the afternoon of the same day, representatives from 38 units of major universities and middle schools in the city, a total of more than 400 people, held a grand rally for the school protection movement at Qilu University. Amidst indignant and enthusiastic emotions, they resolved: (1) to establish the Chengdu Municipal Major Universities and Middle Schools Anti-Strike and Anti-Riot Movement Assembly, (2) to telegram students across the country, (3) to telegraph condolences to injured students in Beijing and Shanghai who protected their schools. The students at the meeting made generous donations on the spot and immediately raised a large sum of money to send to Beijing to express their condolences to the injured students. The entire venue shouted slogans such as: "Oppose 'eating all,'" "Hunger," "Three Strikes," and "Down with conspirators who use young people to create student movements!" The voice of justice resounded throughout Chengdu.

The Just Struggle

Exposes Foreign Conspiracy

Due to the sense of justice of these students, they immediately received the full support of more than 100,000 students from major universities and middle schools in the city. The schemers had no choice but to retreat, and the planned "June 2nd" strike and parade were temporarily called off. "June 2nd"! This tense day passed peacefully. Afterwards, Fei Erbu sent a letter to the Central News Agency, stating that he was only a religious and literary teacher, had no party background, and presided over the strike rally purely due to misunderstanding. However, the next day, students who had witnessed the meeting publicly refuted it, listing the details of the meeting and proving that Fei was indeed a core member, and demanded that the government ask Fei to leave Chengdu. This major case has not yet been resolved.

Spring and Autumn

### In the Theater

— Yang Wen

I heard booing again in a movie theater.

The sound was so familiar; after thinking about it carefully, I realized I often heard it in Chongqing.

Living in that mountain city for six or seven years, life was naturally quite boring, especially on evenings of chilling winds and bitter rain, when time was even harder to pass. Gradually, I learned to go to the “Ascending Peace Drum Song” hall to listen to Fuguihua (a performer), remembering that initially it cost five jiao to steep a cup of tea and sit until late at night. When the performance ended, I would come out with the crowd, and the midnight streets were quiet, the streetlights casting long, faint shadows. Perhaps a drizzle was still falling, which only added to the poetic feeling. After turning a few corners, the pedestrians walking along the road became fewer and fewer, until finally only one person was left, accompanied by their own shadow. There was not a sound on the road except for my own footsteps. I loved the quiet, secluded roads late at night, and sometimes even sat silently in the theater for hours just to savor this atmosphere.

The plays or movies in the theater were not necessarily satisfying. The most uncomfortable things were the applause and boos, especially directed at the characters on the screen.

I heard about it from others at home when I was a child. Once, a village opera troupe was performing. Zhang Shigui and Yuchi Gong came out, and just as the performance was getting exciting, watermelon rinds and clods of earth were thrown onto the stage from below. Even more, a burly man jumped onto the stage from below, grabbed Zhang Shigui and started beating him. By the time several people pulled them apart, the one who had been beaten could no longer stand up. Someone said to the one who had done the beating, "This is just a play, it's not real!" The man still replied indignantly, "If it were real, I would beat him to death." Naturally, the play could not continue, and that was the end of it; the telling of the story also ended with that. At the time, I was very bewildered, wondering if this kind of thing could really happen, if someone watching a play would really go on stage to beat the villainous traitor Zhang Shigui? I didn't know.

Later, I understood that this was a type of "rural behavior" common in the city, perhaps it would occur. In the city, encountering this kind of situation was different; the audience's reaction was to boo, and it was rare for anyone to go on stage to start beating someone. By comparison, it was much more "civilized."

The opposite of booing was applause. When Fuguihua came out and sang a passage, applause thundered throughout the hall; when the "Grand Western Chamber" reached "Stepping into the study door," applause also resounded, mixed with strange shouts of "Bravo!" "I say, brother!" the audience responded in unison. Mr. Black Button's storytelling in The Travels of Lao Ts'an was such that he scanned the entire hall, and even the listener sitting in the farthest corner felt that "Mr. Black Button saw me." This unison response, similarly, although it wasn't "Fuguihua calling me brother," was like "I got something for free from Fuguihua." Tong Zhiling was even more wonderful; without even opening her mouth, a glance and a slight movement of her body would bring forth strange cries of "Bravo!"

People are truly incomprehensible. Dressed in long gowns and leather shoes, acting politely, taking advantage of the dim lighting and the clamor of the crowd, they would actually emit tones so incompatible with their status. Even more strange is that people never seemed to feel any revulsion towards these sounds, considering them vulgar or belonging to the category of vulgar behavior. At most, they would look in that direction or smile. Perhaps everyone was originally seeking excitement, and was equally intoxicated in the excitement.

What I fear most is not these things, but the same methods being used in movie theaters: sometimes booing, sometimes applauding, and sometimes booing mixed with applauding. This scene often occurred when a villainous type of bad guy was suffering misfortune, or was being triumphant, or when a man and woman were kissing. Especially for the latter, booing was certain to occur every time, and even applauding was added. Perhaps only Freud could explain this kind of psychology!

Though the Zhang Shigui being beaten or booed on the stage was just an actor, he was still a living representative; when Fuguihua and Tong Zhiling were applauded and cheered, they would smile contentedly and retreat backstage, and the applauders or cheerers would also feel that their admiration was known, and that there was a "connection" in spirit. Only when shouting wildly at the screen and booing, knowing full well that the other party was completely unaware, then what was the purpose of it all?

There are many behaviors of mankind that cannot be explained; this is one of them.

Truly, "The difference between man and beast is slight." How are their acts of stupidity any better than a Sichuan dog barking at the sun or a fly crashing into glass? In terms of virtues, they are less peaceful than doves and less patient than sheep. Only in hypocrisy and affectation, pretending to be noble and kind, are they much more superior to all things, but what virtue is that! I would rather love the maggots that are certainly not clean, but never boast of their cleanliness. After a while, the entire theater became extremely quiet again. In the dim light, one could clearly see greasy yellow faces perched on stretched-out necks, saliva flowing back into the throat, slowly the chin hanging down, the mouth opening: completely enraptured. Who knows, under this very visage a strange cry or loud boo might erupt again.

I felt a desire to laugh but couldn't. I remembered a scene I saw not long ago in a Peking opera theater. The flirtatious acting of the "Killing the Son for Revenge" flower (female role), the monk kneeling and flirting, and the audience showing the same expressions as today.

"Nine out of ten women...

Are afraid your men will be too loose-lipped."

Applause thundered, mixed with strange cries, and occasional bursts of laughter. They sang on and on, until the monk was arrested, and before the female role even saw the official, Ah Gou pulled Ah Mao away, "It's almost over, there's nothing interesting coming up." They only saw "Killing the Son," but didn't see any "Revenge." The performers sang it this way, and the audience listened this way, but different from the arguments were the solemnly raised issues of education and life.

Theory and practice are often so different!

### Remembering Ma Gongyu

— Zhiyuan

Whenever the three characters "Ma Gongyu" are mentioned, as long as you have lived in Shanghai and know a little about art, I don't think anyone would find them unfamiliar!

At a time when China's inherent arts—calligraphy, painting, etc.—are teetering on the brink of decline, he has already become an authority in the current calligraphy and painting world. He is not only a calligrapher, but also a painter and epigrapher. We can see his ink traces everywhere, especially in the official script (隶书), writing the Han dynasty Zhang Qian stele calligraphy with practiced ease, entering a realm of transformation, being vigorous and robust, and exceptionally full of spirit. Besides calligraphy, there are also his paintings and carvings, which almost everyone admires.

Of medium height, his back slightly bent, with a round, upright face, and full of vigor, he wears a pair of black-rimmed glasses on the bridge of his nose. What attracts the most attention are his long, black whiskers, floating in front of his chest. His demeanor of a famous scholar makes people look at him with respect. Undoubtedly, when people see him, it's clear that he is a completely authentic, ancient scholar preserving the essence of Chinese culture. However, you might not believe that he used to be an English teacher at many schools before the war, and had a considerable understanding of Shakespeare. Before the war, he was an old professor in the Chinese department of Great China University. At the beginning of the war against Japan, the school moved inland, but due to various reasons, he did not follow the school to the interior, but secluded himself on the sea, maintaining his consistent style of a famous scholar, asking nothing and hearing nothing. Although the enemy repeatedly threatened and lured him, he was never moved. He lived a poor and honest life, and passed these long days with a clean conscience.

Generally, a learned person often likes humor and wit. In a recent speech by Mr. Ma, we can see his humorous and witty style, as well as his artistic thoughts.

He said, "Chinese art is worthy of praise, and absolutely cannot be easily imitated by others, because it has an independent prototype. The brilliant culture of five thousand years has only created this crystallization."

"Let's take writing as an example. China uses square characters, which cannot be compared to the phonetic scripts of other countries. They are the only type of script in the world. The reason why China will not perish should also be attributed to the preservation and transmission of square characters. Although we lost our country twice in the Yuan and Qing dynasties, not only did the writing not perish, but it assimilated the foreign races, and the country recovered. Therefore, Chinese art is worthy of pride and can conquer others. Speaking of traditional Chinese painting, foreigners often find it strange and want to learn it, but unless they start learning from five thousand years ago, it will not be easy to learn."

After hearing Mr. Ma's words, I think that those who blindly believe in Westernization will have some understanding!

### Roads (Two Poems)

One Wang Jiande

This is a long road, stretching so far that no one can see its end.

The road surface is sometimes flat, sometimes rugged; there is grass beside the road, and also thorns.

Every day, every day, countless people pass through here, walking towards the end of the road. Among them, some have light and brisk steps, others have hesitant and awkward steps; some sing joyfully, others groan sadly. But they never stop, walking towards the end of the road. No one has ever seen anyone come back.

I don't know from what day, I found myself joining their ranks, walking forward. I feel that this road is not easy to walk; I want to turn back, but behind me is a long, crowded line. I have no choice but to drag my heavy steps and continue forward.

Now, I feel tired, unable to rest, unable to get help, and even unable to get the warmth of friendship, because everyone is a traveler on this road, and all have a long journey ahead!

Two Ming

Roads stretch forward, crossing one mountain after another, never ending. She shows a proud spirit, spreading across every place on earth, using her body to serve as the only great tool for communicating culture and commerce.

Roads fear rivers the most. When a small river cuts across her, the road and the bridge become two friends sharing hardships.

I love "roads". On summer nights, I love to wander on quiet, deserted roads until dewdrops form in my hair.

"Roads are trampled out by people," ancient philosophers said long ago. There were originally no roads on barren mountains. Every day, hunters go up to hunt, woodcutters go up to chop wood, eternally following in the footsteps of their predecessors, and gradually, a road appears. Roads are trampled out by people.

Therefore, I think about why the "road to national construction" has not yet been completed, it is because everyone has not worked together to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, walking the roads that are just taking shape!

Every day, I pray to the road:

Let us walk out of a broad and smooth "road"! …

### The Deeds of Dr. Bu Fangji, Late President of St. John's University

— Cai Zheng

The teacher's surname was Bu, his given name was Fangji, and he was a native of New York State in the United States. Born into a respected family, he was pure in nature. He studied at Columbia University, and at the age of nineteen, received a Bachelor of Arts degree. His literary talent already shone brightly, and his studies became even more diligent. Soon he transferred to the New York Theological Seminary to become a Bachelor of Divinity, studying extensively and thoroughly, exhausting the profound mysteries. His family was originally wealthy, and he further enhanced his reputation, but the teacher did not aspire to gain advancement by unworthy means, but single-mindedly devoted himself to teaching. Undaunted by hardships, he came to China from afar, completely shedding his former attire and customs, and adopting our customs. He first mastered the language, then studied the classics and commentaries, and was able to recite them fluently, without any hesitation. At first, the Episcopal Church had a benefactor who established a school on the sea, and chose the former site of the Brahma temple. Gathering thirty-nine students, this became St. John's University. In the beginning, they believed that the teacher's benevolence was sufficient to lead others, and his integrity was sufficient to manage affairs, so they invited him with courtesy, and appointed him to lead the school. The teacher took office resolutely and decisively, with detailed arrangements, respectfully adhering to the principle of tireless instruction, hoping to achieve the effect of skillful guidance. At that time, scholars were obscured by their attachments, and their learning was far from being practical. The teacher was saddened by this, and used his knowledge to teach orally, explaining the origins and ends, hoping for thorough understanding. Thereupon, those who came from all directions flocked to him, drawn by his reputation and responding to his call. The joy of teaching and learning was as close as father and son. Over the past fifty years, he successively established colleges of arts, sciences, medicine, engineering, etc., expanded the land by more than two hundred acres, and built school buildings. Libraries, science halls, laboratories, gymnasiums, and recreation rooms were all fully equipped, a grand scale was established, and it became a prestigious academy. The teacher himself said that he spent his life begging for the school. Every time he returned to his homeland, he sought donations in every possible way, and came back with funds, often for construction. But later, construction projects increased, and he also raised funds locally. The people of the country were grateful and admired him, and competed to contribute. Therefore, President Li Yuanhong awarded him the Third Class Chiaho Medal for his contribution to civilizing and transforming the people in our country. Trinity College in New York and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland both awarded him honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees. The Episcopal Church also requisitioned him to be a bishop, to manage all church affairs in Anhui Province, but he declined the appointment because he had dedicated himself to the school. Even after the age of seventy, he personally managed all the affairs, without any relaxation. It can be said that his conduct was consistent, from beginning to end. During the Japanese invasion, the teacher was in America, and he was still concerned about his old work, making plans. When he returned after the war, and saw that the school buildings were as before, and the students were still studying diligently, his heart was filled with joy, which overflowed in his words. He said to those around him, "Returning to this old place is no different from returning home. I will spend my old age in this country, and my wish will be fulfilled!" How could he have known that after living peacefully for four months, he suddenly suffered a serious illness, and passed away in the third month of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China (1947). He was eighty-three years old. When the news of his death arrived, tens of thousands of students sent their condolences from afar, and those who were near the mourning hall all said that although the wise man had passed away, his virtuous words remained. We should promote the teacher's spirit, and jointly strive for immortal achievements. Because Zheng Hua was in the same school under the teacher, and personally received his teachings, I was ordered to record his words and deeds, and present them to the historians, for their careful selection!

### Beginning-to-Believe Peak of Mount Huangshan

— Zhiyuan

The strange peaks of the back sea of Mount Huangshan are as dense as swords and halberds. The most famous is the Beginning-to-Believe Peak. The two peaks are about two zhang apart, and are connected by a stone structure. There is a pine tree at the bridgehead, with a branch extending horizontally as long as the bridge. Tourists hold onto it to move forward along the bridge, and it is called the Greeting Pine.

### Dirge

— E. Allan Poe, translated into English; Peiyin, retranslated

This article is one of the ancient Greek poems, originally published in the tenth volume of The Complete Works of E. Allan Poe. It was translated into English by Mr. Poe and is one of Mr. Poe's introductions to Greek literary works. It is now specifically retranslated as follows.

——Translator

(I)

How shall we read this epitaph?

How shall we sing this tragic song?

For this deceased, adorable departed,

What kind of requiem shall we sing?

(II)

Her friends gaze at her,

Gaze at her ornately adorned bier,

And weep—oh! Actually using hypocritical

Tears to humiliate a dead girl.

(III)

They loved her for her wealth—

They hated her for her arrogance—

As she gradually became feeble,

They loved her—therefore she died.

(IV)

They tell me (as they discuss

Her "valuable, embroidered shroud")

That my voice has become hoarse—

I should no longer sing.

(V)

Or that my tone should

Turn into such solemn songs,

So tragic—so sad,

That the dead will not feel regret.

(VI)

Now she has gone to heaven

Carrying young hopes with her.

And I am intoxicated by love for the dead,

She is my bride.

(VII)

Belonging to death—she lies dead

Her whole body adorned with incense,

Her eyes marked by death,

Life still lingering in her hair.

(VIII)

Thus, I knock on the coffin

Loudly and lingeringly—vague melody

Echoing in the gray hut, answering my song,

Harmonizing with my singing.

(IX)

You died in the June of your life—

But you did not die miraculously;

You did not die suddenly,

Nor did you pass with a peaceful death.

(X)

From countless worldly friends

Your life and love were shattered,

Mingling with the eternal gathering of

Countless angels in heaven——

(XI)

Therefore, for you this evening

There will be no requiem,

Only sing and dance for you, as you ascend,

With an old song of joy.

(Written in 1947)

### A Story of the Kazakhs

— Pu

In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Ma Zixiang, the chairman of Qinghai, knew that the Kazakhs were highly skilled in horsemanship and had a strong national character. He wanted to settle these minority compatriots scattered within Qinghai, give them appropriate training, and contribute to the country's all-out war effort. He also knew that the Kazakhs, besides their religion—Islam, usually represented by the "scripture box" worn on their chest—cherished their women and children the most. Women were difficult to manage, so what about the sons? He set up a good primary school in Xining, using education as a pretext to take their beloved sons as "hostages," and then proceed step by step.

Unexpectedly, the Kazakhs, who could sing beautiful vocal music and were both simple and intelligent, had already seen through this plan and immediately planned to resist. At this time, the central government, in order to develop the Great Northwest, sent a team of radio talents to the Qaidam Basin. Mr. Pu Wenfeng was assigned to be the person in charge of entertaining them along the way. When they, a group of dozens of people, camped in one place, they happened to encounter a beautiful moonlit night. After eating and drinking, everyone became excited and couldn't help but sing and laugh loudly. Suddenly, a Kazakh woman came from a dusty place—this Caucasian type of woman suited everyone's temperament.

At that time, these prairie travelers, three parts drunk, did something with this beauty, and we can imagine what it was. Adding excitement to the revelry, this woman also played along. When the moon set, the stars dimmed, and the wind was high and the slumber was sweet, this woman secretly slipped away. The people in several tents fell asleep after extreme revelry. The Kazakhs, who had been lurking in the grass, suddenly walked quickly to the side of the tent, drew their knives, first chopped the tent poles, and then, with a dense formation, stepped on the four sides and chopped at the center together!

"Unfortunately," Mr. Pu, who was sent to accompany us, said, "If I hadn't suddenly needed to urinate and ran out of the tent to relieve myself, I would have gone to see the Bodhisattva of the Earth King with these many specialized talents cultivated by the country for many years! Let me tell you all," he continued, "I was still naked when I ran all the way to the government headquarters! Of course, Chairman Ma's original plan was never carried out because of this!"

It is said that the recent Xinjiang incident was led by the Kazakhs.

Free Talk

### Gypsies

— Cai Xue

India seems to be the homeland of the Gypsies. The language they speak is one of the Indian dialects, which evolved from Sanskrit. They are descendants of the Dravidians, who were conquered by the Aryans and became their slaves. Around the time of Jesus' birth, they broke away from their shackles and began their nomadic life.

They lived in the Balkan Peninsula for hundreds of years and learned many ways to do business. Their language added many Greek and Slavic words. Their religious beliefs and customs were greatly influenced, and they even abandoned their original Taoist religion. Because they lived in the Balkans for a long time, some people mistakenly thought that this was their ancestral home.

The number of Gypsies gradually increased. The Balkan nobles treated them as slaves, making them do everything from cutting firewood, mining, and even cooking and taking care of children. Until the nineteenth century, they were still enslaved in Romania. But their love of freedom was too strong, and those who refused to be slaves fled to the mountainous areas, where they formed bands under their own chieftains and engaged in robbery. Those who were caught were of course beheaded, but they were also well organized. Later, the situation deteriorated even further, and they had to emigrate to Western Europe. They were still led by chieftains, who dressed very impressively, but their subordinates lived in tents and could not help but steal. They claimed to be devout Christians, expelled from Egypt by the Turks. The name "Gypsy" originated from this.

They have been to Paris, spread to England and Spain, and even Norway, Sweden, and Finland are their worlds. At first, everyone did not pay much attention, but later they became alarmed. Prussia was the first to prohibit them from entering the country, otherwise they would be hanged. But they would find a place to settle down. In fact, they are also very lovely, and their temperament is somewhat like children. Danger only arises when they are forced to a dead end. Austria once changed its attitude and treated them well, wanting to set up a colony for them. Although the plan was not successful, countries gradually changed their discriminatory attitudes towards them.

At the end of the eighteenth century, a German named Grellmann wrote a book proving that the Gypsies migrated from India. People then became interested in this long-despised ethnic group and began to study their lives. Novelists and playwrights also used them as subjects, describing their nomadic lives, freedom, and lack of restraint. This friendly praise confused the Gypsies, but it did reduce their fear. However, there were still some among them who liked to live a wandering life. Unless it was in the cold winter, they would temporarily settle indoors, but once spring warmed up, they would all set out on expeditions again.

If you treat Gypsies with sincerity, they will treat you with sincerity. Among them, there are also doctors, lawyers, engineers, and artists. They are full of talent, especially for music and dance. According to police investigations, Gypsies have never committed major crimes, only minor accidents, some of which are simply making trouble for no reason.

Before the war, many people wanted to modernize them by opening schools, publishing newspapers, and establishing theaters, and the results were not bad. During the war, they were also very active, resisting the Germans and sheltering prisoners. Therefore, the Germans killed more than 10,000 Gypsies in Auschwitz overnight. It is said that in 1939, there were about 1.5 million Gypsies in Europe, but not many are left now. The Gypsies in France are calling for everyone to unite completely.

### Birdkeeping and "Door Birds"

— Ai Yinxuan

——Let's Look at Zheng Banqiao's Perspective

The City God Temple in this city recently held a yellow bird competition, with participants from twenty-seven units including Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Luodian. There were over six hundred yellow birds, indicating a great many enthusiasts of this pursuit.

Generally speaking, birdkeeping can be considered a refined pastime. The birds' melodious songs, beautiful plumage, and delicate yet lively姿態 indeed bring joy to the heart and pleasure to the senses. However, if birds are fattened up solely for fighting, taking pleasure in seeing them wounded and maimed in self-destructive combat, it is undeniably somewhat cruel.

Birdfighting is a pastime similar to cockfighting and cricket fighting, enjoyed by people from young children to white-haired elders, often leading to lavish gambling and financial ruin. According to the bird owners participating in the City God Temple's birdfighting competition this time, there was no gambling involved; it was purely for the sake of local pride and prestige. This so-called pride and prestige stems from a desire to win; people naturally have a competitive spirit, but when this spirit expands, it often manifests as cruelty, as exemplified by birdfighting.

In all seriousness, keeping birds in cages is already extremely unnatural. Zheng Banqiao, in discussing birdkeeping with his younger brother, said: "Throughout my life, I have most disliked birds in cages. I seek entertainment, while they are imprisoned. Where is the reason or logic in that? Why must I bend the nature of things to suit my own?" He later added: "What I mean by not keeping birds in cages is not that I don't love birds, but that there is a proper way to care for them. If you want to keep birds, it's best to plant many trees, so that hundreds of branches near your house are lush and dense, forming a bird kingdom and a bird home. At dawn, when you first awaken from sleep, listen to a chorus of chirping, like the music of Yunmen and Xianchi. When you get up, wash your face, and sip tea, watch them spread their wings and display their colors, flitting back and forth, keeping your eyes busy. This is far more enjoyable than the pleasure of a single bird in a cage." (See Banqiao's Family Letters) This should be the most perfect way to keep birds. Even without mentioning "cherishing things" or "loving life," it is a kind of poetic interest and a way of life as an art.

In fact, in the vast universe, there are countless things to do. As Su Dongpo said: "Paying attention to things often leads to pleasure." If we broaden our interests, everything in the world can bring us joy. Why limit ourselves to birdkeeping? And why even limit ourselves to birdfighting?

### Prevalent Urban Diseases

— Baker

The Epidemic Prevention Committee announced on the 13th that epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis and smallpox are spreading in the city. Last month, there were 113 cases of cerebrospinal meningitis and 458 cases of smallpox. As of the 10th of this month, there have been 13 cases of the former and 115 cases of the latter. The statistics for these two diseases are likely only from the Epidemic Prevention Committee's own prevention and treatment efforts. Judging by the extent of the spread, the actual numbers are likely far greater. We know that both diseases are especially easily transmitted to young children. As far as this writer knows, more than one child in the neighborhood has already died from these two diseases. This phenomenon really needs attention.

However, these two diseases are only epidemic. As for tuberculosis and venereal diseases, those are even more so urban diseases. Recently, the Tuberculosis Prevention Association warned citizens to prevent tuberculosis and to raise funds to help treat it. This newspaper is also conducting free tuberculosis screenings, which is quite meaningful and forward-thinking.

The severity of urban diseases is naturally related to the population and living environment. Aside from venereal diseases, which are largely spread by the four thousand-plus prostitutes, the dense urban population, polluted air, unsuitable living conditions, and sewage problems are objective causes of tuberculosis and epidemic diseases. From the perspective of urban hygiene and national health, we are deeply concerned about these prevalent urban diseases.

However, when we shift our gaze from epidemic diseases to social urban diseases, we find that the latter's spread is even wider and its harm even more frightening. We feel that these social diseases need to be prevented and treated even more urgently than epidemic diseases.

These social epidemics are nothing other than unemployment, labor disputes, and unrest. The current unemployment situation is even more serious than last year. Businesses, shops, and organizations are all laying off employees, such as the recent closure of gold and silver shops and the dismissal of printing workers at the Zhonghua Book Company. As for labor disputes, since the decontrol of the cost of living, there have been many conflicts over discounts and base salaries. What is even more worrying are the social phenomena of strikes, marches, and other unrest. It is recently known that leaders from all walks of life in this city have formed a Social Security Promotion Association to seek social stability and solve unemployment and other problems. We hope they can truly begin their work and eradicate today's social urban diseases as soon as possible.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"Old Lu still wants to be a man, I can't swallow this!" Crippled Lu still shouted loudly without any reservations, "I've decided not to run! I don't want to lead people to run anymore! Whoever has the courage, please follow me! Let's go up and fight with the army, at least try to fight those dwarfs! It's better than dying dirty and miserably on the highway or in the train; it's cleaner!"

Lu's unexpected speech stirred almost everyone in the theater. More than half of them immediately raised their hands and shouted, "I'll follow you, Old Lu!" The rest were also eager to try, but hesitant about what they could do at the front.

"Everyone has their own will, Old Lu will never force anyone," Crippled Lu added.

"Very good, very good," Zhu Zhaonian nodded repeatedly. "The country has come to this point, and we can only fight on our own. After I send Feifei to Nandan, I might come back immediately and join you. I've always wanted to try the Japanese Type 38 rifle; maybe this is an opportunity!"

"That would be even better; we'll be waiting for you!" Crippled Lu and several young people shouted excitedly.

Old Zhu picked up the suitcase on the ground and looked again at the back of Crippled Lu, who was limping away. He felt very happy that this precocious young man, burdened with deep melancholy, had not lost his original spirit after all. But at the same time, he felt sad. Under such insufficient conditions, these young people, disregarding everything, turning back to fight, the result was predictable.

It was the movement of Feifei on his back that woke him up, finally making him lift his heavy steps and start walking out of the station. Several people wanted to see him off, but he declined them all.
