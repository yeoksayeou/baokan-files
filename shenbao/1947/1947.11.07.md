### List of Kuomintang Candidates Submitted to the Election Headquarters for Thorough Night Review; Committee Members of Election Offices Nominated by Political Parties to be Removed; Lists from the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party Still Awaiting Further Discussion

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Due to disagreements from the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party regarding the quota of National Assembly candidate lists nominated by political parties after review, further discussions are pending. The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee will hold a temporary meeting on the afternoon of the 7th to discuss this matter.

[Another Dispatch] The Kuomintang's list of National Assembly candidates nominated by political parties, totaling approximately one thousand names, was delivered to the Election Headquarters at 3:00 AM on the 6th. The Election Headquarters has been working diligently on reviewing and proofreading the list throughout the day. As of midnight, the work is still not completed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Zhang Lisheng told Central News Agency reporters on the evening of the 6th that the General Office is currently carefully considering the fact that many of the over ten thousand election committee members at all levels of election offices across the country have been nominated by political parties. According to election laws, these candidates are not allowed to participate in the election. Therefore, they should be removed in accordance with the review procedures. This work is expected to be completed by the 7th. Once the lists of candidates submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party are delivered to the Election Headquarters and reviewed, they will be announced together.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Rumors that the list of Kuomintang National Assembly candidates will be finalized by President Chiang are absolutely untrue. However, the list of Kuomintang comrades holding important military and political responsibilities at the central and local levels has been submitted by the Central Party Headquarters to the President for approval. It is heard that the President hopes that those comrades responsible for military and political affairs at the central and local levels, except for those who are necessary, will not participate in the National Assembly election so as to give way to other individuals.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Headquarters Committee, stated: The list nominated by the Kuomintang is based on the principle of "The world is for all; elect the virtuous and capable." It not only includes Kuomintang members but also recommends virtuous individuals from outside the party.

[Another Dispatch] The original quota of National Assembly candidates nominated by the China Youth Party was 300, and 209 have been approved after review. The original quota of the Democratic Socialist Party was 260, and currently, over 190 have been approved after review, which is far from what the two parties requested. On the morning of the 6th, Wu Tiecheng and Chen Lifu of the Kuomintang successively invited members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party to meet and handed over the reviewed lists. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party believed that the reviewed lists needed further consideration and handed the reviewed lists to their respective parties for discussion before making a decision. Xu Chuanlin and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party flew to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and immediately convened an emergency Central Standing Committee meeting. The meeting continued until 9:00 PM, and it was decided that Xu and Jiang would return to Nanjing on the morning of the 7th to further negotiate with Kuomintang representatives. The China Youth Party has also sent the original list back to the Kuomintang and proposed four points, hoping they can be addressed:  Important figures of the party should be included in the list.  Some of those listed as alternates should be changed to official candidates.  Some of those listed as elected in certain areas should be elected in other areas.  Some unimportant figures who have been nominated should be removed. The government is very concerned about this, as any changes to the China Youth Party's list will inevitably affect the Kuomintang's already decided list.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Control Yuan's morning discussion meeting on the 6th also touched upon the election issue. Some Control Yuan members believed that those who had previously held positions in the puppet regime should not be allowed to mingle among the various candidates. If found, they should be reported according to the law. This was made as a suggestion, and it was signed by over 20 Control Yuan members.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th] The list of National Assembly candidates from the interior of Gansu Province, with its unique customs, and the Tibetan areas was announced by the Provincial Election Office on the morning of the 6th. The former includes Yu Zhengxi, Wu Jiuru, Gu Xixian, Leng Faxiu, Ma Gelin, and Ma Fulin, while the latter includes Kong Jizhou, Suo Zangfo, Lei Zhaoxiang, and Yang Shenghua.

### Molotov Warns the United States that the Atomic Bomb Holds No Secrets; Claims the Soviet Union is Determined to Fight for Peace

[Report from our Agency] London, 6th Broadcast: Moscow News, Today marks the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech stating that the secrets of the atomic bomb no longer exist, and it is an illusion for the United States to try to exert influence through the atomic bomb. The audience erupted in cheers. Molotov also stated that what the Soviet Union values most is ensuring peace. Peace-loving people in all countries of the world can be sure that the Soviet Union will fight for peace to the end. He cited Stalin's conversation with Stettinius, in which the Soviet leader strongly argued that two different economic systems can cooperate and coexist peacefully. However, he said, "In our era, all roads lead to communism." Molotov also heavily criticized American imperialism and issued a subtle warning. He said that aggressive imperialism is the crisis of capitalism, and although it may not be easily noticed by the general public, it will eventually suffer the consequences as time goes on. Molotov then praised the Communist International Information Bureau established in the capital of Yugoslavia and hailed the success of the October Revolution, indicating that capitalism has approached its end. As for Molotov's claim that the secrets of the atomic bomb no longer exist, it is a new statement from Soviet leaders. Previously, the Soviet side often accused the United States of trying to monopolize the secrets of the atomic bomb.

[Report from our Agency] New York, 6th Broadcast: Lake Success News, Molotov's claim that the secrets of the atomic bomb no longer exist has caused speculation among representatives of various countries in the United Nations. Some believe that this statement is not new, while others believe that the United States is at least 15 years ahead of the Soviet Union in atomic bomb manufacturing. Molotov's speech is like a timid child walking through a graveyard, whistling loudly to embolden himself.

### Marshall Still Unwilling to Express U.S. Policy Toward China

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference on the 4th that he is considering the entire China issue, but reiterated his refusal to release the Wedemeyer Report. When asked why the report remains secret, Marshall replied that it was due to the reasons he had already announced. He said that he himself did not feel it was necessary to release it or publish everything he and the President had discussed. When asked if the final publication of the report would include a summary of the United States' ability to assist China, he said that he did not wish to comment on this. Marshall also refused to comment on whether China was included in the world development plan, such as the Marshall Plan. However, he said that he could not specify whether any aid to China was separate from other aid.

### Chairman Sends Special Telegram of Congratulations on Soviet Revolution Anniversary

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Diplomatic sources: November 7th is the anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution.

### The Board of Directors of the Four Banks Joint Administration Approves Increased Provincial Ordinary Agricultural Loans and Approves Many Loan Cases

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Four Banks Joint Administration held its 356th board meeting on the morning of the 6th, chaired by Zhang Qun. The following important cases were approved:  To assist in strengthening transportation, eight working capital loans were approved for the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, the Longhai Railway, the Capital Power Plant, and the Chongqing Public Bus Company.  To assist in enhancing industrial and mining production, over twenty working capital loans were approved, including loans for the Resources Commission to purchase Yunnan tin, the Guangdong Shunde Sugar Factory, the Shanghai Tianli Liquefied Gas Plant, the Qingdao Tongtai Rubber Factory, and the Sichuan Agricultural Manufacturing Company.  To purchase domestically produced cotton for various yarn factories in port areas, foreign exchange will be used to handle the transaction. The loans involve seven yarn factories, including Shanghai Gongyong, Dafeng, Dasheng, Shenxin, Xinhe, Yong'an, Qinghuang Xinhua, Wuxi Lixin, Chongqing Yu, and Changzhou Min.  To assist in the transport and sale of rice to stabilize food prices, seventeen loans for assessing goods in various areas of Sichuan and Huai were approved. In addition, ordinary agricultural loans for various provinces were increased due to the original quotas being insufficient. The provinces include Sui, Lu, Qian, Yu, Jin, Yi, Shan, Cha, Gan, Su, Gui, Yue, Min, Gan, Zhe, E, Xiang, Dian, Chuan, and Kang, totaling twenty provinces.

### Ministry of Finance Orders Banks and Treasuries to Pay Attention to the Use of Loans

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding Control Yuan member Li Shijun's suggestion to suspend commercial loans and to relax restrictions on industrial loans while strengthening auditing and supervision, the Ministry of Finance stated that "The main purpose of production loans provided by national banks and treasuries is to increase production, stabilize prices, facilitate the flow of goods, and promote exports. Therefore, loans have been granted to industries that produce and sell daily necessities, basic industries, export trade, and transportation services, in accordance with government economic policies and the actual needs of each industry. Ordinary commercial loans have already been suspended by various banks and treasuries. In addition, great importance is attached to the assessment of loan usage. In addition to the regular supervision by personnel from the lending banks and treasuries, the Four Banks Joint Administration also sends auditors to various regions to conduct confidential investigations to ensure that loans are used properly and effectively to aid production. In cases where a small number of loans do not comply with regulations, the lending banks and treasuries are notified to strictly rectify the situation or recover the loans. The use of borrowed funds by loan recipient companies to purchase raw materials cannot be without any impact on prices. However, it does not seem to be a fact that the influx of idle capital and the prevalence of speculation are caused by loans. The government has already paid attention to and implemented Control Yuan member Li's suggestions, and it will strictly order various banks and treasuries to comply with government policies and relevant regulations in the future."

### There are No Plans to Move Factories in the Northeast and North China Southward

The Executive Yuan Replies to the Shenyang Provisional Consultative Council

[Report from our Shenyang Office, 6th] The Shenyang Provisional Consultative Council sent a letter to the central government last month requesting that the plan to dismantle and transport production equipment in the Northeast and North China that cannot currently operate southward be stopped. The Executive Yuan specifically replied to the Shenyang Municipal Government to be forwarded to the Provisional Consultative Council, stating that "According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established industry and commerce guidance offices in Shenyang and Tianjin to promote the active production of operating factories in the private sector in the Northeast and North China and to resume operations as soon as possible for those that are not yet operating. There are no plans to move factories southward." It is understood that this may have been caused by a misunderstanding arising from the Resources Commission and other institutions' plans to move abandoned small motor machinery from here southward for use.

[Report from our Shenyang Office, 6th] Chen Cheng convened responsible persons from various Northeast industrial and mining units of the Resources Commission on the night of the 5th to discuss the current crisis in Northeast industry and mining. It is reported that many advocated stabilizing coal production first to ensure that thermal power generation and fuel are not lacking in order to revive industry and mining, followed by transportation and other sectors.

### The Philippines Refuses Entry to Compatriots from Taiwan, Enraging Overseas Chinese Groups; The Manila Daily Bulletin Publishes Absurd Theories Again

[Central News Agency, Manila, 5th] According to news from evening newspapers here, the Philippine government has rejected China's request to authorize the American consulate in Taiwan to issue passports to overseas Chinese from Taiwan who wish to enter the Philippines. According to the Philippine side, this is because, before the post-war status of the people of Taiwan is determined at the future Japanese peace treaty conference, the people of Taiwan, regardless of whether their ancestors were Chinese, are uniformly regarded as Japanese people. The evening newspaper hopes that the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue another denial statement. The Philippine government's suspicious attitude towards the people of Taiwan has angered overseas Chinese groups here and drawn sharp criticism from diplomatic observers. One diplomatic observer said: "If only the future Japanese peace treaty conference can determine the status of Taiwan, then the status of the Philippines also needs to be determined by the same conference, as both Taiwan and the Philippines were once under Japanese occupation."

[United Press, Manila, 6th] An editorial in the American-owned Manila Daily Bulletin today commented that the recent announcement by Chinese Premier Zhang Qun of his request to reclaim the Ryukyu Islands is a political test to gauge international trends. The Ryukyu Islands have no economic value to China, while the United States has sacrificed a considerable amount of money and lives. For the sake of fairness, not only should the Ryukyu Islands be administered by a United Nations agency, but so should Taiwan. (Reports from Taiwan's newspapers criticizing the absurd theories of the Manila Daily Bulletin are published in column three of page two.)

Government to Sell State-Owned Enterprises by Issuing Shares; Public Utilities Prices to be Adjusted According to Formulas

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The National Economic Council held its 22nd meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, chaired by Zhang Qun, and passed the following:

(A), Regarding the joint cotton yarn purchase plan, it was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs should draft trial measures and submit them for discussion at the next meeting.

(B), The State-Owned Enterprises Sales Supervision Committee drafted a method of selling state-owned enterprises by issuing shares, with banks organizing syndicates to raise funds. The method is as follows: The government may select several units of state-owned enterprises and designate national banks to invite banking, financial, industrial, and overseas Chinese businesses to form state-owned enterprise sale and private sector share subscription syndicates. A bank or two will be designated as the convening bank to plan new company organizations for each state-owned enterprise, handle the subscription and sales of new company shares, collect funds, and transfer them. The government should stipulate the sale price for each unit of state-owned enterprises, with the principle that each unit can independently form a new company. The syndicate should publicly raise funds to purchase the state-owned enterprises approved for sale at the price stipulated by the government, under the supervision of the State-Owned Enterprises Sales Supervision Committee. If national banks are invited to join as promoters of shares, the amount should not exceed 5% of the new company's funds. If the syndicate raises and pays the full amount of funds within the agreed time limit, it should immediately organize a new company, pay the purchase price to the government, and take over the business. If the syndicate fails to raise and pay the full amount of funds within the agreed time limit but is able to pay more than half of the purchase price, the government and the syndicate may jointly organize a new company, elect directors in accordance with the law, and transfer the business. The unpaid price will be temporarily regarded as the government's shares and will be sold continuously at market prices.

(C) There are eight formulas for calculating public utility prices, including formulas for electricity, tap water, gas, telephone, streetcar, small train, public bus, and ferry. In the future, public utility prices will be calculated entirely according to the formulas. If factors such as fuel, cost of living index, and foreign exchange rates change, adjustments will be made according to the formulas. Starting from January next year, each calculation formula can be used for the automatic adjustment of public utility prices. Local governments and competent authorities will also use these formulas as audit standards.

In addition, the bandit troops of Hu Ming, a local communist bandit in southern Anhui, numbering about 1,000 men with guns, sneaked to a place 20 li away from Datong Town yesterday.

### Clear Definition of News Reporter Status by Two Departments Within the Newspaper

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] The News Reporter Law has not been implemented on a regular basis since the National Government ordered its postponement in June of the 34th year of the Republic. Because vocational elections are imminent, the identity of reporters must be clearly defined to meet actual needs. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Interior Affairs have adopted the opinions of people from all walks of life and stipulated that anyone who works as a publisher, manager, writer, editor, cartoon editor, interviewer, broadcaster, broadcast commentator, photographer, or specially contracted correspondent who specializes in news, or who is in charge of publishing advertisements in a newspaper or news agency, should be regarded as a news reporter. It is also heard that this has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing.

### Ambassador Gu and Others Host Reporters to Review the Work of the United Nations General Assembly; Hope for Orderly Withdrawal of Troops from Korea by the United States and the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Ambassador Gu Weijun held a reception for Chinese reporters on the evening of the 5th. He said that one of the most important actions taken by the Political and Security Committee of the current United Nations General Assembly was the action on Korea. Ambassador Gu and Jiang Tingfu, Zhang Pengchun, Liu Kai, Zhu Shimin, and others who attended the reception jointly reviewed the work of the United Nations General Assembly to date and briefly described several of the more far-reaching issues that the United Nations has already addressed. Ambassador Gu discussed the resolution on the Korean issue passed by the General Assembly today and emphasized the importance of the Chinese amendment passed by the Political and Security Committee. He pointed out that the Chinese amendment would ensure that China would be consulted on the procedures for withdrawing US and Soviet troops from Korea before they are finalized. Gu stressed China's desire to achieve Korea's independence as soon as possible, and for Korea's benefit, China would also like to see the orderly withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea. China attaches importance to the orderly withdrawal of US and Soviet troops because Korea borders China's northeastern provinces. (Continued on column two of page two.)

### Communist Bandits Attacking Yulin are Wavering; National Army Captures Jia County in Western Henan Province; The Battle Situation in Jilin Has Entered the Stage of Clearing

[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 6th] Yulin News: Morale among the troops defending Yulin is increasing due to the arrival of reinforcements. The crack troops led by General Deng Baoshan himself arrived at a certain place 20 li from the city suburbs at 8:00 AM on the 6th and will soon join forces with the defending troops inside the city. The bandit army launched a fierce attack on the city walls all day long but did not succeed and suffered heavy losses due to continuous bombing by our air force. They are now showing signs of wavering.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 6th] A certain unit of the National Army launched a fierce attack on the Communist bandits entrenched in Jia County on the morning of the 6th. After a fierce battle, the bandits were defeated and abandoned the city, fleeing south. Jia County has been recovered. (Another dispatch from Luoyang, 6th) After the Communist bandits attacking Dengfeng were defeated, they withdrew to Gaocheng (southeast of Dengfeng) on the 5th. They were intercepted by the National Army and continued to flee southeast.

[Report from our Xi'an Office, 6th] The war situation in western Henan has taken a sharp turn for the better, according to even the most optimistic observers. It is hoped that the eastern and western forces can join forces within ten days or even a week to open up the area along the Longhai Railway. In order to cooperate with the military progress, the Longhai Railway Bureau has stepped up efforts to restore the tracks. Director Mo Heng flew back to Xi'an from Zhengzhou this afternoon to urge the repair work from the west.

[Report from our Zhejiang Office, 6th] The Communist offensive in the Northeast is showing signs of moving towards southern Liaoning. According to reports from various sources, the bandits are transferring the main force of the Fourth Column to southern Liaoning, moving it from Qingyuan to Qinghe City, 50 kilometers northeast of Benxi, and Xiaoshi, 25 kilometers southeast. Another unit is also gathering, attempting to attack Benxi, an important industrial and mining city.

[Another Dispatch] Another target of the bandits in southern Liaoning is Anshan, a city known for its steel smelting. More than 2,000 bandits were found in Yingtaoyuan, southeast of Wushan. The Eighth Column is approaching the outskirts of Anshan. According to the confessions of captured bandit scouts, the bandits plan to thoroughly destroy the communications between Anshan and Liaoyang to isolate and paralyze Anshan.

[Report from our Changchun Office, 6th] The remnants who besieged Jilin continue to reorganize in the Jilin area and may launch another fierce attack on Jilin and Xiaofengman in the short term. It is reported that Wu has transported more than 30 tanks and is gathering them five or six kilometers outside the suburbs, generally showing that Wu's ambitions have not died. Bandit troops are also gathering in Changnan, but they dare not disturb Changnan. The Second Division of Wu, which was defeated by the National Army in Fanjiatun, has now fled into Gongzhuling.

[Another Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo met with the press in Changchun today and said that the bandits may launch another large-scale harassment in early December, with Jilin being particularly hard to forget. Siping and even western Liaoning are also possible targets, but the National Army is already deployed and the bandits will find it difficult to succeed. Zheng expressed extreme optimism about the future of the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The battle situation in Jilin has entered the stage of clearing. After defeating the attacking Wu troops, the National Army defending Jilin is now launching an attack in several directions with a part of its force to search for and capture the remnant bandits in the suburbs. One unit is advancing westward beyond Hada Bay, heading straight for Jiuzhan, while another unit is heading south, capturing Liangbanshan, Sanjiazi, and other places. In addition, scattered bandit groups around Changchun, fearing the National Army's surprise capture, began to retreat and flee on the 5th and 6th.

Editorial

### On the Matter of Compiling the National Budget for the Coming Year

The Shanghai Municipal Government's draft budget for the 37th year of the Republic, concerning total revenue and expenditure, has recently been largely approved by the Municipal Council and will be submitted to the Central Government for verification. This brings to mind the annual national budget for revenue and expenditure, which will soon undergo the stages of compilation, review, and approval. In today's era of rapid currency inflation and soaring prices, even a single family or business cannot accurately estimate expenses for six months or even three months. How can the nation, with its immense tasks in military affairs, politics, economics, education, construction, transportation, and other sectors, possibly plan for a year using legal tender figures? Compilers, reviewers, and approvers undoubtedly find it a headache, and even for us who want to evaluate the massive figures, it only feels troublesome and impractical!

A director of a tax collection agency often feels self-satisfied when this year's tax revenue exceeds the budget. A director of a business agency often uses the excuse that the budget is insufficient to complete the work and tries to evade responsibility. When we evaluate the performance of the above two agencies with the factors of currency inflation and soaring prices in mind, we feel that the excess of tax revenue over the budget is not due to the director's efforts to rectify things, but rather the result of rising prices. The failure to complete the business should not be attributed to the insufficiency of the budget, but should be blamed on the organizer's lack of foresight. In the past, there were many examples of construction projects being constrained by the budget and ultimately abandoned halfway. This is not only a huge waste of funds but, more importantly, an irreplaceable loss of time. According to the current system, for all expenditure departments, items not included in the budget, or those included but exceeding the budgeted amount, regardless of how important the business is or how urgent the work is, the auditing agency will not reimburse them. Even during the progress of the business, due to the delay of the auditing agency, the short-term estimate cannot be suitable in the face of drastic price fluctuations, let alone larger construction projects which cannot be completed in the short term.

Therefore, today, if we want to advance the undertakings of various departments, we must re-examine the system of compiling estimates using legal tender figures. This is not to say that we do not need a budget. On the contrary, we really need a budget, a practical and feasible budget. We want to use the budget to urge the completion of the business, not to hinder its progress. Based on this argument, we would like to offer an opinion, advocating for a budget based on work units instead of legal tender units. For example, if the Ministry of Transportation wants to build a thousand kilometers of railway in the 37th year, the budget should list the number of sleepers, the number of rails, the amount of labor required, the time required, the source of sleepers and rails, and the transportation situation. If the quantity of materials used is within the budget and the project is completed on schedule, then it can be accepted without questioning the amount of legal tender spent. If the auditing agency insists on having legal tender figures and proof that the expenditure is real, it can review the vouchers for the purchase of materials and the monthly cost of living index for workers after the fact. If the budget is made with legal tender as the unit, it will be impossible to complete it even with monthly additions. What we should pay particular attention to now is that during this period of turmoil, the military expenditure for suppressing bandits and the relief for the recovered areas will be enormous and impossible to estimate. The soldiers' provisions, the replenishment of military supplies, the relief of the old and weak, the resettlement of refugees, the reconstruction of ruins, and the management of fields cannot have accurate budgets in advance. In the process, all expenses will increase daily. Should this major event, which concerns the survival of the nation, be abandoned or be left unfinished because of budget issues? Before the bandit scourge is quelled, all construction is in vain. Why not concentrate all efforts to complete the work of quelling the turmoil first? No matter what the cost, it should be spared!

Should the national budget be based on income or expenditure? When a country is at war, it is certainly impossible to base it on income. It is common practice for wartime countries to balance expenditure with income. The only remedy is not to issue actual goods, but most of it is still within the scope of legal tender. Even if taxes are levied on value, the increase in tax revenue is the same due to the high prices, but it cannot be proportional to the expenditure. Therefore, it is common practice for wartime countries to have unbalanced income and expenditure. The only remedy is to issue domestic bonds or to organize foreign debts. This remedy is certainly under consideration by the government -- or perhaps it is already in progress. We hope that those in charge of financial affairs will have great courage to carry out this work, and not be deterred by the huge legal tender deficit, or even cause the businesses of various departments to stagnate.

### Yang Zhaolong's Report

After the reports, Yang Zhaolong, Director of the Criminal Division of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, reported on his overseas judicial inspection, stating briefly: He was sent abroad last year to inspect and represent the Chinese government at the Fifth Congress of the International Association of Criminal Law, the International Conference on the Unification of Criminal Law, and the Research Committee on International Crimes, etc. He spent ten months traveling to advanced Western judicial countries such as England, the United States, and Europe, and paid attention to their judicial administrative organization and work, the changes and reforms of the legal system, the trends of legislative principles, and the conditions of prisons. Judicial administration in England and the United States is seeking to establish a systematic organization, while various European countries are striving to improve the integrity of judicial organization and work according to the development of world legal issues, such as the increasing importance of foreign-related events, juvenile crime, and rehabilitation education. In terms of the legal system, the United States has not undergone major reforms, while England and various European countries have undergone significant changes due to wartime and post-war needs. The reactionary content in the German, Italian, and French codes has been cleared. France and Belgium are revising the main codes. In addition, the powers of prosecutors have been expanded. As for the legislation of various countries in recent years, in addition to focusing on internationality, they mostly tend to reduce imprisonment and promote rehabilitation education. France's handling of juvenile offenders is the most reasonable, and its vocational schools have no prison atmosphere at all, which is very effective in improving criminals. Yang believes that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, many new problems have arisen in China's judicial system, such as civil and criminal cases involving foreign countries and prison difficulties, etc., which all rely on colleagues to solve based on practical experience and novel theories.

### Ambassador Gu and Others Host Reporters

(Continued from page 1) Jiang Tingfu also expressed his opinion on this point, believing that if the United Nations can handle the Korean issue in a fair manner and assist Korea in achieving true independence, then Korea will become the Scandinavian Peninsula of the Far East; otherwise, Korea will become the Balkans of the Far East. Reporters asked that if some member countries carry out threats of refusing to participate, then what will happen to the proposed committees on Greece and Korea and the proposed small General Assembly? Gu admitted that if some member countries do not participate in these mechanisms, it will hinder the work of these three bodies. However, although this kind of action is regrettable, the United Nations will implement its resolutions, and the United Nations cannot shirk its responsibility because one or two member countries refuse to participate. The Ambassador stated that the United Nations' handling of the small General Assembly, the Greek issue, and the Korean issue has strengthened the power of the General Assembly. As for Palestine, he believes that the most difficult issues are: how to implement the partition plan; and how to maintain local security after the withdrawal of British troops. Jiang Tingfu then clarified China's position on Palestine, that China does not oppose the partition of Palestine, but opposes the forced implementation of partition. Zhang Pengchun, who represents China at the Social, Charity, and Cultural Committee, said that the Economic and Social Council can prepare to deal with urgent economic and social issues starting next year. Liu Kai, who represents China at the Trusteeship Committee and the Legal Committee, said that the General Assembly exerted pressure on issues involving the welfare of people in non-self-governing territories and mandated areas during this meeting. When discussing the work of the Legal Committee, Liu mentioned China's active role in the development and compilation of international law.

### Zhang Yongchong, Speaker of the Jurong County Council, Assassinated in an Ambush

### Taiwanese Newspapers Criticize Philippine Newspaper's Fallacies, We Must Insist on Returning Ryukyu

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] Two newspapers here today published articles, both criticizing the remarks of the Manila Gazette with an intolerable attitude. The Quanmin Daily published an editorial entitled "A Serious Warning to the Philippines," stating: "The Philippines may have difficulties in opposing the return of Ryukyu to China, so it mentioned Taiwan as a bargaining chip, hoping that China would give up Ryukyu in order to maintain Taiwan. However, Taiwan is Chinese territory, which was occupied by Japan 53 years ago. Even without the decision of the Cairo Conference, China should immediately recover Taiwan after Japan's defeat two years ago, which is a matter of course." The privately-run Gonglun Daily believes that Taiwan is a part of China and should not be discussed by anyone. The newspaper said: "Regarding the proposal to determine the political status of Taiwan by means of national self-determination, what we feel is a kind of insulted anger and provocative earsplitting. Taiwan is not an adopted child, but is connected with its motherland by blood and flesh. Its position in the Chinese family is determined by nature. Now that it has fortunately returned to the embrace of the motherland, what else needs to be decided? How should it be determined?" As for the issue of returning Ryukyu to China, both of the above newspapers believe that China must insist on this claim. The Quanmin Daily also stated: "China's attitude towards the peace treaty is more lenient than that of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union advocates that it should only be discussed by the four powers, while China advocates that countries related to Japan should participate in the discussion, so that the Philippines can also participate in the conference in the future. However, the Philippines treats China without any friendship, which makes us feel infinitely indignant."

### Wang Maogong Points Out the Hidden Worries in Southern Jiangsu, Self-Defense Forces Should Be Strengthened

[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th] Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government reported at a press conference today that after inspecting the self-defense forces of Liyang, Yixing, and Wujin counties through Xuequanqiao to Wuxi, he directly pointed out that the shortcomings exposed by the self-defense forces in the above counties due to funding difficulties, lack of equipment and ammunition, and poor personnel management urgently need to be improved. He continued to say that there are three hidden worries in the counties of Southern Jiangsu: The people's understanding of the cruelty of the communists is still insufficient, so they fear the bandits more than they fear the law, and many communicate with the bandits and harbor them out of fear; Good people and bad people cannot be elected as village chiefs; Some local people still hold the mentality of getting by and being safe, so that in Yixing, with a population of 800,000, only one or two hundred scattered bandits are harassing it, which makes some local forces fear the bandits and not know how to resist them. In Wujin and Wuxi, with a population of more than two million, there are only a few hundred scattered bandits in the territory, but the public security problems in the rural areas of these two counties are still very serious. These are not the phenomena that should exist during the period of suppressing chaos and saving the country. It is hoped that the press will awaken the gentry and promote the officials to accelerate the strengthening of self-defense forces to ensure the public security in the north and south of the Yangtze River in the province.

### There Is Another Turning Point in the Export of Tung Oil to the United States, Becoming a Major Product of the Paint Industry

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] According to the New York Herald Tribune, tung oil has now become the "main product" of the paint industry because its selling price is lower than that of linseed oil and castor oil, and it can be mixed with other paint raw materials. The main points of the report are as follows: Due to the continuous changes in the oils used in paint additives, the paint industry here has a trend to resume importing Chinese tung oil. Due to the invention of suitable manufacturing technology, tung oil has restored its important position in paints.

### Conference of Four Foreign Ministers Begins to Discuss Treaties with Germany and Austria; Marshall to Arrive in England on the 20th of This Month

[Reuters, London, 6th] The British Foreign Office announced that the conference of the representatives of the four major powers to discuss the German issue is scheduled to open in London at 3:40 PM standard time on the 6th. The main items on the agenda are to discuss the procedures for the peace treaty with Germany, the political institutions of Germany, and the organization to protect United Nations nationals in Germany.

[Associated Press, London, 6th] Representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union began their work today in a pessimistic atmosphere, seeking an agreement on the future of Germany and Austria. The opinions of the four countries differ greatly on what steps should be taken to give Germany and Austria a place in the revival of Europe. According to usually reliable sources, the United States has already drafted a plan that can be formally submitted after the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the 26th of this month reaches a deadlock. This plan is tantamount to a separate peace treaty with the part of Germany outside the Soviet occupation zone. Although Britain is unwilling to actively support the US proposal, it seems very willing to act as a mediator between the US and the Soviet Union. France's position is still unclear. According to official spokespersons, France will oppose the establishment of a strong central government in Germany, advocating a relaxed federal system and insisting on international co-management of the Ruhr industrial area. However, the main issue hinges on the attitude of the Soviet Union. It is widely believed that in order to avoid deepening the rift with Western countries, the Soviet Union may reduce its demands for reparations from Germany's current production and suggest the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces. If this happens, the United States is reportedly planning to propose a counter-proposal, demanding the simultaneous establishment of a centralized government, granting it considerable power to avoid being controlled by an organized minority, and promoting the economic unification of Germany, so that it can have the hope of a balanced budget within a few years.

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall revealed at a press conference that he is scheduled to fly to London on November 20 to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. He will go to London four days before the meeting in order to discuss with the foreign minister representatives in advance to hear the latest opinions on various issues. He also stated that he will do his best to lay a sound foundation for the solution of the German and Austrian issues. When asked by reporters whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, he replied in a military tone that he could not allow himself to be pessimistic while the battle was still in progress. When asked if Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov might not attend, Marshall replied that he had no idea how the Soviet Union would respond.

### Marshall Plan for European Aid to be Submitted to Congress Next Monday; Truman to Request Priority Discussion

[Our Report] New York, 6th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman told reporters today that he will ask Congress to first discuss the urgent issue of European aid and then discuss the issues of prices and inflation. According to reliable sources, Republican leader Martin, the Speaker of the House, will take the same stand as Truman and oppose tax cuts.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters today that several key points of the European aid plan are still pending decision and are currently being studied day and night by officials in charge of the State Department. In any case, the full draft should be completed by next Monday and prepared for submission to the Congressional Committee for discussion. Its contents are not convenient to be disclosed piecemeal. It is also not convenient to comment at this time on how the United States will respond to Italy's recent emergency appeal for immediate aid of $100 million.

### Taber Plays a Decisive Role

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] The US government is deeply concerned that the passage of the Marshall Plan will be delayed due to the activities of Taber, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and has already begun to feel uneasy. Since any program requiring appropriations must start in the House, Taber and his committee are tantamount to managing America's "purse." Although Taber will not flatly oppose the Marshall Plan, he will adopt the principle of "saving where possible" and constantly try to eliminate traces of bureaucracy.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The House Foreign Aid Committee held two secret meetings yesterday to discuss the agenda of the special session of Congress, but no decision was made. After the second meeting, Vice Chairman Hoadley said that considerable progress had been made and that an agreement was expected by Thursday or Friday. However, other committee members said that the committee had differing views on the following two key points: Who should be aided, and what restrictions should be placed on the aid; Who should be in charge of the aid affairs. They also said that the committee had almost abandoned the long-term aid plan and was focusing on temporary emergency relief measures, while also instructing the Department of the Army to immediately assist Germany in becoming economically and industrially self-sufficient. Some committee members advocated that temporary aid should be limited to France and Italy and may be extended to the Netherlands and Britain.

### Bridges Visits Bevin

[Reuters, London, 5th] Bridges, the chairman of the US Senate Appropriations Committee, and members of the committee visited British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the British Foreign Office today and are expected to have reviewed the general economic situation in Britain. The Appropriations Committee is conducting a fact-finding inspection in Europe.

### Byrnes Calls for Aid to China and Advocates American Tolerance of the Soviet Union

### New York Governor Dewey Criticizes the Government for Discriminating Against China, Saying European Aid Should be Commercial

[Associated Press, New York, 5th] New York Governor Dewey attacked the Truman administration on the 4th, accusing it of "making economic and diplomatic mistakes" and "discriminating against our Chinese allies." He said that the US government had wasted $20 billion on foreign aid in the past two and a half years. However, he also said that the United States had no other way to go except to aid Europe, but that this aid must be based on a commercial standpoint and genuine bipartisan cooperation. He said: The sixteen countries participating in the Paris Conference should submit detailed reports, not just vague outlines; European aid is a commercial matter and a special agency should be established to supervise it, chaired by a senior businessman; Aid funds should be lent in installments, depending on whether the countries can use them well; Loans to prevent famine in Europe should not be repaid in US dollars, because "we know that Europe cannot repay us with sufficient exports"; Congress should issue a policy statement to avoid misunderstandings, so that even people in the Kremlin do not misunderstand our purpose.

### Byrnes Calls for Aid to China and Advocates American Tolerance of the Soviet Union

[US News Service, Winston-Salem, 5th] Byrnes said in a speech today that US foreign aid should not be limited to Europe, but should also include China and Korea, and should be extended with a generous spirit, but without harming the US economy itself.

[Associated Press, Winston-Salem, 5th] Former US Secretary of State Byrnes addressed the General Convention of the Episcopal Church here on the 4th, calling for tolerance towards the Soviet Union. He said: He was extremely anxious about the morbidities and mistakes of the Soviet Union resulting from the results of the two world wars, which caused it to sometimes develop a psychological state similar to hysteria. He said; Soviet leaders are adopting aggressive policies and are hostile to world peace and the principles of the United Nations, but the United States should act as the defender of the law and should not compete with the Soviet Union for world hegemony. I wish to live in peace, I wish to treat the Soviet Union fairly, so I call for American tolerance.

### French Confederation of Labor Launches Offensive, Resolutely Opposing Government Economic Measures; Soviet Union Opposes Government Economic Measures

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] Despite the opposition of the communist-led General Confederation of Labor, the French government resolutely implemented new economic measures today.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] Well-informed sources say: The Soviet Union has agreed to exchange 200,000 tons of wheat and 100,000 tons of other grains with France for manufactured goods. This proposal is being considered by France.

### Wave of Strikes in France and Italy

### The UN General Assembly May End in a Month; The "Little Assembly" Proposal Will Be Submitted for a Vote; The Soviet Union Adopts a Non-Cooperative Attitude on Various Important Issues

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] It was learned today that the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly will soon put the US-proposed "Little Assembly" to a vote. At the same time, Soviet representative Vyshinsky once again criticized the proposal as "illegal," claiming that the Soviet Union would find it difficult to participate once the "Little Assembly" was established. The Soviet Union and Poland previously refused to participate in the Balkan Border Observation Group, and Ukraine yesterday refused to participate in the Korean Committee. The Soviet Union's adoption of a non-cooperative policy to resist the various key proposals of the United States that it cannot veto, and doing this for the third time, is tantamount to using veto power in another way, and is not limited to the Security Council. What impact this will have on the future of the United Nations institutions is quite questionable. After the Political Committee concludes the debate on the Little Assembly proposal, the biggest obstacle has been overcome. The remaining cases, such as the veto power, the Franco government case, the amendment of the peace treaty with Italy, and the re-examination of Italy's application for membership, may be transferred to the future Little Assembly for discussion, or even temporarily shelved. Therefore, there is great hope that the session will be adjourned before the 27th of this month.

### Ahn Jae-hong of Korea Explains the Nature of Military Government Rule

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 6th] Ahn Jae-hong, the Civil Administrator of South Korea, issued a special statement yesterday (5th) stating: On the 3rd of this month, representatives of fifteen right-wing political parties, including the Korean Democratic Party, the Korean Independence Party, the Independence Promotion Association, and the Korean Democratic Party, inquired of me and questioned the "conspiracy to extend military government rebellion" as published in the left-wing newspapers. I immediately replied, "The political affairs council did indeed discuss the current situation and decided on the attitude towards international politics and South Korean politics." The handling of South Korea's economic problems, the issue of large landowners, and the nature of military government were all discussed, but there was no conspiracy to rebel or demand the extension of military government. Many people confuse "governing power" with "sovereignty." The sovereignty of Korea belongs to the Korean people, and it is only temporarily governed by the American "military government."

Opposition leader Churchill exclaimed, "We cannot accept responsibility for this bill." Mr. Churchill said that he was going to detail the history of Burma as Mr. Attlee did, but just a few strong questions would suffice. "[Burmese leaders who have met with the Prime Minister today have either been assassinated or are awaiting trial for assassination. The best among them are Aung San and U Saw. Aung San surrendered to Japan and organized an army to help Japan fight. U Saw is on trial for the murder of Aung San."

It is not clear what steps Siam will take after rejecting the committee's recommendation.

### Korean Independence Proposal: Full Text; Nine Nations Including China, India, and Australia to Organize Oversight Committee; to be Submitted to the General Assembly for Final Vote Next Week

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 5th] The resolution on Korean independence, amended by China, the Philippines, and India and passed by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, may be put to a final vote by the General Assembly next week. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

The United Nations General Assembly recognizes the urgent and legitimate desire of the Korean people for independence, believes that the independence of the Korean nation should be restored, and that the occupying forces should withdraw as quickly as possible thereafter. The General Assembly's previous resolution stated that the freedom and independence of the Korean people cannot be justly resolved without the participation of their representatives, and decided to establish a United Nations Temporary Commission to facilitate the participation of Korean civilian representatives. Therefore, the following further decisions are made: It is decided that the representative countries shall be composed of nine countries: China, Australia, Canada, France, India, the Philippines, El Salvador, Syria, and Ukraine. The election should be held no later than the end of March 1948, based on universal adult suffrage and by secret ballot, to elect representatives. The UN delegation will consult with these representatives to expedite the freedom and independence of Korea. At the same time, these representatives will form a parliament to establish a national Korean government. The number of representatives in each electoral district should be calculated in proportion to the population, and the election should be conducted under the supervision of the UN delegation. Once the election is over, the parliament should be convened immediately to form a unified government, and the UN delegation should be notified of this matter. After the establishment of the national government, it should immediately consult with the UN delegation on the following matters: (A) Organizing domestic security forces and disbanding all military or paramilitary organizations; (B) The South Korean and North Korean military and political authorities taking over administrative power; (C) Arranging for the complete withdrawal of the occupying forces as soon as possible within the possible scope, to be implemented within ninety days. The UN delegation should facilitate and accelerate the implementation of the above plan to achieve Korean national independence and the withdrawal of the occupying forces, taking into account the results of its observations and consultations in Korea. The delegation should report the results to the General Assembly or consult with the Temporary Committee on the implementation situation (whether or not the Temporary Committee is established is undetermined). It calls upon all related countries to provide all assistance and convenience in the performance of its duties by the delegation. It calls upon all member states of the United Nations not to interfere in Korea's internal affairs during the transition period to independence, unless it is to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly, nor to take any and all actions that would undermine Korea's independence and sovereignty.

### Launching a Campaign to Stop Spitting: City Police Take the Lead, Committees from All Sectors Actively Promote

(This newspaper report) In view of the bad habit of spitting among Chinese people, which is not only unsightly but also easily spreads tuberculosis, Lu Meiseng, president of the Public Welfare Advancement Society, yesterday at the Bankers Club, together with representatives from 12 organizations including the Municipal Government Health Bureau, Education Bureau, Police Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, Men's and Women's Youth Associations, Rotary Club, United Youth Society, Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee, and the United Nations World Health Organization, launched a "Campaign to Stop Spitting" and established a "Campaign to Stop Spitting Committee."

During the meeting, Director Zhang Wei reported that a medical research institute had collected more than 2,000 sputum samples in Shanghai several years ago and analyzed them. Among them, 16 percent contained tuberculosis bacilli. These bacilli can survive for as long as 48 days in damp places and can spread through the air. Currently, about 160,000 people die from tuberculosis in Shanghai every year. Therefore, this "Campaign to Stop Spitting" is the most important task of the anti-tuberculosis campaign. Director Yu Shuping added that the Shanghai police regulations are the same as those in New York, London, and Hong Kong. Any citizen who spits indiscriminately in public places will be fined 20 yuan or detained. The fine should be calculated at 2,000 times, and each spitting incident should be fined 40,000 yuan. In order to lead by example, the police bureau will start by banning police officers from spitting indiscriminately within a month. Director Li Ximou also promised to eliminate the bad habit of spitting in the education sector in the shortest possible time. Afterwards, the methods for preventing spitting, publicity, and fundraising were discussed. It is hoped that all organizations in the city will enthusiastically participate and support the campaign, starting with publicity and education, and then gradually enforcing it by the police bureau. Subsequently, Lu Meiseng and Xuan Ping were elected as president and vice president, respectively. The required operating expenses will be advanced by Xinhua and Jincheng, each providing 10 million yuan.

[This newspaper report] Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the General Labor Union, Zhang Zhusan, director, and others visited Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday morning, asking for improvements to the method of rationing goods to workers. Director Wu replied one by one: In the future, the factory should be responsible for compensating workers for the losses incurred due to the factory's failure to apply for rations. Workers have no right to demand goods from the factory for items that the Social Affairs Bureau has not rationed. Mobile workers, such as rickshaw pullers and dock workers, cannot be rationed goods according to the union's roster and must be sold based on their national identity cards. The roster reported by the union cannot be used as proof. The number of mobile workers each month should be the responsibility of the employers.

### Ban on Dancing to be Decided Today: First Crackdown on Tea Room Dancing, to be Banned by the End of September Next Year

[This newspaper report] Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai from Beiping yesterday and will personally preside over the municipal meeting this morning. A decision will be made at the meeting on the implementation measures for the ban on dancing in this city. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the proposed measures are: the ban on dancing in this city is planned to be implemented in three phases. The first step is to ban tea room dancing from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. (except Sundays), and then ban tea dancing. In March next year, a lottery will be drawn to eliminate commercial dance halls, and they will be banned by the end of September. Most bars in this city have bands and bar girls to dance with customers, but their business licenses are for the wine, food, and coffee industry, not the dance hall industry. The Changju is paying attention to this and has investigated clearly, and this kind of disguised dance hall will also be banned. The implementation measures will be discussed and decided today, and the crackdown on tea room dancing will be implemented first next week.

Regarding the re-employment of dance hall employees and dancers, Director Wu believes that marriage is the best way out for dancers. He also believes that the banned dance halls should plan to convert to economic cafeterias to maintain the livelihood of the employees. However, this cannot be done without sufficient preparation, and the existing equipment needs to be modified. The authorities are not ordering all dance halls to be converted into economic cafeterias. If the boss has a way to maintain the livelihood of the employees, they can be converted into shopping malls, etc.

### Failure to Prevent Known Dangers: District Prosecutor's Office Files Public Prosecution Against Zhang Chunfan for Instigating Suicide

[This newspaper report] After Yue opera star Xiao Danggui committed suicide by taking poison, Zhang Chunfan, manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, was accused of instigating suicide. Yesterday morning, the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. The original text of the indictment stated: "Defendant Zhang Chunfan, 41 years old, from Sheng County, residing at No. 11 Songjia Lane, Beijing Road, in custody. The victim, Qian Chunyun, known as Xiao Danggui, had been living with the defendant Zhang Chunfan for many years. At 11 p.m. on October 7 of this year, Qian Chunyun and Jin Zhaoyuan (i.e., Lengshan) returned from a night out, and were discovered by the defendant, who suspected them of having an affair. He questioned her day and night, and Qian had no way to defend herself, so she indicated her intention to commit suicide. The defendant knew her feelings, and not only did he not take precautions, but he also kept nagging and did not give in, causing Qian Chunyun to take Lysol and commit suicide at about 4 p.m. on the 13th of the same month. After the incident, various newspapers competed to publish the news, and rumors arose. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau arrested the defendant for interrogation and sent him to the prosecutor's office. During the interrogation, the defendant firmly denied instigating Qian Chunyun's suicide. However, Qian had stated before her death that if her body was unclean, she could commit suicide. When the defendant summoned Jin Zhaoyuan for questioning, he also said to Jin, 'If Xiao Danggui commits suicide, it is because of you,' etc. Jin Zhaoyuan and Wu Chen, who were present at the scene, unanimously confirmed that this was true, as evidenced by the interrogation records of the police bureau and this office. It is undoubtedly true that Qian Chunyun's suicide was foreseen by the defendant, since she had indicated her intention to commit suicide and the defendant had relayed it to Jin Zhaoyuan. Anyone who causes the danger of a certain result occurring due to his own actions has the obligation to prevent its occurrence, as stipulated in Article 15, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Since the defendant knew that Qian Chunyun was in danger of committing suicide and did not take precautions, his passive inaction was no different from actively instigating others to commit suicide. Moreover, after reading the original police bureau files in detail, the defendant's anger had not subsided until Qian Chunyun committed suicide, and his nagging was not without suspicion of instigating Qian Chunyun's suicide. His actions constitute a crime under Article 275, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."

### Resolution of Caobao Road Right of Way: Each Allocated Two Vehicles to Operate

[This newspaper report] Caobao Road in West Shanghai was applied for opening by the Shanghai-Minhang Transportation Automobile Company before the war and approved by the Municipal Government. After the victory, local people organized the Caobao Road Transportation Committee and leased four group buses from the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company to operate back and forth to maintain traffic.

### Yu Shengxiao Murder Case: Retrial on the 13th, but Lee

The US Military Court Judgment Not Borrowed

[This newspaper report] British suspect Lee in the murder of black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao.

The District Court believes that the evidence is already sufficient, and the judgment seems to be of little importance, so it has given up on borrowing it.

### Qiu Lianhuan Assassination Case Continues: Five Defendants, "Hercules," Get Anxious and Call the Judge "Brother," Saying He is Restless in Prison and Wants to be Transferred to the Detention Center

[This newspaper report] The Qiu Lianhuan assassination case continued in the Criminal Court 9 of the District Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Cao Zuwei. The defendants Wei Xiaoyang, Li Desheng, Ma Caide, Ye Dongying, and Chai Liangjiang were escorted to the court by bailiffs. Qiu's wife also sat in the audience to listen to the confessions of the defendants. The first to testify was Zhou Bingquan, the accountant of the Zhijiang Bathhouse, followed by Wang Abao, the tea servant of the Zhijiang Tea House, and Wu Zhishun, the tea servant of the Paradise Theater. Then, the separate interrogation of the defendants began. Wei Xiaoyang, known as "Oriental Hercules," wearing a dark blue gown, stated in the defendant's stand: He does not have the nickname "Oriental Hercules" and did not participate in the murder. This matter was framed by Li Zhenyu, an inspector of the 6th Inspection Brigade of the Police Department, because he wanted to see a white show and was refused by me. Please investigate this. Judge Cao questioned him, saying that the evidence of your plan to kill Qiu is conclusive. Why don't you confess truthfully? "Hercules" became so anxious that he blurted out to the court: "Brother, I am really wronged. If you don't believe me, just investigate." The audience was in an uproar when they heard Wei call the judge "Brother." Wei's defender stood up and requested that Li Zhenjin, who is currently in custody for another case, be subpoenaed to the court for cross-examination at the next hearing. The court ordered that a decision be made after verification. Next, Li Desheng was summoned. He testified that he only knew Wei Xiaoyang and did not know the other defendants. He did not participate in the murder. "I am really wronged." In prison, I only talked with Sheng Shugen, nicknamed, and did not quarrel with him. "On the evening of June 5, I took a bath in the bathhouse and then talked in the South." Someone at the Fang Theater told me that Wei Xing and my wife had been arrested by the police. I went to the branch office to inquire, but they replied that they did not know. I went back to the theater to work. At about 12 o'clock, the theater closed, and people in the theater said that Wei was related to the Qiu Shuhuan murder case and advised me to hide. Since I didn't know about this, why should I hide? So I went to the General Bureau on Fourth Road to inquire about the whereabouts of my wife, but I was also detained. Li Caide also denied participating in the murder. He did not quarrel in prison. He only knew that Mao Qingyun often caused trouble inside. Chai Liangjiang testified: He is 25 years old this year. He was listening to the theater in the Paradise Theater that day and did not return home until 12 o'clock. How could he know about the Qiu case? At this point, the court ordered that the defendants in this case did not follow the rules in prison. In addition to transferring them to the Masnan Road Detention Center for separate detention, each of their detention periods was extended by three months. The case was rescheduled for retrial. After the court adjourned, reporters asked Qiu's wife, Chen Aizhu, about her thoughts. Chen, wearing a gray woolen coat, with permed hair and powder, looked quite modern, and said that Qiu and Zhang Xingbao had a feud. Once, Qiu, Zhang, and Sheng Shugen were having a tea talk at Chen's home. Because Sheng Shugen sided with Zhang Xingbao, Qiu intended to use force, and Zhang knelt down to beg for peace before the matter was resolved. At this point, Chen said in a rather sad and indignant tone: "If I had known this would happen, I would rather have let Qiu injure Sheng and the others and face a lawsuit. Now, sitting in jail, he wouldn't have been hacked to death."

### Investigation Completed on the Case of Former Judge Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court Being Shot; Xia Chao and Two Others Indicted Under the Anti-Traitor Ordinance

[Report from this Newspaper] During the War of Resistance, Yu Hua, the judge of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, was fatally shot by the puppet agent Xia Chao. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, Xia Chao, Xia Zhang, and Zhang Chuntang have been publicly prosecuted under the Ordinance for Punishing Traitors. It is reported that Judge Yu was upright and impartial during his tenure, and he dealt severely with the crimes committed by members of the puppet organization in the former concessions. As a result, the puppet organization hated him intensely and wanted to eliminate him at all costs.

At the time, Xia Chao served as the captain of the First Brigade of the Puppet Agent Headquarters' Task Force, and his wife, Xia Zhang, also worked in the same puppet agency, drafting reports and documents for her husband. The Puppet Agent Headquarters dispatched Xia to assassinate Yu Hua. Xia, together with Zhang Chuntang, a shareholder in a gambling establishment in Shanghai's West, gathered seven or eight people and waited outside Yu Hua's residence at 202 Shanzhong Road for three days. On the morning of November 23rd of the 28th year (1939), at around 9:00 AM, as Yu Hua was heading out in his own rickshaw, Xia suddenly fired three shots with a pistol. Yu collapsed in a pool of blood and died instantly. Xia turned and fled. The hired rickshaw puller, Zhou Yejin, shouted after him, and Xia turned back and fired another shot before getting into a car numbered 8771 at the intersection of Pushi Road and Yuting, escaping. Subsequently, the French police investigated and found that the car belonged to the Staff Department of the Puppet Agent Headquarters at No. 76, and it was confirmed that the pistol used in the attack had been sent for use in assassinations. Xia had previously served as the chief of the Zhoujiaqiao Investigation Squad of the New Han Branch of the Puppet Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, and the leader of the Detective Squad of the Puppet Qingpu County Police Bureau. After the victory, Yu Hua's wife, Yu Chenyin, petitioned the Ministry of Judicial Administration to order the High Procuratorate to investigate.

### Trade Association Proves False Accusation of Undermining the Union

Wang Bingrong, the owner of the X shunxing Cotton Shop and a member of the Cotton Industry Association, recently initiated the formation of a manual cotton carding union and established an office on Guangdong Road. On the 20th of last month, a dispute arose between the shop's staff and a female customer buying cotton, which escalated into a mutual assault. Subsequently, Wang accused Jin Wensheng, the owner of the Jinshunxing Shop, and Zhang Baoxing, the owner of the Zhangshunxing Shop, of destroying the union office. After separate investigations by the General Labor Union and the police, it was determined that Jin and Zhang were legitimate businessmen and had not engaged in the destruction of the union office. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also sent a telegram to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, proving that the facts are indeed unrelated to Jin Wensheng and Zhang Baoxing.

### Four People Arrested for Peddling Fake Brandy Brought from Hong Kong

[Report from this Newspaper] Zeng Guocai, Li Ying, Lin Guan chi, Deng You and four other people were running business between Hong Kong and Shanghai.

### Bandit Gang Hidden in the Home of the "Bao" Chief in Western Shanghai; Kidnapped Victim Rescued at Risk of Life

[Report from this Newspaper] Cao Tianming, the deputy commander of the Self-Defense Corps squad in Si Jing Town, Western Shanghai, led volunteer corps members on patrol to Yejia Bang at 10:20 PM on the 3rd of this month and discovered that bandits were inside the home of "Bao" Chief Su Yinlin. They surrounded the house from front and back, but were discovered by the bandits, who suddenly fled out the back door and opened fire to resist arrest. Corps member Gu Yaozong died on the spot. It is learned that the bandit leader Yang Yinlin (wanted by the Songjiang Commissioner's Office) had, at the end of last month, gathered a group to kidnap Cao Baogen, the 19-year-old only son of farmer Cao Qitang, in Xiaochang Bang at the southern end of Si Jing Town, hiding him and demanding a large ransom. On the evening of the 3rd, they moved the hostage to "Bao" Chief Su's house in Yejia Bang, but their plan was discovered during a patrol by the Self-Defense Corps, and the hostage was rescued.

### Sun Qinchi and Others Undergo Seventh Trial in the Case of Alleged Embezzlement of Received Oil Supplies

[Report from this Newspaper] Sun Qinchi, the former director of the Municipal Government's General Affairs Department, Shen Zhenjia, the director of the Motor Vehicle Section, and Shen Wenyuan, a clerk in the section, were accused of embezzlement for receiving large quantities of materials such as kerosene, engine oil, and iron bars from the enemy Japanese-operated Izumitsu Company (short for China Izumitsu Industries Co., Ltd.). After six trials, the seventh trial was held again in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court at 10 AM yesterday, presided over by Judge Wu Shaochang. Sun Qinchi and Shen Zhenjia both denied concealing materials and failing to report them.

Shen Wenyuan testified that in September of the 34th year (1945), when he was ordered to go to the Izumitsu Company's warehouse to transport two cars, he discovered oil and immediately reported it to his supervisor for handling. He was instructed to have Izumitsu Company prepare a detailed inventory of the oil for verification. The Japanese in the company said that the accountant was not present, so they hastily filled it out in pencil. It was handed over to Shen Zhenjia, the director of the Motor Vehicle Section, who submitted it to Sun Qinchi, the director of the General Affairs Department. He was instructed that the detailed list was not in the correct format, lacked the signature and seal of a responsible person, and was written in pencil, so it could not be used as a basis for verification in the future. He was ordered to prepare a formal list for verification. The original list was already waste paper and there was no need to keep it, so it was casually discarded. The indictment's claim that it was intentionally concealed has no basis in law. Subsequently, the witness Zhou Yunshan testified that he was in charge of the warehouse at 360 Yanping Road of the Izumitsu Company, and there were a total of 624 barrels of kerosene and diesel oil. On October 30th of the 34th year, the Third Army sent people to seal up the batch of materials. The next day, 120 barrels were taken away by truck, and the remaining items were sold by the customs. When Shen Wenyuan came to the warehouse to seal it, he did not see him take any oil. Finally, after the defendants' lawyers explained the capacity of the oil drums and the weight of each drum, the court ordered another hearing at a later date.

### An Enigmatic Scene: Major Conflicts in Jinan's Renfeng Cotton Mill

[Report from Our Jinan Correspondent, July 3rd] A major event has occurred in Jinan in recent weeks. This event involves Ma Bosheng, the current chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce, as the "protagonist." The incident has further implicated the "enemy and puppet equity handling" and "takeover issues" of Jinan's largest cotton mill, "Renfeng Cotton Mill," which is chaired by Ma Bosheng. As a result, the content has become increasingly complex and delicate, becoming not only the top headline or sidebar news on the local editions of Jinan's newspapers but also the most important topic of conversation for all "locals" during their leisure time. The incident began with a notice posted by Jiang Ziyuan, the former deputy manager of Renfeng Cotton Mill, in Jinan's Cheng Bao:

A Notice

The main idea was that he wanted the executive of Renfeng Cotton Mill (referring to Ma Bosheng) to answer him clearly: "The factory was given a check for 25 million yuan on October 10 by Ms. Cui Yonghe from Changsheng Gong Silver Shop, issued on October 7th, numbered 001524. Because he did not know what the check was for, he did not dare to accept it. In addition to properly saving the check, he hereby exposed it in newspapers and humbly requested a reply in five days, in order to alleviate his anxiety." (Excerpt from the original text) As the Guomin Evening News said: "In today's society, countless people want to make a fortune, even attempting to hoard huge profits by getting rich by being sullied. This Mr. Jiang is willing to not accept money, and can be considered a news in the year of people getting rich." What is equally intriguing is that the check was handled by Ms. Cui Yonghe, Jinan's most famous "socialite celebrity," who is currently the female secretary of the Pacification Zone and a female senator of the Shandong Provincial Government. Therefore, the news spread quickly, arousing widespread public attention to the issue. Then, on October 26, the Jinan Zhong Bao first published an interview with Ms. Cui. According to her, "After the July 7th Incident, when the enemy invaded the north bank of Luokou and bombarded Jinan, Renfeng Cotton Mill gathered all employees and announced that the situation was critical. Those who wished to return home would have their salaries suspended, while those who remained at the factory to defend the business would receive double pay. Jiang Ziyuan was the deputy manager at the time and was willing to stay." "The check for 25 million yuan was the factory's reward to Mr. Jiang for defending the factory." (Excerpt from the original text)

Five days quickly passed. Ma Bosheng did not formally reply to Jiang Ziyuan. All that everyone saw was a

Letter in Reply

from Mr. Ma to Mr. Jiang, which was disclosed in the Guomin Evening News on October 29th, written on the 6th of the same month but "never sent." The letter listed, "…when the Japanese enemy occupied the cotton mill, all colleagues were expelled, but you alone remained in the factory. Therefore, colleagues suspected that you were playing tricks in front of the enemy. This led to the digging up of old accounts, accusing you of embezzling the Zhangqiu cotton money and Weixian cloth money from the factory, and reporting you with evidence. You were then forced to leave the factory. I have always felt that the former colleagues were too intolerant, … therefore, I gave you 5 million yuan during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year and 3 million yuan during the New Year, and I believe I have not dishonored my friendship. Unexpectedly, you are not afraid of hard work and are insatiable. This spring, you again asked Mr. Miao Hainan to borrow another 1.8 million yuan. I am unable to provide this assistance…" In addition, the letter mentioned Jiang's request to Mr. Ma to be reinstated and the approval process, as well as…"Unexpectedly, in early July, leaflets were found all over the city with the title "See Ma Bosheng's Top Ten Sins," and some specifically stated that questions could be asked to Jiang Ziyuan, etc…" (All bracketed information is excerpted from the original text.)

What kind of conflict is going on between Jiang Ziyuan and Ma Bosheng? What is the inside story? This is only their private matter, at most a conflict within Renfeng, and does not deserve the widespread attention of the public. However, it is because of the

Jiang-Ma Conflict

that the "enemy and puppet equity handling" and "takeover issues" of Renfeng Cotton Mill, which are related to national interests, have been raised. According to the Jinan newspapers from October 25th until the time the reporter wrote this article: "The issue of the takeover, which has caused nationwide heartache after the victory, is about to face a major test here, namely, the handling of the equity of the traitor Yin Tong in Renfeng Cotton Mill. Considering that Yin served as the general manager of the factory both before the war and during the occupation, and held a large number of shares, the factory does not seem to be able to be returned immediately. Even after the return, the process of handling the equity of the traitor should be publicly announced by the relevant authorities and the factory to the public in order to clear doubts. The internal conflicts of the factory have been partially revealed due to Mr. Jiang Ziyuan's refusal to accept the 25 million yuan paid by Ma Bosheng…" "It was recently learned that in 1938 (the 27th year of the Republic of China), Manager Ma Bosheng, on the order of Yin Tong, the puppet general manager of the North China Construction Directorate, sent a letter to the staff of Jinan factory, instructing them to sell some small shares, totaling 175,000 yuan, to the puppet China Preparatory Bank at a price that was 10% higher than the face value. After the victory, it was heard that this equity, which had been sold to the puppet side, was purchased by Ma Yiqing (Ma Bosheng's brother). What kind of method did Ma use to obtain this equity is also intriguing…" "On March 20th, 1942, at a time when our sacred war of resistance was entering a difficult stage, Yin Tong, the General Manager of Renfeng Cotton Mill and the puppet Director of the Construction Directorate, convened a shareholders' meeting at the Provincial Library in Daming Lake, with Ma as the chairman. The list of all directors was posted, claiming that this was decided by the Director Yin in Beijing and could not be changed. After a formal election procedure with red and green ballots, Ma led the group to Lixia Pavilion, where he and the representative sent by the Japanese signed the contract for the joint operation of the Jinan Renfeng Cotton Mill between China and Japan. Then, they took photos and raised glasses to celebrate the success of Sino-Japanese cooperation…" "…A shareholder of Renfeng expressed dissatisfaction that Manager Ma Bosheng did not present the original inventory list to the shareholders' meeting, and that during the acceptance period, it was rumored that a large number of cloths were covered with coal ash, transported out and sold illicitly, and the true facts of the matter were not explained…" "…Since Yin Tong was an enemy-flattering traitor, after he automatically agreed to jointly operate Renfeng Cotton Mill with the Japanese, the Japanese gave 1.8 million yuan in puppet currency to Manager Ma Bosheng for distribution. Ma handled it as follows: 400,000 yuan to the shareholders, 17,000 yuan to all employees, and the remaining 1,383,000 yuan is still a mystery as to whether it was kept by Ma…" "…Ma Bosheng had already fled to Beiping before the Japanese invaders captured Jinan. He would not have been threatened by the Japanese at that time. His return to Jinan to preside over the signing of the contract with the Japanese constitutes the crime of colluding with the enemy and being a traitor. The court prosecutor should prosecute him according to the law. Why is he still allowed to roam free?…" "…After Jinan fell in 1937, the factory was occupied by the enemy. In 1938, Ma Yiqing (Ma Bosheng's brother) suddenly returned to Jinan and contacted the shareholders, claiming that his brother (Ma Bosheng) said that since the cotton mill was occupied by the enemy, all the assets would be lost. In order to protect their rights, he had discussed with Yin Tong (the general manager of the factory) to sell each share at a price that was 10% higher than the face value, which would be collected by the puppet Preparatory Bank. A total of 175,000 yuan was received at that time, but it was not stated who the buyer was. According to the situation at the time, it may have been purchased by Yin Tong. After the victory, Ma Bosheng used the fact that Yin Tong was a traitor and that his property had become traitor property to intimidate Yin's family to take the stock back for himself. He gave part of it to powerful people, and another part was given to two or three powerful shareholders because their sale was unclear at the time. They threatened to sue in court, and Ma gave them a portion in order to appease the situation. The relevant authorities can investigate the archives of the puppet Preparatory Bank to see who the buyer was. The mystery should not be difficult to solve…" "…The board of directors of the factory was originally scheduled to meet on October 29. Due to the small number of attendees, only Cui Shijie (the current chairman of the factory) convened Ma Bosheng, Zhang Weiwei, Chen Lunsheng, and Xin Zhujiu, who seemed to be discussing privately. Cui brought up the issue of Jiang's reinstatement, which Ma Bosheng flatly rejected, saying "There will be Ma but no Jiang." Later, he mentioned that Yin Tong's 300,000 shares during the enemy puppet period had been transferred to Ma Yiqing's name with my notarization,… At this point, the meeting ended without any results." (The above is excerpted from the Spring and Autumn Agency's manuscript and Cheng Bao's report.)

After the newspapers in Jinan published the above news, all newspapers received a threatening letter on October 31, signed by the department heads of Renfeng Cotton Mill, representing 2,500 employees, and bearing the names and seals of 37 employee representatives, including Ma Xude. For the sake of their own safety, the news media held an emergency meeting and decided to forward the original letter to the Defense Command for legal protection. Then, on the 1st of this month, Zhao Mingyuan and others, the people in charge of the Shandong Branch of the Chinese Islamic Association, hosted the Jinan news media. Ma Bosheng tried to

avoid the main points

Aside from briefly explaining that under his leadership, Renfeng Cotton Mill, which has 18,000 spindles, has increased its daily output from 1 piece of yarn and 7 bolts of cloth at the time of the victory's takeover to the current 41 pieces of yarn and 460 bolts of cloth, and the reasons why he "ran to Beiping, occupied by the enemy, while other people ran to the motherland" during the War of Resistance (see the Guomin Evening News, October 25), Ma Bosheng has not sent letters to the newspapers to request corrections, nor has Ma published notices to deny the allegations. As a result, the situation has become increasingly confusing and unfathomable to outsiders. Aside from "knowing that the scope of this issue is very large, involving the public cover-up of the property of a major traitor and the 'merger' of small shareholders by large shareholders, as well as the heavy involvement of wealthy merchants," the details are, as the Spring and Autumn Agency said, only waiting for the "thorough investigation" by Inspector Guo Zhonghuai of the Yulu Supervisory Office and relevant parties, who have already begun to pay attention to this matter in Luoyang, and have also cracked down on several "tigers" in Shandong.

### Li Zongren Suggests Granting One Million to Each Faculty Member in Beijing and Tianjin to Cover Individual Coal Expenses; Ministry of Education Plans to Request Separate Appropriation from the Executive Yuan

[This newspaper dispatch from Nanjing, 6th day] Hu Shih and others from the education sector in Peiping, when Chairman Chiang arrived in Peiping, said that the northern climate was extremely cold, most professors were poor scholars, and at a time of high prices and meager treatment for professors, they were really unable to buy coal themselves to keep warm and cold. Upon direct request, the Chairman expressed sympathy and suggested that the head of the Peiping Executive Headquarters, Li Zongren, request the Ministry of Education to guarantee and issue 1 million yuan to each faculty member of colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin to purchase inexpensive coal for the needs of keeping warm and cold. It is reported that the Ministry of Education believes that there are more than 3,000 faculty members in colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin, costing about 3 billion yuan. The Ministry of Education will guarantee the expenditure, which will be impossible to compensate in the future. The cold in the north is not limited to Peiping and Tianjin. If the northeast and northwest are also taken into account, the funds required are even greater. Therefore, after careful consideration, it is planned to request a separate appropriation from the Executive Yuan to meet the needs.

[Hualian News Agency, Peiping, 6th day] For the winter coal issue, faculty members of colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin were specially allowed to send representatives, including Zheng Tian-ting, Secretary-General of Peking University, Shen Lu, Secretary-General of Tsinghua University, and Yang Guang-bi of the Peiping Research Institute, to visit Director Li yesterday.

Xu and Xiao replied responsibly, saying that Director Li was extremely concerned about the lives of faculty members in colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin and would definitely distribute two tons of raw coal for winter use to each faculty member according to the original plan, and the coal price would still be as originally agreed, so the result was still satisfactory.

[Another dispatch] After the Executive Headquarters approved two tons of winter coal per person for colleges and universities, each school went to the Coal Supply Committee to negotiate and pay the fees. It is reported that the price of two tons is within one million yuan, and it can be received within three days.

### Export Promotion Office Actively Prepares Export Goods Visa Measures Aims to Fully Understand the Actual Situation of Export Industry, Which is Completely Different from the Nature of Import Goods Control

Regarding the visa matter of export materials, the Export Promotion Office of the Import and Export Control Commission is actively preparing. Its visa measures have been approved. Cities with branches of the Import and Export Control Commission will handle this visa measure simultaneously to ensure national consistency and facilitate exporters. Therefore, its preparation requires quite some time. It can be announced and implemented in the middle of this month. After this news spread, exporters believed that it would increase the difficulty of exporting and held opposing opinions. Recently, according to a person in charge of the Export Promotion Office of the Import and Export Control Commission, it is solemnly stated: this measure is handled in accordance with the responsibilities stipulated after the reorganization. There are two purposes: to know the real situation of the export industry; to obtain accurate export statistics. My export industry is still in a difficult stage, and its shortage and increase in exports should be fully understood. If there is a shortage, the reason for the shortage should be studied, whether it is insufficient funds, problems with transportation, or low international market prices, or repeated increases in costs, it should be further clarified to help solve its difficulties so that it can be smoothly withdrawn. The bear market is normal, and quantity increase should also be sought. This is all well-intentioned assistance, not malicious control. The procedure is extremely simple. After the exporter obtains the application form and fills it out, it will be sent to the designated bank for transfer to the office. After reviewing the price, it will be transferred to the customs for approval to export, and the merchants will be provided with convenience in terms of technology and time as much as possible, which is completely different from import control.

The substitution period is three months, and both parties can agree to renew the contract. Before the substitution is completed, the substituting factory will pay a certain percentage of the cloth first.

Among them, 6,000 tons were exported to the United States, and 500 tons were exported to other countries, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, and other places. Among the 6,000 tons exported to the United States, 3,000 tons were exported by the China Vegetable Oil Factory, 1,000 tons were exported by the Central Trust Bureau, and about 2,000 tons were directly exported to the United States by merchants and purchased and transported to the United States by foreign firms in Shanghai. Exports from Hong Kong amounted to 400 tons in September and may increase to 1,000 tons in October, most of which are exported to the United Kingdom, because the price of tung oil in the British market is currently slightly higher than that in the United States. However, due to the recent strict investigation of export smuggling in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and because tung oil is currently in a transitional period in various places, the smuggling of tung oil in Hong Kong is no longer as rampant as in the past.

### Sugar Prices Fall Again

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to loosen by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan due to the fact that He Company still had allocations at the original price.

### New Buying of Chinese Stocks Gradually Becomes Enthusiastic, and the Market Heart Sees Revival

Although the Chinese stock market was stable but still flustered in the morning, the discount was very cheap, and new buying gradually became enthusiastic. As a result, the stimulus of loan sluggishness in the later market made the yarn and flower gangs enthusiastically buy, and began to gradually improve in the midst of great struggle.

Morning Opening

The market heart was slightly stable and saw a high. After Yongsha opened, there was a floating profit-taking, and there was no excitement. It once fell to a low price of 268 yuan for immediate delivery and 276.5 yuan for deferred delivery. However, because the spot discount was very cheap, and the market interest rate was also as low as 1.5 jiao and 1.95 jiao, it gradually rebounded to 2733 and 282 yuan. After a period of hovering, the market heart in the industry was very good, and near the noon market, it rose to a high price of 275 yuan for immediate delivery and 284 yuan for deferred delivery. There were a large number of knock-outs from outside the market, and the asking price was reported to be small.

After a period of retreat to 274 yuan and 283 yuan, the national bank's exchange difference was very large, and it rose again to 278 yuan and 289 yuan. Because there were high sales of immediate delivery and deferred delivery, it fell back to 275 yuan and 284 yuan. However, the general public's expectations of the broker's association and the Executive Yuan's regular meeting were fulfilled, and the closing price was pulled up to a high price of 280 yuan and 290 yuan, and then closed at 279 yuan and 289 yuan. Xinyuan rose even more, and the asking price outside the market continued to rise after the closing.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### The Acute Hearing of the Blind

— Cheng Hanzhang

Blind people, having lost their sight, have other unusually keen senses to compensate. This is a gift from the Creator, just as deaf-mutes have particularly acute vision. Among the keen senses possessed by blind people, hearing is the most important. The fingers of both hands are next, and the sense of touch is also particularly keen. For example, by pressing the fingers on various substances to feel their thickness, even the thickness of fabric weaves, the thickness of paper, it is even possible to know the beauty or ugliness of a woman's face by touching it with your hand. Is that not strange?

Mechnikov (1908) recorded that blind people, when walking on the ground, are able to know the existence of obstacles a considerable distance ahead, and therefore can cleverly avoid collisions. He called it the sixth sense. It is said, "There was an old professor who had been blind for forty years, walking alone in the park, never colliding with a tree or tripping over a stone. He knew and was prepared to avoid it from a distance of two meters. One day, he walked into a building he had never been in before. In the center of the room, there was a large instrument stored, and he was able to know it early on. Another blind person, when walking in the city streets, was able to distinguish shops or residences. He could even count the number of windows." According to Mechnikov's theory, these special senses are due to the function of the blind person's eardrum (or rely on his keen hearing). Because of his keen hearing, he is able to hear subtle sounds; when he walks, the air vibrations reflected from the surface of the surrounding objects can be used to infer the existence of the object. We now know even more that bats do not accidentally touch other objects when flying at night, also for this reason. In this Great War, Britain and the United States used this principle to invent radar, which helped the victory of the war a lot. Is it not more strange and wonderful than the particularly keen senses of blind people?

### Black Fever

— Chu Lin-sun

Black fever is a chronic infectious disease, with main symptoms including long-term irregular fever, enlarged liver and spleen, decreased white blood cells, and anemia. Many people commonly call black fever "lumps disease," but lumps disease is not necessarily black fever; because lumps are a symptom, not unique to black fever! Many people treat black fever as typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, etc., which of course will not have good results, missing the time when modern medicine can help, and slowly dragging the patient to death! What is the reason for this? Is this disease rare in China? Is it difficult to diagnose? No! No! It is one of the major epidemics in China, taking away many lives of compatriots every year! It loses an immeasurable amount of national productivity!

In 1903, Laveran and Mesnil, in memory of Leishmanng and Donovan's contributions to the pathogen of this disease, named the parasite Leishmania donovanl. It lives in the endothelial cells of the patient's blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, and is most abundant in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The pathogen can also be found in the large mononuclear white blood cells, large phagocytes, or urine, stool, nasal mucosa, tonsils, and saliva of patients. The most likely vector for transmission is the sandfly Phlebotomus.

In 1875, black fever was prevalent in Assam, India, causing many deaths. The disease is found in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere, especially in countries along the Mediterranean coast. The history of black fever's prevalence in China must be very early. Due to the lack of detailed clinical signs and the lack of equipment for microscopic examination, it was not noticed by everyone until 1910, when Aspland made the first confirmed diagnosis in China. In the recent thirty years or so, due to the expansion of disease areas, the increase in patients, the discovery of the sandfly which is the transmission vector, and the proof of natural and experimental flagellated protozoa, China has been recognized as one of the major epidemic areas of black fever in the world. In Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Anhui, in addition to many cases, the discovery of the transmitting insect, sandfly, and the animal (six) protective host, confirms that it is the most severely prevalent area. After the Anti-Japanese War, scattered cases have spread across the country. Reports have been made in various provinces in Northeast China, Gansu, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Lanzhou, and other places. If there are only human cases without transmission vectors and protective hosts, it cannot be considered an epidemic area. However, Hou Baozhang inspected cases and the sandfly which is a transmission vector in Guanxian and Lifan in Sichuan, so Sichuan has the potential to become an epidemic area. Last year, a large number of refugees from northern Jiangsu crossed the river to the south. I don't know how many of them have black fever. If sandflies also breed and spread in the Shanghai area, then, in a few years, the Jiangnan area will definitely become an uncollectible black fever epidemic area.

Why is this disease overlooked by people? Because the symptoms are not particularly obvious, it is not possible to determine what the disease is simply by looking with the eyes, listening with the ears, and examining the patient's pulse and tongue coating. The incubation period from infection to onset is about ten days to three or four months. There are no external symptoms. After that, there will be hectic or intermittent fever, with subjective symptoms such as headache and vomiting. The body temperature can have two or three high points within 24 hours. The entire fever process is irregular. During this period, white blood cells decrease, anemia, and heart weakness occur. Sometimes there are also rheumatic joints with mild persistent fever. After five months, the spleen and liver gradually enlarge, and the abdomen is distended. The spleen is often very large. When touched, there is a large one. At this time, the patient's appearance is haggard and skin and bones are like firewood; the skin color gradually becomes darker, as if black, because the skin color is dark, there is fever and chills, so it is called black fever. There is swelling of the back of the foot, dropsy, and the skin and mucous membranes are prone to bleeding. The stool is like dysentery. After half a year or a year or two, the patient dies due to excessive weakness! Or dies due to tuberculosis, sepsis, pneumonia, etc.!

Its course takes such a long time, without a special, reliable symptom that can determine that the patient definitely has black fever. If you don't go through a proper diagnostic procedure, how can you not make a mistake? At first, it is just fever, and there are many diseases that cause fever! Enlarged spleen and liver, decreased white blood cells, are not unique to this disease. Therefore, we must distinguish it from other diseases that can cause fever and can enlarge the liver and spleen, such as: typhoid fever, malaria, relapsing fever, amoebic liver abscess, intestinal tuberculosis, Hodgkin's disease, Banti's disease, leukemia, infantile biliary cirrhosis, Japanese schistosomiasis, etc., before we can prescribe the right medicine and save the patient's life. This is not difficult. If you are willing to listen to the doctor, let us do the following tests: 1. Blood smear specimen, 2. Blood culture, 3. Spleen puncture, 4. Liver puncture, 5. Sternal puncture, 6. Tibial puncture, 7. Lymph node puncture, 8. Napier's Aldehyd test, 9. Antimony test, 10. Globulin sedimentation test, 11. Agglutination test.

After writing so many tests above, are you afraid of danger? Are you afraid of trouble? Don't be afraid! If you want the doctor to give you a definite diagnosis and effective treatment, then you should thank the doctor for spending valuable time doing a detailed and accurate examination to save the patient's life! Increase family happiness!

### An Example of an Accident During a Neck Dissection Under Anesthesia (Continued)

— Liang Junqing

The patient's breathing was normal, and the lungs had mild bronchitis and pneumonia symptoms. The diagnosis at this time was: retro-pharyngeal honeycomb tissue inflammation complicated by bronchitis and pneumonia. Treatment: Professor Reytier personally presided over the retro-pharyngeal honeycomb tissue inflammation dissection. Half an hour before the operation, 0.02 of morphine and scopolamine were injected first. Because the patient also had bronchitis and pneumonia, the anesthesia method was discussed and studied in detail. Finally, it was decided to use the less dangerous Narconumal intravenous injection method. This anesthesia method was presided over by the most experienced assistant doctor, injecting only one cc per minute. After injecting six cc of the drug, the patient began to calculate vaguely (that is, the mind was no longer very clear). After eight cc, the patient fell into a deep sleep and could not answer inquiries from others. Then another three cc were injected. Immediately, a special tongue depressor was tried (named Vegus, which can depress the tongue and also be used to open the mouth, and can also input Aether for anesthesia), but it was not successful, because the jaw was clenched tightly and could not be inserted. Another cc of the above-mentioned intravenous anesthetic was injected, but it was also ineffective. So 40 cc of ether drip anesthesia was added. At this time, the jaw was loose. So he tried to insert the above-mentioned tongue depressor. Unexpectedly, at this time, the patient suddenly had great difficulty breathing. The patient took a few slight breaths and then stopped breathing. However, the surgery was not stopped because the breathing stopped. The honeycomb tissue inflammation swelling on the posterior pharyngeal wall was immediately dissected, starting from the band-shaped bulge on the left side and cutting down to the lower left corner of the trachea. At this time, a lot of foul-smelling pus was discharged. Artificial respiration was also performed at the same time. The patient's pulse was initially stable and full after breathing stopped, but the heart also stopped beating about ten minutes later. So one cc of Adrenalin was injected into the patient's heart. The heart started beating again about three minutes later. However, the breathing was still stopped. Although respiratory stimulants and cardiotonics (Lobelin & Coramin) had been injected, they were not effective. So artificial respiration was constantly used to call for help. The patient only recovered his first breath twenty minutes after breathing stopped, and then waited another minute before having a second breath. Then the breathing gradually returned to normal within ten minutes. However, the patient had rapid breathing again an hour later, followed by a coma like death. At this time, edema suddenly occurred at the trachea, so the throat was dissected. After inserting the bridge into the throat, the breathing improved, but the patient remained in a coma and did not wake up. The next day, August 11, the patient remained in a coma and did not wake up despite various cardiotonics. There was breathing , however normal. However, the patient's whole body gradually stiffened, sometimes with opisthotonos, and the toes were tightly pulled back. The appearance was like a person whose head had been cut off. The patient died 35 hours after the operation.

Autopsy report. The examiner was Professor Wegelin, Dean of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Throat: Both tonsils were slightly enlarged, with quite a few folds and red and swollen. There was a surgical wound near the midline of the posterior pharyngeal wall, starting from the lower end of the tonsil and going straight down to near the spine. The posterior pharyngeal area was completely thickened, most of it had rotted, gangrene, foul-smelling, and spread to the apex of the lungs. In addition, the gangrenous lesions had also spread to the branches of the thyroid gland, and there were two millimeter-sized lesions on the upper end of the thyroid, and most of them had rotted. As for the trachea, there was only edema. Other parts were still normal. The large jugular vein on the left side of the neck had been ligated. No thrombosis was found. The lymph nodes in the neck were also about two centimeters in size, but they were very soft when touched. Medical examination report of histological aspects: The left tonsil had obvious bleeding. The connective tissue behind the left tonsil had a high degree of edema, with occasional bleeding, mixed with white blood cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Smear examination report of posterior pharyngeal abscess aspirate: There were countless fine Gram-positive deformed cocci, as well as blunt Gram-positive cocci, as well as rod-shaped bacteria, and a small amount of Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. Brain: The dura mater was taut, thickened, and opaque. There was flowing blood, blood clots, and dark-colored blood spots in the brain cavity. The pia mater was also taut. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrospinal fluid was clear and not increased. Diencephalon, pituitary gland, and pineal gland were normal. The blood vessels at the base of the brain were thin. Brain weight was 1,300 grams. The cerebral gyri were flattened, and the sulci were narrowed. The width of the brain cavity was normal, and the choroid plexus was also normal. The brain substance was moist and had considerable bleeding. Histological examination report: All blood vessels were dilated and filled with blood. The outer layer of the blood vessel wall was edematous. The edematous change of the dura mater was very severe, and there was a large amount of blood accumulation. The brain substance and meninges had no changes. Autopsy diagnosis result: "The patient had retro-pharyngeal honeycomb inflammation complicated by inflammation of the left thyroid gland. Associated symptoms were tonsillitis, emphysema, pulmonary edema, lobar pneumonia, catarrhal bronchitis, acute splenomegaly, fatty degeneration of the liver, hemorrhage of the outer membrane of the heart, hemorrhage of the entire gastrointestinal mucosa, acute brain swelling, congestion of the pia mater. Liver and kidney degeneration, vague swelling."

The above-mentioned case was investigated and clarified the cause after the autopsy, and it was not prosecuted. The original author, Ms. Graff, expressed the following opinions:

What deserves special attention from our surgeons and otolaryngologists in this case is the interruption of breathing during the anesthesia period. Mr. Dong suddenly experienced respiratory arrest during the period of intravenous general anesthesia before starting to dissect the honeycomb inflammation of the posterior pharynx, which cannot but make people reconsider. Of course, since the person in charge of intravenous anesthesia was an experienced assistant doctor, we cannot suspect any errors in his technique. What we can pay attention to is that breathing suddenly stopped at the moment when a special tongue depressor was placed in the oral cavity. Why is this? This is what we need to study. We all know that when dissecting tonsil hypertrophy, we often use this special tongue depressor in the patient's oral cavity during anesthesia, and we may also encounter the above-mentioned situation of sudden respiratory arrest (especially when the tongue depressor is inserted into the oral cavity and the tongue and the entire jaw are pressed down tightly). Therefore, we must pay special attention when using a mask to inhale ether to anesthetize the patient first, and then want to change to a special tongue depressor to press in ether to continue anesthetizing the patient in order to avoid all kinds of unsatisfactory difficulties, because breathing is prone to difficulty or even sudden cessation at this time. Based on this observation of facts, we deeply feel that after tightly pressing the root of the tongue and the jaw in the oral cavity with a tongue depressor, there must be a reflex action that stimulates the respiratory nerve center to suddenly stop working. We also know that there are many boundaries that can cause the respiratory nerve center to suddenly stop working, such as the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory organs, which is the boundary where reflex action occurs. We can stimulate the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity to cause the above-mentioned situation (stimulating the nasal mucosa of rabbits with electricity can immediately stop breathing). The same is true for stimulating the throat, trachea, and large trachea. Excessive pain can also cause respiratory arrest. Using high-speed sound or stimulating the auditory nerve center can also cause respiratory arrest. Using heat to stimulate the skin can also cause respiratory arrest. If the autonomic nerve is stimulated, the above-mentioned situation can also occur.

### Misplaced Praise

— Liu Yun

Chou Chi's Notes states: "I used to be in Qixia, and heard that the pork of He was extremely delicious. I sent someone to fetch it, but the messenger was drunk, and the pig escaped at night. He bought another pig to bring back, which I did not know. The guests were all amazed, thinking it was beyond the reach of other products; but later, the matter was revealed, and the guests were all greatly ashamed"! After reading this story, I can't help but feel a thousand emotions! "Buy another pig to bring back, which I did not know." Of course, "A gentleman can be deceived by his principles." But "the guests were all amazed, thinking it was beyond the reach of other products." Then there is really a ghost in the mouth. To put it bluntly, isn't it the inferior nature of completely blindly following and agreeing with those who curry favor with the guests, so as to destroy their conscience? Zi Cai asked: "It is difficult to find a confidant, but it is even more difficult to know the taste"! It can be seen that there have been few truly tasteful people throughout history. If the secret of this "great amazement at being beyond the reach of other products" is not revealed, everyone will still be complacent, thinking that they have truly tasted the delicious pork of Heyang, and will be very happy to eat it and brag about it to others. Once the truth is revealed, everyone will feel embarrassed and their faces will turn red. There are many similar things happening in the world! But I think that knowing "great shame" after "the matter is revealed" is still a sign that there is a "conscience" and "sense of good and evil" existing. What is most fearful is being shameless, and not even blushing, then "sorrow is greater than the death of the heart" and there is no cure. Free Talk Biography John Winant
— Zheng Fan

Former US Ambassador to the UK John Winant suddenly committed suicide with a pistol at his home in Concord, New Hampshire on the third night. Before his suicide, he had just finished writing his memoirs, "Recollections of Serving in England." According to the forensic doctor, it may have been caused by long-term excessive fatigue and mental disorder.

Those who pay attention to the international situation will always remember this outstanding American diplomat. He took office as Ambassador to the UK when German planes bombed London the most fiercely, and made great contributions to strengthening the ties between the Allied countries and providing various military and economic assistance. In addition, when he served as Governor of New Hampshire three times, the social welfare undertakings he organized and the regulations he promoted, such as old-age subsidies and emergency relief, are still praised by Americans today.

In terms of appearance, Winant's face and figure were very similar to Lincoln's. He was tall, with bright eyes, and even his temperament was very similar: sincere, meticulous, and unkempt. His hair was always messy, his shirt was crumpled, and he never thought of ironing his pants. During his tenure as Ambassador to the UK, London radio stations often broadcast how unruly and unfashionable the US Ambassador was. When Winant's mother heard about this in the United States, she quickly called his daughter-in-law: "Didn't he take any new shirts?" Winant's wife said sadly: "He took a lot, but, as you know, he must have forgotten to change! What can be done!"

Winant was always focused on his work and was not good at socializing at all. In London, he rarely appeared in social gatherings. He liked to lock himself in his office, take off his jacket, hold it in his hand, and pace back and forth with his head down, pondering a problem that needed to be solved urgently. After he figured out the problem, his jacket must have fallen on the floor and been trampled beyond recognition. He was so busy with his work, every day from morning until late at night, and without any vacations. If it is said that his suicide this time was indeed caused by excessive work and mental disorder, it is not without basis.

Winant came from a wealthy American family and had a lot of money. He worked as a history professor at St. Paul's School. After the First European War, he married Ms. Russell, a wealthy woman from Princeton. After marriage, he focused on his career. Everyone ridiculed him as a bookworm, a "progressive" element, and a guy who got rich off his wife's money, but he didn't care and bravely participated in the election for parliamentarian.

He had terrible speaking skills and a very slow tone. During the election campaign, when he gave his first speech, he went on stage and stammered, unable to say a single word, which made his wife faint on the spot, but the audience was impressed by his honesty and his election was victorious.

No matter how clumsy his appearance was, his sincere spirit would shine. Everyone who came into contact with him supported him. He won the governorship of New Hampshire three times, and those who competed with him for the election, such as former Secretary of the Navy Knox, were far behind.

Another reason why he was supported was that he liked to be close to the people. Anyone could go to his office and talk to him for two hours, and he would put aside all his official duties. Moreover, he liked to help people. Once, he attended an important meeting in New York as governor. On the way to the train station, a ragged woman asked him for money. He gave her all the money in his pocket. When he arrived at the station, he realized that he didn't even have the money to buy a train ticket, so he borrowed money from a stranger.

People in New Hampshire once said: "If the governor invites you to dinner, you must bring money and then lend it to him so that he can pay the bill." — Winant was such a person.

Although he personally could not manage money, during his tenure as governor, he was able to reform finance and adopt the latest budget system, with remarkable results.

He also served as Director of the Social Security Administration and Director of the International Labor Office in Geneva. When the war between Britain and Germany became tense, President Roosevelt specially appointed him to be the envoy to Britain. When the war ended, he served as the US representative on the European Supervisory Committee. This year, he was appointed by Truman as the permanent representative of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. He is 58 years old this year.

Whether Winant's suicide was indeed caused by mental disorder as the forensic doctor judged, or was based on other reasons, it is certainly impossible to guess at present, but it is always very regrettable for the death of such an extraordinary statesman.

### Rooster Crows

— Hulu

Roosters laying eggs have been reported many times.

Women turning into men and men turning into women, it is said that surgery can be done, I wonder if our country is more civilized, roosters laying eggs have been seen many times!

The times are now reversed, everything is turned upside down, strange yin and yang are all over the world, I am afraid there will be less rooster crowing and more dog thieving!

### Autumn in the Old Capital

— Sha Lan

Autumn is deep, which makes me miss the old capital even more. Of the four seasons, only autumn is the best time in Beijing. Spring is often windy, summer is continentally hot, and winter is severely cold, which are not ideal weather conditions. But in autumn, the sky is clear and the air is crisp, which is much more comfortable than the bitter rain in the south of the Yangtze River at this time. Autumn is the season when everything ripens, and peanuts, chestnuts, persimmons, and sweet potatoes are both economical and delicious foods. At the same time, after the Beginning of Autumn, you can enjoy the open-air barbecue, which is a flavor that cannot be enjoyed outside of Beijing. Taking a small stove to Fragrant Hills and picking pine branches to barbecue is even more fun in the mountains.

The fat crabs of Shengfang are also something that makes people think. As early as before the Yangcheng Lake crabs in the south of the Yangtze River were displayed on the streets, the vegetable markets in Xidan or Dongdan had already displayed "overbearing crabs." Of course, from an economic point of view, it is most cost-effective to buy them at Xihuyuan Street near Qianmen.

Southerners like to boast about osmanthus trees in the north, but in fact, in addition to the fragrant and fragrant smell, osmanthus trees have no ornamental value. Among the autumn plants, chrysanthemums are still the best. Not to mention the chrysanthemums of the old capital, Zhu Ziqing's "Chrysanthemums of Tsinghua Garden" has long been well-known. In addition to Tsinghua, the chrysanthemums in the park and the National Beiping Library are also very precious, with many treasures. "Seeing peonies" in the park in spring and Tie Tian's "Appreciating Chrysanthemums" are both fun things to do at that time. It's just that the hills are barren and the situation is chaotic, and everyone is worried about "getting a high position" in time, and I am afraid that not many people have this elegant interest.

Speaking of which, when the white clouds are floating high and the blue sky guarantees that you will not have any wind or rain, and you are wearing a lined shirt that is neither too cold nor too hot, don't you really want to go out for a walk? Near the park Beihai, far away from the Temple of Heaven Summer Palace, if you have poetic and picturesque inspiration, masterpieces will be produced. At the very least, you can wander and relax in your own garden. If you can't create, you can just recite and chant from memory to dispel your worries. However, in Shanghai, this kind of climate is difficult to enjoy. When you look up, you see tall buildings, and when you look down, you see crowded crowds. Needless to say, your inspiration has dissipated and your poetic inspiration has fled. Ah, this is the depression of city dwellers.

### On Chestnuts

— Shu Shang

Both chestnuts and persimmons are fruits of the North. Those produced in the North are smaller, but their sweetness surpasses those from other regions. In the North, chestnuts are most abundantly produced in the three counties of Changping, Licheng, and Zouping. Currently, the most famous are the chestnuts from Liangxiang. Zhejiang Province also produces a considerable amount of chestnuts, with Mingji, Linhai, Dongyang, and Longquan being the most abundant counties. However, in terms of taste, they ultimately fall short of those produced in the aforementioned northern counties. This is likely due to differences in soil.

While in Chongqing, I once tasted the Tianshi chestnuts from Qingcheng Mountain. Their appearance is the same as ordinary chestnuts, but each shell contains only one nut. When eaten, they have an exceptionally sweet taste. Tianshi chestnuts are only produced on Qingcheng Mountain and nowhere else. It is said that this type was planted during the time Zhang Tianshi was studying the Tao. The annual yield is very small, and only people in the Chongqing Zhang County area can get to eat them.

To plant chestnuts, one must wait until the chestnuts are initially ripe and the shells emerge. Then, immediately wrap them and bury them in moist soil, taking care not to expose them to the wind, as exposure will prevent germination. By the third month of the following year, the chestnuts will begin to sprout and grow. Once they have grown slightly, they can be transplanted to another location. Avoid using palm sap immersion for several years. Every year in October, tightly wrap them with straw and untie them in February. Chestnuts are northern trees, but they are still very susceptible to the cold.

Chestnuts and olives, thinly sliced and mixed together, have an exceptionally delicious flavor when eaten together. People call it "Plum Blossom Delight." Yam, sliced together with chestnuts and then stewed with lamb broth and seasonings, is called "Golden Jade Soup," and is also a delicious dish in late autumn and early winter.

The largest chestnuts are called Banli (plate chestnuts), followed by Shanli (mountain chestnuts). Mountain chestnuts that are round with a pointed tip are called Zhuili (cone chestnuts). Small, round chestnuts resembling acorns are called Xinli. Those as small as a finger are called Maoli (thatch chestnuts). The variety of chestnuts is so diverse, even in such small differences.

Chestnuts nourish the kidneys. People with weak waists and legs can eat more than ten sun-dried chestnuts every morning, followed by two bowls of pork kidney porridge. Results can be seen after half a month. Su Dongpo's younger brother, Su Ziyou, ate this kind of tonic, and even wrote a poem saying: "Growing old, I add to my waist and leg ailments, the old mountain man takes the chestnut's old recipe, guests come to tell me morning and evening, three swallows slowly receive the white jade nectar." This is a master of eating chestnuts.

To be intimate with the emperor relies entirely on eloquence. The biography of Xiao Chen in the History of the Liang Dynasty states: "Emperor Wu of Liang had a long-standing relationship with Chen in the Western Residence. The Emperor always received Chen at morning banquets. Chen, due to his old friendship, often attended the imperial banquets. Once, he became drunk and fell. The Emperor threw a persimmon at Chen. Chen then took a chestnut and threw it back, hitting the Emperor directly in the face. The Censorate Adjutant was present. The Emperor, showing a change in color, said: 'There are people here; you must not do such a thing. Is there any explanation?' Chen immediately replied: 'Your Majesty throws your red heart at me; how dare I not repay you with trembling?' Emperor Wu then laughed with delight." This shows the importance of eloquence.

### Shuang Qing's Exquisite Poetry

— Wang Baili

The female historian Bian Qing has immeasurable talent. I once recorded her entire poem "Remembering the Xiao Played on the Phoenix Terrace" with repeated characters, which is a testament to her skill. Now, I will record one of her Xiang Geng Ci (Plowing Songs) in which each line contains the word "spring." It is beautiful, elegant, and without any forced feeling. The poem reads:

"Purple fields, spring clear, slowly wrap in spring gauze, self-supply spring plowing, small plum spring slender, fine grass spring bright, spring field step by step spring grows; remember that year the spring was good, towards the spring swallows, spoke of spring love, until now, thinking of spring letters, spring tears, all turned to spring ice. Pity the spring, ache for the spring, how many springs, by a piece of spring mist, locked in spring shock, give to spring embrace, pass to spring you, is I, is you, spring spirit, count the spring beginning, spring end, also difficult to count the spring dream, spring awakening, what spring demon, make a spring spring illness, spring mistook Shuang Qing."

The entire poem contains only one hundred and four characters, divided into twenty-two lines, and uses twenty-nine "spring" characters. "Spring" truly comes from heaven.

### Byrnes Reveals: The Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy

— Shan

On July 2, Secretary of War Stimson presented a memorandum with insightful views to the President, laying the groundwork for an ultimatum to Japan. Based on this memorandum, the President drafted a joint declaration of the United States, Britain, and China. The President and I repeatedly deliberated, and several suggestions from Prime Minister Churchill were also adopted. This declaration, agreed upon by Churchill, outlined the essentials based on Secretary Stimson's proposal, except for the issue of the future status of the Japanese Emperor, which was not addressed. This proposed declaration was sent to Chiang Kai-shek for signature.

Soon after, Churchill and Winant returned to England, and President Truman also took this opportunity to visit the headquarters of the American occupation zone in Frankfurt, and I followed along. When we returned to the "Little White House" that evening, two telegrams were waiting for the President. One was Ambassador Winant's report of the surprising news of Churchill's election defeat, and the second was Marshal Chiang Kai-shek's approval of what is now called the Potsdam Declaration. This declaration was immediately released and made public, and a copy was sent by special envoy to Mr. Molotov.

Late that night, Mr. Molotov called, requesting that the declaration be delayed for two or three days. When he was told that the declaration had already been announced, he seemed troubled. The next day, I explained to him that the reason we had not sent the declaration to him before it was released was because we did not want to make it difficult for the Soviet Union to issue a declaration to a country it had not yet fought against. He did not say that he hoped to make any revisions, but simply said that we should have consulted with him first.

Two days later, on July 29, Mr. Molotov visited again. Originally, it was decided that the President and I would meet with him and Marshal Stalin, but Molotov told us that Stalin was ill that day. He instructed Molotov to discuss with us the direct reasons for the Soviet Union's entry into the war. Molotov said: The Soviet government believes that it would be best for the United States, Britain, and other united nations to formally request the Soviet Union to enter the war. He added that the Soviet government certainly believes that a treaty should be concluded with the Chinese government before entering the war.

This request was a problem for us. The Soviet Union had already signed a non-aggression pact with Japan, and the Soviet government had also signed a similar treaty with Hitler, but it was the Nazi Party that broke this treaty. We did not believe that the US government should ask other governments to violate agreements without good and sufficient reason. The Soviet Union had notified Japan several months ago that it did not intend to renew the treaty, but it was still in effect for almost a year. The President was troubled by this.

### Reader's Mailbox How Should Overseas Chinese Deposits Be Repaid?

Editor: The method of repaying pre-war deposits has been passed by the State Council and will be announced after the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative procedures on the 7th of this month. However, I am deeply surprised that no preferential repayment methods have been formulated for deposits made by overseas Chinese using foreign exchange converted into legal tender before the outbreak of the Pacific War. As a representative of the overseas Chinese press, in addition to submitting this to the heads of relevant agencies, I would like to use your newspaper's precious space to express the grievances of our overseas compatriots who have suffered losses.

During the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese provided a steady stream of foreign exchange to support the central government, launched large-scale fundraising and donations, and enthusiastically underwrote national salvation bonds, demonstrating their loyalty to the Party and their patriotism.

Before the Pacific War, the Singapore Overseas Chinese Bank repeatedly appealed to overseas Chinese to use British currency to convert into national currency for deposit, in order to enrich the national treasury and increase the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, and declared that it would guarantee the principal and offer generous interest, and would bear the trust responsibility. At that time, the overseas Chinese were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, and in addition to saving money and generously donating to charity, they also transferred funds originally stored in foreign banks to the Bank of China and converted them into national currency. Many even sold part of their property to save money, because they had great confidence in the government's credit.

As soon as the Pacific War broke out, the various islands of Southeast Asia successively fell, and the city banks hastily withdrew, so all overseas Chinese deposits have been frozen to this day.

Based on the above situation, the government repeatedly claims to care for overseas Chinese, and now we can only wait for the facts to be demonstrated. Our request is very simple: please take into account the sincerity of overseas Chinese who used foreign exchange to deposit national currency in the past, and repay the original amount of foreign exchange without interest (in the 29th and 30th years of the Republic of China, every 1,000 yuan of national currency deposit was equivalent to about 200 US dollars). If the current foreign exchange position is tight, a special multiple repayment method in legal tender should also be established, because most of these deposits are the hard-earned savings of ordinary overseas Chinese who have worked like oxen and horses in foreign countries for many years. The Bank of China must also keep its promises, so as not to be regarded as a terrible trap.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the so-called funds for the repatriation of overseas Chinese, although ultimately a fruitless show, we have never dared to utter a single complaint because we sympathize with the country's economic difficulties. However, if these deposits are swallowed up invisibly and completely, we will launch a petition protest and ask the national media to uphold justice. Sincerely, with respectful greetings! Executive Committee of the Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association of Various Regions of Southeast Asia. Li Junxia, special correspondent of the Singapore Sin Chew Daily and the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily, stationed in Beijing and Shanghai. November 3.
