### Assisting Our Government in Guarding Territorial Waters: Sino-American Naval Agreement Signed; Many Gratuitously Transferred Vessels Already Delivered

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The Sino-American Naval Agreement signing ceremony was held at 4:00 PM on the second floor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese side was represented by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie (Naval Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing was detained in Qingdao on official business and unable to return), and the American side was represented by Ambassador John Leighton Stuart. First, each signed two copies held by their respective countries, followed by an exchange of signatures. The entire process lasted only five minutes. Mr. Wang and Ambassador Stuart each handed the signed copies to the other party and shook hands in mutual congratulations, concluding the ceremony. Zhou Xianzhang, Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters, Liu Shirshun, Political Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ling Qihan, Director of Protocol, Hu Qingyu, Director of the Treaty Department, Li Ziming, Director of the American Affairs Department, as well as Mr. Clark, Minister of the American Embassy, and Colonel Oswald of the U.S. Military Advisory Group were all present to witness the ceremony.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Dr. Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, representing the government of the Republic of China, and Dr. John Leighton Stuart, Ambassador of the United States of America to China, representing the government of the United States of America, signed the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America regarding the transfer of naval vessels and equipment in accordance with Resolution 512 of the 79th Congress of the United States of America at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 8th.

This agreement implements Act 512 passed by the 79th Congress of the United States on July 16, 1946, and approved by the President of the United States, to gratuitously transfer certain naval vessels and floating drydocks exceeding the needs of the U.S. government to the government of the Republic of China. A significant portion of the vessels included in this agreement has already been transferred to the Chinese Navy under lease-lend provisions. These vessels are now nominally being recalled and transferred to China under the terms of this agreement.

The transfer of these vessels to China is to assist the Chinese government in defending its coastal and inland territorial waters and to safeguard and improve the safety of navigation in its territorial waters. None of the warships exceed the size of escort destroyers.

The agreement also provides for technical information and advice regarding the organization, maintenance, and supply of the naval institutions of the Republic of China. December 8, 1947.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The Sino-American Naval Agreement signed in Nanjing is to implement the act passed by the U.S. Congress on July 16, 1946, regarding the transfer of surplus naval vessels to China. This act was proposed by U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and approved by President Truman to assist China in establishing a navy with a total tonnage of 300,000 tons. The transferred warships consist of 271 surplus vessels of the escort destroyer class, including two destroyer patrol vessels, twenty-four minesweepers, twenty-eight submarine chasers, one hundred and ninety-three landing craft, two repair ships, three oil tankers, one survey vessel, six motor torpedo boats, six pontoon rafts, six light ferries, and two mobile floating docks and much other equipment.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] According to the Sino-American Naval Agreement signed in Nanjing on the 8th, the earliest of the 271 vessels gratuitously transferred to our country by the U.S. side were the eight leased escort destroyers Taikang and Taiping led by Lieutenant Colonel Lin Zun, minesweepers Yongsheng, Yongshun, Yongding, Yongning, submarine chasers Yongtai, Yongxing and the transport supply ship Emei transferred later in Qingdao, which arrived in Shanghai on July 19 last year. After the gratuitous transfer act was passed by the U.S. Congress and approved by President Truman, and announced by the Department of the Navy, a portion of the U.S. Navy landing ship fleet serving in the Far East began to be handed over to our country, jointly handled by our Seventh Fleet and Naval Training Corps in Qingdao. By September of this year, the vessels received included ten tank landing ships Zhonghai, Zhongquan, Zhongding, Zhongxing, Zhongjian, Zhongye, Zhongyu, Zhongji, Zhongcheng, Zhonglian, each with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, six medium landing ships Meizhen, Meile, Meisong, Meigai, Meipeng, Meisheng, each with a displacement of 912 tons, six infantry landing craft Lianzhen, Lianbi, Lianguang, Lianhua, Liansheng, Lianli, each with a displacement of 380 tons, and five tank landing craft Hezong, Hequn, Hejian, Heyong, Hecheng, each with a displacement of 279 tons, totaling 28 vessels including the largest transport repair ship Emei (displacement 15,000 tons), with a total displacement of 64,000 tons. Apart from a portion that has been formed into a fleet for service, a portion is concentrated in Qingdao for the training of naval officers, and the remaining gifted vessels continue to arrive in China. The agreement on the 8th is a general treaty provision for this transfer work, so that this work can be quickly completed on a certain basis.

### Expanding Military Advisors: Preliminary Plan Underway

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] This agency has learned from reliable sources that the U.S. Congress or President Truman has instructed to provide the Chinese government forces with comprehensive military assistance. The U.S. Military Advisory Group is about to expand, and its preliminary plan is underway on both the Nanjing and Washington sides. Although responsible officials declined to comment, according to the most reliable estimates, U.S. senators have repeatedly requested direct assistance to the Nationalist army. Once passed, the total number of advisors for the army, navy, and air force will increase to 5,600, allocated as follows: Army, at least 3,600 (currently 300); Air Force, 1,600 (currently also only 300); Navy, 300 (currently only 116). Washington has not yet expressed its position on this expansion, but the U.S. government has no choice but to consider it due to repeated requests from members of Congress and those who are concerned about the situation in China. The expansion plan will naturally focus on General Lucas, the head of the Army Advisory Group, for two reasons: first, China's current military problem is land warfare; second, the members of the U.S. Navy and Air Force Advisory Groups, according to the original plan, if fully implemented, are already sufficient for expansion. The Army Advisory Group is currently taking the first step of participating in the direct training of Chinese troops in Taiwan. According to experts, the authority of the advisors must be extended down from the Ministry of National Defense to the regiment level in order to be effective. If so, the current number must be increased by five to ten times. The Navy Advisory Group currently has only one-third of its approved personnel. Rear Admiral Murray, the head of the group, declined to comment on increasing the number, but it is heard that expanding to the prescribed number would allow every warship in the current Chinese Navy to have an advisor, and there would also be a considerable number of advisors in the naval academies and headquarters. The Air Force Advisory Group, headed by Brigadier General Thomas, is implementing the plan passed by former Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen and President Truman after the victory over Japan, in which the United States would provide advisors to the Chinese Air Force, down to each detachment, in order to effectively train personnel. This plan was drafted by General Stratemeyer, then commander of the U.S. Air Force in China, but only a portion of it was implemented, with the number of personnel assigned less than one-fifth of the prescribed amount. According to informed sources, the United States is currently actively pursuing a plan to maintain 54 air squadrons, which has caused aviation experts to feel that it is insufficient. If China wants to obtain sufficient U.S. Air Force personnel to complete its original plan, it will inevitably be somewhat difficult. In addition, there is another issue related to the expansion of the advisory group, which is the supply of housing in Nanjing and other places, which is also being considered. The Chinese government has had considerable difficulty in providing housing for the existing advisors, causing many senior military officers to be unwilling to be transferred to China to avoid prolonged separation from their families.

### Establishment of Sino-American Tobacco Loan: Tobacco Merchants' Association Unaware

[Report from this newspaper] It is rumored that a Sino-American tobacco loan has been established, amounting to $30 million, managed by a foreign company manager in this city. When reporters inquired about this matter with the Tobacco Merchants' Association, they said that they were unaware of it. Two weeks ago, the Tobacco Merchants' Association, hearing rumors that a soon-to-be-successful American loan would be paid with six or seven kinds of materials, with tobacco as one of them, immediately submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance requesting that tobacco imports not be allowed, on the grounds that: commodity loans should be limited to those beneficial to national construction, tobacco is entirely a consumable, and our country can produce it ourselves. As evidenced by the fact that domestic tobacco was able to be self-sufficient during the War of Resistance, allowing large quantities of American tobacco to enter at this time would bankrupt domestic tobacco farmers. In the past, the Tobacco Merchants' Association has fought with the Transportation Control Committee to reduce the import quota for foreign tobacco. As a result, the quota has been reduced from $8 million in the first quarter to $5 million, and the $3 million saved has been used entirely to purchase paper for domestic needs. Allowing part of the loan to be paid in tobacco at this time is a form of disguised dumping, which is detrimental to both national economy and people's livelihood. The association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance the day before yesterday, the gist of which was: the content of the American loan has not yet been determined, and everything that is rumored is not to be deeply believed. The points raised in the document are not without reason and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the National Economic Commission for further reference.

### War Materiel on Pacific Islands: Value Exceeds One Billion U.S. Dollars; Shipping to China Being Destroyed

[United Press, Washington, 7th Dispatch] U.S. Army officials say that the war materiel being destroyed on the Pacific islands is sufficient to equip many divisions of the Chinese army, but the problem of shipping this materiel to China does not seem easy to solve. According to the Army, there are already more than one billion dollars' worth of supplies on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. On Guam and Saipan, there are rusted tanks, radar equipment, and aircraft, but Army officials say that although Congress is demanding U.S. aid to China, the cost of preserving this materiel will exceed its original value, but it is much less than the cost of shipping it to China.

### Opening Gold Trading: Finance Ministry's Four Principles Unchanged; Silversmiths Petition Transferred to Executive Yuan for Approval

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The silversmiths' request to open up gold trading to maintain their livelihoods has not been resolved for several months, and silversmith representatives continue to petition. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance on the 8th, the silversmiths' petition has been transferred to the Executive Yuan for approval, but the basic attitude of the Ministry of Finance remains unchanged. This basic attitude is: Gold bars cannot be bought and sold absolutely. The Central Bank must not supply gold to silversmiths to prevent it from flowing into the black market. Gold can be bought and sold openly, but the price should be around the market price of $40. The price of gold jewelry can be regulated by the local Social Affairs Bureau, and the legitimate profits of the silversmiths should also be taken into account. The Ministry of Finance finds it difficult to allow gold trading beyond these limits.

### In Order to Meet Actual Needs, the Government Should Issue Large Denomination Notes Above 10,000 Yuan Quickly: An Economist Discusses the Current Financial Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] "The government should issue large denomination notes above 10,000 yuan as soon as possible to meet actual needs. Currently, even transactions of slightly larger amounts in the market are already suffering from a shortage of chips. If the government does not solve this in time, the end of the year is approaching, and various industries will need more cash. At that time, adverse phenomena such as high premiums may occur. If the government then seeks remedy, it will be too late." This is the conclusion made by an economist to reporters after analyzing the current financial situation. He said that the National Federation of Commerce and the National Federation of Banks have repeatedly suggested to the financial authorities to issue large denomination notes immediately because they saw that there was a shortage of chips in the market. Recently, the National Federation of Banks also decided at its board meeting in Shanghai to request the government to issue large denomination notes above 10,000 yuan immediately. However, the authorities, fearing that it would stimulate prices, have not only delayed it but have also denied such rumors. This is actually superfluous. The issuance of large denomination notes is not the cause of high prices. On the contrary, it is because of the high prices that large denomination notes have to be issued due to actual needs. It can also be said that it is the result of high prices. He then compared the current face value of banknotes with the prices, saying: The highest face value of legal tender circulating in the market today is 10,000 yuan, but considering that current prices have increased 50,000 times compared to before the war, today's 10,000 yuan is only equivalent to 20 cents before the war. Before the war, the issuance of legal tender was stipulated to have five denominations: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Comparing this with prices, 1 yuan before the war is equivalent to 50,000 yuan today, and 100 yuan is equivalent to 5 million yuan. From this point of view, if it is said that the government is reasonable in not issuing large amounts of legal tender in order to avoid stimulating prices, then why did the "large denomination notes" of 1 yuan to 100 yuan before the war not cause market chaos and price fluctuations? Facts prove that the cause of stimulating prices is definitely not whether or not large denomination notes are issued. This is only an excuse for speculators to seek profits. Finally, he also suggested that the government should not hesitate to issue large denomination notes. In order to adapt to the needs of transactions, it should not only issue 50,000 yuan notes, but also issue 500,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and even 5 million yuan notes at the same time. However, how to maintain the value of the currency and reduce the amount of issuance is another responsibility of the government.

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] A key official of the Ministry of Finance stated today that the government will issue two types of Customs Gold Units, 1,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan, before the end of this year. The initial distribution work has now begun.

### Government Drafting Important Plan to Solve Current Financial and Economic Problems; General Budget for First Half of Next Year Under Review

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] In order to achieve the goals of securing foreign aid and self-reliance, the government, after deliberation by the Executive Yuan, has decided to draft a plan to solve the current financial, economic, political, and military sectors. This plan is divided into two parts: constructive, with a longer period of application; a short-term, palliative approach to current problems. Regarding the latter, it has been decided that Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, and Weng Wenhao will draft it.

[Another Dispatch] The national general budget for the first half of the 37th year (1948), regarding the departments of the Executive Yuan, has been approved by the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 6th. The Comptroller-General's Office of the National Government will begin reviewing the budgets of the remaining four Yuan (Judicial, Legislative, Examination, and Control) and their affiliated institutions starting on the 8th, which will take about a week to complete. According to reliable sources, the ratio of expenditures in the 36th year (1947) to the original budget is approximately four to one, or even more. On the revenue side, it has also increased by more than double the original budget, but this has further exacerbated the imbalance between revenue and expenditure.

### Xu Kan, Comptroller-General, Discusses Balancing Revenue and Expenditure

[Another Dispatch] Comptroller-General Xu Kan met with reporters on the evening of the 8th and discussed matters relating to balancing revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices. He said that the conditions for balancing revenue and expenditure are no more than two major principles: increasing revenue and saving expenditure. In the part of increasing revenue, in addition to reorganizing tax collection, that is, developing new tax sources, production should also be increased to increase the wealth of the people. Next, is raising debt. Regarding the part of expenditure, it is only about reducing expenses. Xu also said that some tax regulations and measures should be revised to conform to the actual situation so that the taxes borne by the people can be turned over to the government. Finally, Xu discussed the issue of prices, believing that several factors must be achieved, such as: A, improving the treatment of officers, soldiers, and public school teachers; B, settling urban, inland, and rural areas for stability; C, engaging in production; D, restoring transportation. In this way, society will be stable, and prices will not rise.

### Guangxi Provincial Government Decides to Form Exploration Team: To Explore for Atomic Energy Raw Materials; To Depart Next Month to Inspect Uranium Mines in Eastern Guangxi

[Our Guilin Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] Since the discovery of the atomic energy raw material uranium and uranium mines in Zhongshan and He counties in this province, it has aroused great attention among the people of the country. Minister Bai Chongxi has repeatedly urged the provincial government to explore as soon as possible. The Guangxi Provincial Government has now decided to form an exploration team to conduct surveys next month, and has hired experts He Jie and Cai Chengyun, professors at Guangxi University, to participate in the work, which is expected to be completed within one year.

The distribution area is 20 kilometers east-west and 220 kilometers north-south. The minerals are produced in the granite veins in Huangqiangping. Three types have been discovered: 1. Lemon yellow powder and flake-like clumps, which are uranium phosphate minerals. 2. Reddish-brown, ochre yellow, and light green oily crystals, not yet determined to be what kind of mineral. 3. Black, fine-grained, dense colloidal minerals, which appear to be asphalt minerals. The minerals were discovered in the tailings of the Shuiyanba tin mine in the area where Zhongshan and He counties border. After testing, it was proven that there is indeed abundant uranium mineral present.

### Fierce Fighting Expected on Both Sides of the Southern Henan Pinghan Railway; Bandit Liu Cut into Two Sections; National Army Advancing Westward from Guangshan Continues Pursuit

(Our newspaper, Jiujiang, 8th) Today's battle situation on both the east and west sides of the Pinghan Railway in southern Henan remains fierce. The number of Bandit Liu's westward-fleeing troops is close to ten thousand. Bandit Liu himself may still be directing operations near the Luotian-Xuanhua Dian highway. Although it has been discovered that three columns with the numbers one, two, and ten have sneaked across the railway to the west, it is possible that some of the bandit forces are still entrenched in the Dabie Mountains. Bandit Liu's independent column is mostly composed of local communist rabble, who may remain in the Dabie Mountains. A senior military official told our newspaper reporter today about the battle situation in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area over the past week. The official believes that Bandit Liu's westward flight was within the expectations of the Jiujiang Command's encirclement and suppression plan. Therefore, after the Jiujiang Command implemented command authority on the 27th of last month, in addition to using a large force to pressure Bandit Liu from south to north, it also set up a tight net on both sides of the Pinghan Railway. The westward-fleeing bandits are being beaten everywhere and running into walls. The fighting on both sides of the railway today is part of this plan. Overall, the battle reports today indicate that the war on that front has become white-hot. Minister Bai is currently stationed in Wuhan and sometimes goes to the front lines to direct or inspect the positions. (Nanjing, 8th) The National Army in southern Henan has broken Bandit Liu's attempt to cross the railway. On the night of the 6th, Bandit Liu's main forces, the first, seventh, and twelfth columns, were pressured by the National Army and fled westward through Luoshan and Guangshan, via the Fu Danjiao area. After being ambushed by the National Army in Xinyang and Liulin, they have been cut into two sections. A small group of about thirty who crossed the railway was surrounded by our army on the 7th near Xishuanghe and Tan Jiahe south of Liulin. Fierce fighting continued until the morning of the 8th. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. The remnants fled to the Damao Fan area in the southwest, and the National Army is in pursuit. Its main force is still in the Liulin area, where it is being encircled and annihilated by the National Army. The National Army, which is pursuing and suppressing from Longsheng Town south of Dashan, has advanced to Dashan Chong; the National Army, which is advancing westward from Guangshan, has directly attacked Dupihe. The bandit forces in this area have reached the end of their road and are now scattered in small groups. A small group attempted to flee south to the Jianqiao area east of Guangshui,

while others fled from Fuchuan to Liudian, and on the 8th, they fled again to Gushi. Currently, the National Army is advancing from Lijiaji, Guangshan, and Shangcheng to coordinate with the Gushi garrison and encircle the bandits. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

(Our newspaper, Hankou, 8th) The Provincial Senate has telegraphed the central government again, requesting the addition of more troops to defend the north and provide support to Xuan County to secure the Han River defenses. The Hankou-Zhengzhou express train on the Pinghan Railway has recently been suspended due to Communist bandits disrupting the Liulin Station. All trains on the railway will also be suspended from today. The First Column of more than 10,000 Communist bandits at Liulin Station, after being tracked and pursued by the National Army, scattered towards Luotuo and Moshicun on the morning of the 7th. A vanguard of over a thousand people had infiltrated Lijiaji, and the National Army is closely monitoring them. After the Communist bandits were driven out of Liulin Station, the railway was repaired overnight, and one kilometer of the damaged track has been restored.

Editorial

### Technical Problems of Economic Control

A doctor who only knows how to treat a headache by treating the head and a foot pain by treating the foot, and forgets to examine and treat the entire pathological condition, is definitely not worthy of being called a good doctor. It is not that local and palliative treatment is necessarily completely ineffective; on the contrary, sometimes it has quite good temporary effects. However, physiology is a whole, and the meridians are connected. A local special operation, if the severity is inappropriate, often affects the whole body, deepening the original symptoms.

Everyone knows that the current state of economic unrest is due to many reasons. To use a disease as a metaphor, it is like a multiple-illness syndrome. In addition, eight years of war of resistance and two years of internal turmoil have left the country ravaged and its vitality greatly weakened. In addition to careful examination and prescribing the right medicine, we must also pay attention to investigation and recovery of its physical strength. After excessive weakness, if strong and aggressive drugs are administered indiscriminately, excessively weakening resistance, this is certainly not an appropriate method.

Therefore, no matter how improved or strengthened the economic remedial measures are, we believe that there are several principles that must be taken into account at all times. One is national, or at least city-wide. That is, within the same economic unit, all controls, distributions, and other measures should be equal, universal, and mutually beneficial, so as to achieve a fair and equitable state. Do not favor one over another, and do not focus on one while losing sight of the other, so as to increase public discontent and destroy the results of your efforts. Specifically, all current regional or class-based local measures are theoretically not very satisfactory.

The second is liquidity. Whether it is goods or finance, its role lies in free circulation. Unless there are other international policies, so-called free trade is not easily adopted by most countries. Within a country, however, if barriers are deliberately set up between regions, or local authorities are allowed to impose bans at will, hindering transportation, this kind of deformed situation is neither permitted by the central government nor sympathized with by public opinion. For example, regarding the circulation of rice, has the central government not repeatedly ordered that provinces not be allowed to impose bans without authorization? The circulation of customs currency and Taiwan dollars has been repeatedly criticized by all parties for hindering unification. By analogy, the recent measures of the National Bank to control remittances and stop loans should only be regarded as temporary measures and should not be continued for too long. The pros and cons of the situation are explained in detail in a recent telegram from the City Council to the Executive Yuan. In short, the piecemeal blocking measures are contrary to the principle of blood circulation and the free flow of goods, and of course, they are not long-term solutions.

The third is consistency. This contains two meanings: one is the consistency of the measures before and after, and the other is the consistency of the procedures when each agency implements them. If it is advocated today and canceled tomorrow, or even strictly ordered to be banned, such as the past gold policy, export subsidy policy, public utility subsidy policy, textile industry control policy, and the policy of price limits and price negotiations that are sometimes tightened and sometimes relaxed. The reasons for the sudden changes may be justified at the time, but in the general perception, there is always a sense of panic, and merchants especially regret the loss of their basis. We believe that when enacting laws, it is fine to consult widely and carefully, but once the clauses are formulated and officially implemented, they should not be changed in the morning and evening, causing much confusion, and even contradict each other. This is important for the government's credibility, not just for the sake of convenience for the people.

Every law often involves two or more agencies in its jurisdiction. Therefore, in the implementation, it is inevitable to consult with each other, delaying the time. When the consultation is not satisfactory, it is inevitable that each will act in its own way, resulting in duplication and shirking of responsibility. This is a common problem now. In fact, although the relevant agencies may involve two or more, there are clear distinctions between the responsible agency and the assisting agency. As long as each adheres to its duties and responsibilities, it will not easily lead to disputes and shirk of responsibilities. For example, the recently promulgated organizational regulations of the Financial Supervisory Bureau clearly stipulate in Articles 1 and 4 that the competent authorities are the Financial Supervisory Bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, etc., and the assisting agencies are the local governments and related agencies. If the matter involves the responsibilities of other agencies, they may also handle it jointly. According to these articles, the division is very clear and will not lead to the above phenomena. It can be seen that many of the current disturbances are not due to the laws themselves, let alone the lax enforcement, but rather to the lack of understanding of the relevant parties.

In short, laws are dead, but how to enforce them is alive. It is valuable to adapt to the times, weigh the pros and cons, and eliminate the bad habits too much so that the people can be convenient. On the one hand, the government's expected goals are achieved, and on the other hand, the original intention of supporting industry and commerce is not lost. This is to be good at abiding by the law and good at carrying it out. Take the matter of cracking down on hoarding, for example. If the "Regulations on Cracking Down on Hoarding of Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" are strictly implemented according to the letter of the law, universally and strictly, then the transfer and storage of all designated daily necessities must be reported, registered, inspected, priced, sold on consignment, or purchased. In large cities such as Shanghai, it is almost impossible in fact, unless it is intended to suffocate it and make it completely immobile. Because merchants are subject to many restrictions in every move, they will feel very inconvenient, and even the trade associations and competent authorities will not have enough manpower to cope with this matter. However, if speculation is too hot and hoarding is too rampant, if one is not killed as a warning to hundreds and the illegal hoarders who are truly guilty are severely punished, it will not be enough to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, improving the legislation is one thing, and how to use the law well is another.

Another example is the control of yarn and cotton cloth. From the Textile Control Committee to the Textile Adjustment Committee, and then from the Textile Adjustment Committee to the strengthened Management Committee, there are constant improvements in personnel and organization. This is enough to show the authorities' attention and determination. Of course, we also hope that it can actively promote progress and achieve results day by day to achieve the goal of increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, the textile business has passed. Of course, it can be divided into three major parts: How to obtain sufficient raw materials? How to seek consistency between the current decentralization of manual spinning and weaving? How to carefully consider domestic and foreign sales, state-owned and private enterprises, so that each is in its place and each gets what it deserves? If these three major parts can be systematically linked together, coordinated and promoted in a unified way, this is of course management. However, it cannot be regarded as management if only a part of it is handled in a branch or only a fragment is handled in a part. However, the effect is bound to be different.

Economic control is originally an extremely difficult and cumbersome task. In addition to personnel, organization, and light expenses, is the environment suitable? Are other conditions fully met? These cannot be solved by ideals alone. Therefore, it is unreasonable to be pessimistic at the beginning of the promotion or to wait and see, watching success or failure, or to act in a way that is outwardly compliant but inwardly opposed, and unwilling to cooperate. It is also not a balanced argument to expect too much and blame too severely. Our opinion: For things that can be managed in fact and controlled in the situation, it is advisable to plan and implement overall control to increase efficiency; if there are too many problems, it is also a way to broaden the scope of operation and free operation, which is a way to move forward in different ways and achieve the same goal by different paths. In the part of prohibition or crackdown, more attention should be paid to increasing production and maintaining employment. Any means, any name, if the result is only to hinder production or create unemployment, that is not the original intention of the government's legislation, let alone what the general public expects. We have heard the following joke:

There was a hunchback who was sent to a quack doctor by his family for treatment. The quack doctor did not hesitate and simply clamped the hunchback tightly in the middle with two very thick wooden boards. After a while, the hunchback was clamped to death. His family questioned the quack doctor, who replied: "I am only in charge of treating the hunchback. As long as he is not hunchbacked, it is considered cured. As for life and death, that is another matter, and I cannot be responsible."

This is indeed a joke, and I don't think it really happened. But there are many people with a hunchback in the economy now. Those who are expected to treat economic diseases must take into account the problem of life and death, first maintain his life, and then talk about the problem of hunchback, which is the common psychology of the patient's family.

### Fu Zuoyi Talks About His Thoughts

(Continued from page 1) Fu continued to talk about his thoughts, saying: He feels deeply that his responsibility has increased as he takes on the military command of the North China Bandit Suppression. In the short term, he may even suffer some blame and slander, because he cannot create miracles and immediately satisfy the expectations of the people. Talking about the future bandit suppression work, Fu is very confident, saying that the Communist bandits today are "their evil is more obvious, and their crimes are more obvious." The people's certainty of right and wrong is the infinite power to suppress the chaos and build the country. At the same time, the central government has granted the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters full authority to command operations, reorganize troops, and reward personnel. In the future, with the concentration of troops and flexible use, the Communist bandits will not be able to use their tricks. Talking about the precautions for the future, Fu said: He encourages the troops to carry forward the traditional spirit of hard struggle. He humbly accepts the criticism and guidance of the wise and conscious. He asks patriotic compatriots to unite their strength and resolutely suppress the chaos, and hopes that knowledgeable people will vigorously promote and cooperate. He will reorganize the troops, strengthen combat power, maintain military discipline, and strive for military-civilian cooperation. He respects the party and government and cooperates with the party and government. He hopes that patriotic youths who joined the Communist Party for the sake of resistance will join hands with us and share the mission of national construction. We will do our best to rescue the good people who have been threatened by the Communist bandits and be responsible for arranging their future work and life. The military and the people will cooperate to pacify the local area. Fu said: "If the whole body cooperates and makes efforts, I believe that after a considerable period of time, we can pacify the rebellion and stabilize people's livelihoods." Fu said at the end of his speech: "With a heavy heart, I accept the arduous task. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and Director Li, I will unite the strength of the people, sacrifice and struggle, and do my best to suppress the chaos and build the country."

Support economic reform and implement the Principle of People's Livelihood to solve the current economic crisis. The declaration concluded: "Chairman is our leader in building the country.

### Commemorative Week at the Central Party Headquarters, Supplementary Commemoration of the Zhaohuo Uprising, Presided Over by the President, Report by Lu

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th) The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week this morning, and at the same time, a supplementary commemoration of the Zhaohuo Warship Uprising. President Chiang presided over the ceremony in person, and Committee Member Lu reported on the uprising and expressed his feelings, saying: Although this uprising failed, the whole country soon rose up in response, and Yuan Shikai finally collapsed. He emphasized that the Labor Revolutionary Party members need to have the spirit of great wisdom, great benevolence, and great courage. He pointed out that when the General was willing to give the presidency to Yuan at that time, he had the foresight to believe that once Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, the revolutionary forces could rise up. Later, the General reorganized the party into the Chinese Revolutionary Party and launched a campaign against Yuan, and said that the purpose of leading the revolution was not for personal gain, nor was it for a party or faction, but to overthrow the imperial system that had lasted for thousands of years and to return power to the people in order to build a country of the Three Principles of the People. He continued: At the time of the Zhaohuo Uprising, only one or two warships were available, and the military camp was only a few hundred people, but Yuan Shikai's henchmen were all over the country. However, the reason why they eventually failed and died was entirely due to the great courage of our revolutionary party members. He finally said: After the death of the General, the President inherited his teachings and led the revolution. Although there are many difficulties at present, if our party can continue to carry forward the spirit of great wisdom, great benevolence, and great courage, the goal of national construction will eventually be achieved.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Nearing Success or Failure; US, Britain, and France Confer Secretly on Countermeasures; Determined Not to Recognize Pro-Communist Delegation; Dulles Completes Mission and Returns to London

[Reuters, London, 8th] It is learned that the Foreign Ministers of Britain, the United States, and France held a meeting on the 7th, without the participation of Molotov. Although it was an informal meeting, it was the first time since the start of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference that a meeting was held by three Foreign Ministers instead of four. Officials did not disclose what Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault discussed. However, it is speculated that the three discussed possible steps to take if the Foreign Ministers' Conference failed. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the purpose of the three Foreign Ministers' meeting was to prepare for suggestions expected from Molotov on treaty differences, rather than to discuss the strategy of how to adopt a [decisive method] in the Foreign Ministers' Conference in the coming week. Reliable sources said that the re-arrival in London of General Clay, Commander of the US forces in Germany, and his political advisor, Fei Fei, from Berlin was related to the [German People's Congress] convened by the German Socialist Unity Party in Berlin, and was not to prepare for the conclusion of the London Conference. It can be almost certainly asserted that the United States, Britain, and France will reject the list of the German Socialist Unity Party in Berlin, as the three countries believe that this list was drafted by a conference of German political parties in the Soviet-occupied zone and cannot be regarded as a delegation representing Germany. However, whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can meet at this stage with a delegation considered to represent Germany is still subject to discussion.

[Reuters, London, 8th] In view of widespread rumors that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has already failed, Foreign Minister Bevin issued a statement from the Foreign Office today, saying that there has been no development to support the claim that this session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has failed. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to proceed as usual at Lancaster House on the afternoon of the 8th.

[United Press, London, 7th] Marshall's Republican consultant Dulles has returned to London after a three-day trip to France, where he met with the country's authorities. It is said that the results of this trip were extremely satisfactory. Dulles' main purpose in going to France was to explore whether the French government could support the merger of the British and American occupied zones in Germany in the event that the Foreign Ministers' Conference broke down. French Foreign Minister Bidault has indicated here that the French occupied zone is willing to participate in the merger if a breakdown of the conference is unavoidable.

### If the London Conference Breaks Down, the US Prepares to Issue New Currency; To Circulate in Germany and South Korea

[United Press, Washington, 7th] According to reliable official sources today: If the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference breaks down, the US Treasury Department plans to issue a new currency for use in Germany and Korea. This new currency has already been printed, and three cars have been transported from Washington to Bairokson under strict protection, ready for shipment to Germany.

Authorities have kept this secret for weeks, observing the success or failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to officials in charge of the occupied zones, the German mark and Korean currency will be revalued by the US government to prevent inflation. In Germany, the Soviet Union used printing presses supplied by the United States during the war in 1944 to print military notes in large quantities, flooding the western occupied zones, causing the black market value to fall far below the official price. After the new currency is issued, these military notes can be declared invalid. As of 1945, military notes were redeemed for US dollars at face value, totaling approximately $350 million. The printing of the new currency was approved by Britain. However, when it will be issued, whether it will circulate simultaneously in the British and French occupied zones, and its exchange rate with the current mark remain to be announced. The current mark is virtually worthless. As for Korea, the new currency can currently only circulate in the south. The exchange rate between the current Korean currency and the US dollar is set by the US military government at 50 to 1. The total amount of Korean currency issued before the war was approximately 7 billion. Now, the amount circulating in the south has inflated to 20 billion. The black market exchange rate is 300 to 400 Korean currency to 1 US dollar, whereas it was 50 to 1 before the war.

Residents of Le Havre have expressed their opposition to the three-month-long labor war.

### Optimistic French Situation, Yet Labor Disputes Hinge on Wage Agreement, Unions and Government Still Far Apart

[Reuters, Paris, August 8th] Hopes for resolving the strike, now in its third week, have diminished. The Central Labor Commission issued a statement indicating that the government's counter-proposals are insufficient to encourage striking workers to strengthen their position and persist until victory. The strike committee further stated: "The committee cannot agree with the government's attitude towards the main parts of the workers' demands. The strike occurred precisely because the government refused these demands." The biggest point of contention between the National Confederation of Labor (CGT) and the government is the workers' demand for a system to adjust wages in line with the cost of living. CGT Secretary Lebrun stated that the government's proposed minimum wage would be insufficient if the cost of living rose by another 10%. Labor Minister Marius Moutet stated last night that the government would never accept any form of temporary adjustment system. The main demands of the strike committee are: A general wage increase of 1,125 to 1,500 francs per month for industrial workers and civil servants. Effective guarantees for periodic proportional wage adjustments based on the cost of living and a suitable minimum. The Paris subway workers' union decided yesterday to strike for two days starting on the morning of the 8th in response to the symbolic strike of civil servants, but the independent union, comprising about one-tenth or two-tenths of the total workforce, has opposed the strike. According to the People's Daily, the Paris-Lyon express train derailed near Lyon yesterday, caused by someone removing the rail spikes, but fortunately no one was injured.

### Transportation Workers Call Off Strike

[United Press, Paris, August 8th] The Paris subway workers' union, affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), announced on the 8th that it was canceling the strike due to the majority of workers not responding to the call to participate in the 48-hour demonstration strike. On the morning of the 8th, when the strike was supposed to begin, Paris buses were still running normally, and the subway workers' union announced the cancellation of the strike shortly after 11:00 a.m. Civil servants were also scheduled to strike on the 8th, but largely ignored the union's strike order.

### Indonesian-Dutch Peace Talks Begin

[United Press, Batavia, August 8th] Under the auspices of the United Nations Good Offices Committee, the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia began a meeting on the morning of the 8th aboard the U.S. Navy ship "Renville" in Batavia Harbor. The Dutch delegation consisted of 15 people, and the Indonesian delegation 29. The two sides sat opposite each other at a conference table on the deck, with UN committee members and the ship's captain seated between the two delegations. The Dutch chief representative was A.K. Gani, and Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir personally led the delegation. The opening ceremony lasted exactly one hour, and formal discussions on the Indonesian issue will begin on the 9th.

### Emergency Foreign Aid Bill Expected to Pass U.S. House, U.S. to Continue Allocating Funds Until Next June

[United Press, Washington, August 8th] The House of Representatives is expected to pass the $597 million bill for winter relief to France, Italy, Austria, and China by a majority vote today or tomorrow. Once the bill is finalized, President Truman will address a joint session of Congress to announce the Marshall Plan, a four-year program to help 16 Western European countries recover economically after March, with funding of approximately $16 billion to $18 billion. However, annual funding must be voted on annually by Congress. Secretary of State Marshall estimates that initial funding of $1.5 billion will be required before June of next year to bridge the gap with the winter relief program.

### Italian Communist Party Demonstrations, Cabinet Reorganization Talks Underway

[Central News Agency, Rome, July 7th, United Press] The Communist Party here today directed about 50,000 of its members to march in Rome to show off its military strength.

The trade union executive committee also threatened that if the government could not meet its demands, it would launch a general strike starting at midnight on the 9th. The trade union demanded that special Christmas bonuses be issued to all unemployed workers and that the government investigate the incident on the 5th of this month when one member of the left wing demonstration was killed and 30 injured. Demonstrators clashed with police, injuring 19 police officers.

[United Press, Rome, July 7th] Premier Alcide De Gasperi continued to meet with the leaders of the Republican Party and the Moderate Socialist Party today in an attempt to bring these two small left-wing parties into the cabinet to broaden the government's base.

### British Troops to Begin Withdrawal From Holy Land Next Monday

The Turbulent Prospects of French and Italian Politics (Translated by this Newspaper's Editorial Department)

The Communist parties of France and Italy are currently working to undermine the strategy of the American plan to assist Western European recovery. They will receive instructions from the Soviet Union through the Cominform.

Representatives of the Communist parties of nine European countries recently met in Poland. Judging from the statement it issued, a shift in Communist policy has occurred, which is that the Soviet Union hopes that Communist party members in European countries will become closer military allies of the Soviet Union.

According to a dispatch from Warsaw, the new Cominform is openly directing the work of the Communist parties of nine European countries. France and Italy are the two places where the success or failure of the Marshall Plan is at stake, and the Communist parties of these two countries also participated in the Cominform. The other seven participating countries are the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states, namely Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria.

This new organization differs from the old Comintern in form and nature. The old Comintern was founded in 1919 with the goal of promoting world revolution. After the Soviet Union declared war on Germany, the old Comintern was dissolved in 1943. At the time, Stalin said that the dissolution of the old Comintern disproved the lie that Communist parties around the world were directed by the Soviet Union.

The new Cominform claims to be "democratic and patriotic." The founders of this organization never mention world revolution. Currently, its scope of action is limited to Europe. In theory, the Communist parties of the nine countries are all equal; however, in reality, the Soviet Union controls the other countries. The two Soviet representatives who attended the Polish meeting were both members of the Politburo, which rules the Soviet Union.

The current goal of the new Cominform is to undermine the Marshall Plan, which is also a goal of Soviet policy. But among the Communist parties of the nine countries, only the Communist parties of two countries have the most important tasks in undermining the Marshall Plan, namely the Communist parties of France and Italy.

The next step in the new strategy of the Communist parties and the Soviet Union is to enter France and Italy. In these two countries, the Communist parties do not participate in the government, but they are major parties and control labor organizations.

In France, Communist agitation could seriously undermine the government's efforts to reform the economy and implement the Marshall Plan. They hope for the collapse of the current government, but not necessarily for a major cabinet.

Communists recently tried to prevent French army trucks from transporting sugar to Germany in Verdun. This batch of sugar was sold by the United States to France and was intended for distribution to German civilians in the French occupation zone of Germany, but Communist newspapers argued that the sugar should be distributed to the French, not the Germans.

Such actions may increase in the future and become a major task of the French Communist Party.

In Italy, the Communist Party is currently considering taking strong action because they have failed to seize real power in Italy through elections.

Some Italians may abandon the Communist Party because the latter has openly allied itself with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the latter of which is a country that is competing with Italy for the port of Trieste. However, some Italians, in view of the inevitability of a showdown between the left and right, may abandon moderate political parties and tend towards extremism.

But the following points are worth noting, the success or failure of the new Soviet strategy depends on this: Due to the establishment of the new Cominform, anti-communist sentiment in France and Italy is bound to increase greatly; Strikes and demonstrations will generally become more intense, especially in Italy, which is most prone to radical change due to its weak armed forces; Special attention should be paid to how workers react to Communist leadership. Communist labor leaders have become powerful by claiming to protect the interests of workers. If French and Italian workers suspect that the Communist Party is following Moscow's orders and harming the interests of the workers themselves, the Communist Party's attempts to obstruct the Marshall Plan may collapse.

### All Shelters for the Poor to be Completed by Deadline

The previous City Council had proposed that private car owners in the city donate 1 million yuan each to be used for winter relief. After discussion, it was believed that implementation would be difficult, and according to statistics, there are only over 9,000 private cars in the city, most of which belong to government agencies.

### Gui Zhongshu Invented a Five-Line Chinese Shorthand

Simple Method, Easy to Learn

[Our Report] The famous lawyer Gui Zhongshu had previously created a "Gui's Word Collection," inventing the positional character search method, positional catalog method, etc., which is another progressive work after Wang Yunwu's Four-Corner Code Word Collection, making a great contribution to the scientific processing of Chinese characters. Recently, he realized that "Chinese shorthand" has not been actively promoted and utilized in our country, and the reason is that Chinese shorthand has not been perfected. After careful research, he invented a "Five-Line Chinese Shorthand," and it is said that he has applied for registration with the Ministry of Interior. He plans to gradually promote it in the future, and it is expected to achieve a landmark success in Chinese shorthand.

This shorthand method requires the use of five shorthand notebooks in the initial practice. The lines are divided into five colors: purple, blue, red, green, and black. The initials of the national phonetic alphabet, which are close to the colors, are marked on the line. For example, "zhi" and "chi" are written on the purple line, and "qi" and "ji" are written on the green line. When writing shorthand, you only need to identify the line or space of the initial, without writing the initial symbol. In addition, the finals in the national phonetic alphabet are divided into 14 single finals and 18 combined finals, each with special symbol regulations. If a word is formed by a final or an initial, the symbol is quickly written in the line or space of the initial in sequence. After the shorthand is completed, the Chinese characters are translated and written on the original five-line staff. Once the practice is proficient or can naturally use the symbols of initials and finals, there is no need to use the five-line staff, so the method is very simple and easy to learn. (Attached is a photo of Gui taking shorthand, taken by this newspaper)

### War Criminal Hoshino Takio Sentenced to Ten Years in Retrial

Six Other War Criminal Cases Decided at the Same Time

[Our Report] The former commander of the Weihaiwei Gendarmerie detachment, Japanese war criminal Hoshino Takio, was previously sentenced to death by a military court for allegedly killing 18 officers and soldiers of our Muping Security Team. The Ministry of National Defense believed that the evidence was insufficient and sent it back for retrial. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Shi Meiyu announced the verdict, changing the sentence to ten years of imprisonment. In addition, six other war criminal cases were also decided by the military court yesterday: The former Qingdao Gendarmerie Sergeant Mochide Minoru was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing civilians. The former Xiamen Security Team member, Korean Yang Mouzhi, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for robbery. The former Pudong Gendarmerie Captain Kamihoro Nobuya was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for using torture on non-military personnel. The former Xiamen Security Commander Fujiwara Keisuke was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for allowing his subordinates to rob and kill.

### Joint Relief Agency Prepares to Protest to the Executive Yuan Over Restrictions on the Quantity of Goods Unloaded by the Fisheries Management Bureau

[Our Report] The Joint Relief Agency is preparing to protest to the Executive Yuan because the Shanghai Fisheries Market restricts the quantity of goods unloaded by the Fisheries Management Bureau each month. A spokesman for the Joint Relief Agency claimed yesterday that the agency originally sent ships to catch fresh fish in Shanghai every month to solve the problem of the public's fish food and help suppress prices. Later, at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the number of fish caught and brought to Shanghai was reduced to 60 ships per month. Without prior discussion or explanation, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry ordered the Fisheries Market to limit the Fisheries Management Bureau to unloading 35 ships of fish per month, and now it is limited to 300,000 catties per month. This move undoubtedly raises fish prices and harms people's lives. The Fisheries Management Bureau, seeing that the fresh fish could not be unloaded and was rotting, had no choice but to send telegrams to fishing boats on various seas, ordering them not to return to Shanghai, but to go to ports such as Keelung, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Qingdao, and Tianjin. According to the spokesman, if the Shanghai Fisheries Market only limits the unloading of 300,000 catties per month, it only requires five Joint Relief Agency fishing boats, which can be caught in a week.

### A Loud Noise, a False Alarm at the North Railway Station, Passengers Jump Out of Windows, Three Injured

[Our Report] At 9:50 PM the night before last, the 10th train to Nanjing, which was parked at the North Railway Station, suddenly exploded in a section of the No. 893 third-class carriage before departure. With a loud bang, thick smoke spread everywhere, and the smell of gunpowder filled the entire carriage. Passengers, not knowing the truth, jumped out of the windows and fled, causing great chaos.

### Rental Dispute: False Accusations Out of Malice

Female Teacher Drafts Anonymous Letter, Handwriting Analysis Leads to Father and Daughter Being Investigated

[Our Report] Xianyang Chu was originally the tenant of the house at No. 203 Zha Pu Road. He sublet the remaining rooms to Xu Tianmou, the current manager of the Goods Department of the Chinese Culture Service Agency. Recently, due to the expiration of the lease term, a dispute arose, and a lawsuit has already been filed in court, requesting possession. It is known that Gu, eager to win, consulted his relative Wang Zhaoqi, a specialist in a certain bureau, who lives at No. 6, Lane 206, Chongqing South Road. His daughter, Wang Sumin (19 years old, a graduate of a university and a teacher at Xishi Middle School), drafted two anonymous letters and sent them directly to the Garrison Headquarters, alleging that the Xu family was a secret drug manufacturing organization. After receiving the letter, the Garrison Headquarters transferred it to the Police Bureau's Detective Section, which ordered officers to investigate for several days, but there was no concrete evidence. Xu was summoned to the bureau for questioning, who claimed that he was being falsely accused, and the motive may have been due to the housing dispute. In order to clarify the situation, the police bureau ordered the original manuscript of the lawsuit filed by Gu to be inspected and compared with the handwriting, confirming that it was written by the same person. At this point, Gu Yangchu and Wang Zhaoqi and his daughter Wang Sumin were summoned for questioning. However, Gu and Wang denied it, but the bureau, with conclusive evidence of anonymous false accusations, has transferred the case to the District Procuratorate according to law. It is reported that Wang Zhaoqi and his daughter have been temporarily allowed to be released on bail pending investigation.

### Public Utilities Bureau Sends Personnel to Station at the Factory to Dispatch Electricity in the Nanshi Area: China Electric Company Urges the Shipment of Generators

### Overseas Chinese Students in Japan Live in Hardship, Number of Returnees to Increase, Returnees Talk About Recent Situation in Japan

A group of 15 overseas Chinese students who returned to Shanghai from Japan a few days ago were provided with food and lodging by the authorities and were accommodated together with returnees from South Sakhalin Island. According to Yu Zhiqiang and Wang Ricai, graduates of the Imperial University, the recent situation in Japan is as follows: After the war, Japan continued to implement food rationing, but each person only received 2.5 go per day, which was not enough, so the black market was rampant, life was insecure, and theft increased. The general middle and lower classes of Japanese people still despise China. The more knowledgeable intellectuals express their goodwill and concern for the internal situation in China. Although many Japanese people still miss their past empire, most Japanese people are most concerned about obtaining improved and stable living conditions. The awakened Japanese people have called for building a "Sweden of the East," meaning that Japan should devote all its efforts to the development of culture and science and no longer dream of military expansion. The Japanese people's idol worship of the Emperor has changed slightly. They now regard Hirohito as a "human emperor," and only a few communists advocate overthrowing him. Japan's industry has not developed rapidly. According to a professor at a Japanese university in a lecture, Japan will not devote itself to the reconstruction of industry before the compensation issue is resolved, fearing that all construction will be used to offset compensation, so Japanese industrialists prefer to preserve equipment and raw materials without using them. Regarding the situation of overseas Chinese, it is said that those who used to open restaurants have now mostly changed to "coffee shops," but their livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, and the number of returnees will increase. In addition, there are more than 200 students studying in Japan, working part-time and studying, and their lives are also very difficult. They hope that the government will provide assistance.

### Returning from Jiujiang

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Short Stay in Fuzhou · Ending a Five-Thousand-Li Journey

[Our Newspaper, 5th] From Nanchang to Jiujiang, there is the Nanxun Railway, which is now under the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Administration and is the Nanxun Line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. We went to Jiujiang on December 3rd, taking the train. I imagined that the land along the route should be better than in eastern Jiangxi, but as soon as we left Nanchang, it was desolate and bleak. The train ran very smoothly, passing through some stations. After traveling for about three hours, Mount Lu came into view, and on the banks of Poyang Lake, there was still a patch of withered reeds. Before we knew it, we had arrived in Jiujiang.

Eight or Nine Tenths Harvest in a Bountiful Year

I, the reporter, had been to Jiujiang in September of the year of victory. At that time, it was unusually desolate. Today, revisiting the old place, I felt it was very lively. Crowds of people were coming and going in the streets. Not long ago, the Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense was located here, which made Jiujiang important and also made it active.

According to the old people of Jiujiang, this year's harvest is eight or nine tenths, which is considered a bountiful year. The population here is 140,000, and there are seven middle schools, including the Girls' Normal School. It is said that before the war, it was much more lively and the population was also larger. Now, because there are wars in Guangji, Huangmei, and other counties, many merchants and goods cannot be shipped out.

Jingdezhen Porcelain Business Not Very Prosperous

There are more porcelain shops in Jiujiang than in Nanchang, probably about a hundred. You can't walk five steps without encountering a porcelain shop, and the variety of goods in the shops is much greater than in Nanchang. Here, you can directly access Jingdezhen, the origin of porcelain. Porcelain made in Jingdezhen can be transported to Poyang Lake, and then transferred from Poyang Lake to the Yangtze River, where it is unloaded on the shore in Jiujiang. People who sell porcelain in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou also come to Jiujiang to purchase goods along the river. Porcelain merchants told me: This year's business is not very prosperous. The money from selling goods cannot cover the cost of replenishing them, and transportation is blocked in many places due to the flames of war, which is severely impacting business.

Xu Zuyi Reports that Jiangfang Can Be Carefree

Recently, the price of rice in Jiujiang has risen sharply, from 400,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan per dan in a matter of days. An officer from the command told me: "The military eats military rice, so the price of rice should not rise. Not only has the price of rice risen, but the prices of everything have risen accordingly." In order to show our concern for military affairs, we once visited Minister Bai Chongxi. Minister Bai was out on official business, and Chief of Staff Xu Zuyi hosted us at a tea party. Through this reception, we obtained a lot of war news. We also learned that the National Army defends the north bank of the Yangtze River, the security team defends the south bank, and the navy defends the river, so we can say that the river defense is safe.

Small Tour of Gan Tang Lake, Returning to Nanchang City

Jiujiang has a Gan Tang Lake, in which there is the Yanshui Pavilion, which is said to be the place where Zhou Yu of the Three Kingdoms trained naval soldiers. We looked out at the lake from afar and saw fishing boats, casting their nets and cruising on Gan Tang Lake, creating a peaceful picture.

We returned to Nanchang by railway, taking a railcar from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau. This type of car simply replaces the tires with railway wheels and can run very fast, traveling at 60 kilometers per hour.

Fuzhou, Visiting Farmhouses, Taro and Wheat Too Dry

Then, we returned from Nanchang to Shanghai, taking a passenger plane from the Central Aviation Corporation. We made a short stop in Fuzhou, where we inquired with local farmers and learned that there were droughts in several places in March and floods in several places in June. Now, it has been dry for months, and the winter wheat crop has been severely affected. The local unit of measurement for rice is 160 jin per shi, and the price is 1 million yuan per shi. Vegetable oil costs 33,600 yuan per jin. The price of goods is not low. Fuzhou produces oranges, especially in Yiyu Township, which is the most abundant. Lacquerware and tea are also very famous. Fuzhou City has a population of 400,000.

Taking off from Fuzhou again, we crossed high mountains and ridges, passed Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang, and Songjiang in Jiangsu, before arriving in Shanghai.

Immigration to Reclaim Jiangxi Province, Prosperity Can Be Expected

On this journey of nearly ten days, we passed through the four provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Jiangsu, traveling approximately 5,000 li. Comparing these four provinces, Jiangxi Province is the poorest. Due to its vast land and sparse population, desolation is everywhere, which has turned China's famous and abundant granary into a poor and unbearable place. What can be said here is that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is actively under construction, will soon be fully opened to traffic. We eagerly hope that relying on it, the densely populated provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang can immigrate and reclaim the land in Jiangxi Province, so that the products and culture of Jiangxi can interact with the products and culture of Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, and at the same time, the entire Southeast and Southwest can cooperate closely and prosper.

### Suzhou Cracks Down on Gambling Den, 52 Gamblers Captured

On the morning of the 6th, the police bureau received a report that a large gambling den was set up at the end of Shantang Street in Mudu Town, with gamblers as numerous as clouds and huge stakes.

### Underground Gold Stirs, White Coins Reign in Longshang

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 3rd (Air Mail)] There is no stock exchange in the Northwest. The manipulator behind the prices of goods is gold. On the surface, the gold shops in Lanzhou have stopped trading in accordance with the law, with their doors half-closed, but in reality, underground transactions are extremely frequent. A week ago, a "烚赤" (likely a local term for gold) soared from 5.9 million to 9 million, almost reaching the 10 million mark. Fortunately, the National Bank, on instructions, stopped all lending operations, and within two or three days, the black market price of gold fell back to 6 million. Other department stores were also affected, and prices gradually fell by 20-30%. Today, it is rumored in the market that the government has for the first time cracked down on a gold black market trader, seized 100 taels of gold on the spot, and handed him over to the Gaolan Local Court for interrogation.

Although gold is valuable, it cannot compete with white coins in various counties of eastern and southern Gansu. When I, the reporter, saw the use of hard currency in the Qinghai Tibetan areas a few months ago, I explained the phenomenon as a special border situation, but according to people who recently came to Lanzhou from southern Gansu, almost all counties in eastern and southern Gansu use white coins. In eastern and southern Gansu, white coins are rampant, prices are rising desperately, the market is chaotic, rumors are spreading like bees, and people are panicking. In order to stabilize prices and calm people's minds, in addition to cutting off the root of the problem and strictly controlling speculators, we should first start with "white coins"!

### The Origins of British Football (Part 2)

By Le Xiurong

This cup competition later became the standard for various cup competitions in England and is the most famous football cup competition in the world.

The FA Cup competition began in 1871. The first competition had 15 participating teams, with three teams dropping out. In the final, the Royal Watterloo team defeated the Royal Engineers team 1-0 at Kennington. Initially, only people related to the two teams attended the matches. Gradually, it has become the most watched football final in England.

In 1878, the Watterloo team voluntarily handed over the silver cup to the FA according to the regulations at the time. Unexpectedly, in 1895, Aston Villa won the cup, and the silver cup was stolen during an exhibition in Birmingham. In 1911, a second cup was made and presented to Kinnaird, the then president of the Football Association, to thank him for his contributions to football. At the same time, the Football Association decided to make an even more magnificent silver cup. This is the third silver cup for which 500 teams compete each year.

Before 1892, the finals were held at Kennington Oval. From then until 1914, they were held at Crystal Palace. After the First World War, they were moved to Stamford Bridge's Gilslade Ground, and since 1923, they have been held at Wembley Stadium. (The World Games next year will also be held here).

From 1893, the Football Association also organized an amateur cup competition, with about 400 teams participating each year. Both the FA Cup and the Amateur Cup are completely under the management of the Football Association.

According to the competition rules, there is no regulation for teams to distribute tickets. However, in 1887, it was stipulated that the ticket revenue before the quarter-finals should be distributed equally among the competing teams. In 1889, it was further stipulated that the teams participating in the quarter-finals could receive 50% of the tickets. But today, the Football Association gets one-third of the final tickets, one-fifth of the quarter-final tickets, and a very small portion of the tickets before the quarter-finals. Since last year, the ticket allocation for each club has been increased again. (End)

### Ministry of Finance Stipulates Flexible Measures for Transactions between Provincial/Municipal Banks and Commercial Firms: Restricting Lending Amounts and Requiring Next-Day Repayment

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the third provision of the measures for strengthening the control of financial operations in the economic emergency plan, excess funds of provincial and municipal banks should be deposited in local branches of the Central Bank or national banks. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance, based on the submissions from various provincial and municipal banks, provincial and municipal governments, and banking associations, stated that provincial and municipal local banks have the responsibility of regulating local finance, and it is inappropriate to sever ties with commercial firms. Moreover, interbank lending with commercial firms is based on mutual assistance and is very short-term, which does not seem to promote speculation, and does not conflict with the provisions of the economic emergency measures. It is requested that a flexible approach be taken, etc., which is considered essential. In order to stabilize finance and adapt to the needs of reality, six provisions are specifically stipulated:

If local credit is tight and commercial firms in various provinces and cities (municipalities directly under the central government) experience financial difficulties, provincial and municipal banks may, under the principle of not hindering their own operations, approve short-term lending upon request from commercial firms with good local credit and normal operations.

The total amount of such lending shall not exceed two-tenths of the bank's total deposit balance on the previous day.

The maximum amount of lending to each commercial firm shall not exceed one-tenth of the lending bank's daily lending limit.

The lending period shall be based on the principle of repayment on the following day, but if there are reasons such as inconvenient transportation or tight money market conditions, the term may be extended once, limited to one day, and shall not exceed five days at most.

The lending areas or approved lending institutions of provincial and municipal banks shall be stipulated in advance by each bank and reported to the Ministry for approval. Lending shall not be undertaken in areas or by institutions that have not been approved.

Each lending bank shall prepare and submit a monthly report on lending.

### Textile Export Commission States: Yarn and Cloth Exports Most Promising; Supplementing Raw Cotton and Enriching Domestic Sales Can Both Be Addressed

[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Export Commission recently expressed the following views to reporters regarding the need for yarn and cloth exports:

1.  The insufficient supply of raw cotton domestically is a severe fact currently facing the textile industry. It is estimated that this year, the amount of domestically produced cotton that can be purchased and supplied to the textile industry will only reach 4 million dan. However, the national number of spindles already in operation requires 8 million dan of raw cotton. Therefore, in addition to domestic cotton, there is a shortage of 4 million dan, equivalent to 1.1 million bales in Indian packaging, which must be supplemented by imported cotton. The foreign exchange payment for this amount of foreign cotton, calculated at the current US dollar value, is US$158.4 million. Calculated at the current Indian cotton value, it is 520 million rupees. Even if this amount of foreign exchange cannot be fully offset by yarn and cloth exports, at least a portion of it should be offset. Otherwise, even if one wants to import, it will inevitably be impossible. If raw cotton cannot be supplemented in full quantity, production will naturally decrease proportionally. In addition to greatly affecting daily necessities for the people, serious problems such as factory shutdowns and unemployment will arise.

As for the method of exchanging Indian cotton, it also has its advantages. It can not only import raw materials and increase production, but also enrich a portion of domestic sales. In reality, after the cotton is exchanged, the export of finished products is only an export of a portion of wages. Moreover, according to the current contract, the first batch involves shipping the cotton to Shanghai first, and then shipping the yarn and cloth from Shanghai. It also stipulates that one-tenth of the yarn and cloth produced in six months can be exchanged for cotton at a time. This is calculated from the date of the contract, so it will not affect current domestic sales.

2.  Among China's export commodities, tea has Indian tin as a strong competitor, and raw silk has Japan. Currently, the United States has greatly increased the production of soybeans in recent years, which will also encounter attacks. In the future, the most promising exports are textiles. The number of yarn and cloth sold in the South Sea Islands is quite large. Before the war, it was occupied by Japan. After the victory, Japan withdrew, and there is an extreme shortage of yarn and cloth. China should have risen up to replace it. If China's textiles do not strive for this market at this time (the Near East and Africa should also strive for it at the same time), future exports, or even the entire textile industry, will have no way to develop.

In short, given the current situation of considerable strain on national foreign exchange, insufficient domestic cotton production, the supply of existing spindles, and the international yarn and cloth market being in urgent need of seizure, importing cotton and spinning it into yarn and cloth, taking only seven-tenths for export to offset the foreign exchange paid, and the factory also gaining considerable profit, is a business that should be actively promoted and well prepared for. The only concern is that the export quantity will be affected by competition and will not be able to reach the predetermined ear within a certain period.

### Bankers Association Requests Issuance of Large Denomination Notes: Petition Submitted to National Bank

[Reported by this newspaper] An official of the National Bank told reporters yesterday that the petition submitted by the Shanghai Bankers Association and the Money Exchange Association requesting the issuance of large-denomination banknotes to solve the problem of cash collection has been submitted to the National Bank. He said that the National Bank has no opinion on this matter and will submit it to the government for a final decision.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Weak

The government bond market was very sluggish yesterday, with a turnover of just over 3 million. The rise and fall of various bonds were minimal. Unified C opened at 24,700 yuan in the morning, with the lowest price at just 24,100 yuan, but stabilized towards closing. Room 552 bought, while Rooms 503, 360, and 555 all offered supply. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B fell by 100 yuan, C fell by 300 yuan, Unified D rose by 100 yuan, and Unified E remained flat.

There were no special changes in foreign stocks either. Although Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric had a slight contraction, the stimulation was not significant. The rise and fall of Ewo Silk were very narrow, opening at 356,000 yuan and falling to a low of 351,000 yuan, before rebounding. Guangbang hongs sold, while bank hongs and retail investors bought slightly. As a result, compared to last Saturday, electric, military, and telephone remained flat, Landgrafen fell by 10%, shipping fell by half a percent, paper rose slightly, and the rest all fell slightly.

### Money Market Remains Tight

[Reported by this newspaper] The money market remained tight yesterday, with secret interest rates at 1.2%. The Huagu deposit rate was 2.55%. The four banks and two bureaus had a shortfall of 96.2 billion, with the Central Bank taking in 53.5 billion. The large exchange released 35.9 billion, foreign merchants took in 54.1 billion, the small exchange released 14.4 billion, China Joint Venture took in 13.7 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury took in 15 billion.

### Money Exchange Industry Supports Small and Medium Enterprises: Launching Small-Amount Loans

[Reported by this newspaper] Shanghai's money exchange industry leaders, such as Shen Rixin, believe that one of the original purposes of the industry is to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and to facilitate the turnover of small-amount funds. Therefore, they have decided to launch a money exchange loan syndicate, set up a management committee, and conduct two types of loans: small business loans and small-amount loans. The former targets small and medium-sized enterprises, while the latter targets public and educational staff. It is reported that the pre-determined loan amount will be a maximum of 5 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 5%. Fifteen people have been nominated and a subcommittee meeting will be convened today to draft organizational and lending plans, which will be submitted to the board of directors of the Money Exchange Association for approval.

P> Buyers Wait and See, Buying on Dips: Yarn, Cotton and Cloth Market Stable

The cotton yarn market opened steadily yesterday. The situation in the market was that due to the tight money market, new purchases were rarely active. People in the industry, suffering from tight capital, often sold at a painful loss, causing 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn to fall to 47.5 million yuan at one point. Later, because various hongs saw the price and absorbed it slightly, the closing price recovered to 48 million yuan, which was 200,000 yuan lower than Saturday. In addition to 32-count and Special Double Majincheng yarn, which rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan, other 16-count yarns generally fell by 200,000 to 400,000 yuan or 500,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth

At the initial opening, because the supply of weaving and construction from Saturday was very sufficient, the price once fell. However, due to favorable buying news and the favor of customer hongs, as well as actions taken on the street and retail replenishment, the market recovered at noon. As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloths of various grades rose by 5,000 to 12,000 yuan, and bleached cloth also rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Yesterday, the Huagu market saw volatile fluctuations because various news were still difficult to clarify and people's minds were uncertain. The rise and fall of various stocks were slight. Hwa Foong Enamel tokens were not selling well, and there were favorable buying rumors, so both spot and forward contracts had risen to the limit. The trends of other cloths seemed to show a situation of being outwardly stable but inwardly firm.

Spot Cotton

Yesterday's spot cotton market was mediocre. Yarn mills took delivery slightly, and transactions were quiet. There was little activity among peers, the market was quiet, and prices did not change much. 355 bales were traded, with the delivery price to factories being 4.96 million yuan for Shashi, 5.084 million yuan for Zhancheng, 5.167 million yuan for Jingyang, 4.3 million yuan for Han fine, and 925,000 yuan for Zhoupu cottonseed.

Weaving and Construction Sells Yarn

[Reported by this newspaper] China Weaving and Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,283 pieces, equivalent to 2,500.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 547 applications were received.

### Hua Shares Rise and Fall Slightly, with Volatile and Unstable Trends

Yesterday, Huagu saw volatile fluctuations because various news were still difficult to clarify and people's minds were uncertain. The rise and fall of various stocks were slight. Hwa Foong Enamel tokens were not selling well, and there were favorable buying rumors, so both spot and forward contracts had risen to the limit.

Morning opening saw low prices due to the large banknotes not being implemented and US loan news. When the market opened, Yong Silk retreated to 370 yuan and 380 yuan, and then further retreated to 360 yuan and 373 yuan. Some people took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the price recovered to 374 yuan for immediate delivery and 382 yuan for forward delivery. At this time, sellers started to sell, and the off-market interest rate opened high at 21% and 25.5%, and gradually fell to a low price of 361 yuan for immediate delivery and 368 yuan for forward delivery. The off-market situation was still good, and it rose slightly to 365 yuan and 372 yuan near noon. The noon closing price still retreated to 362 yuan and 370 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday's immediate delivery shares, China Silk fell slightly by 10%, China-France Underwear fell by half a percent, Yong Silk, Zhabei, Xinyihe, Mayar, Xinju, Jingfu, Qinxing, Lilian, Yonggong, Guohuo, Datong, Tongyi, and Rongfeng all fell slightly, China New Firecrackers, China Xing, New Asia, and Xinhua were flat, while Hwa Foong and China Textile rose slightly. For forward delivery shares, Hwa Foong was still flat, and the rest fell slightly.

The market sentiment was slightly better later in the day. It was reported that Hong Kong Electric had contracted, and Hwa Foong Enamel suddenly had news of establishing a branch factory in Kowloon. The buying trend started, and the number of tokens was limited, so both spot and forward contracts had stopped rising. Small stocks such as Mayar, China Silk, and New Light also showed a good color. Later, because the small exchange reported a shortfall of more than 100 billion at the time of exchange, and the National Bank must make up the difference, the market situation was again unsustainable. It gradually returned to a low price of 362 yuan and 366 yuan. Numbers 157 and 91 forcefully advanced and were then lifted up again, and the closing price rose again to 372 yuan and 376 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning closing price, the spot shares of Hwa Foong had risen sharply and closed at the limit. Yong Silk, Xinyihe, Mayar, New Light, Jingfu, Qinxing, China-France, Xinhua, Zhabei Underwear, China-France, Yonggong, Lilian, Guohuo, China Silk, Rongfeng, and Tongyi rose slightly, China Xing fell slightly, New Asia fell by half a percent, Jinglun was good for 10%, and firecrackers and Hwa Shin were flat. As for the forward shares, Hwa Foong rose sharply and closed at the limit, and the rest all increased slightly. Various foreign stocks in the off-market market fell slightly.

### New Organization of Textile Management Committee to be Officially Established This Year

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the central authorities have given principal approval to the organization of the National Textile Enterprise Management Committee, the management rules are still being studied in detail by the Textile Coordination Committee. It is reported that a draft can be completed within about a week and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The committee is expected to be formally established within this year, so that it can implement control matters starting next year.

The authorities have decided that the list of members of the committee will not include members of private factories. Private factories still maintain a silent attitude on this matter. However, Chen Shutong, Yun Zhang, and Wu Weijing discussed the matter and planned to invite Chen and Li to participate in the committee, and invite Wu to assist in the committee's business affairs. However, they said that after the new committee is established, the position of state-owned and private spinning mills will be no different, and they believe it is difficult to participate. Related parties also stated that if the new committee wants to promote the control work as much as possible, the selection of committee members should include two transcendent figures within the textile industry to participate and discuss, in order to communicate various difficulties between the control authorities and the spinning mills, so that any method can be implemented smoothly and eliminate mutual isolation.

### Rice Sales Improve

Yesterday, more than 17,200 stones of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets, and sales improved, rebounding after fatigue. White Japonica rice rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while thin Indica rice increased sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. White Yin Yuan rice digested actively, rising sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Indica rice also increased by more than 10,000 yuan, with ups and downs, and the situation tended towards a revolving pattern. Flour opened evenly, and rose rapidly near noon, rising by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Wheat bran was in short supply and high demand, soaring by more than 10,000 yuan, and the situation gradually increased. Soybean cake from Taiwan and Shantou continued to be ordered, and remained strong. Customer hongs selectively increased the high price of soybeans slightly, while oil mills were still slack, setting the price first and then becoming tired. Duzhong from Nanyang was favored and rose slightly by 10,000 yuan.

Mung beans had few spirits in the light trading, and it was not easy to move forward. Red beans were still rarely traded and were still in a dull and tired state. Broad beans were depressed, and red grain from the north was accompanied by business, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Corn from the north turned light after seeing the departure, and the source increased, falling back by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to be received by Guangbang hongs, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame saw customer hongs killing short and taking slightly, and the price on the street was also tight, but oil mills were cold, and the price fell slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and black sesame also fell by 20,000 yuan.

Due to Nanyang's purchases, the oil market saw unrefined oil soar early in the morning, but it was slightly weaker at noon. As a result, the price increased by 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories still supplied a lot, and followed the increase by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan successively, and clear oil was also high by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

### Reorganization of the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks is Ripe

[Reported by this newspaper] The reorganization of the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks has now reached a mature stage. After the reorganization, the committee of the Shanghai Branch will include nine units including the Ministry of Finance and national banks, with each unit sending two representatives to participate. After the reorganization, the branch will divide the work into five groups. It is rumored that Liu Gongyun has been internally appointed as the chairman, and other personnel and organizational matters are still to be decided at the headquarters' regular meeting this Thursday.

### Xu Boyuan Gives Speech on "Controlling Finance"

[Reported by this newspaper] Deputy Finance Minister Xu Boyuan gave a speech at the Shanghai Financial Issues Research Association yesterday, entitled "Controlling Finance". Xu said that according to the Ministry of Finance's data at the end of September, the total number of various banking institutions across the country, including national banks, provincial and municipal banks, county banks, commercial banks, money changers, silver shops, trust companies, and insurance companies, totaled 5,666 units. Among them, the head offices accounted for 1,941 units, and the branch offices accounted for 3,725 units. The number is second only to the United States and is unparalleled in any other country. The government paid special attention to three principles in the establishment and distribution of financial institutions during the war: encouraging the financial industry to set up institutions in the interior to make financial turnover in the interior more flexible, restricting the excessive concentration of financial institutions in large coastal and riverside cities to prevent hot money from wreaking havoc, and cracking down on underground money changers to protect the safety of social credit. The current stage of financial control aims to eliminate the black market for gold and banknotes and cracking down on commodity hoarding in a negative way, and to guide financial business to cooperate with economic construction, restore the original credibility of the financial sector, and stabilize the hearts of the people in a positive way.

### Woolen Fabrics Firm and Expensive

The woolen fabric market was still firm and expensive yesterday, especially for fancy tweeds, which were particularly scarce. Fancy tweeds with mixed colors were more popular than plain tweeds, and most factory stores were not willing to sell them easily. Mixed-color fabrics produced by Yuanfeng, Zhanghua, and Shanghai Xiexin were all sold for 1.3 million to 1.6 million yuan per yard, while single-color tweeds from Dacheng, Daye, Dahua, Daming, Yonghe, and Ruihua were all sold for around 1 million yuan per yard. Black and gray were still the most popular for overcoat fabrics. Because Milleden had risen too sharply, it created a good opportunity for China Textile, and retail sales were still strong. Trading was inferior to last week due to the relationship between money and short-term interest rates.

### Random Talks on Learning (1)

— Zhang Qiyun

Constructive Democracy

More than two years have passed since the end of the war. The cheers of victory have long faded. The world is still like a freezer in the depths of winter, and no one knows when spring will come to the human world. During the war, Allied people believed that they could promote understanding through mutual assistance and goodwill, but the result was that conflicts piled up. The ideological differences between the United States and the Soviet Union have deepened more than before. The interpretations of the word "democracy" by the United States and the Soviet Union are vastly different, as if they were separated by a chasm. The problem of thought is indeed the fundamental problem of the current myriad difficulties.

The Soviet Union's view of democracy leans towards collectivism. The government exists for the benefit of the masses or the proletariat. If the interests of the majority can indeed be taken care of, then who is in power and the method of exercising power are secondary issues. In the view of the Soviet leadership, anyone who can serve the people and sacrifice for the people, regardless of their style, is a democrat. This kind of interpretation seems to imply that the end justifies the means, which is obviously not satisfactory to the British and Americans. The British and Americans' view of democracy leans towards individualism, believing that the individual is the basic unit of the country, and every citizen should have ample opportunity for development, because without that, it cannot be called democracy.

There are many reasons for these two incompatible concepts. Religion, politics, society, economy, history, and geography all have their roots. Therefore, it is necessary to study from many aspects to be able to see the inside and out. In the current turbulent world, due to the Soviet Union's strong barriers and fierce challenges, insightful people in Britain and the United States believe that it is necessary to re-evaluate their traditional culture. Many new books published in recent years express this new idea, such as Professor George Norlo's "The Quest of American Life" (published by the University of Colorado in 1945), which is a good example.

The ancestors of the Americans crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the New World, and even issued the Declaration of Independence. Their motivation was to resist tyranny and oppose government control. Professor Norlo called Americans "a protesting nation" (A protestiag people), and its foundation lies in individualistic political freedom. Norlo called this spirit humanism. He does not use liberalism or democracy (democracy) because these two terms have been used too much and are easily misunderstood. Norlo's meaning is that the United States has certainly not yet reached the ideal realm of humanism. But in the history of the development of the American nation, every time it reaches a new period, it can often launch a powerful protest against domestic and foreign absurd actions. Since the nineteenth century, the United States has eliminated corruption and reformed internal affairs, which is another manifestation of the spirit of nation-building. More than ten years ago, President Roosevelt implemented the New Deal, represented by the T.V.A. system (my book "Travel Notes in the United States" has introduced it, pages 52 to 58 of the Commercial Press edition), which increased government power and implemented a planned economy. It was indeed an innovation movement, but was it not also a traditional spirit? The characteristic of the New Deal lies in its emphasis on greater social justice. In fact, the United States has been demanding social justice since its founding. President Roosevelt transformed American democracy from the old to the new, which is precisely to promote the inherent spirit of the United States. The program of humanism respects individual rights on the one hand and raises living standards on the other, taking the advantages of communism and discarding its shortcomings. Modern world thought is not as insurmountable as a chasm, but like layers upon layers upward. We need not worry about ideological problems. If we strive upwards with small breaks, the future will definitely be infinitely bright. Accordingly, the Y.V.A. plan, which is currently attracting national attention, relies on American science and technology, which is secondary. The most important thing is to engage in democracy experiments in a down-to-earth manner in the process of construction.

Human Ecology

The 79-year-old British literary giant H. G. Wells (1866-1946) has passed away. He was the greatest science educator of this century, integrating science and humanities. He has a deep foundation in physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, biology, etc., and a wide range of new knowledge. Relying on his extraordinary literary talent, he used writing to convey the Tao, integrating scientific principles and writing nearly one hundred works; including history, novels, and treatises on social and political issues. Among them, works such as "Outline of History" and "The Science of Life" (co-authored with his eldest son and Juliaa Huxley) have been translated into Chinese and have long been admired by the Chinese people. His work starts from the happiness of the entire human race, exploring the intricate meanings of the latest discoveries and inventions in various specialized sciences, and carefully elucidating their common principles, and explaining how human beings can innovate and seek more happiness in the many new issues that arise in this new era. This kind of intellectual effort, harp, is called human environmental science or simply human ecology by Sir Ric Gregory. (See British Natural Weekly Nature, September 21, 1946) Pioneering the study of human ecology is Wells's greatest contribution in his life. Originally, science only sought the cause and did not ask about the purpose. The purpose of human ecology is to understand the relationship between heaven and man, understand the changes of the past and the present, and enable scientific progress to have a moral impact. With the guidance of this torch, the human world can still hold new hope. Wells is a representative figure of modern neo-humanism.

### "Sincerity" and the Work of Learning and Deliberation

— Yan Qun

The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Sincerity is the way of Heaven; to make oneself sincere is the way of man. He who is sincere hits upon what is right without effort; he apprehends without thinking; he easily and naturally embodies the Tao—he is a sage. He who seeks sincerity chooses what is good and firmly holds it fast." (Chapter 20 of Zhu Xi's Annotations) It also says: "Next to him who is thus naturally sincere is he who attains to sincerity by cultivating himself. He who cultivates sincerity hits the mark. Hitting the mark manifests itself; manifesting itself makes him distinguished; being distinguished, he is able to influence; being able to influence, he is able to transform; being able to transform, he is able to nurture. Only he who is absolutely sincere can transform." (Chapter 23 of the same)

"Sincerity" is truth. The way of heaven and earth is nothing but truth, so it is said that "sincerity is the way of Heaven." "Seeking sincerity" is like seeking truth. It is not only seeking it, but also taking it as the standard for all actions and movements. This is the way of being human, so it is said that "it is the way of man." "Hitting upon what is right without effort" refers to actions; "apprehending without thinking" refers to knowledge; "easily and naturally embodies the Tao" means that in both knowledge and action, one can attain the Tao of the Mean, naturally and without any effort. This is what is called "sage." Sage is nothing else. The mind, body, inside and out, and all thoughts and actions are nothing but the ultimate Tao and principle, which is what is called "sincerity." The ultimate Tao and principle, from the perspective of its true and unwavering quality, is called sincerity; from the perspective of its neither excessive nor insufficient state, it is called the Mean. In fact, they are the same. "He who seeks sincerity" always adds vigilance and effort to the thoughts and actions of his mind and body in order to "choose what is good and firmly hold it fast." "Good" is the "Mean" that is neither excessive nor insufficient, and it is also the "sincerity" that is true and unwavering. The ultimate Tao and principle is here.

He who chooses what is good and firmly holds it fast exerts his mind to seek enlightenment of the ultimate Tao and principle, and exhausts his body's ability to embody it and practice it, so as not to lose it or fall away from it. This is the matter of "cultivating oneself." "Cultivating" means partial; attaining means reaching and exhausting. Partial refers to different things and matters; complete refers to common principles and public examples, which is what is called "sincerity." "Cultivating oneself" is like saying that one exhausts his partial knowledge, that is, investigates different things and matters, seeks to know the reasons for them, and then combines and connects them to reach the consistent common principles and public examples. This is the work of "seeking sincerity." The sage who is born with knowledge and acts in accordance with it, who is called "sincerity," is rarely seen in generations. Those who seek the next best thing are those who are called "cultivating oneself," so it is said that the next best thing is "cultivating oneself." However, accumulating the work of "cultivating oneself" will also lead to "sincerity," so it is said that "cultivating oneself can lead to sincerity." Once one reaches sincerity, then all that is known in the heart is the common principles and public examples, and all that is practiced by the body is the implementation of the common principles and public examples. What the body comes into contact with and practices are the different things and matters that have forms and traces that can be sought, so it is said that "it manifests itself." The common principles and public examples, which have no form or trace, are applied to the different things and matters that have traces and forms, and their effects are seen, so it is said that "it is distinguished." When principles and examples are distinguished among things, things all obtain the reasons for their existence, and what is obscure is not made clear, so it is said that "it is able to influence." Being able to influence the reasons for things, one can rely on their principles and examples to control and dominate them, so it is said that "it is able to transform." When influence transforms, changes arise; when changes arise, there is a way to adapt to the times and take what is appropriate to the circumstances. Its effects cannot be glimpsed by those who are confined to the empty and accustomed. Therefore, it is said that "it is able to nurture." The work of seeking sincerity is complete when one is able to nurture, so it is said that "only he who is absolutely sincere can nurture." Through cultivating oneself, one can also reach the ultimate sincerity and be able to nurture. This is the same as the work of Heaven's gift. Different paths lead to the same goal.

Indeed, "sincerity" is what is called "the sage of Heaven's gift." The completeness and wonderfulness of his innate virtue are the same as the natural nature of the way of Heaven. This is the ideal figure of our Confucianism, so he "inherits Heaven and establishes the ultimate," rectifies human relations, defines righteousness and principles, and is not subject to human relations, righteousness and principles. He is like Heaven and Earth in nature. As for "choosing what is good and firmly holding it fast," what is called "seeking sincerity" is actually a figure of reality. Although he is not a sage of Heaven's gift, he will eventually achieve the same work as "sincerity" through the exertion of effort over time. "Sincerity" is unattainable. To seek the next best thing is to "seek sincerity." From this, it can be seen that our Confucianism holds ideals, but also does not forget reality.

As for the way of "seeking sincerity" that it shows, the method of "choosing what is good and firmly holding it fast," it says: "Study extensively, inquire carefully, deliberate cautiously, discriminate clearly, and practice earnestly." (Chapter 20 of the same) Study, inquire, deliberate, and discriminate are used to choose what is good; earnest practice is used to firmly hold it fast. "Study" is to observe the conditions and states of things; "extensively" is like broadly. Broadly observing the conditions and states of things is to lengthen one's experience. "Inquiring carefully" is to carefully examine the experience of others in order to supplement what one's own ears and eyes cannot reach. "Deliberating" is to arrange and analyze what one has gained from experience, seek to connect them, and set up common principles and public examples; however, if one engages in this rashly, the defects of bias and crudeness will arise, so one must not deliberate without caution. "Discriminating" is to discriminate whether the connection is complete or not, and whether the common principles and public examples that have been set up are accurate or not; making them complete and accurate, then what has been set up is established and cannot be shaken again. Discriminating must be "clear," and if it is clear, then what is discriminated is precise and will not lead to errors. To seek to be like this, one must also broadly take real facts and things, and compare them with the established principles and examples to verify them. "Earnest practice" means holding fast to the common principles and public examples that have been established and cannot be shaken, and applying them to dealing with things and handling affairs, and truly reaping the benefits of their use. All of these are named learning's: "extensive study" and "careful inquiry" are to observe the relevant facts and collect them, (Observation for the enumeration of relevant instances) which is the first step of enumeration (also called induction); "cautious deliberation" is to explain the collected facts and create a hypothesis, (Explanation for the establishment of bypothesis) which is the second step of enumeration; "clear discrimination" is to reconstruct the hypothesis (that is, the established common principles and public examples) and establish them as common principles and public examples, (Establishisllment of general principle from the hypothesis) which is the third step of enumeration; using real facts and things to compare with the established principles and examples for verification, (Verification of the general principle by concrete instances) which is the fourth step of enumeration. As for "earnest practice," it is the implementation of the common principles and public examples, (Application of the general principle) which is also the matter of external derivation (also called deduction).

### The Way of Learning

— Shaoxiong

The thing most to be feared in the way of learning is the word "obstruction." To have something is to have something not seen. To have something not seen is to be unable to obtain the whole of truth, to use a part of the truth to represent the whole truth, and to use a view that is not entirely accurate to represent a view that is entirely accurate. To obtain one end is to think that the whole is here, and there is no need to seek elsewhere. It is like blind men touching an elephant, each clinging to the part they touch as the whole of the elephant. The common disease of ancient and modern scholarship is mostly similar to this. Xunzi's discussion of learning advocates dispelling obstruction. The two words "dispelling obstruction" can be said to be uniquely insightful and best express the spirit of scholarship. There is nothing else in the way of learning besides this.

The common disease of the current academic world can be said to be the word "obstruction." Many academic disputes arise from obstruction. For example, some people are conservative, and some people are progressive. The conservatives believe that everything of the ancients is good. The way of learning is only to restore the past, only to read the classics, and only to promote the doctrines of ancient sages can we revive the decadence and reverse the fate. The progressives believe that everything of the ancients is not in line with the current era, is outdated and useless, and only by thoroughly eliminating it can we establish a new foundation. The way of learning lies in eliminating the old and establishing the new, and in introducing new theories and new ideas to replace the old. This struggle between the new and the old is due to each being obstructed. The conservatives are obstructed by the past and do not know the present, and the progressives are obstructed by the present and do not know the past. Each statement has its merits and demerits. To understand the past and be versed in the present is to be successful.

For example, some people believe that what our country needs most at present is applied science, so school education should focus on practicality. All subjects that are not related to practical applications, such as literature, philosophy, and even pure science, do not need to be emphasized. The way of learning lies in seeking practicality, not in empty theory. On the contrary, some people believe that the way of learning lies in seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge, in pursuing truth, and not in application. To take application as the purpose is enough to hinder the progress of learning and the discovery of truth. The reason why Western science has today's brilliant achievements is that Westerners can inherit the spirit of Greek philosophers who sought knowledge for the sake of knowledge, and get rid of the shackles of practicality, so that they can progress day by day and reach today. These statements from the south have their own truths and are each obstructed. The former is obstructed by practicality and does not know theory, and the latter is obstructed by theory and does not know practicality. True learning emphasizes both theory and practice.

There are many examples mentioned above, and we cannot enumerate them one by one. We can cite one more example to conclude. Some people believe that the way of learning lies in seeking creation, in the discovery of new ideas, and not in reading books, textual research, and clinging to the old sayings of the ancients. Learning values deep thought. As Mencius said, "Think and you will get it, do not think and you will not get it." Without deep thought, there is no such thing as learning. However, some people believe that the way of learning does not lie in seeking creation, but in reading books and observing. Learning must have a basis and cannot be created out of thin air. One must read many books and observe for a long time before one can talk about creation. Even Confucius, a sage, said, "Transmitting, not creating," how can we not read books and lightly talk about creation? These two aspects again have their own reasons, but they are also each obstructed. The former is obstructed by thought, and the latter is obstructed by learning. To think without learning or to learn without thinking is not right.

From this, it can be seen that the way of learning lies in dispelling obstruction. To have obstruction in learning will lead to many unnecessary disputes. Professor Whitehead, a modern British philosopher, once said: "The true method of invention is like the soaring of an airplane in the sky. The airplane soars into the sky, rises from the ground, and then penetrates into the clouds. This method of invention also starts from the special observation on the ground, but then leaps into the sky-wide imagination of the generalized principle, and then descends to the ground again to re-observe, but its observation is more acute because it has been rationally explained." On the ground, one can see its details; in the sky, one can see its greatness. Therefore, one must be on the ground and also in the sky. The main reason is to seek to be unobstructed. The way of learning, is it in this!

### An Outline of Bosanquet's Aesthetics, Part One: The Characteristics of Aesthetic Experience

— Han Yuwen

A simple aesthetic experience is a feeling of pleasure, or a feeling for something that is pleasurable.

Here, the so-called feeling of pleasure, being an aesthetic experience, is of course an aesthetic feeling of pleasure, which is naturally different from other feelings, such as material desires; the so-called pleasurable things naturally refer to beautiful things, not other pleasurable things, such as things that resolve material desires. Now, I will put forward three points to explain the characteristics of aesthetic experience or feeling.

Aesthetic experience is a stable feeling - the pleasure we feel in pleasurable things, that is, beautiful things, is different from the pleasure we feel in food. The former is aesthetic pleasure, and the latter is material desire. Material desire is a desire that arises from the needs of the body: when a person's body has a deficiency or unbalanced abnormality in physiology, he experiences an unstable and troubled emotion, and then intends to pursue what he lacks in order to satisfy his desires and restore his body to a balanced, quiet, and normal state in physiology. The satisfaction of this desire can be called satiety. The starting point of this intention is pain, and the end is satiety. Satiety is its purpose. In the relief of pain, there is a kind of pleasure. When the pain is relieved, the pleasure also gradually stops with that pursuing intention. Therefore, this pleasure is passive. It and the intention that accompanies it are in the process of time, and in its process, it shifts at any time, with increases and decreases in degree. Aesthetic pleasure is active. It is a kind of joy or accomplishment for the perfect form. Although you can forget all the troubles of the world in aesthetic appreciation and be intoxicated in the realm of perfection or be one with it, aesthetic activity is not caused by troubles or physiological imbalances. It is a creative activity of the most fulfilling life. In it, there is no lack or demand, and there is no so-called satiety. Although our actual act of appreciation certainly cannot but appear in time, in terms of the nature of appreciation, aesthetic experience is beyond time, with no difference between before and after. Our heart is always comfortable and at ease in aesthetic activities (athome). The perfection of a moment is like the perfection of eternity. The pleasure of an instant is like the pleasure of a long time. There is no change or growth and decline of time. Therefore, it cannot be said to have a beginning and an end. Our appreciation of perfection has no time for satiety. When we actually appreciate, for example, at a concert, we will indeed feel tired, but that is not because we have heard too much music or the music is too beautiful, just like overeating; but because our energy is not enough and we are idling. Aesthetic requirements have no time to be satisfied, so there is no time to wane.

Aesthetic experience is a related or relative feeling - that is to say, it is attached to or relative to the nature of an object, and at the same time it can be said that it is a special or concrete feeling. When we see something, or hear a sound, such as hearing the dinner bell, we can have many reasons, such as dinner is coming soon, to feel happy; but if this pleasant feeling is not caused by the actual sound of the bell itself, then it is not an aesthetic experience. Aesthetic feeling is caused by the special nature of an object. In other words, it is a feeling that arises for the special nature of a certain thing. It must have such an object, and have a special, concrete feeling for it. And, in fact, this feeling and the special nature of that thing are the same thing. Feelings that are opposite to aesthetic feelings, such as the general pleasant feeling of health that occurs with the growth of energy, may contain aesthetic components, or make us feel comfortable aesthetic conditions more easily; but in general, it is a general feeling rather than a feeling related to an object. The feeling in the aesthetic attitude is concretely expressed in an object. The degree of its concreteness is obviously considerable, and in principle it is considerable to everyone.

Aesthetic experience is a public feeling. You can tell it to others and share it with others, which is the reason for "sharing wonderful articles together"; and its value is not reduced because it is shared. This is the reason for "being happy alone is not as good as being happy with others, and being happy with a few is not as good as being happy with everyone." It can not only be shared with others, but also be understood by others. That is to say, aesthetic feelings are clear and can be expressed. If disputes about taste are really useless, then, disputes about aesthetic pleasure are just the opposite. It can be said that there is nothing more discussed than aesthetic pleasure, and there is nothing more beneficial than discussing aesthetic pleasure. Education is most important in aesthetic experience. The effect that education has on it is also the greatest. Liking something and not liking something are both paths to culture that are worthy of being called aesthetic experience.

The above are the three main characteristics of aesthetic experience. Aesthetic attitude obtains aesthetic objects in it. The first point is that aesthetic feelings have constancy. The second point is that aesthetic feelings have relevance. The third point is that it has commonality. But the three are closely linked, and are not isolated.

### The Power of Thought

— Liren

"Existence determines thought, and thought cannot determine existence," this is the claim of Marx and his followers. Under this claim, the power of thought seems to be denied. Thought cannot influence existence; thought is only a reflection of existence. When existence changes, thought cannot but change with it. In this way, thought becomes the least important thing. Historical change is purely a change of existence, and thought is powerless. Is this a fact? If it were a fact, we would not understand why human beings only use thought. But the fact is not like this. We do not have to go to other sources to find evidence to prove the power of thought. We can find many pieces of evidence of the power of thought from the very people who adhere to Marx's claims, from their actual behavior, and prove the fallacy of their claims.

First, what is the strategy that those who carry out Marx's claims, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, value most and consider indispensable? On the one hand, it is propaganda; on the other hand, it is control--the control of thought. The former is active, and the latter is passive. But whether active or passive, from our point of view, it is a sign of valuing the power of thought. What is propaganda? Propaganda is trying to use one's own thoughts to influence or manipulate the thoughts of others. If thought is powerless and unimportant, why spend so much effort to manipulate the thoughts of others? Also, if thought cannot determine existence, then any harmful or poisonous thought has no relationship to its prevalence. We can let false thoughts arise and die on their own, why bother to control them? To control thought is to assume that thought has power, enough to influence others and change existence. Therefore, in terms of the Communist Party's emphasis on propaganda and the control of thought, it implicitly affirms the power of thought.

Second, in terms of the current situation in the Soviet Union, is the Soviet Union's creation of today's situation a historical necessity? Or is it the power of thought? According to the American philosopher F. SC. Northrop, he believes that the Soviet Union's creation of today's situation is not because there is something that necessarily makes it so, but mostly because the leaders of the Soviet revolution adopted Marx's philosophical theory, forced others to accept it, and built their political actions and cultural institutions on Marx's theory, thus making it so. Therefore, what the current situation in the Soviet Union proves is not that the physical existence of production relations determines the individual's belief or thought about politics and society, but that Marx's philosophy, Marx's thought, determines the Soviet Union's social system and production relations today. (See his book "The Meeting of East and West," page 246) Those who study the Soviet revolution and its current situation, even the Communists, would never dare to deny the power of Marx's philosophy. Is this not proving the power of thought again?

It can be seen that the power of thought is undeniable. To deny the power of thought is tantamount to denying the reason why people are human. The main point of why people are human and different from animals is that humans have thought. The reason why humans can overcome difficulties, conquer nature, and survive to this day is also because humans have thought. A history of human culture is mostly a history of human thought. Without the power of thought, there would never be today's human culture. The progress of history is, on the one hand, the progress of existence itself, and on the other hand, the progress of human thought. Existence can naturally determine thought, but thought can also determine existence. Marx's philosophy and the Soviet Union is the most obvious example.

### On Drinking

— Ping Gong

Drinking is no easy matter. Some people think they "can" drink, simply because they can drink three or five catties of yellow wine without getting drunk, or maybe they can gulp down a large glass of vodka in one go. But can the person who drinks the most be considered the person who drinks the "best"? The charm of art lies partly in the blank spaces, and the interest in conversation lies mostly in moments of silence – the person who constantly gulps down large cups of alcohol probably only makes you think he is a bit like a bull.

To be able to drink to the point of "just right" is like seeking the right balance in life, and naturally becomes an art. When an artist creates a work, in addition to skillful technique, he also needs a sudden inspiration. This inspiration is fleeting, so many masterpieces meet with a premature demise in the bud. Drinking also has this uncontrollable aspect, so drinking "well" is really extremely rare.

First of all, "drinking mood" is not easy to come by. By drinking mood, I think it is actually just a moment of feeling some leisure in one's state of mind. Whether one is busy with official duties during the day, or simply has nothing to do and has lazed around all day, if at dusk one suddenly feels the idea of "how about a little drink," then one puts aside the whole day's busyness or boredom, and just wants to drink – this is really the time to have a little drink, because only at this time can one drink with composure. Some people have become accustomed to drinking and cannot sleep without it, while others use alcohol as a tool to dispel sorrow, with forgetting as the purpose of drinking – the excuses may vary, but they all treat alcohol as opium or morphine. Since they intend to anesthetize themselves, how can they still appreciate the true pleasure of drinking! Therefore, only drinking that is "done for no purpose" is true drinking, and only then can one reach the state of Tao Yuanming's "wanting to discern, but already forgotten the words."

Some people like to bottoms up, and even force others to do the same. The taste of the wine hasn't even been carefully appreciated before it is hurriedly swallowed. Such people drink like elementary school students submitting their test papers, thinking that submitting the first paper is a way to show off, without caring whether they will pass. They don't know that the taste of wine can actually be divided into "head" and "tail." When you first raise your glass, you first see the bright color and the rich aroma, and then slowly sip it. At that time, the color, aroma, and taste of the wine all rush to the tip of your tongue, imbibing the fragrance and containing the jade nectar. This sip can be called the "head of the wine." Then, slowly swallow it, as if there is a lingering fragrance, and this aftertaste can be called the "tail of the wine." Even tea must be slowly "tasted," so why must drinking be done hastily like a child taking medicine, seeking only to swallow it without bothering to distinguish the taste! My friend Mr. Xu Gu likes to drink, but many people are afraid to drink with him, because they say that Xu Gu drinks too slowly. They don't know that it is precisely because Xu Gu can drink slowly that he is sometimes able to write pure and beautiful short poems.

Having a drinking mood is a kind of clarity. I don't think this is an exaggeration, because the drinking mood is very difficult to come by and very easy to disappear. Sometimes, just as you have prepared the cups and chopsticks and are about to have a little drink, suddenly the radio next door starts playing Shaoxing opera loudly, and you immediately have no way to continue. Shanyin is a place that produces famous wine and famous scholars, but it also produces the disgusting Shaoxing opera, probably because of the principle of mutual generation and restraint. Otherwise, everyone would probably rush to live in Shaoxing, to truly roam on the "Shanyin Road."

### Secret Method

— Wang Baili

I remember a Qing Dynasty record that goes like this: There was a man in Hangzhou who sold secret methods. He sealed the methods inside paper bags, with names like "Secret Method for So-and-So," "Secret Method for So-and-So" written on the outside. A person bought three strips for three hundred coins, called "Guaranteed Prosperity for the Household," "Staying Sober While Drinking," and "Cutting Off the Root of Production." After the selection was made, the seller of secret methods said to the buyer in a very serious tone: "These methods are extremely effective. When you get home, secretly open them and do as they say. Be careful not to spread them to others." The buyer happily went home and opened them in a secret room. They read "Diligence and Thrift," "Disperse Early," and "Frequently Lift." The buyer was greatly disappointed and filled with regret.

Originally, secret methods are not good to expose, once exposed they cease to be secret methods. Like Liu Nan’s hidden pen, “Tang Su Shichang served as governor, because the people did not follow the teachings, he blamed himself and voluntarily kowtowed in the capital street. The Wubo hated his trickery and whipped him until he bled. Shichang could not bear the pain and cried out and ran away, and the spectators all held their stomachs.” This is also a secret method, but it is a pity that the secret method was exposed, and the result was not effective. The aforementioned Hangzhou man spent three hundred coins to buy three secret methods, thinking that he would be able to get his wish, but when he opened them, he saw such ordinary words, and therefore was disappointed and regretful, but the principle cannot be changed, and he can’t do anything to the seller. I think this is not because the "method" is not effective, the "method" has already given you an excellent revelation, you yourself think it is ordinary, not rare, then it can not blame the law, only blame yourself for not being able to do as it says. Things in the world are originally very ordinary. Zhuge Liang is not extraordinary, his life is only about "caution". Zeng Guofan has no other strengths, his life is only about "paying attention to everything". Please think: Is there really any other secret method besides "diligence and thrift" for "guaranteed prosperity for the household"?

### Random Notes from the Rat-Peering Pavilion

— Yu Shou

The Estrangement between Weng and Li in the History of Political Strife in the Late Qing Dynasty (Part 2)

Li Shangyang (Hongzao) and Weng Changshu (Tonghe) were in the Grand Council, where they slandered each other and mobilized their followers to fight. Li Ciming, because he was allied with Weng, used extremely harsh words in his Yuemantang Diary to slander Zhang Xiangtao, Chen Taoan, and others, and his tone lost its restraint. This gentleman had a narrow mind, and his hatred of Xiangtao was not entirely due to partisanship. Xiangtao's discourteous treatment of him was also a factor. Yuemantang Diary, Guangxu 3rd year, 2nd month: "When I arrived at Xiangtao's house, his rabble servants were particularly forceful in refusing me. I scolded them and went straight in, sitting in the reception room. After about two hours, the master still did not appear. I was neither willing to endure the humiliation for the sake of my life, nor did I want to argue with him about scholarship, and lightly accepting this insult was my fault." Guangxu 8th year, 5th month: "Recently, the northerners, the two Zhangs and one Li (referring to Li Gaoyang and Youqiao Xiangtao), echo each other internally and externally. Zhang uses Li to increase his importance, and Li uses Zhang for his own purposes. They probe into imperial intentions, widely build party alliances, and the descendants of the Eight Banners advance rapidly through shortcuts. They show no skill in learning, and are insane. I wish I could be in a position to impeach those rats!" Although Ciming was so vitriolic, a reading of Changshu's diary reveals that he praised Xiangtao without any critical words and was happy that he was specially promoted to Governor of Shanxi. On the other hand, Xiangtao insisted on keeping the draft to criticize Changshu. His "Guangyatang Poetry Collection" has a poem "Sending the Literary Official Weng Zhongyuan from His Father Mr. Yaofang's Exile to the Frontier," with a note: "When Mr. Yaofang was in prison, I visited him twice and recorded this poem to show that my friendship with the Weng family was not shallow. Later, Prime Minister Shuping (Li Hongzao) was determined to slander him, and he was only spared death, not unlike Qi Zhang to Zanhuang. This kind of karmic relationship is incomprehensible." Mr. Yaofang was Tongshu, Changshu's third brother, who was impeached by Zeng Guofan while serving as Governor of Anhui and was exiled. Xiangtao used this to blame Changshu for being heartless, but he did not know that in political infighting, even siblings can be disregarded. How could this small favor be of any importance? Xiangtao's argument is truly illogical!

Weng Changshu's diary seems to have been revised by his descendants (or perhaps he himself deleted and revised it during his lifetime, which is also unknown). His evaluations of people mostly leave good comments and rarely show deep analysis. Xiangfan and Youqiao were people he extremely disliked, but his diary only contains praise, probably to show his magnanimity. However, the true facts of history cannot be known. In these respects, I think Li Ciming's straightforwardness is more admirable. The Yuemantang Diary records Youqiao's marriage to the Li family of Hefei, roughly saying: "Hefei has only one daughter, born to his second wife, Madam Zhao."

### Angle

— Tong Tuo

Downstairs in my house, in the back rooms, lived a mother and daughter-in-law. The son worked as a civil servant in a small county in eastern Zhejiang. On the first of each month, after receiving his "crane salary," he would remit it to Shanghai for household expenses. On the fifth of this month, the money was remitted, and the daughter-in-law, as usual, brought the remittance slip upstairs, "Mr. Wang, thank you for helping me to redeem the money."

I put the remittance slip away. In the evening, when I passed by the back rooms, I handed the two million yuan I had brought back to them. As I entered the room, the old lady hurriedly stepped forward, welcoming me and saying, "Mr. Wang, you've come at just the right time. Because A Long's money has been remitted, we quickly bought a dan of rice. Now the shop assistant at the rice store is waiting to collect the cash. Just think, on the first the price of rice was only 700,000, but today it is already 780,000. If you, Mr. Wang, get the money on the first and buy rice, wouldn't you save 80,000 per dan!"

I asked her to check the amount and went back upstairs. In my heart, I was calculating that this A Long was in a small county, and his treatment was even more meager than civil servants of the same level in Shanghai. The money was remitted to Shanghai and took three or four days to arrive. The dan of rice that her family bought was indeed 80,000 more expensive than buying on the first.

Walking into my own room, Xiao Zhang, whom I hadn't seen in a long time, was sitting on the sofa waiting for me. As soon as I saw him, we shook hands happily: "Hello, Old Wang, are you busy? How are you?"

"Xiao Zhang, how are you? The price of rice has been rising sharply recently. Are you making a good profit in the rice market?"

Xiao Zhang shook his head at me, "Don't mention it. Yesterday I sold a batch of rice and lost at least 80,000 at a time."

"How could you lose money? Isn't the price of rice reporting a rise these days?"

"It's precisely the reported rise that's causing the problem. I sold it at 780,000. You think, these days the North and South markets are so active, and there are countless people in the market holding onto the price and not letting go. It is said that in less than a week, it will rise another 10%. I had to sell it at a cheap price because I had to send an urgent letter to my hometown, waiting to pay a deposit for building a house. Think about it, if it rises another 10%, wouldn't it jump up another 80,000 or so? If I wait for the peak, compared to now, I have lost a profit."

After chatting for a while, Xiao Zhang left. The news about the price of rice is that the price of rice will not rise, because the production area is not rising, and the authorities are trying their best to dredge the source, and it is expected to fall to about 700,000 in the near future. At the same time, the authorities are preparing a unified allocation policy for daily necessities for people's livelihoods, and loans have stopped. It is expected that the general price of goods will be stimulated by this and will collapse together. Therefore, the fall in the price of rice is a natural and reasonable thing.

### Medicine is More Expensive Than Blood

— Shi Baiwu's Writing, Gao Longsheng's Painting

It is said that even today, Chongqing is still considered to have the best and most pediatricians in China. During the War of Resistance, of course, the nation's famous doctors were concentrated in the wartime capital. Afterwards, everyone returned to their original positions, and most of the famous doctors who wanted to stay could not. However, pediatrics is still bustling with patients.

At first, I thought it was because the citizens of Chongqing emphasized "protecting the young," but when I asked, it was not the case. "It's just that the children of middle-class civil servants and teachers are often sick," said a pediatrician authority: "Children are generally suffering from indigestion, and the reason for indigestion is due to the 'tooth sacrifice' system."

People who have lived in Chongqing are generally familiar with the term "tooth sacrifice." It is because people with usually poor nutrition regularly—once a week or ten days to half a month—eat a better dish to supplement their insufficient calories. It is said that the teeth and mouth have been too bitter, so they periodically "sacrifice" to them, "serving them with offerings."

So the children of civil servants and teachers in a half-starved state are in luck. If they don't have a tooth sacrifice, that's fine, but if they do, they fill their stomachs like hungry tigers. How can stomachs that are not accustomed to rich and greasy food not get sick after this sacrifice!

Even though they cannot usually "cherish" themselves with full stomachs, when they get sick, they have no choice but to sell their clothes and pawn their belongings to pay for medical treatment.

But the disease is really unaffordable to treat, at least for civil servants and teachers. In terms of medicine, Chongqing is at least two or three times to five or six times more expensive than Shanghai, even though all commodity prices are said to be cheaper than Shanghai. One thousand CC of American-made glucose saline solution transported from Shanghai cost 450,000 yuan a bottle in Chongqing a month ago, when the price in Shanghai was 70,000 or 80,000 yuan. Therefore, the doors of church hospitals, which are said to be charitable institutions, are often lined with rickshaws, and the people on the rickshaws are people who cannot afford the hospitalization fees. Some are waiting for their families to run around begging for loans, while others have already died on the rickshaws before they could wait for emergency treatment. – Everyone knows that Chongqing's church hospitals have long had no subsidies from the church and rely on business income to support themselves.

I personally witnessed a fifteen-year-old girl who ranked first in her school—I swear to God I am not lying—die because her father—a middle-ranking civil servant—could not afford emergency treatment. A cultural figure who has been engaged in the profession for more than 20 years could not afford American blood plasma and had to use his own blood to transfuse his wife to save her life.

### Xiaoyao Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 3: On Stage and Off Stage

That night, after Xu Zhuzhai returned from Gu Qiwan's house, the charming but bold impression Qiwan left on him was firmly imprinted in his mind. He felt that the rumors outside that Qiwan was demanding high prices for her services, had a bad temper, and did not care for her family, etc., were completely wrong. Today was their first meeting, and she revealed all the hardships she had endured, which showed that she had a very straightforward personality. She was a very ambitious woman who constantly strived for progress, and she gave him a very good impression today. Because of her, Zhuzhai tossed and turned all night.

The next day, near closing time at the bank, Qiwan sent a letter containing two tickets to the Kaiming Theater, along with a note written in pencil: "Hoping Mr. Xu can come tonight, Qiwan." After Zhuzhai read the letter, his mind was immediately in turmoil again. Afraid that his colleagues would see it and make fun of him, he quickly put the letter in his pocket, walked out of the bank, and thought to himself, she sent me two tickets, of course I have to go. But who should I go with? I can't provoke the colleagues in the bank, and no one at home is available, so I can only ask my cousin Yi Yunqing. She usually loves to watch plays, and she is also knowledgeable about the lyrics, so going with her would allow for some discussion. Having made up his mind, he hired a car and hurried to Zhang Yunqing's house on Duofu Lane. When he asked at the door, he learned that Old Mrs. Zhang had gone to Tianjin, and only Miss Zhang was at home. Zhuzhai went straight upstairs, where Yunqing was knitting a sweater in the room. Seeing Zhuzhai come in, she sat still and simply nodded, saying, "Cousin, you haven't come in days. It's so boring being home alone since my mother went to Tianjin." Zhuzhai walked up to her and took out the theater tickets from his pocket, saying, "If you're free, let's go see a play tonight." As soon as Yunqing saw the tickets, she reached out and took them, asking, "Who's in the play?" Zhuzhai said, "It's Gu Qiwan at the Kaiming Theater." Yunqing laughed, "I'm asking you what play it is!" Zhuzhai was stumped by her question, scratching his head and saying, "What play is it? I don't even know!" Yunqing laughed, "Inviting someone to a play, but you don't even know what play it is!" Zhuzhai said, "It doesn't matter, we can look it up in the newspaper." As he said this, he picked up the newspaper on the coffee table and exclaimed, "Great, great! It's Qiwan performing 'The Peach Blossom on a Human Face'." Yunqing said, "The play 'The Peach Blossom on a Human Face' is very touching!" Zhuzhai said, "The Peach Blossom on a Human Face is the story of Cui Hu's farewell to the nun, a sentimental and beautiful play, and when Qiwan performs it, it will definitely be tender and moving." Yunqing said, "You haven't even seen her, how do you know?" Zhuzhai said, "Qiwan is best at performing this kind of play, don't you also love watching this kind of play?" Yunqing smiled slightly, glanced at Zhuzhai, a touch of shyness flitted across her face, and she slowly lowered her head, as if there were endless feelings in her heart. Zhuzhai stood behind her and saw that the photo he had given her under the glass on the table was still placed there properly. The half-length photo had been colored and was very harmonious.

### Alumni and Alma Mater

— Sheng Xue

The position of President of Beiyang University has been vacant for some time, arousing much attention. In the south, old alumni such as Wang Chonghui and Wang Zhengting sent telegrams to Liu Xianshou urging him to take the position. In the north, alumni such as Tan Bingxun have been running around to maintain the university. Although they have left the school for many years, their enthusiasm for their alma mater is no less than that of the students in the student union.

This summer, when Peking University took over Duan Wangfu Engineering School, many old alumni (i.e., graduates of the former Industrial Vocational School and the Engineering College of Peking University) launched a movement to protect the school. In addition to holding meetings, issuing leaflets, and sending telegrams, they joined the students at the school in closing the gates and tightly guarding the instruments in the various experimental factories when the takeover took place. They even scolded the personnel taking over. The situation was similar when Beiyang took over last year. On the one hand, they opposed the merger with other schools; on the other hand, they telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting independent funding and an independent college. Similarly, the demands of Normal University and Tangshan Institute of Technology to return to National Jiaotong University have all been echoed by alumni and students.

This reminds me of an incident I personally experienced. In 1919, when Peking University was reorganized, the engineering department was transferred to Beiyang (while Beiyang's law department was transferred to Peking University). When old alumni working on the Yuehan Railway far away in Guangdong learned of this news from the newspapers, more than 20 people led by Wu Cifeng sent me a long letter. They said that the university's separation of departments had originally included an engineering department, and that national construction required engineering talents. From a historical, academic, or any other perspective, Peking University had no reason to abolish the engineering department. The graduates could not stand idly by, and they were holding this public letter as representatives to strongly argue with the Peking University authorities to try to save the situation. On another piece of paper, they wrote many words of encouragement: "Among the engineering alumni, only you, brother, are in Beijing. This matter is of great importance and you cannot shirk your responsibility. We await good news." I was also excited upon receiving this letter and immediately visited President Cai Jiemin! Although I was alone and weak, I planned to imitate the weeping at the Qin court and do my best. To my surprise, after meeting, Mr. Cai said that this was a comprehensive reform of the academic system, and not a question of the survival or abolition of the engineering department. If we were to preserve the engineering department, the entire situation would inevitably revert to the old ways, which would be difficult to accept. Please forgive me. I felt that his reasons were sufficient and there was no way to force the matter, so I replied to the alumni thousands of miles away accordingly.

Observing the above situations in a comprehensive manner, it can be seen that the concern of alumni for their alma mater is indeed of considerable importance.

The loyalty of faculty and students to the school may be said to be a matter of vested interest (or at least has an element of vested interest), while alumni have graduated long ago in terms of academic pursuits, and have left the school for many years; in terms of career, they have long had their own prospects and do not need to rely on their alma mater. However, they are even more enthusiastic and激越 about the rise and fall, separation and reunion of their alma mater than the students at the school. What is the reason for this?

I once talked to an alumnus, and he said: When working outside, one relies on one's background. When others ask about diplomas and origins, even the names of the school or department one graduated from have disappeared. They are neither "produced in the empty mulberry" nor are they any different from "children without mothers"! These words were extremely painful, but they are only one reason and not the root cause. Even when this "Advanced Industrial School" was renamed "Industrial Vocational School," the alumni did not feel resentful because of the disappearance of the old name. When the "Railway Management School" was renamed Jiaotong University, there was no difference. When the "Industrial Vocational School" was upgraded to the "Industrial University," not only was there no opposition, but there was also great joy. When verifying the diploma, isn't it always a mismatch between name and reality, and the answer is not what was asked? Why is it that changing the name to a certain college of a certain university is considered a major change, and people speak out when they feel injustice?

From this perspective, historical sentiment and the psychology of self-esteem transcend considerations of vested interests and become a pure and innate trait. The expression of this trait does not necessarily conform to understanding, but it has the most precious value, which is the greatest factor in the national resistance war.

### Quit Smoking!

— Ya Nong

A small civil servant—including myself—looks like someone of a higher class, but in reality is just someone of a "lower class," at least a subordinate under a large civil servant. If one insists on "puffing oneself up to look fat," then one is bound to be even worse off than a "lower class" person, and the hidden pain suffered in their life is even deeper than that of a "lower class" person.

Having become a small civil servant, one indispensable item abroad is an "old coat," just like in the situation depicted by the novelist Gogol. In our China, one must also drag along a tattered long gown, as if without it, one is not qualified to join the ranks of the "higher class." Speaking of cigarettes, they also cannot be spared or quit. If one insists on quitting smoking, some who are considered the most clever will display their political insight and say, "Am I quitting cigarettes? I am truly compelled!"

My wife, beside my chair, said, "The food supplies have been used up particularly quickly these past few days. Relatives are coming and going incessantly, eating here every day. Look, the rice bought at the end of last month is already more than half a dan gone. What should we do? Should we buy another dan?"

The room was filled with the smoke I exhaled, and the sound of trucks outside the window was deafening, making the room seem even quieter. Why? One reason is to respond to the thrift campaign, and the other is to cultivate an honest atmosphere. As for not having money to smoke, even if you say it, it's better to keep it to yourself. Look at everything from a political point of view. Complaining about personal poverty used to be like saying a gentleman is steadfast in poverty; now, it's better to apply a phrase that the whole country is in poverty. Isn't this more resonant and powerful? Why not do it!

Even more pitiful are the real small civil servants. In the current situation of traffic congestion and soaring prices, the "difficulty of living" cannot be concealed. They can't take off their long gowns, and they want to quit smoking but haven't, or they have quit and started again, trapped in the so-called藕斷絲連 (remaining connected despite breaking apart) situation, which is everywhere. Their mental state is like Shanghainese saying goodbye reluctantly. Cigarettes, to them, are simply touching hard-hearted people, a lingering and affectionate 香君 (fragrant lady) (certainly not the historical Li Xiangjun!). Before parting, they often first reduce the frequency of their interactions, superficially maintaining appearances with 香君; however, maintaining appearances is pitiful, and vain compromises are hard to fill. After some time, they seem to realize the pain of not having money to smoke, and with 香君, "friendship is good, but transactions require money; measure your virtue and capacity, it's hard to manage." So, quit! But they still can't help but groan: "No money to squander, my strength is not enough, it's not that I don't love her enough, I am truly compelled!" This is like talking at length about "difficulties," asking the other party for "understanding." However, cigarettes are not living things after all. No matter how much you shout until your throat is hoarse, saying a thousand or ten thousand times "香君 is gone, how can I bear the sadness!" The sadness is only for you, the civil servant, alone. The other party doesn't appreciate it at all. Not only are you unwilling to say sternly, "From now on, we break up and go our separate ways," but instead, you say with tears in your eyes, "Temporary separation, we will meet again in the future. If the situation permits, we will reunite."

Perhaps one day in the future, your superior or colleague will offer you a cigarette, and you will feel as happy as if a mistress had given you a kiss, and you will gladly accept this kiss. May I ask: What is the difference between the so-called frugality on the lips of ordinary people and the quitting smoking on the lips of this small civil servant? The reason why I am saddened is precisely because of this.
