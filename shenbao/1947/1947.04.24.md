### After Taking Office as Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun Makes His First Broadcast, Elaborating on Domestic and Foreign Policies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan delivered his first broadcast speech to the people of the country at the Central Broadcasting Station at 7:00 PM on the 23rd. The original text is as follows:

The Constitution of the Republic of China has been promulgated for nearly four months, and the Chinese Kuomintang has begun to end tutelage, expand the foundation of the government, and tentatively implement the responsibility system of the Executive Yuan in advance, according to the spirit of the Constitution. In the next eight months, it is the transitional stage from tutelage to constitutionalism. On the one hand, the government must complete the work of preparing for constitutionalism, and at the same time, it is more urgent to restore national unity and stability, and solve the current serious financial and economic problems. The tasks are extremely arduous, and the success or failure of these matters is related to the century-long governance, order, security, and danger of the country. I, in this period, have been appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan. I am truly afraid that my talent is not enough. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, has long drafted the Outline of National Construction, which serves as the highest guiding principle for our nation. Regarding the important political and economic measures at the current stage, the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee are also very comprehensive. As for the policy direction after the government reorganization, agreements have been reached with various parties and social elites. I can only follow the public will under the leadership of the Chairman and shoulder this heavy responsibility. At this critical juncture, all difficulties and obstacles can be foreseen, but I dare not decline the labor and resentment, nor do I care about personal success or failure. I will concentrate my efforts, devote myself to the cause, and strive for unity, democracy, peace, and construction. I will not avoid any sacrifice. On the occasion of taking office today, I would like to present a few key points of governance to my fellow countrymen and appeal for national unity.

Military Restoration of Order; Government Had No Choice

Today, the most important thing that China needs is stability and unity. This is the prerequisite for all construction. Since the end of the War of Resistance, the government has consistently sought a political solution to the CCP issue with the highest enthusiasm and patience. In the past year or so, I have repeatedly participated in peace and unification talks under the instructions of the Chairman. Unfortunately, the situation has evolved to this day, and the CCP has closed the door to peace negotiations with comprehensive military action, rendering all past efforts futile. In order to restore order and ensure unification, the government had no choice but to take effective military measures. This is the current need of the country and the demand of the people, and the government has to shoulder this responsibility, but I feel deeply pained in my heart. I hope that this effective measure can quickly achieve the fundamental goal of resolving domestic disputes and restoring unification through political means. As for the government's consistent determination to pursue peace, it will not change because of this.

Deep Financial and Economic Crisis; Decided to Treat Both Symptoms and Root Causes

China has gone through eight years of arduous war, the nation's vitality has been depleted, and the people's lives are miserable. In addition, the domestic turmoil for more than a year after the war has deepened the national financial and social economic crisis day by day. In terms of treating the symptoms, the government has already promulgated an emergency economic measures plan, and will continue to implement it effectively. In terms of treating the root causes, the government will also gradually implement the established plan. Now I must strongly emphasize that, since the national economy and the people's livelihood are so urgent, we cannot make mistakes again. The government's future measures must be particularly cautious, focusing on fundamental solutions and less on minor details. Anything that is not related to budget balance and currency reform, or that is not urgently important to the national economy and the people's livelihood, should never be acted upon rashly, so as to seek progress from stability. We must also strive to support private economic enterprises, so that social idle capital can be used for production. The government's integrity and trustworthiness are the foundation of all progress and reform.

Enforce Law and Discipline, Eliminate Corruption, and Protect People's Freedom

Regarding political reform, the government should earnestly assume the responsibility of revitalizing and eliminating malpractices, strictly enforce law and discipline, eliminate corruption, eliminate vanity and procrastination, and improve administrative efficiency. In particular, I hope that leaders at all levels will grasp the goal, set an example, be strict with themselves, be fair in dealing with affairs, reward without favoritism, punish without avoiding relatives, and jointly establish a political atmosphere of respecting the law and seeking truth. As for the protection of the people's freedom and rights, this is the most important work in preparing for constitutionalism. The government should, in accordance with the Constitution and the policy direction after the reorganization, protect the freedom that all people should enjoy in accordance with the law. I also hope that people all over the country will recognize the dignity of the law, improve the spirit of abiding by the law, and strengthen their sense of responsibility to the country, so that the rule of law and freedom can complement each other and enter the normal track of constitutionalism.

Peaceful Coexistence with Foreign Countries; Strive to Enhance Diplomatic Relations

In terms of foreign relations, what China earnestly desires is a world of peace, justice, friendship, and cooperation. This is China's traditional spirit, and it is also the need of the facts. Therefore, the Chinese government is determined to adhere to its consistent position, coexist peacefully with all friendly countries in the world, and continue the friendship of fighting side by side with the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, and strive to enhance diplomatic relations between them. All outstanding issues that hinder diplomatic relations are willing to follow the diplomatic path and seek reasonable solutions. We must also strive to promote the harmonious relationship between the allied countries and ensure world peace. China will never shirk its responsibility for handling various post-war international issues and establishing a world peace order and cooperative relationship, nor will it give up its international status. We uphold the Charter of the United Nations, faithfully fulfill our treaty obligations, and respect the legitimate rights and interests of friendly countries, and we also have the firmest determination to maintain our country's independence, sovereignty, and international status.

Unleash Potential Strength; Strive to Revitalize the Cause

Today, the country's difficulties have reached the most serious juncture, and there are so many things to be done and reformed. However, China has a solid potential strength, and the people also have political enthusiasm. We certainly do not underestimate the current difficulties and obstacles, but if we can concentrate the efforts of the whole people to unleash the country's potential strength, we have absolutely no reason to be pessimistic about the future of China's revitalization. The government should select key points from thousands of threads, concentrate its efforts, be sincere, do practical things, and hope that it will benefit the country. The people of the whole country must also eliminate inertia, abide by laws and regulations, be brave and resolute, and work together with the government to revitalize the cause. If the government's laws and regulations are not faithfully implemented, or if the people's sufferings and demands are not reached by the government's eyes, ears, and mind, I hope that we can make up for the shortcomings of the government with the effectiveness of collective wisdom. If there are active, effective, and tangible proposals, the government will be happy to adopt them. I have served in the military and government for more than 30 years, and I am ashamed that I have not made many achievements. The only thing I can be confident in is that I have never dared to violate the law for personal gain, nor have I ever cared about personal gains or losses. Now, I have been appointed to a difficult task, based on the great righteousness of entrusting myself to the country and sharing weal and woe. I will do my best to be loyal and strive to restore unity, complete the preparation for constitutionalism, break through the economic difficulties, and improve the people's lives. I hope not to disappoint the sympathy and expectations of my fellow countrymen and comrades in the Party. (End)

### Acheson's Speech

More Than One Million U.S. Dollars of Lend-Lease Materials

Were Obstructed by Congress and Could Not Be Shipped to China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson said at a press conference today: The lend-lease materials with a value of 1.4 million U.S. dollars that the United States and China agreed to allocate to China could not be delivered to China because the U.S. Congress passed a bill prohibiting the State Department from shipping materials worth 25 million U.S. dollars to eleven countries from November 1 last year. According to the agreement, since China signed a contract with the United States for civilian lend-lease materials worth 50 million U.S. dollars after the victory over Japan, all of the materials except the above-mentioned 1.4 million U.S. dollars have been shipped to China. The Soviet Union has entered into a contract with the United States for lend-lease materials worth 1 billion and 100 million U.S. dollars. These materials are either waiting to be shipped or are being manufactured. The U.S. Congress is now withholding materials worth 16.7 million U.S. dollars by not allowing the Treasury Department to handle and allocate all necessary plans related to these materials (even if all funds are borne by the country receiving the materials). According to Congress's purpose, it is mainly for the Soviet Union, but the lend-lease materials to China, France, Austria, and other countries that have signed lend-lease materials contracts with the United States are also obstructed as a result. Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to Congress to abide by the contracts signed between the United States and other countries was also ignored by Congress.

### Yingkou's Import and Export Trade is Active, Floating Capital Accumulates, and Prices Rise

[Our Newspaper, Ningyang, 23rd] Since Yingkou opened its port on April 10th, import and export trade has gradually become active, and the market has also become more prosperous. Imports are mainly daily necessities and cigarettes, while exports are mainly soybeans, bean cakes, and bean oil. However, at the beginning of the port opening, floating capital from other areas accumulated, and prices were inevitably manipulated, resulting in soaring prices that lead the Northeast. The major factories here include the Zhongfang Yingkou Textile Factory and the Zizhiwei Yingkou Paper Mill, both of which have already commenced operations. In terms of municipal administration, there are countless problems, and everything is limited by funding and cannot be promoted. Two examples are: (1) Public Health - Equipment is lacking, and there are no measures to protect the health of citizens. Meningitis is already prevalent. (2) Transportation is extremely difficult. There are no trams or buses. The 130,000 citizens rely on horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws. The roads have been severely damaged, and 50 million yuan in circulating currency is needed for construction, but there is no ability to undertake the repairs.

Construction began in March of this year and will be carried out in three phases, aiming to restore the company to its original state in two years.

They were also escorted to Taiwan by American military police and are scheduled to be transferred to Shanghai on the Zhongxing ship on the 25th to be tried by our country's military court.

### Puppet Mengjiang Bank Notes - One Yuan Exchanges for Four Jiao in Legal Tender

Ministry of Finance Stipulates Measures for Fixed-Period Redemption

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Ministry of Finance previously stated that the head office of the puppet Mengjiang Bank in Zhangjiakou was occupied by the communist army and could not be taken over and cleared. As a result, the banknotes issued by the bank had not been priced for redemption. After the national army recovered Zhangjiakou, the ministry investigated the issuance of puppet Mengjiang Bank notes and submitted a report to the Executive Yuan for approval of the redemption ratio. The redemption measures are as follows: (1) Puppet Mengjiang Bank notes will be allowed to be exchanged for legal tender at a rate of one yuan for four jiao. The Central Bank and its entrusted agencies will handle the redemption. Redemption rules will be formulated separately. (2) The redemption period will be from June 1, 1947, to September 30, 1947. Puppet banknotes not presented for redemption after the deadline will be invalid. (3) The Ministry has a record of the types and total amount of puppet Mengjiang Bank notes issued. Counterfeit banknotes exceeding the reported amount or of non-conforming types will not be redeemed. (4) Those who manipulate for profit, deliberately raise or lower prices, and violate the provisions of Article 1 of these measures will be prosecuted for disrupting financial order. The above measures have been publicly announced by the Ministry and distributed to the Central Bank and the governments of the Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces for public notice.

As he served as a spokesperson for one year and is now being transferred, he has composed "Shui Diao Ge Tou" to thank colleagues in the press and art circles. The original lyrics are as follows:

### On Participating in the National Government - The Youth Party Issues a Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Zeng Qi and others, representing the Chinese Youth Party, issued a statement on participating in the National Government, which read: "The basis for our participation in the government this time is based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in the long term, and on the twelve governing principles jointly agreed upon by the Kuomintang, Youth, and Democratic parties in the near term. Considering that a political party that has been in opposition for twenty-four years has resolutely come forward to share responsibility at a time of national crisis, there must be a way of conduct that is shared with the world. We respectfully offer two meanings to the people of the country: (1) Although China has now destroyed the strong enemy and won the Anti-Japanese War, the confusion of national affairs and the decline of people's livelihood are no less than in the past. There are thousands of ways to save the situation, but the most important thing is to stabilize the foundation of the country. The Chinese people do not want to see foreign aggression again, nor do they want to see the division of the country again. The legal nationals and the government only hope that democracy can be gradually realized under the principle of freedom and progress. The participation of opposition parties in the government can enable the National Government to achieve peaceful reform internally and gain international respect externally, so that China will not fall into a state of disintegration and chaos in the future. Only when the state affairs are settled can the people's hearts be at peace, and only when the people's hearts are at peace will all ambitious people have no opportunity to subvert the foundation of the country. This is also why our party must come out and jointly shoulder national policies with all patriotic parties for the sake of stabilizing the country.

Thirty-six years after the founding of the Republic of China, democratic politics has not yet been realized. The promotion of democratic politics depends on a number of democratic parties who cut and study each other's policies, and do not compete with each other with thousands of ge and thousands of jia, competing for seats and not competing for battlefields. Although there are many political parties in the country today, there are few who can deeply understand this meaning and follow the normal track of party politics to compete openly in a peaceful way. Our party has been guiding democracy for more than twenty years and has always regarded itself as the orthodox of democracy. What China needs today is a peaceful opposition party. If the policy is feasible, it will be in power, and if the policy is not feasible, it will retire and be in the opposition. Our party is not talented and secretly willing to follow this meaning, and also hopes that all parties in the country will follow this track to strive for democracy by democratic methods, and not to strive for democracy by methods other than democracy. Today, the country is in the transitional stage from the end of political tutelage to the beginning of constitutional government. How can a political party with democratic constitutionalism as its goal stand by and shirk its responsibilities? This is also why our party must come out and jointly shoulder national policies with all patriotic parties for the sake of advancing democracy.

What's more, the renewal of state affairs and the promotion of democracy are not only closely related to the reform of the central government, but also to the comprehensive promotion of the foundation from the bottom up. If democratic knowledge is not popularized among the people, and if the power of democracy is not deeply rooted in the grassroots, then the foundation of constitutional government cannot be said to be completed, and the long-term stability and peace of the country cannot be said to be free from worry. This is what our party is willing to work together with all parties in the country and social elites.

Chen Qitian and Chang Naihui Talk

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Chen Qitian, the newly appointed government member of the Youth Party, met with our newspaper's reporter at 5:00 PM on the 23rd. The reporter first asked that the National Government should be a multi-party political government from today onwards, but some people also call it a multi-party tutelage government. What is Mr. Chen's opinion? Chen replied: "I do not agree with multi-party tutelage government. I believe that democracy is a gradual development and a gradual step forward. The current stage is still preliminary. We have had today after twenty years of training. We believe that in three or five years, we will be able to move towards multi-party politics and reach the realm of democracy." The reporter then asked when the Youth Party will nominate its remaining government member candidate and the list of participants in the local government. Chen said: "We are currently waiting for the arrival of the members of the Central Standing Committee of our party to convene a meeting in Nanjing before we can make a decision. It can be completed before the end of this month." The reporter also quoted the newly appointed executive member of the Executive Yuan, Chang Nai, as saying that the issue of the Youth Party's government members and ministers taking office can only be decided after Li Huang arrives in Nanjing. The reason why the list was submitted as late as the morning of the 23rd was to solicit opinions widely. Regarding the issue of participating in local governments, the Youth Party decided to participate partially, starting from the provinces along the Yangtze River. For temporary organizations such as temporary provincial, municipal, and county assemblies, they still mainly participate with party quotas. Furthermore, the Youth Party has recently decided to officially begin public party activities in various regions.

Editorial

### Expectations for the New Government

The reorganized National Government Committee was established yesterday, and a grand ceremony was held in the auditorium of the National Government. Chairman Chiang and Vice Chairman Sun both attended and delivered speeches. Leaders of the Kuomintang and Youth Democratic parties, as well as social elites, gathered together to discuss the current practical political affairs. This is the first time since the establishment of the National Government twenty years ago. At the same time, the newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, was also sworn into office yesterday. The candidates for the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan have all been approved by the National Government Committee and will all take office today. The political circles of the capital are suddenly filled with a bright and peaceful new atmosphere. Not only are the people of the whole country looking forward to governance, but also people all over the world who love peace and democracy are hoping that after this reorganization, the Chinese government can truly promote a new political style and complete all the necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutional government during this short transition period, opening up a broad road for China's democratic nation-building. Therefore, the reorganized new government bears a very heavy responsibility. Not only will the stability and chaos of China depend on whether the reorganized government can complete its mission, but also the rise and fall and honor and disgrace of the entire country will depend on whether the reorganized new government can be renewed with the people.

The current situation is actually the darkest period in our country's history. During the Anti-Japanese War, we were frustrated by military setbacks. But looking forward to the current prospects, we ultimately feel very optimistic. At this moment, the fruits of victory have already rotted away, and the dream of the four or five strong powers has also awakened. Looking at reality, the flames of war are permeating half of China. The people in the war-torn areas are, of course, directly subjected to the looting of civil strife. Even the people outside the war-torn areas are living in dire straits, constantly facing the threat of soaring prices, and everywhere are the dangerous signs of production shrinking and traffic obstruction. Everyone is aware of the daily non-existence of national affairs, and thus falls into a state of depression and despair. Before the convening of the National Assembly last year, we had always hoped that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could reopen peace talks and turn the internal conflict into a treasure as soon as possible. Later, we learned about the crux of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and we knew that if the Chinese Communist Party was obsessed with its own ways and refused to lay down its arms, then all peace talks would be meaningless. Therefore, we can only hope that the government will make greater efforts to give play to the spirit of "everything is within my power" and obtain the cooperation and understanding of other political parties and social elites other than the Chinese Communist Party, and move towards the road of democratic nation-building step by step. When the National Assembly formulated the constitution last year, the people of the whole country placed unlimited hopes on it, and the reason was also in this. Now that the constitution has been promulgated and the outline of democracy has been roughly determined, as long as we make full preparations in accordance with the procedures for implementing the constitution, we can embark on the right track of constitutional government. Therefore, the attention of the people of the country is focused on the work of preparing for the implementation of the constitution during the transition period. The Kuomintang has implemented political tutelage for 20 years, but has failed to complete the work of implementing the constitution. Although it is due to the successive internal and external troubles, it cannot but bear considerable responsibility. Moreover, the transition period is very short and fleeting, so we must cherish it especially. In the Kuomintang itself, it welcomes the leaders of other political parties to participate in the government and jointly bear the responsibility of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. In the whole country, the people hope that the government can expand the foundation of democracy, with the participation of various parties, and work together to effectively complete all the work of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. Therefore, since the closing of the National Assembly, the people of the whole country have been looking forward to the reorganization of the government. Now, the reorganization of the government has finally been fully realized. But what exactly should the reorganized new government do? And how can it live up to the expectations of the people of the country? On the occasion of the establishment of the reorganized government, we would like to express what our ordinary people want to say in their hearts.

First is the stability of the country. The people's demand for the government is not simple, in a word, it is the stability of the country. However, under the current circumstances, it is indeed a very difficult task to achieve the stability of the country. This demand for stability includes political stability and economic stability. As far as the former is concerned, if the problem of the Communist Party cannot be resolved, there is no hope of stopping the war. It is fundamentally impossible to seek the stability of the country. How can the problem of the Communist Party be resolved? The governing principles of the reorganized government also stipulate that political means should be adopted to resolve it, and it is said that negotiations will be held with the Communist Party as soon as railway traffic is restored. We believe that this is the only way out for our country's politics. Whether the reorganized new government can complete this governing principle is a major key to its success or failure. Regarding the latter, economic stability, it can be said that it is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. Some people say that political instability means that any good strategy or beautiful plan is useless. This statement certainly has considerable reasons, but it is also not a solution to push all the problems onto political problems and demand a general solution. May I ask, if the problem of the Communist Party is not resolved, can the economic problem never be resolved? We believe that human power can overcome nature. As long as the government dares to act and is willing to do something, and finds ways to contract the currency, balance the budget, increase production, and develop foreign trade, it is definitely not absolutely impossible to seek economic stability. Therefore, what we ordinary people hope for most from the reorganized government is that it can come up with a solution. It can no longer make our ordinary people struggle on the starvation line, otherwise singing loudly about democratic constitutionalism will be meaningless.

Second is the preparation for the implementation of the constitution. The biggest task undertaken by the government during the transition period is to fully prepare for the implementation of the constitution. I count on my fingers that there are only eight months from today to the day when the constitutional government begins, which is really too short. But how can we complete the work of preparing for the implementation of the constitution in these short eight months? The legislative procedure is extremely important, but it is not as good as the cultivation of democratic political style. The so-called democratic political style can be divided into two aspects. On the government side, it should fully demonstrate the new spirit of democratic politics. It should not only be enlightened, capable, courageous to take responsibility, and pay attention to administrative efficiency, but also have a broad-mindedness that can accept other people's criticisms. All administrative facilities should be based on public opinion. We should not plan for individuals, nor should we specialize in political parties, but we should always be able to take the interests of the entire country and nation and the people as the premise, and be able to take care of the overall situation in everything, and even be able to sacrifice the small ego to achieve the big ego. On the side of the people, we should also enthusiastically and humbly learn the use of democratic constitutionalism. On the one hand, we must have the tolerance to tolerate other people's opinions, and on the other hand, we must also have the spirit of abiding by the law. If everyone can have this basic spirit of tolerance and law-abiding, then the implementation of the constitution will definitely have good results, and it can truly make China's politics step into a new era of peace and democracy. Therefore, we ordinary people not only hope that the government has this new style, but also that we should take this initiative.

In short, from today onwards, the reorganized new government has begun to work. This is the starting point for our country's political innovation and democratization. The people of the whole country are full of hope. I only hope that Chinese politics will be reborn from today and open up a new path for China's democratic nation-building.

### U.S. Aid Plan for Greece and Turkey Formally Passed by the Senate; Effective Upon House Approval

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] President Truman's $400 million aid bill to Greece and Turkey for anti-communism, despite opponents denouncing it as a "declaration of war against the Soviet Union," was passed by the Senate today with a vote of 67 to 25. It now awaits final passage by the House of Representatives. The House is scheduled to begin debate next week. House leaders intend to limit the debate period so that it can be sent to President Truman for signature within the next week. According to Truman's warning, Britain can no longer afford military and economic aid to Greece and is withdrawing its troops from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean. If the United States does not provide assistance, strategic locations such as the Dardanelles Strait, Turkey, and the oil-rich fields of the Middle East will fall under communist control. It is said that this measure will authorize the President to provide military equipment, money, and military advisors to the governments of Greece and Turkey, but will not send troops. This move is a notification to the world that the United States is addressing the crisis in Greece and Turkey independently because the United Nations does not intend to handle this critical issue. However, its preamble states that the purpose of this plan is the same as the United Nations' mission to create peace. This aid measure includes an amendment stipulating that the United Nations Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly (without a veto) can stop it at any time by a majority vote, but it also stipulates that the United Nations will take over this task from the United States. The bill will provide military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey, with three hundred million dollars loaned to Greece and one hundred million dollars loaned to Turkey. President Truman will decide which of these will be repayable loans. At that time, the United States will send a limited number of military personnel to Greece and Turkey, but no troops will be sent. Economic delegations will also be sent to the two countries to supervise the distribution of American relief supplies and guide the economic policies of the Greek and Turkish governments.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Vandenberg delivered a speech today before the House vote, urging Democratic and Republican members to face the issue that the Communist Party has invaded the South China Sea from the Baltic Sea, which no one can deny us. President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey only represents the President's policy, and claims that this move constitutes American interference in the Balkans or a declaration of war against the Soviet Union are not factual. We should support the policy adopted by the President.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The "crusade" led by former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace against Truman's policies in the United States and European countries has had some impact on the U.S. Senate's vote on the aid plan to Turkey and Greece. At least two influential senators, Democratic Senator Pepper of Florida and Democratic Senator Taylor of Idaho, voted against the plan. Observers today said that the small but highly active idealist faction to which Pepper and Taylor belong is expected to be even larger in the House of Representatives. No matter how weak this minority group's actions may be, they will likely increase Republican opposition to the Democratic government when the government requests continued funding. It is reported that President Truman and his advisors believe that the aid the United States should provide to Greece and Turkey is only the beginning stage, and the broader and more universal nature of the Truman Doctrine remains to be seen. According to reliable sources in the American diplomatic community, the White House is holding secret meetings and will not make a firm decision before Secretary of State Marshall returns from Moscow. Secretary of State Marshall will determine the intentions of the Soviet Union and then decide on the important issues of U.S.-Soviet relations, which may be resolved in the near future. It is also said that when the aid bill for Turkey and Greece becomes law in late May or early June, the U.S. government will likely decide on a strategy to present to Congress to expand the scope of the Truman Doctrine.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] It is reported that U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Wilson will travel to Turkey on the evening of the 25th with Robert Loeblein, Director of the Near Eastern Affairs Office of the State Department, to negotiate the U.S. supplying Turkey with $100 million worth of surplus military materials to help reorganize its army.

### Upon Government Invitation, Greek Foreign Minister Visits France; Bilateral Relations Become Closer

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 22nd] It was officially announced that Turkish Minister to Greece Ünaltin has invited Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris to Ankara for a visit. On the other hand, Greek Naval Minister Veni-zelos has invited the Turkish fleet to visit Greek ports. In addition, Greece and Turkey will soon hold negotiations aimed at determining a common agricultural policy to avoid competition in the production of grapes, figs, and tobacco, and to reduce their prices. According to a morning announcement by the Greek Army Headquarters, an area of 4,000 square kilometers in central Thessaly has been completely controlled by government forces. Guerrillas in the area have either been captured or fled, with 346 guerrillas killed and 294 captured. A large number of guerrillas have surrendered voluntarily. The Greek Army and gendarmerie suffered 30 deaths and 74 injuries. The Greek Army will pursue its victory and will not give the guerrillas a chance to regain their strength.

### Greek Prime Minister Grateful to the United States

[Reuters, Athens, 23rd] Greek Prime Minister Maximos told the Parliament today that in order to show that they are worthy of receiving American aid, the following two things must be done: (1) Suppress the rebellion as soon as possible; (2) Eliminate anti-democratic forces from any other sources. American aid to Greece indicates that we bear a greater responsibility for the nation and the democracy advocated by President Truman. He believed that the Parliament would pass a large-scale austerity plan to ensure that every dollar of the American people's generous assistance is used for the intended purpose of the loan.

### Acheson Clarifies Stance on Suspension of Soviet Cargo Shipments

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: Since Senator Vandenberg suggested suspending cargo shipments to the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union settles the $11 billion Lend-Lease debt, various parties have paid close attention to the State Department's attitude. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson specifically addressed this issue at a press conference, stating that the State Department's position has never changed, that the $17 million worth of post-war Lend-Lease materials that the United States allowed to be shipped to the Soviet Union should still be shipped according to the original plan.

After President Truman announced the aid plan for Greece and Turkey on March 12, both houses of Congress paid great attention. The image shows Acting Secretary of State Acheson answering questions from members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. (Special photo provided by the New York Times for this newspaper)

### U.S. House Passes Bill Indicting Communist Party Secretary General

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Amid calls for strong measures against the Communist Party, the House of Representatives today passed a bill indicting Communist Party Secretary General Dennis and New York lawyer Josephson for contempt of court.

### McKellar Requests Marshall Return to the Country Quickly

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The Senate continued to discuss the aid plan for Greece and Turkey proposed by President Truman today. Democratic Senator McKellar stated that President Truman should cable Secretary of State Marshall to return from Moscow. He also said that the Soviet Union opposes all peace agreements. In my humble opinion, it is a great mistake for President Truman to keep Secretary of State Marshall in Moscow for so long.

### Wallace Broadcasts in France Advocating U.S. Loans to the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace, after arriving here today, broadcasted on French radio, advocating non-political loans to the Soviet Union from the United States through some agency of the United Nations. Wallace said that in order to safeguard lasting peace, one agency of the United Nations must take care of the Soviet Union's vast disaster areas, not only those caused by the war but also those caused by repeated droughts. The Soviet Union, due to its poverty, has to demand huge amounts of industrial production as reparations from Germany, which will increase Germany's suffering and ultimately create instability in Europe. Therefore, I advocate that the United States give the Soviet Union non-political loans so that the Soviet Union can restore its industrial production. I hope that the United States can use its great power through the United Nations.

### Arab Countries Suggest Palestine Should Be Independent

[United Press International, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to convene a special session on the 28th of this month to discuss the Palestine issue. The Arab side is taking a unified stance. Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are following Egypt in requesting that the agenda of the General Assembly be expanded to immediately discuss ending the League of Nations' mandate over Palestine and establishing an independent state. The Jewish side has experienced internal strife. The unofficial organization, the Hebrew National Liberation Committee, today requested that United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie allow the committee to send representatives to attend. The official Jewish organization, the Zionist Organization Committee, refuted this, stating that the Hebrew Committee has no right to serve as an official representative.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 23rd] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to convene a special session next Monday to discuss the Palestine issue. First, there is a dispute over the selection of candidates for the organization of an investigation committee. All five Arab countries of the United Nations request to be represented on the committee. Jewish groups object, believing that Arab countries and Britain should not be represented, and that the Jewish side should also have representatives participate. Britain argues that the Jewish groups, Arab countries, and Britain are all "parties involved" and should not participate in the committee, as this would hinder the work of the committee.

The Holy Land Is Still Unsettled; Retaliation Actions Arise Again

[United Press International, Jerusalem, 22nd] A fast train was derailed by a landmine today about twenty miles southeast of Tel Aviv, killing eight people and injuring one hundred and fifty. British troops have tightened security in the vicinity afterward. It is reported that the case was a retaliatory action by Jewish underground organizations for the British execution of terrorists.

### Whether an Agreement on the Austrian Treaty Can Be Reached Depends on Whether the Soviet Union Makes Concessions; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Is About to Adjourn

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 23rd Broadcast: According to U.S. officials, the hope of completing the Austrian treaty at the Moscow Conference has almost disappeared. The last meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Conference may be held today or tomorrow. Delegations are currently packing their bags, preparing to return home three or four days after the conference closes. It is reported that the French delegation is scheduled to return by special train after the last meeting. Marshall and most of the American delegation plan to fly back to the United States by special plane.

[United Press International, Moscow, 23rd] Today, the fate of the Austrian treaty rests on the Kremlin. The British and American delegation leaders here, who are quite anxious about the Austrian treaty, cannot predict whether the treaty can be completed. They unanimously acknowledged that this matter is quite difficult. The French delegation, due to the Soviet Union's refusal to recognize France's integration of Saar into its economic system, already believes that the conference is a thing of the past and continues its preparations to end tonight. However, the British and American sides are more inclined to set tomorrow as the earliest possible date for adjournment. Because the four foreign ministers have spent a lot of time in secret negotiations in recent days, there still seems to be a glimmer of hope for the completion of the Austrian treaty.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] The four foreign ministers held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the Trieste issue for an hour. Then, at the suggestion of Secretary of State Marshall, a secret meeting began at 6:10 to discuss the disputed points in the Austrian treaty and adjourned at 7:00 PM. It is reported that the four foreign ministers were slightly closer to agreement on the Austrian border issue during yesterday's secret meeting, but no new compromises were reached during the two secret meetings this morning and afternoon. The four foreign ministers met this morning to continue discussing the financial situation of the Free Territory of Trieste for fifteen minutes. The four powers unanimously agreed to accept the report submitted by the special investigation committee and decided that the Governor of the Territory and its legislative and administrative organs should find ways to balance it, which is tantamount to recognizing the economic independence of the Territory. At 11:45 PM, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed holding a secret meeting in an attempt to end the discussion of the Austrian issue, but it is reported that no positive results were achieved. In addition, the Foreign Ministers' Conference also ordered the four Deputy Foreign Ministers to discuss the German issue tomorrow morning, compile a statistical table of the opinions of various countries, and submit it to the Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion tomorrow afternoon. However, according to observers, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will not discuss the German issue in detail.

According to informed sources here, the conservatives may achieve the greatest success in this general election.

At that time, the French side stated that although the new tax is individually stipulated for each item, the tax rate will not be higher than before the war, and that this new tax will be used as a basis for negotiations on reducing French tariffs in Geneva. However, according to European sources, France's new tax system will be 50 percent higher than the current tax rate. In the US-French loan agreement, France also stated that it will abolish the import restriction system after the new tax system is implemented.

### Between Lujiabang and Kunshan: Jinling Express Derails and Overturns; Eleven Injured Sent to Suzhou and Wuxi for Treatment; Track Repaired at Midnight, Traffic Disrupted for Nine Hours

[Our Own Dispatch] The Jinling Express, a through train with first and second-class carriages on the Shanghai-Nanjing line of the two railway bureaus, departing from Shanghai for Nanjing at 1:30 PM yesterday, derailed at 2:36 PM between Lujiabang and Kunshan, outside Xiyangqi village west of Xixiang Station. The last two carriages (FP503 and SP705) suddenly derailed and overturned on the south side of the track. Fortunately, the driver noticed the derailment and immediately applied the brakes, preventing damage to other carriages. One passenger in the overturned carriages, Chen Panming, was seriously injured, nine were slightly injured, and a car attendant, Tao Zengrong, also sustained injuries. Personnel from Xixiang Station provided immediate assistance and urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Railway Bureau. Deputy Director Hou Huohua, Transportation Director Guan Duo, and Engineering Director Mei Fuqiang, along with engineering and medical personnel, rushed to the scene on a rescue train to provide assistance and carry out repairs.

The front portion of the Jinling Express, the carriages that had not derailed, continued onward at 3:57 PM. All injured passengers were transported on the train to Suzhou Hospital for treatment, while the remaining two hundred-plus uninjured passengers continued their journey to Nanjing on the original train. After the incident, our reporter boarded the bureau's rescue train to inspect the scene. Track workers were diligently replacing sleepers and steel rails. The overturned carriages had their windows completely destroyed, and the sofa furnishings were in complete disarray, yet many of the passengers' glass teacups remained intact. The passenger car was only a foot away from the track. At 8:30 PM, cranes were used to lift the overturned carriages, and the tracks were repaired. By 11:30 PM, all train services were able to resume, meaning that traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing line had been disrupted for a total of nine hours. Upon inspection, 38 steel rails were damaged, and over 300 sleepers were broken. The bureau's responsible personnel are currently conducting detailed investigations and studies based on reports from various sources to determine the cause of the accident. A meeting on the incident is scheduled for this afternoon. Until a conclusion is reached, no statement will be issued. Upon hearing the news, Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei in Nanjing expressed great concern and immediately telegraphed Bureau Director Chen Bozhuang to visit the injured passengers at the hospital. Due to Chen's busy schedule, Deputy Director Hou Huohua was asked to represent him and visit the Suzhou and Wuxi hospitals last night.

[Another Dispatch] Four people were seriously injured in the derailment, three passengers and one car attendant. One passenger, Chen Panming, suffered a fractured skull with a large hole. Another, Zhang Bingfu, sustained severe spinal and chest injuries and is unable to walk or sit. He is currently being treated at the Puren Hospital in Wuxi. It is reported that Zhang is the owner of the Nanyang Hotel in Xinan. The third passenger suffered severe injuries to his chest and shoulders and is in critical condition. The car attendant, Tao Zengrong, suffered a broken nose, with a T-shaped fracture and three bone fractures.

According to passengers on the derailed Jinling Express, the number of injuries was limited because the carriage doors and windows were tightly closed due to the cold weather. Otherwise, passengers would have been thrown out of the doors and windows with no chance of survival. It was also said that the FP503 first-class carriage was newly shipped from the United States, and the ratio between the wheels and the tracks may not have been up to standard, causing the derailment. The glass windows on the carriages were very large and thick, costing over four million yuan each, and many were shattered.

[Our Own Dispatch from Suzhou, 23rd] As the Jinling Express from Shanghai approached Xixiang, four or five kilometers from Kunshan Station, the last two carriages suddenly overturned. Due to the distance, the locomotive was unable to detect the derailment in time and continued for about one kilometer before stopping. Two passengers were seriously injured, and four were slightly injured. They have been sent to hospitals in Kunshan and Suzhou for treatment. The cause of the derailment is attributed to the American-style wheels not being fully compatible with the existing tracks, resulting in a risk of vibration and overturning at slightly higher speeds.

### Arms Smuggling Organization Uncovered in West Shanghai; Six Arrested; Arms Dealer Conspired with US Navy Soldiers to Steal and Sell; Confessed to Purchasing on Orders from Haimen County Government

[Our Own Dispatch] Regarding rumors of a terrorist organization preparing a conspiracy to riot and sell arms being uncovered by the Garrison Headquarters in West Shanghai, a responsible person from the Garrison Headquarters stated yesterday that the case was actually an ordinary case of stolen arms and did not involve a terrorist organization with booby traps, etc. However, the case involves the US Navy stationed in Shanghai and the Haimen County Government. Recently, there have been frequent reports of arms being stolen from the US Navy in this city. After a secret investigation, several soldiers were found to be involved in theft. According to their confessions, they colluded with Chinese arms brokers to steal and sell the arms. The US Navy authorities requested the assistance of the Garrison Headquarters to solve the case. The Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, together with US personnel, conducted investigations for several days and learned that the arms dealer who colluded with the US Navy was living in Gongmaoli, Zhangjiazhai in West Shanghai. So a search was made there a few days ago, and eight light machine guns and six rifles were found on the scene. Six people were arrested. After sending the people and the stolen goods to the headquarters for interrogation, in addition to the main offender admitting to colluding in the theft and sale of arms, several others confessed that they were ordered by the Haimen County Government to purchase guns and ammunition in Shanghai for use by the local self-defense corps, and they had certificates from the Haimen County Government as proof. The Garrison Headquarters has already telegraphed the Haimen County Government to inquire whether this is true. The headquarters believes that even if the offenders were ordered to come to Shanghai to buy guns and ammunition, they did not contact the military and police authorities in advance and proceeded secretly on their own, which is inappropriate. Therefore, all the offenders were sent to the military court for trial last night in accordance with the law. As for the names of the offenders and the details of the case, the Inspection Department has not yet agreed to disclose them yesterday.

### 200 Mu of Land Encircled in Zhabei to Be Opened Soon

[Our Own Dispatch] In the north of Hengfeng Bridge in Zhabei, this city, there are two pieces of vacant land with an area of about 200 mu. They were originally encircled during the enemy and puppet period. In order to benefit the citizens, Wang, the chief of Zhabei District, specially requested the military authorities to open the vacant land, and he has been approved by You Nuo. It will be opened in the shortest possible time. However, in order to prevent unscrupulous citizens from arbitrarily occupying or privately building shacks, in addition to organizing a committee to handle the matter, District Chief Wang, accompanied by Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, went to inspect the land.

### Dangerous Ferry Service Between Dongchang Road and Dongmen Road; Crowding Easily Leads to Accidents; Citizens Call for Improvement

[Our Own Dispatch] City Councilors Zhao Yangxiong and Cao Jun, recently received a request from Pudong citizens to forward a letter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Municipal Ferry Company to improve the ferry situation, and specially requested the authorities to handle it quickly on their behalf. It is said that the ferry line across the river between Dongchang Road and Dongmen Road in Pudong has always had two ferries, Nos. 25 and 23, and a special ferry, No. 26, is also opened in the morning and evening, and the order is good. In late last month, the No. 26 ferry was damaged, and the special ferry service was discontinued. As a result, there are too many passengers in the morning and evening, and they are extremely crowded. When the ferry is docked, the order is greatly disrupted, and the old and weak suffer from it. Crying and shouting, scratched skin, and torn clothes are often seen. Moreover, each ship carries more than 500 passengers. When crowded, people often stand dangerously outside the railing. If the ship tilts, they may easily lose their footing. At about 5:00 PM on the 12th of this month, a passenger fell into the river, but was fortunately rescued and escaped disaster. Subsequently, the bureau regularly transferred the No. 25 ferry back for repair, and replaced it with the Changdu ferry Huhai. However, although the ship is large, the equipment is not suitable, and short-distance passengers feel even more inconvenient, and the crowding and chaos are the same as before. Therefore, a letter is specially sent to the company authorities to try to rent appropriate ferries to replace the Nos. 25 and 26 ferries before they are repaired, and to send special ferries during the crowded ferry times in the morning and evening to accommodate passengers, so as to benefit the people's travel.

### Strengthening Financial Organizations to Assist Agricultural Production

Chen Guofu's Speech at a Welcome Dinner

Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Treasury, recently came to Shanghai. Financial figures in this city held a joint tea party at the conference hall on the fourth floor of the Bank of China yesterday afternoon to welcome him. Fang, the chairman of the committee, was elected to preside over the meeting and gave a brief welcome speech. Then, Mr. Chen was invited to express his opinions on the financial community in the future. The main points were roughly as follows: For the sake of coordinating with the national policy, the financial cause of our country should strive to assist the development of the production cause, and should especially take the effort to assist agricultural production as the guiding principle for the financial community to carry out its business in the future. The Farmers Bank of China should first promote the work of assisting agricultural finance. Secondly, the Central Cooperative Treasury should do its best to assist the development of cooperative undertakings throughout the country. At the same time, Shanghai's consumer cooperatives should cooperate with inland production cooperatives to enhance efficiency. We should study the current financial problems more in order to make progress. At the same time, we should absorb outstanding people, strengthen the organization of the financial community, and reform the atmosphere, so as to be a model for society.

### Morphine Seized on the Cai E Steamer; Female Passenger Conspired with Cook to Smuggle; Value Exceeds 300 Million Yuan

[Our Own Dispatch] Shen Deting and Chen Jingshan, the director and deputy director of the Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau, are very active in investigating and prohibiting opium and other drugs. Recently, Zhou, the section chief of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Cai E steamer, which arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at about 9:00 AM on the 12th, learned that there were narcotics on board. He immediately led Inspector Gu Yaoshen, Police Chief Sun Ziqiang, and police officers Li Jiafu, Wang Jinghua, Hu Qujiu, and Chen Xianfa to depart at about 8:00 AM and went to the Third Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on East Zhongshan Second Road to lay in ambush around. After the steamer docked at the wharf, they immediately inspected the luggage and suitcases of each passenger. In the luggage of a female passenger named Bao Yue'e and Wu Suqing, a small yellow suitcase was opened and three large packages of morphine were discovered. Soon after, two young women, Weng Beishi and Wu Dongshi, carried biscuit boxes and pickled radish baskets. After inspection, five more large packages of morphine were found. According to Weng Beishi and others, the head cook Wang Rongzhang and cook Wang Huating on the steamer were responsible for keeping them in custody along the way. The narcotics were entrusted to them by Wang Yangshi in Tianjin and instructed to bring them to Shanghai and then call Yuan A'fa at 724 Guangdong Road to pick up the goods. The telephone number was 97668, etc. Then, Section Chief Zhou arrested the head cook Wang Rongzhang and cook Wang Huating on the ship. He then went to the front building of 724 Guangdong Road together with personnel from the Laozha Police Station to arrest Yuan A'fa, but he was not found. According to people, Yuan returned to his hometown to sweep tombs more than ten days ago and has not yet returned. After interrogating the other offenders at the police station, Bao Yue'e confessed that the narcotics she was carrying were entrusted to her by Zhang Rongsheng in Tianjin and asked her to bring them to Shanghai first. Zhang would arrive after work. Wu Dongshi confessed that the principal offender, Wang Yangshi, would come to Shanghai by steamer recently. After receiving the confessions, the sub-bureau ordered police officers to wait and search each Tianjin steamer arriving in Shanghai, but to no avail. The sub-bureau intends to send the eight large packages of morphine seized, weighing a total of 77 taels and 4 mace, worth more than 300 million yuan, together with the suspects to the court. The search for the principal offender who is still at large is still underway. According to Shen Deting, the director of the sub-bureau, the police officers have solved more than 30 opium and drug cases in the past month, and have spared no effort in searching all steamers arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin.

### The Spirit of Heroic Resistance to the Enemy Will Never Die; Sixth Anniversary of Xie Jinyuan's Death; Commemorative Ceremony at the Tomb Today

Today is the sixth anniversary of the death of Xie Jinyuan, the late commander of the Eight Hundred Heroes. Xie led the Eight Hundred Heroes to defend Sihang Warehouse. The spirit of their heroic resistance to the enemy and the tragic encounter of their death in the Lone Army Camp still linger in the minds of residents of the city, and they sigh with emotion.

The Xie Jinyuan Middle School Boy Scout Band will play music.

### Labor Circles Demand Adjustment of the Index; Resolutely Crack Down on Speculators; Shui Xiangyun Talks About Past Price Increases Unrelated to the Index

Since the government implemented the Economic Emergency Plan and froze the workers' cost-of-living index, prices were stable for a while, but recently they have fluctuated and risen again. The laborers in this city are quite anxious because their livelihoods are affected, and various labor unions are gradually demanding an adjustment of the index. A reporter from Dagong News Agency specially visited Shui Xiangyun, the chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, yesterday to inquire about his thoughts on this matter. According to him, when the authorities announced the workers' cost-of-living index, taking the wages of January as the standard, he immediately expressed that prices should also be frozen from January, and requested the allocation of physical goods in the same quantity as public and private school teachers. Later, Mayor Wu and Director Wu strongly argued with the central government and obtained six items of in-kind difference funds. This was slightly better than the original plan, but it was still 48 items less than the original cost-of-living index. The city's labor representatives proposed at the general meeting to unfreeze the cost-of-living index, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also had a proposal to adjust the cost-of-living index every three months, but the Standing Committee believed that the Economic Emergency Plan had not been announced for a long time, and prices were not stable, so in order to maintain the central government's decrees, it temporarily did not change, and the workers also understood the country's economic crisis and temporarily endured the pain and accepted it. Up to now, three months later, prices have not decreased slightly, but have risen instead. Daily necessities such as rice, oil, cloth, and vegetables have risen even more sharply. Under such circumstances, it is really difficult for workers to maintain their true livelihoods. At that time, the government still thought that the rise in prices was due to the index. In fact, the index originally arose from prices. First there were prices, then there was the index. The index would never lead to rising prices. The fact that prices have continued to rise after the index was frozen this time is clear evidence. As a result, the hardworking workers have suffered significant sacrifices at this time. Therefore, the Federation of Trade Unions has only two requests to the government under such circumstances: (1) Please adjust the index. (2) Please crack down on speculators' speculation and monopoly in order to stabilize prices and stabilize workers' lives. Otherwise, labor-capital disputes in the industry will continue to rise and fall, affecting the stability of the entire society.

### Embezzlement in Seawall Project; Investigation Reveals It Was a Misunderstanding

[Our Own Dispatch] In order to thoroughly investigate the seawall project embezzlement case, the Public Works Bureau, based on the accusation of the people's representatives of the third protection zone of Gaoqiao, said that Yang Yilang, the contractor of the seawall project team, misappropriated the original seawall stones as purchased new stone materials. Three senior officials were sent to inspect the site on the 10th of this month, and the district chief of the district, Zhong Yuliang, and the chairman of the people's representative assembly, Cui Zhiming and Huang Mengyan, were invited to investigate together. Cui and Huang were unable to participate due to other business. The three senior officials of the Public Works Bureau and the team leader of the engineering team, Xu Juansong, and the contractor, Yang Yilang, went to the two places for inspection. The results of the investigation were announced by the Public Works Bureau yesterday as follows: (1) The project section is the third engineering team, not under the jurisdiction of the fourth engineering team. (2) District Chief Zhong and Cui Zhiming claimed that the number of seawall stones moved was tens of millions of tons, which was not true. Only more than 600 cubic meters were moved, which is equivalent to more than 940 tons. (3) According to the contract, the cost of retrieving stones scattered far away is 3,000 yuan per cubic meter, the cost of loading and unloading trucks is 2,000 yuan per cubic meter, and the cost of paving is 6,000 yuan per cubic meter, totaling 11,000 yuan per cubic meter. The stone materials are not priced, and the transportation truck is allocated by the management team of the engineering team, and no transportation fee is listed separately. (4) The section of stone retrieval is consistent with the survey. Because there is a shallow sand beach outside the row piles in that section, it is easy to retrieve, and there is absolutely no such thing as dismantling the seawall.

On the 21st of this month, a staff member of the Public Works Bureau went to Gaoqiao again to meet with Cui and Huang. According to them, they said that they were unable to go together because they were busy with meetings. As for the engineering team moving stones, because they had not seen a report in advance, and the local people did not want to move the stones from place A to place B. Based on the above points, it can be seen that perhaps the local residents only saw trucks transporting stones, and suspected that there was corruption, resulting in a misunderstanding.

### Su Chengde Still Attempts to Evade Death; Application for Retrial in High Court Rejected

[Our Own Dispatch] Su Chengde, who once served as the puppet capital's police chief and deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was sentenced to death by the High Court. Su appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial, but his appeal was rejected. In order to save his last fate, Su applied to the original trial court (High Court) for a retrial in accordance with Article 413 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The High Court rejected his application on the grounds that he did not present any favorable new evidence in his application. The ruling was sent to Su yesterday. It is reported that within three days, he will appeal to the directly superior court (Supreme Court) in accordance with Article 395 of the Criminal Procedure Law. If the appeal is rejected again, Su will have no way to escape his death. The execution of Liang Hongzhi and Chang Yuqing did not complete the "application for retrial" and "appeal" procedures, so they were still resentful when they were dying. Su has gone through this complete legal procedure, so he can die with peace of mind when he is executed in the future.

### Zheng Hongnian Sent Back for Retrial

Zheng Hongnian, the president of the puppet Central China Railway Co., Ltd., was previously sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the High Court. Zheng did not accept the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The Supreme Court ruled, "The original judgment is revoked," and the case was sent back to the High Court for a retrial. The reasons for the judgment are roughly as follows: According to the defendant's confession, during his tenure in the puppet government, he rescued 48 underground workers, including Tao Xiaojie. The original trial did not fully investigate this favorable evidence. Moreover, after the defendant served as the president of the puppet Central China Railway Co., Ltd. on January 6, 1944, all his power was controlled by the Japanese deputy president. He only worked two hours a week. During his one-year tenure in the puppet government, he reviewed no more than 40 documents. According to the provisions of Article 59 of the Criminal Law, "If the circumstances of the crime are pitiful, the sentence may be appropriately reduced." The original judgment's sentence was a bit too heavy. The defendant's application for retrial is not unreasonable.

### Black Nose Ah Da and Others Sentenced to Two and a Half Years Each

[Our Own Dispatch] The High Court pronounced judgments on three cases of suspected traitors yesterday morning: (1) Xie Demao, the manager of Jiu Da Xie Ji Copper and Tin Co. Ltd. on Linsen Middle Road, was accused of purchasing military raw materials such as copper coins and lead for the enemy. (2) Wang Zhisan, the publisher of the Da Xue Yan Shi Le, was accused of opening a joint alcohol factory during the enemy and puppet period to supply the enemy with alcohol. (3) Li Ah Da, nicknamed "Black Nose Ah Da," was accused of serving as a puppet military officer. In all three cases, the defendants were sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for two years, and their property was confiscated, with the exception of the necessary living expenses for their families.

### The Tragic Death of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Zheng Jingzong; Still Suspected of Being Killed by His Landlord

Shao Kunshan's Non-Prosecution Disposition; Deceased's Family Displeased and Requests Reconsideration

[Our Own Dispatch] Zheng Jingzong, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner living at No. 12 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, went out at noon on March 21 and did not return. The next day, his body was found floating in the Huangpu River. Zheng Liangshi, the deceased's wife, filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate, accusing the landlord, Shao Kunshan, of murdering her husband. From last September to this spring, Shao Kunshan had forced Zheng Jingzong to move out. In March of this year, Shao's actions became more active. He had forced Zheng to go out for "tea talks" on the 15th of the month. On the 19th, Shao Kunshan's wife slapped Zheng Jingzong, blocked the gate, obstructed Zheng's freedom, and did not allow patients to enter for treatment. Fang Zheng, the prosecutor in charge of the case, summoned the co-tenants for questioning, proving the above facts, and therefore filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 304, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. However, regarding the suspicion of murder, the autopsy results confirmed that he had drowned and there was no trace of being murdered before being thrown into the water. The scars on the body may have been abrasions after entering the water. It was considered that the defendant, Shao Kunshan, was suspected of murdering the deceased, so he was given a non-prosecution disposition. Zheng Jingzong's family members were dissatisfied with the punishment received by the defendant and filed a request with the High Procuratorate for reconsideration yesterday.

### Huang Mian's Tragic Death Under a Car; His Wife Demands Compensation

Huang Mian, a section chief of the Jiangsu District Commodity Tax Bureau, came to Shanghai on official business last month. On the 15th of the month, he was crushed to death by a No. 22 red public bus at the intersection of Zhongzheng Middle Road and Lianyun Road. Huang's wife, Wu Meizhen, requested the help of the Guangdong Dapu Fellow Villagers Association to seek justice. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the Dapu Fellow Villagers Association received reporters at the association in Laoximen and reported the details of the accident. Huang Jun left behind a 73-year-old mother, as well as a wife and two sons and one daughter. Although Huang's wife repeatedly negotiated with the French Concession Bus Company, demanding compensation for damages in accordance with the law, so that the deceased could be buried and the living could be supported, the company has not paid attention to it, or only offered a very small amount of charitable relief funds, deliberately delaying the matter. According to Huang's wife, the French Concession Bus Company is irresponsible and bullies the weak, which she is not willing to accept. Huang Jun is a national civil servant, so his salary is meager. The medical expenses and funeral expenses this time were borrowed from friends. In the future, funeral and living expenses will have no source. She has submitted a request to the company for living expenses, children's education expenses, mental consolation money, funeral expenses, etc. The company is only willing to donate 10 million yuan, so she asks people from all walks of life to uphold justice.

### Ministry of Education Plans to Hold Publicly Funded Overseas Student Examinations This Year with a Quota of 300 Students; Application for Funds Submitted to the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Ministry of Education, recognizing the acute shortage of talent in various fields in China, believes that, in addition to strengthening domestic universities and research institutions to cultivate talent, sending students abroad to absorb new knowledge is particularly important. Before the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education placed great emphasis on overseas education. During the War of Resistance, due to funding and transportation constraints, the Ministry of Education did not hold public examinations for overseas students, except for the examinations for research and internship students to the United States and the first self-funded overseas student examination. After the victory, with everything waiting to be rebuilt, all kinds of construction projects require the participation of specialized talent. Therefore, the Ministry held one examination each for publicly funded and self-funded overseas students in July last year. The original plan was to recruit 1,000 publicly funded students, but due to limited funding, this was reduced to 100, which was far from meeting the actual needs. The cultivation of talent in the future cannot be delayed. Therefore, the Ministry of Education's work plan for the 36th year still includes sending students abroad. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the Ministry of Education still plans to hold public examinations for overseas students this year. The quota was originally set at 500 students, but due to the announcement of economic measures and foreign exchange difficulties, it has been reduced to 300 students. The application has now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be prepared for implementation once approved.

In the Group A rematch, Columbus will face the Shantou team. The referees are Wu Zibin and Chen Baolin. Both sides are evenly matched. The Columbus team consists of elite American sailors, with height and strength, and excellent basketball skills, which have earned unanimous praise from both insiders and outsiders. The main players, Ash and Plori, are particularly dangerous. They recently defeated the strong Qingli Zhuang's Encas, showing their full potential and strong fighting power. The Shantou team has been in good shape recently, with great momentum. Last weekend, they lost to Hualian by only two points in the final for the League A championship, which proves their formidable strength. They will definitely do their best to fight for the finals against the American team. The outcome of the game is uncertain. The last game is the women's rematch between Xue Bai and Qing Lian, refereed by Liu Hesheng. Xue Bai has a collection of famous players, such as Zhang Xiuli, Wang Shan, Wang Huiling, Huang Ruyu, and Zhu Jiazhen, all of whom are the best of their time. Qing Lian has also been in good shape recently, and their players are in excellent condition. Their fighting power is no less than that of Xue Bai. The two teams drew with 35 points each in their previous match, indicating that their strengths are similar. This rematch will determine the winner, and there will be many exciting moments, and the battle will be even more intense. The rosters of the four teams are as follows:

(Shantou Team) Cai Yanxiong, Ma Canxi, Chen Qingjiang, He Lide, Lin Weicong, Ji Nankang, Lin Ziren.

(Columbus) Plori, Ash, Po Lafa Te, Ao Bulai, Ke Bo, Bo Ke, Ke Luoning, Le Simi, Qu Ling Huo Tuo, Bo Na Tuo, Ke Ni Ge, Lang En.

(Xue Bai) Zhang Xiuli, Nie Baozhu, Wang Shan, Wang Huiling, Guo Aizhen, Huang Ruyu, Zhu Jiazhen, Wang Xiu, Yao Siyuan, Ding Yi.

(Qing Lian) Liu Huishan, Xu Peizhen, Sun Fengzhu, Yang Jian, Zheng Shuqing, Zhu Lanzhen, Wang Wenzhu, Li Sizhen.

### Possible Modifications to Track and Field Rules

— Wu Bangwei

The track and field rules currently used in China are still those from 1936. It is unknown whether new rules can be obtained from the Olympic Games, but the International Amateur Athletic Federation revised the rules at a meeting in France in 1939 in preparation for the 12th World Games to be held in Finland in 1940. The changes were not significant. I think that at least these new rules should be adopted for the upcoming National Games. Therefore, I will first introduce the changes unofficially.

(1) The original starting command has been changed to "On Your Marks" and "Set". When using Mandarin, the two words "Yu Bei" (Ready) may be changed to one word.

(2) After calling "Set", the starter may fire the gun when he believes that the athletes have calmed down and are consistent. This is slightly different from the old rule of "pausing for about two seconds before firing the gun."

(3) After calling "Set" and before firing the gun, an athlete's hand or foot leaving the starting position will be considered a foul.

(4) Starting blocks may be used at the start. This is not intended to help athletes with equipment, but to protect the track and accelerate the race.

(5) In a staggered start race (such as 200 or 400 meters around a curve), the starter should stand in a suitable location so that the distance to each athlete is approximately equal.

(6) Anyone who uses stimulants to increase their physical ability during a competition will be permanently disqualified from participating in the competition.

(7) When the results of the high jump or pole vault are equal, the method of determining the ranking is as follows: To resolve the first place, a fourth jump should be made at the height at which they both failed. If they both clear it, the height is raised by two centimeters and they each jump once. If they both fail the fourth jump, the height is lowered to the last cleared height and they each jump once. If there is still no result, the height should continue to be increased or decreased until a ranking is determined.

(8) For field events that are measured by distance, if the results are equal, the ranking will be determined by the second-best result of each athlete with equal results. (If this rule is implemented, the result of each jump and throw of each athlete must be accurately measured and recorded for verification.)

(9) In high jump and pole vault, the referee should announce to the athletes the height that will be increased each time before the competition begins.

(10) In pole vault, if the athlete's pole touches the vertical plane of the top of the pole vault box, it will be considered a failure.

(11) New-style hurdles are required, so there is no disqualification for knocking down a hurdle, and the result can be officially recorded.

### Three Directives from the Executive Yuan to the Municipal Government - Strengthen Control of Gauze Supply - Implementation Method to be Determined After Chairman Wu Returns to Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Government yesterday received instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding the balanced supply and price stabilization of gauze, and decided on three measures: (1) The customs declaration for cotton yarn and cloth for re-export or railway transit must be approved by the Textile Industry Management Committee. (2) The Textile Industry Management Committee shall issue permits in accordance with the Provisional Management Measures for Gauze Shipped to South China and the Simplified Rules for Reviewing Categories A and B. (3) The Ministry of Economic Affairs shall instruct the China Textile Corporation to rush the delivery of gauze needed in the Northeast and Guangdong as soon as possible to ensure sufficient supply. Items 1 and 2 above will be implemented with immediate effect. The three ministries of Finance, Economy, and Transportation have been instructed to comply. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government notified the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday (23rd) to comply.

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Director Liu of the Business Department of the Textile Management Committee, the Executive Yuan issued three measures to stabilize the price of gauze. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government received an urgent telegram and forwarded it to the committee. According to the content of the measures, the customs declaration for cotton yarn and cloth for re-export must be approved by the committee, which shows that the scope is very wide. And if it is handled in accordance with the management measures for the transport of gauze to the south, the monthly quota of gauze transported to major commercial ports across the country will need to be calculated, and the procedures will be very complicated. However, the committee is actively preparing, and once Chairman Wu returns to Shanghai, they will discuss the implementation method.

Gauze Market Situation is Uniformly Downstream

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, after the Executive Yuan issued three measures to stabilize the price of gauze, the Jianghai Customs and the North Station in the city received the instructions from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation, and exports were restricted, so the gauze market situation was uniformly downstream. Those holding goods rushed to sell them, while buyers dared not continue to enter the market. The market fell sharply in the morning, but people's hearts have stabilized in the afternoon.

Forecast of Cotton Yarn Purchase Price in April

According to Liu, the purchase price of cotton yarn in April has not been discussed by the Sixth District Cotton Textile Public Meeting Price Negotiation Group, so the Textile Management Committee has no basis for discussion, and there is no saying that 3.4 million yuan has been determined. The current cotton in Shanghai has been allocated. According to his estimation, if the cost of each load of cotton from the Industry and Commerce General Association is 650,000 yuan, then the purchase price of 20-count yarn in April should be above 4 million yuan. As for the yarn spun by each factory from cotton purchased on its own in addition to the cotton from the Industry and Commerce General Association and the limited import quota, it is not included in the purchase.

Letter from the Cotton Textile Public Association to the Textile Management Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Machinery Cotton Textile Industry Association recently stated that the rising price of cotton has made it impossible to maintain the cost of the purchase price set by the Textile Management Committee, and has listed detailed figures in a letter to the Textile Management Committee, requesting comprehensive instructions for the textile industry to follow. The content of the original letter is as follows:

"We respectfully report that since the 18th Committee meeting of your association on December 27th of last year resolved to stabilize yarn prices, each yarn factory has conscientiously implemented the policy of having the government purchase half of the cotton yarn produced since January 1st, 1947. However, soon after your association purchased cotton yarn to stabilize market prices, the market price of cotton yarn has risen from 2.2 million yuan per piece to more than 6 million yuan, and the price of cotton has risen from 300,000 yuan per load to 1.5 million yuan.

The purchase price of yarn in January was 1,975,000 yuan per piece, which was only 200,000 yuan away from the market price. The purchase price of yarn in April has not yet been clearly indicated by your association, but there is a saying that it will be set at around 3.4 million yuan, which is more than 3 million yuan away from the market price. Proportionally speaking, the difference was only 10% at the beginning, but now it has reached 100%. The price of cotton and the price of yarn are becoming more and more decoupled.

At the beginning of the purchase, the price of cotton was 300,000 yuan per load, and the purchase price of cotton yarn was 1,975,000 yuan, a ratio of 1 to 6.6. Now the price of cotton is 1.5 million yuan. Assuming that the purchase price is still around 3.4 million yuan, the ratio is 1 to 2.3, a difference of two-thirds in proportion. In terms of the purpose of the purchase, it was originally to stabilize yarn prices. However, the instability of yarn prices remains the same, and the significance of the purchase has long been lost.

The distance between the market price and the purchase price is increasing day by day, and the evolution of the market is far beyond the original expectations. In particular, the market price of yarn and cotton cannot match. (If the purchase price is 3.4 million yuan, only 230 pounds of cotton can be purchased at the market price. According to the 350 pounds of raw cotton required per piece, there is a shortage of 120 pounds, and there is no way to pay for labor.) If the current situation is not thoroughly changed, the effect of stabilizing yarn prices will not be achieved, and yarn factories are already facing the situation of suspending work and closing down. Your association bears the mission of supervising the rational development of the national textile industry. At present, the textile industry is facing a critical moment of survival. We urge your association to provide comprehensive instructions to follow, which would be fortunate for the textile industry and fortunate for the national industry."

46 Households Resume Yarn Allocation

A total of 183 manufacturers whose allocation of yarn was temporarily suspended by the Textile Construction Company due to the fact that the amount applied for did not meet the actual production needs, have once again stated their reasons to the company's business department and submitted supplementary documents. After re-examination, it has been approved that the allocation will be resumed from yesterday (23rd) for 46 households. These include 23 knitting industries, 6 underwear industries, 5 towel and sheet industries, 10 handkerchief industries, and 2 canvas industries.

Four Cases of Illegal Business Operation Uncovered

The Economic Group of the Garrison Headquarters has dispatched a large number of personnel to the yarn and cloth markets in recent days to investigate unscrupulous merchants and put pressure on them, and has achieved results. Yesterday, the black market price of Shuangma 20-count yarn plummeted by more than 1 million yuan from a high price of 6.8 million yuan per piece, and the price of cloth also fell by 30,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan per bolt, with a continuing downward trend. The group also announced yesterday that it had uncovered four cases of illegal gauze and cloth business operations: (1) Fuan Yarn Factory, located in the Salt Industry Building at 280 Beijing Road, sold 188 bales of cotton yarn on the black market from April 7th to April 15th, all exceeding the negotiated price, which is obviously illegal. The factory manager, Ni Baosheng, and the deputy manager, Du Yunzhan, have been summoned, and the case has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. (2) Shengxin Yarn Number at 249 Zhonghui Building, Zhengdong Road, falsified account books and hoarded 29 pieces of cotton yarn. The hoarded cotton yarn was confiscated. (3) Qinxing Yarn Number at 250 Zhonghui Building is a "side-job" yarn number that specializes in "passing the buck". There are no account books at all. The penalty is suspension of business. (4) Yongda Xiejihang on Xiaoshadu Road is a department store that uses the name of department stores to request the distribution of cloth and sells it on the black market. It was discovered by inspectors on the spot and has also been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal proceedings.

### National Bonds Mediocre

The public bonds were still very mediocre yesterday, first high and then low. Room 504 had offers, while Runde accepted them. Tong Bing opened at 14,000 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 14,000 yuan and a low of 12,600 yuan. It struggled around 13,000 yuan in the end. As a result, it fell by 1,200 yuan compared to the previous close. Categories A and B fell by 1,000 yuan. Category D was still flat, while Tong Wu fell by 1,300 yuan. The transaction volume was only 3-4 million.

### Four Types of Security Designated for US Dollar Bonds

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 23rd] The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Industries recently held several meetings to discuss the issue of security for US dollar bonds. It is reported that it has been decided to use the following four categories as security: (1) The wharves and warehouses received nationwide, (2) The real estate received nationwide, (3) The stocks invested by the central government in companies such as Shanghai Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, (4) China Textile Corporation. It is reported that the total value of the above four categories exceeds 5 trillion yuan. If the Supervisory Committee finds that the amount is insufficient during the review, it can continue to allocate funds. The detailed list is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other agencies. In addition, the government recently ordered the National Bank to allocate the principal and interest of the US dollar bonds due on September 30th. The National Bank is processing the transfer procedures and will announce it soon.

### Sugar Market Fluctuates Unevenly

The sugar market still fluctuated unevenly depending on the trend of off-site transactions. Ti Zhuang Qing was 200,100 to 202,000 yuan, Mian Chi was 218,000 to 220,000 yuan, Xinghua Bai Gao was 320,000 to 315,000 yuan, Xinghua Chi was 210,000 to 200,800 yuan, and Jing Diao Qing was 187,000 to 189,000 yuan. The total transaction volume was more than 500 pieces.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Customers Re-register and Number

According to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the company has stipulated the following methods for renumbering customer registrations: (1) All customers who have been approved for registration, whose registration numbers are from 1 to 500, should collect the survey form from the company's promotion department from now on, fill it in again, and send it to the company for review before April 30th to renumber. (2) Starting from May 1st, the newly compiled registration numbers will be applied, and all old registration numbers will be cancelled.

### New Light's Delivery Starts Today

Yesterday, "New Light" opened at 108 yuan and closed at 115 yuan. At the beginning of the market, Mu Zhuangwu of No. 204 posted 124 yuan, first reporting a limit up. Although No. 154 sold out a lot, it was finally supported by banks and securities firms. The bulls and bears struggled, and the limit up was reached more than ten times. After the limit up, there was a transaction of 35 yuan outside the market. This morning, "New Light's Delivery" will debut for the first time. According to yesterday's trading, the trend will be more active.

### Seasonable Wool Fabrics Sell Well

Yesterday, the wool fabric market was quite good. The sales of men's and women's colored wool fabrics in wool fabric clothing stores were brisk. Seasonable light-colored thin floral woolen fabrics, serge, venetian, palice, and feather yarn wool fabrics were more popular with customers and merchants. Due to the increasing actual sales due to the hot weather, the sales of Chinese and Western clothing have increased. The standard wholesale market price is still on the path of a clear firm and dark rise due to various facts and environmental factors. Looking at the retail price tags, each store is continuing to adjust them. Spring and summer goods that are slightly pleasing to the eye are priced at more than 40,000 yuan per yard, and each suit is mostly priced at around 1 million yuan.

### Government-Licensed Imports and Exports Between China and Korea Allowed for Transport

China and Korea have not yet formally announced the opening of trade. Regarding the issue of import and export trade, Korea has sent representatives to Shanghai to negotiate with our diplomatic authorities, but no concrete measures have been obtained so far. It is now known that import and export goods between the two countries that are licensed by the government are allowed to be transported. Otherwise, if any ships or sailboats transport goods from Korea into China or from China to Korea without permission, they will be prohibited. Any smuggling found will be detained.

### Affected by the Surge in Foreign Stocks, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Again - Up to Eleven Types Reach the Limit Up

### No Formal Rice Transactions - Grain, Flour, and Oil Prices Rise Again - Off-Market White Rice Rises to 190,000 Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice market rose again yesterday, affected by the issuance of 10,000 yuan bills and reports of rising prices in the producing areas. A total of 5,686 stones of goods arrived in the north and south markets. The market price list of food rice, single japonica, and thin rice fields were all blank, and there was no price filled in. Japonica rice formed a situation where there were no goods to supply the market. The off-market prices were blindly shouted, and the prices secretly soared by more than 10,000 yuan. The authorities advised the industry to find ways to stabilize prices, so there were no formal transactions in the japonica rice market. Bai Yuansheng soared to a new high price of 196,000 yuan, and Yin Yuan also reached 182,000 yuan. The Social Bureau continued to release a total of 9,000 bags of white japonica, red pointed, and Saigon rice. The price of white japonica was still 135,500, red pointed was 120,500 yuan, and medium-sized Saigon was 110,000 yuan. The black market price of off-market white japonica has risen to 190,000 yuan, and the limited retail price of 165,000 yuan can no longer be supplied due to reports of rising prices in the producing areas.

Yesterday, according to Ji Mingzhai, the head of the Food Section, the Social Bureau has released a total of 58,305 bags of white japonica, Saigon, and red pointed rice in the market in recent days. Among them, more than 30,000 bags are currently in the process of being shipped out. The rumor that rice merchants have paid for five or six days, but the allocated rice has not yet been given, is not true. It takes about three days to pay and complete the shipping procedures, and then the goods can be shipped. He said that he can only act as a firefighter doing his best to passively control the situation regarding the recent jump in rice prices. He said that it is beyond his ability to actively dredge the source and suppress the price of producing areas. He also said that Director Wu has gone to Beijing to attend the National Price Conference and should be able to come up with countermeasures.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Black market prices of flour have risen to 101,000, an increase of 2,000 from the previous day. Bingchuan was 72,800, an increase of 4,800 yuan.

Red sorghum wine workshops had a better demand, soaring by 4-5,000 yuan. Allocated oil was supplied as usual.

### Various Firms Compete to Buy, Foreign Stocks Rise Sharply

Yesterday, foreign stocks saw a large reduction in Hong Kong market water and were eagerly bought by Guang firms, securities firms, and banks, leading to a depletion of chips and unprecedentedly fierce price increases. Yisha opened at 39,400 yuan in the morning and immediately competed to buy, with the high price reaching 48,700 yuan. Bidding prices were approaching 50,000 yuan, and the situation was extremely chaotic. However, prices fell slightly after reaching a high. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha rose by 20%, British Union rose by 15%, Wheelock Marden Wharf, Yeguang Paper, Telephone KaiPing each rose by about 10%, Shipping rose by 5%, and Yip's Brewery, Ye Industry, and Kenji rose only slightly.

### Tea Market Transactions Sparse

This year's new Longjing tea from Wenzhou, since the stock in the producing area has tended to shrink, the amount arriving recently is not as much as before, and those holding the goods have shouted up prices, resulting in an increase.  Mao Feng green tea, the current new goods in Tunxi are priced at 2.4 million yuan per unit, and new goods in Sian are 2 million yuan per load, but the prices here are exceptionally high, so sales are extremely sluggish.  As for various types of domestic old tea, supply and demand are not large, and the process remains in a state of deadlock.  Foreign firms' tea market buyers' appetite is still narrow, and they continue to plan to buy at low prices, the situation is still difficult to improve, and transactions continue to be sparse.

### 2,500 Cases of Rayon Arrive in Shanghai; China Trust Resumes Allotment Today

[Report from this newspaper] The long-awaited first batch of Japanese rayon for this year finally arrived yesterday from Japan by the Central Trust Bureau, totaling 2,500 cases.

First allocated to the silk weaving industry, in addition to the quota of the Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company, each factory will still be allocated one-fifth of the amount applied for in December of last year.

No. 120 Takayama Arakawa opened at 1.3 million yuan, then fell back to 1.09 million yuan with a transaction. Afterwards, prices fluctuated without major changes, and it still closed at 900,000 yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment softened further, with a minimum shouted price of 600,000 yuan. At one point, due to the rise in stocks, the shouted price jumped to 1.67 million yuan, but ultimately, with the allocation imminent, no one paid much attention, and it fell again, finally still shouted at 1.09 million yuan. The result was 1.5 million yuan lower than the previous day.

The factory market was quite quiet yesterday morning. Several loads of B-grade were transacted at a price of 1.4 million yuan. The afternoon was slightly more active, with slight transactions in each grade, and the price was about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan higher than in the morning, the result was similar to the price of the previous day.

Other goods and factory prices were unchanged.

### Metals Rise

The metal market situation has seen another increase. Among them, the rise in foreign nails is the most intense. "Human Head" sandpaper, Three-Star steel saws, and all copper and iron products have all seen improvement.

### Second Quarter Import Quotas Expected to Be Announced This Month

[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee held its 29th regular meeting on April 22nd. It has been learned that the resolutions are as follows: (1) The Central Bank has scheduled a joint meeting of the Export Promotion and Import Management Committees on April 23rd to discuss special import measures for packaging materials and raw materials needed for export goods.

(5) President Zhang expressed great concern about the import applications that have not yet been processed by the Quota Allocation Office and the Non-Quota Examination Office, and has instructed the heads of the relevant offices at the meeting to clear them within a limited time. The work has been extremely tense in recent days. It is reported that approximately 30 to 40 cases can be processed daily in the first category, more than 100 cases in the second category, and 200 to 300 cases in the third category (Category A). It is hoped that all accumulated cases, whether approved or rejected, will be cleared by the end of May.

### Dalian Under the Iron Curtain

— Special Correspondent Bing Yu, Liaoyuan Airmail, 16th

Since an American ship carrying diplomatic mail and relief supplies sailed to Dalian, an American reporter accompanied it. As a result, the reporter's impressions quickly spread throughout the world. The timing of this news release was in late December last year, when Shenyang was covered in heavy snow and people were huddled indoors to keep warm. However, upon hearing the news that the U.S. State Department acknowledged that Dalian was still under Soviet military control, people couldn't help but feel a burning sensation.

Because Dalian is a major commercial port in the Northeast, with thriving trade and developed business, the people of Shenyang, which is the military and political center of the Northeast, are even more concerned about taking over Dalian. The movements of Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang and Special Commissioner Zhang Jianfei, as well as the negotiations between Soviet Ambassador and Foreign Minister Wang, are particularly noteworthy to the general public.

According to the main points of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance announced by the National Government on August 25, 1945, regarding the Dalian and Lushun issue, although our country has declared Dalian a free port, open to all trade and shipping, all administrative powers belong to our country, except that the port director is appointed by Soviet personnel, and the opening period is set at 30 years. Therefore, the timing of the takeover of Dalian is believed to be not far away. Due to the Communist army's widespread harassment of the people in Dalian, the people of Lushun, Dalian, and Jinzhou have repeatedly petitioned the authorities in Shenyang, and relevant parties speculate that military action to cooperate with the promotion of the takeover work is also highly possible.

The reporter originally intended to follow merchants to Dalian for an inspection last month, but Dalian, which is occupied by the Communists, absolutely does not allow any people from other provinces to go to Dalian. On the contrary, many refugees have secretly fled from Dalian, living a miserable life in Shenyang. Below is an account from a former teacher at a national school during the puppet Manchukuo era, who lamented to the reporter about the current situation in Dalian.

Since the victory, Dalian has not enjoyed the joy given by the victory. Only before November of the year before last, people from all walks of life in the local area organized a temporary organization called the Local Maintenance Committee, which was dedicated to maintaining the local area and protecting the properties and buildings of various enemies and puppets. After the current Communist army's "Dalian City" Deputy Mayor Chen Yuntao and "Lushun City" Deputy Mayor Chen Minli arrived in Dalian, they dissolved the Maintenance Committee, severely scolded the members, and arrogantly regarded themselves as "victorious figures."

The two puppet deputy mayors arrived in Lushun and Dalian empty-handed, so naturally they could not carry out any work. Therefore, they pushed out local financial magnates to be considered "democratically elected" "mayors." In fact, it was still under the means of threats and inducements that they were forced onto the stage. In the Communist Party's "political tactics," it was already considered "local autonomy" completed.

Outsiders may not believe it, or at least have some doubts, why so many local people in Dalian participate in the "municipal government" and other Communist Party organizations, especially women? In fact, the reason is also very simple. Although the old Eighth Route Army from Jiaodong are the cadres of the "municipal government," most of them are "rough guys" who can't even write the popular "colloquial official documents" (those who can write are already in charge). Therefore, the work of writing and calculating still has to be done by the locals. If they don't work in any organization, they will immediately be labeled as "national spies." Women, in order to avoid the danger of "public wives," also join the "Women's Federation" to serve, because there is still a small allowance to alleviate economic difficulties.

The Communist Party "municipal government," in order to trap scholars and Kuomintang members, deliberately collects some information and lists them as the Communist Party municipal government's roster. In fact, the Communist Party's genuine members are extremely strict about joining the party. This kind of foolish conspiracy has long been seen through by the local people. Moreover, the incompetence of the people in the Communist Party's municipal government, even the puppet-style "Lushun-Dalian Administrative Joint Office" Director and Deputy Director Chi Zixiang and Liu Xin, the former is a wine bag and the latter is a rice bucket, and Wang Xiping, the "Dalian County Chief" who manages the suburbs of Dalian, used to be a shop assistant in a leather shoe store. The former "Lushun-Dalian Police Bureau" Director Zhao Lebin, everyone knows that he is "Old Zhao" who sells used goods. The people of Dalian say that these phenomena are similar to the situation in the enemy-puppet era where a barber who worked for the Japanese was appointed as the county chief, with different tunes sung in harmony.

Although the puppet municipal government's organization is divided into various bureaus and offices, except for the finance and tax revenue agencies, which are the busiest (because collecting money and grain is their main task), the construction, public utilities, and office personnel, apart from warming themselves by the fire, are idle all day long.

On the surface, the Communist Party is still openly active in Dalian. In fact, espionage work is still carried out secretly. The ones in charge of the Dalian area are three people surnamed Han, Song, and Sun, all of whom are "local committee members" of the "Dalian City Party Committee." The local people only see them going out, with three or four guards, preceding and following them, but they cannot ask their names. Therefore, behind their backs, they are called Song Guang, Han Guang, and Sun Guang, separately nicknamed "Guang Kuo," and together they are called "San Guang Ma Zi." A "training center" is specially set up near Sanchun Town, ostensibly to train party members, but in reality, it is an agency for espionage work research. When work reviews are submitted for discussion, if it is found that someone wants to abandon the darkness and turn to the light or is "not loyal to the party," they will be imprisoned lightly or executed heavily. Therefore, some Communist Party members who are deeply dissatisfied with the reality appear happy, but secretly act carelessly, taking it one day at a time.

In terms of the Communist Party's party affairs in Dalian, the class system is very strict, which is contrary to the high-sounding tune of "no class." Moreover, the prominence of the "local committee" and the snobbery of the "party members" have caused the "Communist Party" to play a major role in all administrative agencies. The political commissar of any agency can overturn the decision of its supervisor, just like the Japanese deputy officials in the puppet Manchukuo government "guiding" the puppet Manchukuo officials.

There is no "democracy" in Dalian. Even the "democratic politics" that the Communist Party is good at, hanging sheep's heads and selling dog meat, cannot be seen. The active results of the "struggle meetings" and "liquidation meetings" have given idle ruffians an opportunity to make a temporary career as a "cheering squad." And arresting people is entirely at their discretion. "Freedom" cannot be seen in Dalian.

There is no "culture" to speak of in Dalian under the Communist army's occupation. Three party-run newspapers—Dalian Daily, Shinhua Bao, and Xinsheng Times—have very smooth sales (because they are sold by force). The news is the same everywhere. What is seen on the paper is all articles praising the Communist Party. The so-called "mass words" are nothing more than fabricated things that insult the government and extinguish conscience.

Ideological control is very strict. All radios in the city have been confiscated. No one can hear the news from Beiping and Nanjing. However, the lecture sessions held by the fang gong suo force every resident to attend. Public servants, teachers, and students from various puppet agencies and schools are forced to participate. Communist Party agents mix among them. If anyone expresses unwillingness, they will definitely be subject to severe and cruel punishment. In the Xigang Branch of the Police Bureau, the Shahekou Branch, and the detention center of the court, these ideological prisoners are full every day.

Speaking of red education, students from the "Lushun-Dalian National Construction College" often wear five-cornered hats. This is the highest red academy. They graduate in six months. Although they are divided into classes and departments, the students are all transferred from various agencies for training. There are very few lessons every day, just things like "Socialism," "Marxist Theory," "New Democracy and the United Government," and "Democracy and Struggle." The president is "Local Committee" Han Guang, and the vice president is Yuan Muhua, who is the director of the Education Committee of the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Joint Office, that is, an "education agent." If any student is considered to have "ideological wavering," they will be arrested the next day. And there are often unfamiliar faces among the classmates. There is no need to ask more. They are "special commissioners" for ideological research. In the two municipal secondary schools for boys and girls, political classes are also taught, with Communist Party political commissars serving as teachers. Other subjects such as mathematics and science are three hours per week, and Russian and English are two hours per week, with the former being more important than the latter. Primary schools, on the other hand, don't matter at all. They sing revolutionary songs every day, which saves the teachers the trouble of grading papers. "Latinization of Chinese Characters" is the slogan of the Communist Party's education agencies. After implementation, it has created the fact of obliterating Chinese culture. The citizens of Dalian all expressed their opposition to this vicious method, but under the oppression of the Communist Party's iron hooves, they dare to be angry but dare not speak out!

Today's industry and commerce in Dalian truly make people disbelieve that this is a major commercial port.

The "municipal government's" tax collection work is too zealous. Private industries and businesses cannot shoulder the heavy burden of exorbitant taxes. If they have any wealth, they may be struggled against. Therefore, since the "municipal government" was established not long ago, the trend of closures has been rampant. Nine out of ten private factories have been liquidated. And what about the "state-run" ones? They organized Yuhua, Xinhua, Liaodong, and other cooperatives with the people's fat and blood. Grain prices and commodity prices are adjusted at any time. Only state-run businesses are allowed in sea and land transportation, industry, and trade. Private businesses are not allowed.

Today, factories in Dalian are destroyed, workers are unemployed, and merchants are squeezed, causing the people's lives to fall into unprecedented poverty. Starving people are everywhere, and beggars are endless on the road. The refugees at Shihe Station don't even have sorghum rice to eat. But the Communist Party personnel who manage the refugees still frequent prostitutes, drink alcohol, and seek pleasure.

On the streets, only Japanese prostitutes are seen. The Japanese girls at the entrance of the cafeteria are not transformed goddesses? As long as you spend 500 yuan in "Northeast Bank" currency, she can satisfy your desires. Is this heaven or hell!

Along the port of Dalian, there are only small state-run steamships cruising, and armed speedboats also patrol from time to time. Apart from this, there are only certain warships and merchant ships coming and going between Lushun and Dalian. The common people dare not go deep into the coastal areas, at most they can only peek at the station half a mile from the port. What can often be seen is certain parties busy with transportation. Trams and electric lights still exist in some parts. After using four generators, Dalian is often without water again. The flowers and trees in Central Park and the tour boats in Xingpu can only be recalled by the citizens of Dalian, because these are all examples of being destroyed.

The Western-style houses on both sides of Xigang Street and Huichun Street are nine out of ten empty. Japanese residents have been repatriated to their country, and citizens have fled one after another. These empty Western-style houses have become refugee concentration camps. No tourists can be seen in Nanshan, the racecourse is almost in ruins, and the airport runway is also damaged. The past prosperity and liveliness cannot be seen in Dalian. The pedestrians who come and go, in addition to the red elements flaunting their power, are filled with a sad and gloomy atmosphere throughout Dalian. The citizens of Dalian, who live in deep water and scorching heat, are the same in Lushun and Jin County, longing for the government to take over Dalian as soon as possible, so that the people can breathe a breath of free and fresh air!

### Suzhou Municipal Council Special Record

— Our Suzhou dispatch, 8th. Special correspondent Wu Shouren

The first popularly elected Municipal Council of Suzhou was formally established on the 15th of last month. The 143 councilors are all outstanding figures from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and educational circles, who were honored with a seat representing public opinion after a heated election process. In the past few months, which was the period of gestation for this great popular election, the reporter silently observed the movements of all parties with a very objective eye, and felt that the competition with each other was enthusiastic, truly like a raging fire. Especially for the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, it showed a fully democratic sentiment! Of course, there were inevitably some differences of opinion due to the different central figures. From this competitive angle, we can see the people's concern for politics today, reaching an ideal level! Among the competitors, they can probably be divided into three major groups: one is the veteran faction centered on Mr. Song Jicheng; another is the younger faction surrounding Mr. Wu Wentian; and the third is the education faction centered on Mr. Fan Gongren, a leading figure in the educational and cultural circles.

New Route

Not long after Mr. Wu Wentian returned to Suzhou from Shanghai, the Central Government suddenly announced the new appointment of him as a legislator. According to the regulations, public officials cannot concurrently serve as representatives of public opinion. The decision to choose should of course be to accept the legislator and give up the councilor. Mr. Qian Dajun, in a non-official capacity, expressed his willingness to assist in the construction work of his hometown. After the news spread, Suzhou and the surrounding areas were immediately in an uproar. With Mu Yin's reputation and status, it was the most ideal destination. However, for Mu Yin to serve as the Speaker, this is by no means a simple election issue. The main thing should be to find him a Deputy Speaker who can cooperate, so as to have the confidence to encourage Mu Yin to take on the role without hesitation. However, in fact, this problem is indeed not easy to solve.

The younger generation decided on a brand-new route, which is to support Mr. Qian Dajun as the Speaker and Mr. Yan Xinqi as the Deputy Speaker. Undoubtedly, this is a highly激烈的fan-dong. The education faction naturally combined to form a mixed camp, with the central idea of supporting Mr. Song Jicheng as the Speaker and Mr. Fan Gongren as the Deputy Speaker.

Strength Estimate

If we make a fair estimate of the basic strength of these two major camps, new and old, the proportion is not enough to control the odds of the election. The new camp, mainly composed of the younger generation, has a basic strength of only one-third of the total number of councilors, while the old camp, mainly composed of the veteran and education factions, has a basic strength of only one-fifth. The remaining majority of one-half are completely middle-of-the-road people who have no party affiliation and can swing to either side. The fact is very clear: whoever can grasp these many middle-of-the-road people will truly win the victory!

Grasping the middle-of-the-road people is not simply achieved by activity contacts. They are often sufficient to truly represent public opinion in many places. Therefore, the main condition for grasping the middle-of-the-road people is still to see how the social public's psychological trends are? After the war, the social public's psychology almost surged and flooded, emphasizing the two major prerequisites of seeking peace and seeking construction. However, the vast majority of them know that the elements of seeking peace and seeking construction must first have a strong economic backing, second must have the support of a heroic character, and third must have a weighty reputation. If the three elements can be prepared day by day, then the psychology of seeking peace and seeking construction, even if there is no immediate guarantee of realization, can ultimately exist with some hope of longing. The social public's psychological trends are like this. Then, the figures who can best meet these three elements are naturally none other than Mr. Qian Dajun and Mr. Yan Xinqi! Therefore, when the council was established and the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker was launched, Mr. Qian and Mr. Yan finally emerged with the largest majority of 97 votes and 84 votes to serve as the first Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Suzhou. This result, we should say that it is the success of activity contacts, rather than the social public's psychological makeup, is more relevant to the facts!

Mr. Qian's Reputation

But then again, although the social public's psychology emphasizes seeking peace and seeking construction, how can it be seen that Mr. Qian and Mr. Yan can indeed shoulder these two expectations of the vast public and confidently and without hesitation trust and appoint them? The reasons for this are nothing more than two points: (1) Mr. Qian Dajun has considerable potential and foundation in politics. Everyone believes that although he is in a non-official capacity, he still has the status of 言九重鼎. Once he serves as the Speaker, in the future, the separation between officials and the people, and the suffering of the people, can be communicated and conveyed by him, which will inevitably lead the province and county to pay more attention to it. (2) Mr. Yan Xinhong has always been in a leading position in the local economy, and his style over the years has not entered the capitalist circle. He has been happy to sponsor and support the public welfare construction undertakings of the local community, which has been commonly seen and known by the public. If he serves as the Deputy Speaker, then the promotion of local construction undertakings in the future can at least achieve the effect of one person's advocacy leading to a hundred responses, which is more directly beneficial to the public's expectations of seeking peace and seeking construction!

Mr. Yan's Expression

The analysis of the public's psychological belief in Mr. Qian and Mr. Yan has been described above. However, we should study whether they can in fact match the public's psychology and reward the ardent hopes of the 1.18 million people of Suzhou? Here, we can objectively report Mr. Yan Xinqi's expression on future tasks: "I believe that the actual pain and psychological fear given to the people by the post-war social environment are truly interwoven and complex. Even with the perseverance and determination to save them from drowning and solve their problems, it is not easy to gradually rescue and improve them in a way that is appropriate for both urgent and slow matters. Therefore, if a true public opinion institution wants to fully exert its functions, it must first understand what the most urgent and most important thing is for the people's suffering today, and then proceed step by step to seek rescue and improvement according to the correct procedure, so as not to reverse the order of urgency and neglect the fundamentals. In my personal opinion, I feel that the crux of the current suffering of the people is nothing more than the instability of the rural areas; and the reasons for the rural unrest are complex. To draw its outline, the main thing is that the burden on farmers is too heavy. Therefore, in the future, the council will give close consideration to the determination of township and village expenses, the abolition of harsh miscellaneous taxes, the increase in production, and the handling of cooperative transportation and sales, etc., to save the rural economy with both radical and palliative measures, and formulate concrete plans for gradual implementation. Secondly, the pain of public teachers, the exhaustion of commercial economy, and the flooding of unemployment are all prepared to gather ideas and discuss effective remedial measures. As for the superficial rectification of the local society, which is related to the external outlook, I think it is relatively easy to start with, and will take the lead in advocating."

From the above remarks, we can understand that Mr. Yan sees the current advantages and disadvantages very clearly. At the same time, we can also see that he seems to have quite a determination to promote advantages and eliminate disadvantages.

For the time being, the result of the first congress of the council is undoubtedly the turning point in the fate of the local society of Suzhou, determining whether it can turn from bad to good. However, local construction work is the responsibility of everyone, especially the rights and obligations of the councilors to take on the arduous task without hesitation, and they must work together to exert their efforts in order to have hope. We believe that the election phase has passed, and the future should be a time of harmony and cooperation. Here, we offer our infinite expectations!

### Liang Yansun's Chronicle

— Lu Danlin

Over the past decade, due to my focus on modern historical materials, I have read many people's chronicles. Among them, I find the "Chronicle of Mr. Liang Yansun of Sanshui" to be one of the most interesting, even more meaningful to read than the Chronicle of Ye Gongchuo.

Liang Yansun's chronicle begins in the eighth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1869) and ends in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. During these sixty-five years, China experienced drastic changes in politics, economics, transportation, diplomacy, and culture. Mr. Liang lived through this era, and his actions and career were directly or indirectly closely related to these areas. Therefore, this chronicle is very much a miniature of modern history.

The entire work is divided into two volumes, upper and lower, in a sixteen-mo format, totaling over a thousand pages and more than seven hundred thousand words, which can be described as a grand spectacle. The first edition was published in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic, with a revised second edition recently released. It includes four illustrations.

The chronicle naturally focuses on the subject's life and career. However, if one were to narrate and include all the experiences, actions, and works of a person over several decades, even millions of words would not be enough. This is especially true for prominent figures in the political arena, who have numerous connections and abundant materials. How can one include everything? The principle of "宁缺毋滥" (寧缺毋濫, "better to have less than to have inferior quality") can be applied. Moreover, when a person's connections are broad, there are many things that cannot be published or are not yet ready for publication, so one must reluctantly omit them or temporarily keep them reserved. Therefore, it is difficult to write chronicles and autobiographies of contemporary figures without intentional omissions, and there is nothing that can be done about it.

Speaking of Liang Yansun (Shiyi), he has thirty years of history in politics. While many people praised him, there were also several instances where people misunderstood his environment or the inside story of certain events, making him the target of public criticism. The most notable examples include the Five-Route Petition Case, the preparation for Yuan Shikai's enthronement, the redemption of the Jiaoji Railway, and the Major Transportation Case. The chronicle reveals the truth behind these events, allowing people to understand the underlying context. Of course, some details related to other parties involved cannot be disclosed too explicitly. However, from this, we can gain a much clearer understanding compared to previous hearsay.

In terms of historical facts, the chronicle details major domestic events over sixty years, such as the Hundred Days' Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, the revision of the Sino-British Treaty on Opium Suppression, the Xinhai Revolution, the establishment of the Republic of China, the Second Revolution, the Sino-Russian Agreement, the Twenty-One Demands, Yuan Shikai's betrayal, the restoration of the Republic, participation in World War I and the recruitment of laborers, Puyi's restoration, the Ma Chang Campaign against Zhang Xun, the establishment of the Guangzhou Constitutional Protection Government, the North-South Peace Conference, the Shandong Problem, the Zhili-Anhui War, the Washington Conference, Hunan's provincial autonomy, the First and Second Zhili-Fengtian Wars, Chen Jiongming's rebellion, the Lincheng Kidnapping Case, Cao Kun's bribery, the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, the expulsion of Puyi from the Forbidden City, Duan Qirui's provisional government, Sun Yat-sen's journey north, the Post-War Conference, the Gold Franc Case and the new agreement, the May Thirtieth Movement, the establishment of the National Government, the abolition of Likin (internal transit tax), the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, Zhang Zuolin's appointment as Grand Marshal, the split between Nanjing and Wuhan, national unification, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and major plans such as the raising of various public debts, transportation construction, and finance. In particular, the details regarding the financial and transportation sectors are so comprehensive that it would not be an exaggeration to call it a thirty-year history of finance and transportation. Among the chronicles of various individuals over the past decades, none can match its richness.

The book contains several descriptions of Liang's resourcefulness in dealing with crises and his anecdotes. For example, his experience while fleeing Beijing to Huairou to avoid the Boxer Rebellion is described as follows:

"On the 21st of this month (May), Mr. Liang, along with Madam Gao, his concubine Ms. Pan, sons Dingji, Dingwu, and a female servant, left Beijing. They first traveled by land to Tongzhou and then sailed south along the Grand Canal. The group included Guan Boheng (Mianjun) and his family, totaling over a hundred people, including men, women, old, and young. As soon as they arrived at Muzhuang, they were met with cannon fire and could not pass, forcing them to go to Hexiwu. While on the boat, they found altars in every village and Boxers everywhere along the way. They were forced to worship the altars and burn paper money. Anyone whose ashes from burning the paper money did not fly up was immediately labeled a 'Han traitor' and killed without mercy. Mr. Liang, helpless in the face of violence, wore loose-fitting clothes and, with each bow, flicked his sleeves, causing the ashes to fly up, thus narrowly escaping death many times. One day, when Guan Boheng bowed, the ashes did not fly up, and they were about to seize him. Boheng turned pale. Mr. Liang shouted loudly, 'Lord Guan is not afraid!' The Boxer leader admired Guan Yu and often referred to him as 'Lord Guan.' Hearing this, they released him. Boheng was drenched in sweat."

Liang's lectures at Fenggang Academy also have an interesting anecdote. The academy traditionally selected sixty outstanding students each month and awarded them stipends. Mr. Liang, to encourage poor scholars, increased the number of recipients and donated money for the awards. The locals followed suit, and hundreds of people came to the academy. There was a scholar named Chen in the county, an elder scholar, who was seventy years old. On the day of the monthly examination, he brought his two sons to help him write. Taking advantage of Mr. Liang's distraction, he secretly passed the draft behind the pillars. Mr. Liang pretended not to notice. When the essay was submitted, Mr. Liang wrote, "The love of parents for their children is all-encompassing. As children, we should take the parents' heart as our own. In the future, when you become famous, please do not forget the sight of your father embracing the pillar in his old age."

During the Zhili-Fengtian War, when the Fengtian army retreated to Junliangcheng, Liang, along with Ye Gongchuo and Zhang Hu, were placed on the wanted list and stripped of their honors and medals. According to the truth stated in the book, "When the order to punish them was about to be issued, some around Mr. Liang advised him to send a telegram to defend himself. Mr. Liang said, 'During Hongxian's reign, I still served Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai), what is today? Since I became an official, I have dedicated myself to the country and have long put life, death, fortune, and misfortune out of my mind. What is there to defend? Zhang Taiyue (Zhang Juzheng) once wrote in his reply to Wu Yaoshan, "Twenty years ago, I had a grand wish to use my body as a mattress for people to lie on, and they could urinate and defecate on it without my interference. If someone wanted to cut off my ears and nose, I would gladly give them." This is Jiangling's (Zhang Juzheng's) confident statement. Although I dare not compare myself to Jiangling, I have never forgotten this wish. If the order is issued, I will take a raft and return to serve my elderly father.' The next evening, he suddenly received a call from the State Council in Beijing, asking Mr. Liang to listen in person. Speaking, it was none other than Zhou Ziqi, the acting Premier. He stated that the order to punish them was about to be issued, and he should countersign the documents because he was an acting Premier. Zhou felt sorry for his decades-old friend and asked Mr. Liang to leave Tianjin immediately to avoid arrest. Mr. Liang said, '(Ziqi) (周字, Zhou's name) thank the East Sea for me, when the tide of the East Sea is calm, perhaps we will meet again! If not you and I, what traces will there be? Future historians will see Zhou Ziqi countersigning the arrest of Liang Shiyi as a good story in political history.' The conversation ended. Not long after, Zhou was also forced to resign and went south to visit Mr. Liang. They met in bewilderment. Later, when Zhou was critically ill, he summoned Zhang Junming and said, 'Looking back on my life, the matter of countersigning the arrest of Liang Yanlao (Liang Shiyi) is the most regretful to my conscience. After I die, please convey my apology.' It is also commendable."

From this, we can see that in the officialdom, the waves are treacherous, and right and wrong are uncertain. Those who do not know the inside story are truly lost in a fog. Especially after each political change, the result is that the generals with troops are never punished, only a few literati are wrongly blamed, and the case is closed.

### Simple Experiments: Wireless Radio

— Nian Hong

Edited by Liu Tongkang, published by World Book Company

Writing a good basic introductory book is not necessarily easier than writing an advanced theoretical book. It is a thankless task, just like the work of elementary school teachers is not valued.

Although China's wireless radio industry is quite developed in general, there are few Chinese books on wireless radio, and practical books for beginners are even rarer. This book can be said to be the only one, and I would like to solemnly recommend it to all amateur radio enthusiasts.

The greatest feature of the book is that it is detailed without being cumbersome and that it incorporates basic theory into experiments. These two points can not only arouse the beginner's interest in exploring wireless radio, but also inspire his wisdom to create new things and turn them into his own new blood and new flesh. A book is dead, it only has a certain limited amount of content, but due to its inspiration, it can expand the small into the large, turn the dead into the living, so that it can be operated at will and increase the effectiveness of the book tenfold, a hundredfold, or even a thousandfold. There are many small things that seem verbose and redundant to those who are experienced in this field, but they are invaluable instructions to a friend who has just stepped across the threshold. For example, the soldering work that must be used in the experiment is considered by amateur practitioners who have been assembling and disassembling for several years to be nothing more than ordinary work, so why elaborate on it, but for beginners it is not necessarily a quite difficult thing, precisely because it is ordinary, so it is more important, try to see that the most common and ordinary work in the world, which one is not the most important and most necessary? It seems that it is the most ordinary and easiest thing for a writer to write a short essay or diary, but an elementary school student has only written the title after scribbling for a long time! Wireless radio work is especially true, a child no one guides blindly bumping into truly do not know how many injustice losses to eat, how much injustice road to walk, not only waste money and effort, and often will grind away many beginners a cavity of enthusiasm, to think that wireless radio is a rare extraordinary something unattainable, because the heart is disheartened, abandoned halfway or even dare not ask Jin, the advantage of this book is here, it can become a good companion for beginners, avoid many unnecessary setbacks and unexpected troubles. It uses simple experiments to introduce beginners into the web of wireless radio, and also gives him the courage to continue his efforts.

The book is divided into five chapters: first, it discusses the installation of the antenna and lightning arrester, tools, and soldering work. The second chapter introduces the basic parts of wireless radio in detail, not only describing the appearance, internal structure, efficacy, and performance of each part, but also interspersing some easy-to-understand important theories at any time to understand why, which makes this book a living thing rather than a soulless shell. Each part also has clear illustrations and special numbers. The last three chapters are the production of crystal radios, single-tube radios, and two-tube radios, which are not only the skeleton of circuit diagrams and parts lists, but also have three-dimensional wiring diagrams, coil winding methods, parts installation and arrangement, as well as radio receiving methods, experimental results, and other bloody and easy-to-digest things. The four circuit boards of the crystal radio are very simple and effective, but there are many places in the state that have branching devices, which in fact often bring some trouble to beginners, which is inevitably a small flaw. Several single-tube and two-tube circuits are also very common, but common does not mean that it is not good, the things that have been eliminated by countless experiments are also the most suitable for practical needs.

Also worth mentioning is that this book is not only suitable for amateur radio enthusiasts in big cities, but also for researchers in poor rural areas. Because in addition to the use of DC power, there is also a homemade AB battery method!

Recently, I saw Mr. Liu's newly compiled "World Wireless Radio Vacuum Tube Encyclopedia", and I feel that Mr. Liu is still working hard for the wireless radio publishing business, then I sincerely hope that Mr. Liu can continue to write a slightly more advanced experimental book after this book, which will definitely be of great benefit to many friends who study wireless radio.

### Introducing Two Books on Reading Guidance

— Huang Weilian

An Example of Skimming Guidance, An Example of Intensive Reading Guidance, co-authored by Ye Shaojun and Zhu Ziqing, published by Commercial Press in 1946 and 1947 respectively.

Western philosopher Bacon once said in his essay collection: "Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be skimmed, others to be read at will, and still others are to be read intensively." Zeng Wenzhenggong also said in his family motto: "The essentials of reading, looking, reading, writing, four things, must not be lacking one day. Looking is like looking at the Records of the Grand Historian, the Book of Han, Han Yu's articles, Reflections at Hand, and the Zhouyi Zhezhong. Reading is like reading the Four Books, the Book of Poetry, the Book of Documents, the Book of Changes, the Zuo Zhuan, the Selections of Refined Literature, the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and the articles of Han Yu, Ouyang Xiu, Zeng Gong, and Wang Anshi. If you do not recite them loudly, you cannot grasp their magnificence; if you do not meditate on them silently, you cannot explore their profound charm." Looking at books and reading books, neither can be neglected.

No matter what people do, they should have proper methods, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort. We should also be the same for the way of reading. Therefore, reading should also be guided, if you can understand the way of reading, you will not waste time and work without success. If there is no method for reading, it is like sailing without a compass, just drifting in the vast sea, unable to reach the destination.

The two books introduced in this article are both one of the Chinese Language Teaching Series of the Sichuan Provincial Education Science Museum. Although they are written for the reference of Chinese language teachers in middle schools, they are also beneficial to ordinary students. The compilation of the two books is similar in method, with a "Preface" in front and a "General Guidance" in the back, one for skimming guidance and one for intensive reading guidance, and the selected materials are also different. The book on skimming lists seven books as examples, including one scripture, one excerpt of famous works, one anthology of poetry, two anthologies, and two novels; among them, "Mencius", "Selected Essence of the Records of the Grand Historian", "Three Hundred Tang Poems", and "Selected Essays of Hu Shi" are suitable for high school students to read, and "Selected Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Yuanpei", "Call to Arms", and "Education of Love" are suitable for junior high school students to read.

The book on intensive reading guidance selects six articles as examples, including one narrative, one short story, one lyric, one explanatory text, and two argumentative essays; among them, "Longgang Qian Biao" and "On Feudalism" are commonly seen in textbooks, and "The Beginning of the Second Anti-Japanese War to the National People's Book" is in the category of supplementary teaching materials stipulated by the Ministry. Shang You Lu Xun's "Medicine", Xu Zhimo's "Cambridge I Know" and Hu Shi's "On New Poetry" (excerpt) are also common middle school supplementary teaching materials.

Because of the two different kinds of teaching materials with different properties, there are two different kinds of guidance. "Skimming guidance must be concise and self-contained; intensive reading guidance must be exhaustive (giving full play to the spirit of salt)", this is their teaching experience. In the preface guidance of the book on skimming, there are the following guidelines such as "edition guidance", "preface and table of contents guidance", "reference books guidance", "reading method guidance", and "problem guidance". In the preface guidance of intensive reading, there are "reading the whole text", "knowing new words and phrases", "answering the questions raised by the teacher", and other preparatory work; and then there are "recitation", "referring to relevant texts, answering the teacher's questions" and other practice work.

According to the above two books, originally as tools for reading guidance, the selected articles, since they are called examples, are certainly not perfect, and cannot be said to be standard; it seems that what we should pay attention to and is worth introducing is that these two books can represent a method of reading guidance. For example, regarding the compilation of books on national studies, there are several kinds that have been published, with Hu Shi and Liang Qichao's "Bibliography of National Studies" in front, and Li Lizhi's "Summary of Selected Books for National Studies" in the back. If you can follow the format set by the authors, Zhu and Zhu, whether it is skimming or intensive reading, let the readers choose any of the basic books of national studies to devote themselves to research and discussion, then day by day, month by month, it will be easy to get started.

In short, skimming and intensive reading, as Zeng Wenzhenggong said: "It is like the battle of military strategists, skimming is like looking at books, then it is attacking cities and seizing land, and opening up territory; intensive reading is like reading books, then it is deep trenches and strong fortresses, and being able to defend the land." Today's education system is divided into elementary school, middle school, and university; in the elementary school period, the childhood is not enlightened, and in practice, what is learned cannot get its actual reality, the middle school period is indeed the most important period, the knowledge sought should not only be advanced from the offensive side, but also should be firm from the defensive side; reading at this time, should spend more effort studying the books, as Bacon said, some books should be tasted, and some books should be chewed carefully, then the roots are firm and the leaves are lush, and can be used as a foundation for future construction.

### Random Notes from the Ladderless Tower

— Yi Yuan

Written by Bu Shaofu, published by News and World Publishing House

This book contains thirty-five essays, all written by the author in the rear during the war. Because the author is a journalist, the articles in this collection include records of wartime life, descriptions of battlefield scenery, sketches of characters, and descriptions of personal feelings. The writing of the whole book is concise and lively, and the charming style is often described in a few words, not only incisively, but also more fresh, making people reluctant to put it down. What is especially commendable is that the author writes profound truths effortlessly, and readers do not have a headache when reading them. With a few light words, it contains good advice for life and dealing with the world. Although the essays in this collection are mainly lyrical and realistic, there are words of "carrying the Tao" in them. The seriousness is its ease. This wonderful application really produced a new style of writing for our essays.

In terms of "carrying the Tao", randomly quoting the author's original text, you can see: "Our general ideas, to be honest, are monopolized by the sentence in the Three Character Classic, "Diligence is rewarding, play is useless." When you mention pleasure, you think of uselessness, which is really harmful." The author is obviously defending the Tao here. But this Tao is not the Tao of those self-righteous moralists who think of depravity when they mention entertainment. He is defending the human right to entertainment. Entertainment does not mean hurting public morals, and entertainment does not mean wasting money. There are many moralists, or pseudo-moralists, in the world now, but the author is defending the right path. However, his defense of the Tao does not reveal a self-righteous appearance, but is interspersed in a light melody like a foxtrot, which is what makes it so valuable.

Since each article in this collection was written during the war, the depiction of wartime life is naturally the most distinctive. The author, with his keen sense of humor, really painted several pictures that make people smile knowingly; such as:

"At noon, I ran into 369, because my intestines had been without oil for a long time, so I ordered a bowl of Four Happiness Noodles. The waiter said:

Sir! Too fatty, right? How about sparerib noodles?

I quickly said: No! No! I'm not afraid of fat."

However, this is also a wartime life picture that makes people sigh a little!

I solemnly recommend this book to people who love literature, history (records of wartime life are also a kind of history), and humor. This is a book worth reading.

### Occasional Notes on a Visit to Jianglang Mountain

— You Jin

The Yue River flows east, dissolving into the water, turning back to look at my hometown, separated by ten thousand layers.

Tomorrow I will pass by Jianglang Mountain, where hibiscus flowers are inserted deep in the azure clouds.

Jianglang Mountain is located in Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, and is the most strangely steep peak in Southeast China. From Shimen Township, walk for several miles to first see hibiscus flowers inserted high in the azure clouds, suddenly embraced, and then see the peak divided into two, standing side by side. Walking to its front, it is shaped like the Chinese character "川" (川, river), clearly three peaks. Therefore, it is also called Sanpanshi (三爿石, Three Slabs of Stone).

One of the three peaks is slightly lower. From a distance, it seems to be wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. Only when you get closer do you realize it is not. This matches Xu Xiake's description of being sharp at the top and converging at the bottom. From Yu Jiawu, it is about three miles uphill, passing Huashi Pavilion, ascending eighteen bends, and reaching Kaiming Temple. In front of it is the Tang Dynasty scholar Zhu Dongshan's vine, and it is also the former residence of Zhou Wenxing, a Ming Dynasty recluse from Fenglin. The people in the temple gave us local products such as large tea leaves and Shijai Huanhuncao (石載還魂草, Sedum sarmentosum Bunge). Leaving from the back door of the temple, climb the Zhonggu Cave and set off firecrackers, the sound of which is as loud as bells and drums. Next, go through a large depression, looking up at the cliffs, which stand upright for thousands of yards. I have been to Jianmen Pass in Sichuan, and although Jianmen Pass is majestic, I feel that it can never be as strangely steep as this. Walking along the rocks, I was trembling with fear, using large reed leaves as divination to walk like a snake, my feet wet and soaked from yesterday's rain. After climbing to a high place and resting for a while, turn to a small depression and descend, as if walking in a long canyon, looking up, my mind was dizzy and my breath was taken away. There is a stone valley and Huanhuncao under the rocks. I picked up a few and set off firecrackers again. The sound was deafening and earth-shattering, and the echo was especially loud. Descending the mountain, I rested at Jianglang Temple.

Fang Yusheng slightly said:

"Jianglang Mountain is also known as Yulang Mountain, also known as Jinshan, fifty miles away from Jiangshan County, six hundred xun high. Also known as Xulang Mountain." The Dongyang Record says: "Jinshun Mountain has three peaks, all hundreds of feet high, the color is dazzling red, and it is impossible to look up at it." The Taiping Huanyu Ji says: "Jianglin Mountain has five-colored stones, which are dazzling in the sun." Today, I have personally visited it, and it is not quite so.

People cannot reach the top of the mountain. It is said that there is a pond on it that produces blue lotus and golden fish, where immortals live. There are rocks halfway up the mountain, and dangerous rocks hang in the air, in which a hut can be built.

Xiangshan (Bai Juyi) wrote a poem: "The two boys of Linlu never eat, the three sons of Jianglang dream of returning home. How can I get wings to fly, to come and go with you and get drunk in the misty clouds." This is based on what the Wen Si Bo Yao said: "The three Jiang brothers ascended to heaven and turned into stone." It is probably because these three peaks are too peculiar, so they mystified the story.

### Spring Bathing in Huaqing

— Ke Ren

Early spring in Chang'an; you see that the snow on the Zhongnan and Taibai mountains has not melted, but the green grass has sprouted between the Jing and Wei rivers. After eating enough yellow sand in the three winter months, people naturally think of the story of "the emperor bestows bathing in the Huaqing Pool in the spring cold."

Huaqing Pool is located outside the south gate of Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, forty miles east of Chang'an. You can get there by train in an hour; it is backed by Lishan Mountain and faces the desert wilderness, with pavilions, small bridges, lotus ponds, and flower gardens. There are several bathrooms built according to the flow of hot springs. The most exquisite and fascinating is the Imperial Concubine Pool.

The Imperial Concubine Pool can be used for bathing by four people together, with vermilion railings and jade steps, and inlaid with milky glass windows. There are white lotus flowers in the pool. In the shimmering light, your thoughts drift farther and farther; who says that the white smoke and smooth spring water have not left the imperial concubine's remaining fat?

On the mountain road, the Zhongshan Forest is lined with dwarf pine trees, and the area is quite secluded. There are small temples such as the Sanyuan Cave, Dimu Temple, and Laojun Hall scattered nearby. The Zhongzheng Forest has not been built for long, and the planted saplings are pitifully thin, but the stone path is clean and easy for tourists to go up and down. After walking uphill from Zhongzheng Forest for a short time, you will pass the place where the Chairman was captured during the Xi'an Incident. The walls are full of inscriptions, all from the hands of prominent figures in the Party and the country. This protruding peak wall arches over a large blue stone; if you sit on the meditation stone, the mountains behind, to the left, and to the right are all hidden from view, and you can only see the terraced fields and village trees in the distance at the foot of the mountain, and a line of the Wei River meandering eastward.

The mountain lacks strange peaks and original stones; green shade is also rare, with only short pine trees at high places. There is an ancient temple in the mountainside, dark and quiet, with crows cawing on the old pagoda trees next to the hall, giving people a feeling of being outside the world. There are several Taoist priests there. The summit of the mountain is the Zhou Youwang Beacon Tower, open and bare; three thousand years ago, green smoke pillars once rose straight into the sky here, and princes from all directions gathered at the foot of the mountain. The ancient emperor's romantic absurdity ultimately won him a smile from a beauty, but the dynasty came to an end from then on.

### Journey to Sun Moon Lake

— Feng Qian

As the car drove out of Tainan, we gradually left the vast fields, rushing towards the mountains. We passed through many deep mountain tunnels and elevated bridges. Peering out, the car had turned into the white clouds. After a light mist passed, the scenery in the mountains suddenly opened up. The Zhuoshui River was as slender as a ribbon, winding between the mountains and the sky, and what was in front of us was still a dark green mountain range.

After driving in the mountains for three hours, we arrived at Sun Moon Lake, one of the eight scenic spots in Taiwan. The beautiful lake view gave travelers endless joy. And the Hanbi Building, hidden in the lush green, was also close at hand. Hanbi Building is the only hotel on the shore of Sun Moon Lake. It faces the mountain and overlooks the water. All four sides are small glass windows with square lattices. Leaning on the railing and looking out, the lake and mountain scenery shimmering in the forest can be seen by everyone. Of course, we also rested here.

In the early morning, the white misty curtain added a light morning dress to the lake. When the early mist disappeared with time, the lake was like a mirror, clearly reflecting the shadows of the surrounding green mountains. Occasionally, a fishing dugout floated by indifferently, drawing a silver light on the dark green lake mirror. At this time, all sounds disappeared, and it seemed that the entire universe had calmed down.

And the scenery at dusk is even more beautiful. The magnificent sunset dyed the distant mountains a pale purple and a gray-blue. If you are a painter, no matter how hard you try, you can't restrain your interest.

Travelers to Sun Moon Lake are reluctant to give up visiting the "Civilized Aborigine" tribes under Mount Shueshe. We took a small electric boat across the lake and landed in the tribal village on the opposite bank. The twenty-odd thatched huts of the aborigines sparkled milky yellow in the hot sun. When we arrived at the tribal village, thirty or forty aborigines had run over to welcome us. They were wearing Han Chinese clothes and spoke fluent Southern Min dialect. There was no trace of the original aborigines. But when we explained our intention to see the "Civilized Aborigine Pestle Song", a dozen young women immediately rushed home to change their clothes. Time passed, and they came out of their homes one after another, wearing the clothes they had worn since they were children. They wore deep blue, chest-high skirts, with colorful flower belts tightly fastened in front of their abdomens, light blue short jackets on their upper bodies, long-sleeved coats, and pearl circles on their heads, adorned with flowers, full of primitive flavor. Each person held an eight-foot-long wooden pestle in their hand, and the slightly older ones carried two-foot-long bamboo tubes, knocking out "dong, dong..." sounds.

The song and dance began. They constantly struck the stone slabs with wooden pestles, making "peng, peng" sounds, and added the sound of bamboo tubes, playing a unique and rustic melody. In the music, they performed dances similar to those of African natives, singing love songs that made us feel as if we had returned to primitive times.

### Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines

— Hao

The section of mountain road facing north in Longjing Village includes Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines. The so-called Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines are just nine streams and eighteen small streams. There is nothing special about them, but you don't know how rugged the mountain road is. On both sides are towering pointed peaks. On the rugged mountain road, there is a clear spring. Several stones protrude from the surface of the water, causing the flowing water to wrap around it in a rounded water pattern. When the flowing water runs over a natural stone slab, it will ruthlessly strike the stone slab, making a tinkling sound. Occasionally, a small bird flies over, chirping, and intertwining with the sound to form a quiet score like a "serenade". In the mountains, people are intoxicated in the spring scenery.

### Wolf Mountain is a famous scenic spot north of the Yangtze River and south of Nantong. Relying on the river and leaning on the mountain, it is worthy of being a beautiful place with water and mountains.

### The Beauty of West Lake

— Facing the Wall

I say that the beauty of West Lake is suitable for viewing from a distance, not for close-up inspection. Therefore, it is better to sit and watch than to take a deep tour. To appreciate its beauty, it is best to find a suitable place on the lake and sit down, and then leisurely look around. What is in front of you is like a natural painting. Surrounded by mountains and in a lake of blue waves. At this time, the mountains are not disgusted with their low height. Even bare mountains happen to form a faint backdrop. The water is not tired of its small size. If it were as large as Taihu Lake or Dongting Lake, it would not have such rippling beauty. In general, so-called beauty is a degree of gazing illusion. Furthermore, being enchanted by this illusion, one can enjoy a kind of pleasant feeling of beauty. If you examine it carefully, it is difficult to say that anything is beautiful. For example, a dilapidated temple. If you visit it with sincerity, you will surely be greatly disappointed and return. But if its location is just in the mountains and by the water, and there are some plants and trees outside, then if you look at it from a distance, you will see a mix of trees, revealing half-broken tiles and red walls, and a corner of a flying eave. At that time, you will not only not feel its dilapidation, but it will become a wonderful sight. I am not saying that everything in West Lake is broken down and worthless, that you cannot look at it closely, but only look at it vaguely from a distance and indulge in it yourself. Rather, I am saying that the beauty of the scenery is that it is suitable for viewing from a distance, and West Lake is one of them. But this is probably not something that those tourists who flock to crowded places can understand.

Peach blossoms and cherry blossoms have already faded, and "when the rose blooms, the spring is over". Another spring is about to pass. Returning from a lake tour and recording my feelings can be regarded as a small souvenir.

### Dwarf Cave

— W.F.

During the spring break, I went to Hangzhou with a friend. Halfway up Mount Gao Feng on the way north, I suddenly discovered a small cave. There were three characters "Xiangshan Cave" in front of it. The entrance of the cave was very small and low. I bent down and entered. The cave was dark and without light. I groped forward and suddenly felt as if a monster was moving in the dark corner. Everyone was frightened and retreated. Only I was curious and struck a fire to shine on it. I found out that it was a dwarf. I asked him. He replied that his surname was Shen and he was fifty-seven years old. He came from Huizhou to live in the cave and had been there for more than half of his life. I saw that he was only three feet tall and had a burly physique, but his head was as big as a dipper, bald, and his appearance was very kind and amiable. Then he went out of the cave with me. We took a photo together in front of the cave (photo attached) to leave as a souvenir.

I think there are many people who travel to Hangzhou in the spring, but very few people know about this cave and this strange person. Therefore, I specially make this unexpected encounter public to those who love spring outings.

### Spring Outing Song

— Sun Yuehan

Swallows murmur into the painted building, most of the spring scenery wants to return and rest. Even if the oriole calls people to stay, it is inevitable that the hair will easily turn white. My heart is heavy; my hatred is long. It is difficult to write a book that can eliminate poverty and sorrow; it is better to make an appointment with a companion to go out and find fragrance, the sun is bright and the wind is gentle, and to travel on the road. I can see the sights along the side of the Cheng River at will, emeralds and corals are all spring colors, tender willows droop their branches, buds are not yet stretched, and beautiful flowers fall to the ground, the buds are about to come out. By the stream, there is a graceful woman, with a jade appearance, full of charm and speechless; slender hands gently rub and wash the green gauze, and a graceful waist sways across the lotus pond. She turns her head and smiles as if beckoning, black hair scattered in the wind; red clouds fly onto her peach cheeks, and she walks slowly across the painted bridge. Several families worship wandering souls beside the graves, the flowing water sobs and the setting sun is dim! I am also too sentimental to bear it, and I secretly wipe away tears when I return.

### Scenic Spots of Mount Tuan

— Yi Jin

In Zhenjiang, if you mention spring outings, everyone will think of Jinshan, Jiaoshan, Beigushan, or the southern suburbs, because these are the "darlings" of the times and the "favorite guests" of the provincial capital.

"Mount Tuan", this name, perhaps some people will find it unfamiliar! Originally, he was not a well-known "beauty", but an unknown "hero" who had fallen in the countryside. He did not have the petite, graceful, gentle, and shy maiden state, nor had he undergone artificial makeup. The heroic, upright, bold, and unrestrained heroic posture is natural and the innate heroic nature.

In the eastern countryside of Zhenjiang, eight miles east of Dagang Town, the hometown of the martyr Zhao Boxian, is the location of Mount Tuan, forty-four miles from Zhenjiang City.

The towering and towering image of the Pengfeng Pagoda can be seen within a radius of tens of miles around, especially when the sun sets in the west and the sky is full of sunset clouds. The mountains reflect brilliant colors of purple, red, yellow, or green, and the rapid changes are even more spectacular.

From the foot of the mountain to the top, it is about three or four miles. The mountain is steep, and the stone steps wind upwards. The "Great Hero Hall", which originally stood majestically on the top of the mountain, was destroyed by enemy fire in the winter of the 26th year.

"Caves" are the only scenic spot of Mount Tuan. The main thing to do when visiting the mountain is to "visit the caves". According to local legend: "There are a total of seventy-two stone caves of all sizes on the mountain." Although this statement has not been verified, there are indeed twenty or thirty stone caves worth seeing, and these many caves are all naturally formed and rarely artificially decorated. In each cave or to the left and right of the cave, there is a small nunnery for tourists to rest and dine.

The most amazing one is the "Arrow Cave". The cave is pierced in the thick stone wall on the mountainside, forming a circle with a diameter of more than ten feet. From the south of the mountain, you can see through to the north of the mountain. It is truly a different world. It is said that this cave was pierced by Liu Bowen with an arrow in the past, hence the name.

The largest one is the "Immortal Cave", which is the size of three large houses, rectangular in shape, and about thirty feet high. The surrounding stone walls stand upright. When people are in the cave, they look up and see strange rocks towering and hanging in mid-air, making people feel shocked and sigh.

"Peach Immortal Cave" is the most beautiful. A small building is built outside the cave. Inside the cave, there is a clear spring, clear and bright. Peach trees are planted in the surrounding slopes, and the peach blossoms are in full bloom in March of late spring, charming, neat, and brilliant, simply a pink world.

"Guanyin Cave" is the deepest and longest, with a Guanyin Hall, a pavilion, a kitchen, and a bedroom inside.

In addition, there are Bat Cave, White Pigeon Cave, Crab Cave, White Dragon Cave, Lu Xian Cave, Snail Cave, Tobacco Pouch Cave, Purse Cave..., some are deep, some are winding, some are protruding, and some are bizarre..., all of which are enough to make people enjoy visiting and sigh in admiration.

The annual Huangming has arrived, and the men and women of the surrounding villages and towns will go to admire the heroic posture and broaden their horizons again.

### Mochou Lake and Yanzi Rock

— Mustard Spring

Around the Grain Rain Festival, walk out of the Shuixi Gate, away from the noisy city, and see people by the water letting out ducks, and patches of vegetable fields paved with golden flowers. After walking through the villages, buildings and pavilions are hidden among the trees, and the spring water is uneven. We have approached the shore of Mochou Lake.

Walking along the banks of the lake, you come to the Huayan Nunnery. Behind the nunnery is the Shengji Building. It is said that Emperor Taizu of Ming once gambled with Prince Zhongshan Xu Da here. His Majesty lost the bet and gave the lake products to the Xu family, hence the name. The building houses a portrait of a national hero who recovered the territory, and his heroic posture is still imaginable. The couplets on both sides are like pearls and full of beautiful words.

Behind the building is the former site of the Yu Jin Hall, where the statue of Lu Mochou is enshrined. The four characters "Is it or not" are inscribed on the horizontal plaque. The story of Mochou has been circulated among the people and passed down from generation to generation. Mo Chou is one, so there is no need to cling to the zither and examine her origin and history.

In this quiet Yujin Hall, overlooking the railing and facing the stream, reeds are sprouting green and spring water is rising. Swimming fish are connected and their appearances can be counted. To the east is Stone City, with mountains winding around and majestic palaces. Marquis Wu Xiang wrote: "Zhongyu is like a dragon, and Stone City is like a tiger." This is a faithful introduction. Looking around, Qingliang Mountain, Zhongfu Mountain, and Lulong Mountain are connected in front of you, remotely connected to some mountain peaks north of the Yangtze River. The water is a piece of blue, and the mountains are a horizontal stroke of black. Xuanwu Lake has never had this kind of scenery!

When the setting sun hangs on the mountain, walk down the Shengji Building and look back. The Qingliang Gate of Stone City is already dimly lit, and the lights are dim. The new moon rises, and the lake is covered in smoke. The weeping willows flutter in the evening breeze, with another kind of melancholy meaning. I can't help but chant the couplet on the building: "What about peerless heroes? The prime minister only leaves a portrait; indulging in a lake of wind and moon, Mochou is truly a good person to worry"!
— Mustard

In the past few days, tourists from all over the world have flocked to Hangzhou, and the lake is even more like a carnival. However, we, who live in paradise, want to go to other places for a spring outing. It just so happened that we had an opportunity to visit the capital. Nanjing was originally a place for old tours, and most of the scenic spots in the suburbs have already been admired. This time, we have another trip to Yanzi Rock.

Taking a car over Coal Port and turning to Shangyuan Village, there is a different kind of scenery. The narrow and winding stone road is hidden high and low. On the right are stone cliffs that stretch continuously, and on the left, the Yangtze River is like a sash, with fertile fields. Although the car is moving fast, it shows its twists and turns. It looks like "the mountains and rivers are exhausted", but as you go, "the road turns and the peaks change". This mountain path alone is enough to make you praise it.

Parking is quite spacious inside the Santai Cave. The water dripping from the cave has accumulated into a shallow pool, clear and crystal clear, which can cleanse the mind. There is nothing to see in the Ertai Cave. In the Toutai Cave, there are many more myths, such as "Dragon Head and Dragon Mouth" and "Rhinoceros Gazing at the Sun". These are all stories of the cave stones resembling shapes.

Yanzi Rock, like other mountain peaks, climbs up level by level, but there are still strange and steep peaks on top. Standing on it and looking down, the Yangtze River is surging, washing away many heroes. Moreover, this is also a good final destination for general misanthropes. The "Think About It" stele will call on people to "rein in at the edge of the cliff", but who is willing to "drift with the tide"? "Isn't it just forced by the environment".

After walking down the mountain, hire a small boat and row to the river in front of the mountain to admire the true face of "Yanzi". I only feel that it is steep and rugged, and the cliffs are like flying swallows. If it were to be inserted higher into the clouds, it would be even more amazing. Returning to Guanyin Pavilion, after the guidance of the old Taoist, I saw an iron chain hanging down from the mountainside, only a foot long. He said that it was used in the Ming Dynasty to lock the Yangtze River and tie up boats. Regardless of the truth, the river water at that time undoubtedly reached halfway up the mountain. The sea has changed and the mulberry fields have changed several times. Sit down and chat with an old white-haired woman who is ninety-one years old about the mountain life. At such a great age, she can still grind ink with one hand and talk and laugh freely. Asking her about the price of food, she is completely unaware, and she casually answers with a few tens of coppers per liter. It really feels like "I don't know there is Han".

Returning, speeding through the verdant winding path is a wonderful living environment.

### Recommendation of "A Brief Discussion on Agricultural Finance"

— Xu Weinan

Wang Shiying is one of the pioneers of China's cooperative movement. For twenty years, he has been wholeheartedly devoted to the promotion of the cooperative movement, especially the agricultural finance sector, in which he has taken a special interest and paid special attention. During the Anti-Japanese War, he taught agricultural finance in various universities. In 1939, when he was in Chongqing, he compiled a "Outline of Agricultural Finance", which was printed in 300 copies for the reference of students at the Cooperative College of the Central Political School. In 1941, he compiled a "Brief Discussion on Agricultural Finance", which was divided into six chapters. The style took theory as the warp and examples from various countries as the weft. It described all aspects of agricultural credit in detail. The first edition was limited and had long been sold out. Recently, it was reprinted by the "China Book and Stationery Production Cooperative", with three articles appended, such as "The Mission of Agricultural Finance", which are powerful works that elaborate on agricultural finance.

The author believes that "China's economic construction must attach equal importance to industry and agriculture, and the establishment of an agricultural financial system is particularly crucial among the new facilities for agricultural construction", and that "the promotion of cooperative undertakings also relies heavily on agricultural finance".

He also believes that "the agricultural finance problem is by no means simply a problem of relief for farmers' lives, nor is it a problem caused by agriculture being on the verge of bankruptcy. The agricultural finance problem is a constant problem for a country in a normal situation".

This view is naturally extremely correct. This is theory, but it is also fact. He is now the director of the Cooperative Affairs Bureau. When he recently came to Shanghai, he mentioned that he is now implementing the theory; he is working hard on rural financial facilities; however, he also sighed that he is afraid that he will not be able to see the seeds blossom and bear fruit. From his words, it can be seen how enthusiastic he is about cooperativism, and how deep his intention is to focus his attention on the countryside and improve rural life.

My purpose in recommending this "Brief Discussion on Agricultural Finance" is not just to encourage everyone to read this book. I hope that those who read this book can also be like the author, broaden their horizons and truly pay attention to the tasks we should shoulder.
