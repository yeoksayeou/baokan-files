### National Occupational Women's Election Office; Explains Meaning of "Preliminary Announcement"

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the question of whether those listed in the candidate lists of the nationwide occupational women's organizations' election office's announcements on the 6th and 9th with the notation "Not yet fully reviewed, preliminary announcement" are confirmed as "qualified," a spokesperson for the office stated that the legally mandated "review" period after the candidate registration deadline is only five days. Given the current traffic and postal difficulties, the issuance and verification of signature documents are impractical within this short period. "Therefore, most lower-level election offices, in order to meet the announcement deadline, telegraphed names in advance, stating that signature documents would be mailed separately. These signature documents could not all be received by the office before the announcement period. The eighth election committee meeting of this office resolved that: Telegrams with a notation for verification would be announced; those without a notation would be preliminarily announced. Individual telegrams received before the final announcement period would be permitted for preliminary announcement." The "Not yet fully reviewed, preliminary announcement" notations on the two announcements of this office were made based on the above facts and in accordance with the resolution. As for whether candidates who have been preliminarily announced have obtained "qualified" status, the seventh committee meeting of this office resolved: "Those whose verification is inconsistent before the election will be canceled; those whose verification is inconsistent after the election will be declared invalid." According to the above, those who are still listed as preliminarily announced in the final supplementary announcement on the 15th of this month do not need to undergo further review and announcement procedures to be considered qualified candidates. This principle is very clear. However, this office will continue to actively verify at any time before the final announcement. All those who have been preliminarily announced, such as Ye Lufu and 21 others listed in Item A of the 9th announcement, are handled in this way. It is expected that by the date of the 15th final announcement, the list of those changed from preliminary announcement to announcement will certainly be even greater. However, it is possible that a portion will not be changed to announcement, but this will not affect their eligibility. Furthermore, the list of candidates for National Assembly delegates from national occupational and women's organizations nominated by the Chinese Kuomintang has been forwarded by the general election office to the national occupational and women's election office. After registration and review by the office, the 250 people, including Tang Chengzong, have passed and are now publicly announced in Nanjing.

### Revised Distribution of National Assembly Delegate Quotas for Border Regions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The National Government issued an order on the 13th: Herewith the revised distribution of National Assembly delegate quotas for representatives of various ethnic groups elected in border regions is promulgated. Yunnan: 4 people (including one female representative), Guizhou: 3 people, Xikang: 4 people, Sichuan: 2 people, Guangxi: 2 people, Hunan: 2 people. Other border regions: 17 people (elected by Manchu citizens, including one female representative).

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 12th] Regarding the quotas for Legislative Yuan members and National Assembly delegates from national industrial and mining sectors, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, and Chongqing municipalities should be allocated one Legislative Yuan member and three National Assembly delegates. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that Yunnan Province is one of the four major national defense industrial zones, so the one Legislative Yuan member from the western industrial and mining sector is designated to be elected by Yunnan, while the three National Assembly delegates will be elected by Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Chongqing.

### Amendment to Article 4 of the National Assembly Delegate Election and Recall Law

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The National Government issued an order on the 13th: Herewith the amended language of Article 4 of the National Assembly Delegate Election and Recall Law is promulgated. Article 4: The quotas for National Assembly delegates are as follows:

### Gu Weijun Discusses United Nations Issues; Criticizes Uncooperative Attitude; Hopes to Rescue Crisis with Moderation

[Central News Agency, New York, 11th] Ambassador Gu Weijun indirectly criticized the Soviet Union for adopting an uncooperative attitude in the United Nations General Assembly, causing the world to become two different and seemingly irreconcilable camps, at a banquet held by the Foreign Press Association here on the 11th, which was met with thunderous applause. Gu stated: The reason why the United Nations' efforts to seek peace have become difficult is that there are almost two worlds in everything that is most important to the future of mankind. He described these two separate worlds as follows: In the economic sphere, capitalism and communism look at each other with suspicion, each claiming that the other has no place to exist. One side of democracy is based on one-party dictatorship, where the opposition party has no right to vote, while the other side recognizes the people's freedom of election and often accepts the victory of the opposition party with a good attitude. One side of cooperation expresses at least a willingness to compromise with the other side, while the other side expects the other to completely obey its will, otherwise it will not cooperate. One side of peace hopes to make the world peaceful, restored, and prosperous by providing relief and assistance to post-war reconstruction, while the other side still holds suspicion and is indifferent to the delay and uncertainty in solving global problems. As to whether the above-mentioned differences will become a prelude to another world war, Gu quoted sophists as saying: "Those who want to instigate chaos cannot succeed, and those who can succeed do not want to do it." He also said that so far no one has put forward a compromise solution that can reconcile these two different concepts and be acceptable to people, so he advocated adopting a moderate approach to deal with future problems of the United Nations, that is, think from the worst, but do not abandon hope and efforts for the best result.

### United States Seeking Practical Ways to Help Improve China's Currency Difficulties; Marshall Continues to Explain Aid to China Stance

[News Report] New York, 12th Broadcasting: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall attended the House Foreign Affairs Committee and continued to explain the issue of foreign aid. He said: The State Department sincerely hopes to help China, and said that China's situation is different from that of Europe. The United States government hopes that this aid will be effective. Marshall continued: Europe needs emergency assistance to prevent the import of important goods from being interrupted, otherwise famine and industrial bankruptcy will occur. However, the problem in China is different. China's imports are not immediately threatened with interruption, and China has resources. He said that the problem of inflation is a difficulty for China and must be helped to improve it, and the Chinese government should also take some steps to prevent inflation. We are seeking practical ways to ensure that at least 70% of the aid we give to China is effective. I am proposing the issue of foreign aid to Congress based on this position.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall declared in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: In addition to the 2.597 billion US dollars for aid to Europe and occupation forces, he will ask Congress to allocate 60 million US dollars before July 1 next year to aid Europe and occupation forces. In addition to the 2.597 billion US dollars for aid to Europe and occupation forces, he will ask Congress to allocate 60 million US dollars before July 1 next year to aid China. Undersecretary of State Lovett said: If aid to China continues after June 30 next year, approximately 20 million US dollars will be needed each month. Official estimates that long-term aid to China by July 1, 1949, is more valuable to our goals than the ten dollars spent in Europe. 60 million US dollars is only a preliminary need, and the total number of needs is still unclear, but what China needs is food and goods, not money.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] The Wedemeyer Report may be secretly opened soon. This has been hinted at by Senator Taft, who announced that he opposed Marshall's request to use 60 million US dollars as the first batch of loans in the 300 million US dollar aid to China plan. Taft secretly told the press: "The Republican Party will certainly propose to publish the Wedemeyer Report." Taft made this statement after being questioned continuously for a long time about the Republican Party's future policy. Taft's statement was made only one day after his speech in New York stating that aid to China and Europe should be considered together.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Official sources stated today that if the United States only provides China with 300 million US dollars before July 1, 1949, unless accompanied by other grants, it will not satisfy China's hopes and needs. Although the highest authorities remained silent on US Secretary of State Marshall's statement in Congress, general public opinion believes that this limited aid to China plan will not solve China's serious situation unless it is supplemented.

Editorial

### Coup in Siam

Since the coup in Siam on the 9th, the situation has not yet become entirely clear, and the governments of various countries are still largely maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. According to reports, the recent coup in Siam was initiated by Pibul, the former Prime Minister of "Thailand" who had collaborated with Japan. There were no reports of bloodshed in the Bangkok area. By the 10th, a new government was established, with Aphaiwong serving as Prime Minister, while Pibul retreated behind the scenes. The government announced the abolition of the Regency Council, the revision of the new constitution, and the assumption of state affairs by the soon-to-be-of-age monarch, currently in Switzerland, with the assistance of a Privy Council composed of five members. This newly established Privy Council immediately amended the constitution, restoring some previously abolished powers to the King of Siam, and reinstated the bicameral parliamentary system. The King of Siam in Geneva has also prepared to accept the fait accompli. At this point, the situation since the coup in Siam seemed to be gradually stabilizing. However, according to a Reuters report from Bangkok on the 11th, the highest deputy commander of the new Siamese regime, General Phin Choonhavan, stated that the Siamese regular army has engaged in war with the "Siamese People's Resistance Army," and the authorities have ordered defense forces across the country to prepare to mobilize within 24 hours. The coup in Siam is feared to be unavoidable bloodshed. The fact that the situation in Siam has not yet become entirely clear lies here. We have synthesized reports from various sources and believe that the following points regarding the situation in Siam are worth noting:

First, the coup in Siam does not appear to be a sudden event; it has historical roots. Needless to say, examining the reasons why Pibul has regained power, it is not difficult to see the cause in the unfortunate assassination of the Siamese King's palace in mid-May of last year. In April of last year, King Ananda Mahidol of Siam signed an order promulgating a new constitution, characterized by a bicameral parliamentary system and the publicization of political party activities. However, within a month, the king was assassinated, and the truth remains unclear to this day. The first task of the result of the coup, was to amend this constitution, restore the bicameral parliamentary system, and appoint members of the upper house. The coup seems to be inevitably related to the assassination of the king last year.

Second, Pibul is the leader of this coup, but he does not take credit for it and is content to stay behind the scenes. His methods appear to be quite clever on the surface, but they still cannot deceive the people of the world. Pibul is known as the "Siamese Mussolini." He is a figure who participated in the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" called for by the Japanese militarists. While his prestige in Siam allows him to influence Siamese politics, his position under the rule of the Japanese militarists in the past makes it impossible for him to come to the forefront again in reality. Therefore, although the coup was promoted by Pibul, the figures who came forward were members of the Democratic Party such as Aphaiwong. Like the situation in England and France, the coup in Siam somewhat resembles the result of the English and French municipal elections, which is the resurgence of right-wing forces. However, the color is more intense and resembles fascism in Siam. Under this situation, even if there is resistance within Siam, bloodshed is unavoidable, but the general trend suggests that resistance will be ineffective. In any case, the coup cannot be said to be a move against the democratic trend.

Third, according to official announcements, the coup in Siam was intended to end the corrupt internal affairs of Siam, improve the people's livelihood, and cleanse officialdom. However, according to reports, we can easily see that the coup in Siam is less about internal affairs and more about external affairs. This can be seen in two aspects. First, the border disputes between Siam and Vietnam have not yet been resolved. In the past, with the assistance of the Japanese, Siam signed a treaty with Vichy France to cede part of Vietnam to Siam. After the end of the war, this treaty was torn up by France; however, Siam has never forgotten its desire for land in the eastern Cambodia area. Pibul was the commander of the army fighting on the border at the time. The success of the coup he led can be said to be a threat to Vietnam. After the success of the coup, the authorities seemed to be reconsidering the demand for the demarcation of the Siamese-Vietnamese border to cover up the failure to improve the domestic situation. Second, the coup in Siam seems to be flirting with Washington, perhaps another speculation by Pibul on the political stage. The coup led by Pibul this time received the support of the Democratic Party; and many of the members of the Democratic Party are pro-American. Prime Minister Aphaiwong has been to the United States as Siam's representative to the United Nations. In addition, Pramoj, the former ambassador to the United States who chanted "Free Thailand," is also a key figure in the Siamese Democratic Party. He also maintained contact with the US Office of Strategic Services during the war. It can be seen that the coup in Siam inevitably has a posture of throwing itself into the arms of the United States.

From the perspective of our China, the coup in Siam will be a sign of the resurgence of the "Greater Thai Nationalism" slogan. From the perspective of the Three Principles of the People, we are happy to see the rise of Siamese nationalism, but the "Greater Thai Nationalism" symbolized by Pibul inevitably had discriminatory treatment of our overseas Chinese in Siam in the past. Even after Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, there was still a large-scale anti-Chinese movement, carrying out massacres and plunder against our compatriots. On the other hand, it imitated Hitler's style of "recovering lost territory," and often had delusional thoughts of coveting and wooing the Yi people residing in our southwestern border areas, especially the "Bai Yi" in Yunnan. Therefore, the success of the coup led by Pibul this time may be the resurgence of the "Greater Thai" movement. We want to see the rise of the Siamese nation, but we do not want to see the resurgence of anti-Chinese and anti-China movements. In particular, we cannot forget Pibul's past assistance to Japan in fighting the United Nations. If Pibul wants to reform himself, he should first change his old policies, so that Sino-Siamese relations will not have a negative impact.

### Head of Military Law Office Talks About the Case of Arresting Communist Bandits in Beiping

"Direct Arrest" is Legally Justified

[Central News Agency, Beiping, December 12] The case of communist espionage cracked in this city a month ago is complex. Because the clues of this case continue to be cracked in various places, the handling of this important case has attracted attention from all parties. The reporter specially visited Yin, the head of the military law office of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters, to inquire about the handling of this case. According to the conversation: The content of this case has not yet reached the stage of publication and will be announced by the central government in a unified manner in the future. However, what can be told is that the arrested criminals are all guilty and have confessed without hesitation. Meng Xian Gong's letter to President Hu admitted "doing illegal things and being extremely ashamed," which shows a glimpse of their current mentality. Regarding the issue of investigation and trial, according to the organizational regulations of the headquarters promulgated by the national government, it has the power to investigate and try governance cases. This case has a significant relationship with public security, and the case involves a wide range of issues and is still under investigation. This is the duty of the headquarters and the responsibility of the headquarters. As for the communist criminals without military status, the investigation stage falls under the jurisdiction of the headquarters. As for the issue of who will have the power of trial in the future, it has been reported to the central government for interpretation, and it can be decided after the central government approves it. However, both judicial and military laws are based on legal proceedings. Some people in the society believe that military trials are more serious and judicial proceedings are more relaxed, which is a misconception. The case is serious, there are many accomplices, and they are all caught in the act. In order to avoid the destruction of evidence and the escape of accomplices, "direct arrest" must be carried out. This should be done in fact, and there is a legal basis for it. Some newspapers have criticized the arrest reported in this case as "illegal arrest" and said that the headquarters has not promptly transferred the case to the court as "delay." The arguments seem to be misunderstood. In short, the case is of great importance, and the investigation and interrogation should be carried out with an extremely cautious attitude and under the principles of reasonableness and legality.

### Regarding the Yu Zisan Case, Three Criminals Were Publicly Prosecuted for Secretly Forming a Society to Help the Communist Party

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, December 12] Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Li Bojin, who are related to the Yu Zisan case at Zhejiang University, have been investigated and concluded by Li Zaipeng, prosecutor of the Zhejiang Higher Court, and formally prosecuted on the 12th. The criminal facts, evidence, and legal provisions listed in the indictment are recorded below:

Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, Li Bojin, etc., formed the New Trend Society in Meitan, Guizhou in the spring of the third year of the Republic of China, and were instructed by the Communist Party to expand its scope. The society members were distributed in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Taipei, Fenghua, Pinghu, and other places. Chen Jianxin served as the president, Huang Shimin served as the head of the accounting department, and Li Bojin served as the head of the academic department, actively promoting the society's affairs. The

Main tasks

There are three types: open up a diligent farming farm as the economic foundation of the society's business. Organize an election campaign organization, planned by Yu Zisan (deceased), the head of the society in Hangzhou, to strive for representative seats in the student self-government associations of various departments and grades at Zhejiang University, secretly participate in the National Student Federation led by the CCP, and attempt to manipulate student unrest. Establish reading clubs, presided over by Li Bojin, head of the society's academic department, collect various left-leaning newspapers and books, instill communist theory, secretly recruit members, and instigate communist peripheral work. The defendants Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin came to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 25th of last month, carrying a large number of secret documents, and summoned Yu Zisan and Li Bojin to the Datong Hotel for a secret meeting late at night. The security authorities tracked and eavesdropped based on secret reports from Beijing and Shanghai, and arrested them on the spot and searched the documents. Except for Yu Zisan, who committed suicide while in custody at the Security Command, all others were sent to the court for investigation.

Evidence and Legal Provisions: It has been found that the defendants Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Li Bojin all held important positions in the New Trend Society. The society was not registered with the government, but its affairs were actively promoted, and the funds used

Very large amount

All of them are admitted by the defendants and there are receipts and expenditure accounts seized on the spot that can be checked. The society also organized a secret organization within Zhejiang University, striving for representatives of student self-government associations in order to participate in the National Student Federation led by the CCP, and there are also statements made by Yu Zisan in the original transcribed record of the conversation, such as "Someone ordered me to do this, who I can't say now," etc., which is sufficient to prove this. As for the establishment of reading clubs to instill communist ideology, this is very clear from the learning outline drafted by the defendant Li Bojin. Moreover, the reading list includes more than 50 kinds of left-wing theoretical books such as the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Dialectical Materialism, Preliminary Theory of Ideological Methodology, Mao Zedong's Seventh Congress Documents, the "Four Big Families," and Red Star Over China, etc. They were read separately, and reports were limited, and there are also handwritten records by Li Bojin to prove this, which is even more convincing that it is a secret education method in coordination with the Communist Party. It has also been found that the society's various activities have accepted the practices of the Communist Party, and in fact have been integrated with the Communist Party

Integrated as one

And is responsible for liaison, and Yu Zisan also clearly stated in the original transcribed record of the conversation that there is no difference. This kind of statement by a criminal can be adopted as evidence of a crime. The Communist Party intends to seize the country and subvert the government, and its crimes are obvious. The government has already ordered to suppress the rebellion. The defendants Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, Li Bojin, etc. have carried out the important tasks of the New Trend Society, and the tasks of the New Trend Society are to help the Communist Party promote planning and strengthen training, as has been proved above. Then the defendants have violated Article 30, Paragraph 1, and more than 100 Article 1 of the Criminal Law. The defendants are all young students who have gone astray because their will is not firm. Although their situation is pitiful, since they have violated the Criminal Law, they should be prosecuted according to the law. Except for the defendant Yu Zisan, who died before the court accepted the case, he should be exempted from discussion. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with the provisions of Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### The Unique Cotton Production in Shaanxi Province (Part 2) - Special Correspondent Hu Chang of Our Newspaper's Xi'an Airmail

The Shanghai Cotton Spinning Adjustment Committee recently decided to implement a joint cotton price negotiation in six districts, including Xi'an, as part of a joint voucher distribution method with the Unified Cotton Yarn. The negotiation method in the north will temporarily use a price equivalent to seven shi dan of medium wheat for one shi dan of 7/8 fine short-staple white cotton as the standard. Currently, grain prices and cotton prices are moving in opposite directions in this area. Ordinary raw cotton costs about 2 million yuan per dan, while wheat has been quoted at 600,000 yuan per dan in recent days. This ratio is clearly unbalanced, and the raw cotton costing 2 million yuan per dan, plus transportation costs to Shanghai, cannot compete with the Shanghai market price. If the price is negotiated according to the standard of seven dan of wheat, the negotiation will inevitably fail, only disrupting the cotton market and not helping the situation. When Mr. Wu Weijing came here, the local Central Bank convened two meetings with various relevant parties. The unanimous conclusion was that under the current circumstances, cotton price negotiation in Xi'an was temporarily unnecessary.

The cotton industry in Xi'an believes that Shaanxi cotton faces two major difficulties: a shortage of cash and transportation obstructions. If these two difficulties are not overcome, the prospects and prices of Shaanxi cotton will not improve. The Central Bank's cash is often transported by plane, each time carrying 10-20 billion yuan. As soon as it arrives, it is snatched up by various banks, leading to a premium on checks, which at its peak reached 10%. The more serious transportation problem is that before the obstruction, Shaanxi cotton could still be exported in large quantities. Now, this is no longer possible. Currently, everyone is using one of three routes: The first route is from Xi'an via Shiji to Chongqing, then down the Yangtze River to Shanghai. This route is currently passable, but not economical. It takes about 40 days, and the transportation cost of each ton of raw cotton is about 11 million yuan. The second route is from Xi'an via Ankang to Laohekou, then by boat downstream. This takes about a month, and the transportation cost is about 7 million yuan per ton. This route is relatively short and reasonably ideal. The final route is along the Xi-Jing Highway (Xi'an to Jingmen) to Hankou downstream. This route takes about half the time and transportation cost of the second route, but the area around Shangxian and Luonan is insecure and uncertain. Finally, it is necessary to mention the air transport route. An aircraft can only transport 5.5 tons of cotton, and the cost of transporting each ton of raw cotton to Shanghai is 24 million yuan. Even if we ignore the uneconomical nature, what use is such a small amount of transportation?

Currently, due to transportation obstructions, high-quality Shaanxi cotton, piled high like mountains, has been reduced to a low price of 2 million yuan, and sales are still sluggish, which inevitably affects the interest of Shaanxi cotton farmers in planting cotton. On the other hand, Shanghai yarn factories spend high transportation costs and overcome many difficulties to transport the cotton to Shanghai, but they still cannot make a profit. As a result, they all have to shy away from Shaanxi cotton. This phenomenon is extremely contradictory.

On the evening of the 4th, business leaders in Xi'an held a grand banquet to welcome Mr. Wu Weijing. Mr. Wu was invited to report on the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Joint Distribution and the Cotton Spinning Adjustment Committee's motives for implementing cotton price negotiations. He then listened to the opinions of the Xi'an business community. Mr. Di Chenqingyu of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Finance, standing from the perspective of the local government, hoped that the current cotton price negotiations would not be so high that yarn factories could not continue production, nor so low that cotton farmers would no longer plant cotton. Mr. Li Guozhen, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute, looking forward to the future cultivation of Shaanxi cotton, called for attention to three major issues: water conservancy, fertilizer, and pest control. There was also a unanimous and pressing demand to solve the two major obstacles of cash and transportation. In order to preserve and promote this rich and pure cotton production, to encourage cotton farmers to increase production next year, and to solve the raw material problems of yarn factories nationwide, these urgent suggestions are worth asking the relevant central authorities to jointly seek a reasonable solution. (Xi'an, evening of the 4th)

### Condemning the Franco Regime - The United Nations Reopens the Issue - China, the United States, and Other Countries Oppose Economic Sanctions

[United Press, Lake Success, November 11] Chinese representative Jiang Tingbi declared in the UN Political Committee today: Spain is undoubtedly a totalitarian regime, and China has no diplomatic relations with Spain. Military sanctions are certainly inappropriate, as they lack a legal basis. Regarding economic sanctions, it is also quite questionable whether we can find their legal basis in the Charter. Economic sanctions will cause suffering to the people, and may also create poverty in the countries implementing the sanctions. Jiang warned that Franco might use economic sanctions to strengthen domestic hopes. The Franco regime remained unchanged throughout last year, so this year's General Assembly does not need to move forward or backward. Someone proposed reaffirming

[United Press, Lake Success, November 11] US representative Fahy today opposed the Soviet bloc's proposal to overthrow the Franco regime in Spain through economic sanctions in the UN Political Committee. It is said that the United States opposes any action to initiate reform through violence. The Spanish people will take steps to restore their international status at the appropriate time and in their own way. Polish representative Lange, who attacked Franco in the Security Council last April, again asked the Committee and the General Assembly to invoke the provisions of the UN Charter to completely or partially sever economic ties with Spain. It is said that the General Assembly passed a resolution on December 12 last year, calling on member states to recall their envoys to Spain. At the same time, if a democratic government in Spain is not established within an appropriate period, the Security Council should consider appropriate steps. The situation has not improved since then. Soviet representative Gromyko supported Lange, saying that the United Kingdom and the United States did not recall their envoys, and their relations with Spain were becoming more cordial, and trade between those countries had increased. Czech representative also supported Lange, while the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Canada, Pakistan, Peru, and Chile opposed.

### Marshall's Preliminary Foreign Aid Estimate Considered Too High by Taft - Also Dissatisfied with the Harriman Report

[Reuters, Washington, December 12] Marshall told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 11th that transitional assistance would be managed by the existing agencies of the State Department, while long-term assistance would require a different type of management organization, and this matter should be decided by Congress.

[United Press, Washington, November 11] Secretary of State Marshall told Congress on the 11th that the United States would need $2.657 billion in foreign aid for this fiscal year. Republican leader Senator Taft immediately declared that he "flatly opposed allowing so much." Taft refused to say what figure he advocated, but said he would review the plan. He also refused to comment on Marshall's statement that the administration needed $7.5 billion for the fifteen-month plan starting April 1 next year, including $1.5 billion in the request submitted today. According to Taft, he believes that the $575 million in emergency aid recommended by the Harriman Committee is "too high and quite dangerous."

He believes that his movement can seize power without civil war. He said, "I do not believe that French public opinion desires civil war or armed destruction, but if a war occurs, the legal system must maintain its strength." He also suggested concluding a legal agreement to resist the communist threat and reorganize Western Europe. De Gaulle also said that France's main goal is to prevent Germany from becoming a centralized state again. Finally, he said that he has always disapproved of Franco's Spain, but this does not prevent us from maintaining relations with Spain, especially economic relations.

### US and Soviet Union Blame Each Other for Obstructing Atomic Energy Agreement

[United Press, New York, December 12] The Overseas Press Association held its 30th anniversary celebration tonight, as well as the Second Annual United Nations Dinner. Soviet representative Vyshinsky and US representative Austin were both invited to the banquet to deliver speeches. The two men blamed each other for obstructing the establishment of an agreement to control atomic energy. Vyshinsky reiterated his previous statement that the United Nations had no right to interfere in the Korean issue. Vyshinsky expressed his ability regarding the "resolution to ban atomic bombs has not been effective" after one year, and pointed out that "US diplomatic leaders thought that they could break the Soviet Union's atomic bombs." Besides, it seemed that the Soviet Union already had atomic bombs. The Soviet representative announced that the motivation of Soviet foreign policy was peace, and the US policy expressed by Marshall's plan and the Truman Doctrine was "hostility and slander" towards the Soviet Union. Austin refuted Molotov's speech last week declaring that the secret of pressure bombs no longer exists. He refuted the Soviet Union's claim that the United States was obstructing the world atomic agreement, and said that of the fifteen countries participating in the Atomic Energy Commission, all countries except the Soviet Union and Poland had reached a unanimous agreement on basic issues, so the blame for obstruction lies with the Stravinsky Group.

In Japan, the commander of the occupying Eighth Army, Acheson, said in Cincinnati that Japan is a large reserve for future friendly forces. Can it take on the task of carrying the brunt before American heroes are dispatched again, or even have a day when American troops are not dispatched?

[United Press, Paris, November 11] Today is the anniversary of the European Armistice Day. Tens of thousands of communists gathered around the French fallen soldiers' tomb to hold demonstrations. Red flags fluttered, fists were clenched, and slogans demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Ramadier were shouted. There was also a grand commemoration in Beijing, with Regent Charles offering wreaths.

### Unifying the Nile River Basin - Egypt is Determined and Farouk Explains the Policy

[Reuters, Cairo, December 12] The Egyptian Parliament reconvened today. King Farouk attended and delivered a speech, stating that the Egyptian government should continue to strive to unify the Nile River Basin and to realize the demand that British troops completely withdraw from all parts of the region. If the British government finally decides to accept this unanimous demand of the Egyptian people, the two countries can consolidate their relations under the UN Charter based on the principle of equal sovereignty. Otherwise, with the support of the whole country, Egypt will continue to strive to achieve this demand. Referring to the Security Council's debate on the Egyptian issue, Farouk said that the Egyptian delegation had proven that the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was a threat to peace. Egypt must not negotiate a bargain on the unification of Egypt and Sudan. Farouk also referred to Palestine, stating that the Arab countries will never accept any solution that denies the right of the Palestinians to a brief independent national sovereignty. Such methods will inevitably fail and will seriously endanger the security of the Middle East.

### Jews Ordered to Mobilize in Preparation for the Struggle for Independence

The association is scheduled to raise a fund of 500,000 pounds this year for the purpose of maintaining the security of the Jewish people. At the same time, it will put the 650,000 Jews in Palestine in a state of war.

The other 18 defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor to imprisonment for one year, with four of them being sentenced in absentia. According to Romanian law, the death penalty has been abolished, so life imprisonment is the most severe sentence.

### Katayama's Dismissal of the Minister of Agriculture Has Been Ratified by the Japanese Cabinet

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, December 12] On the 11th, during the House of Representatives, Liberal Party member Keita Kitamura asked about the question of whether the Japanese Prime Minister's dismissal of the former Minister of Agriculture violated the constitution. Katayama Chang replied: This was implemented according to the powers stipulated in the constitution, and the procedures stipulated in the constitution that require cabinet ratification have also been completed.

Representatives from the United States, Britain, and China have also expressed the same, but have not provided opinions on how the exchange rate should be stipulated.

### Magnificent Performance at the Majestic Theatre: Commemorating the Father of the Nation's Birthday, Emphasis on Spirit Over Form, Various Leaders in Attendance Offer Words of Encouragement

"This Newspaper Reports" Yesterday was the birthday of the Father of the Nation, a day celebrated throughout the city with flags. All government offices, schools, and banks were closed for the day. At 9:00 AM, various sectors of Shanghai society gathered at the Majestic Theatre to hold a general assembly commemorating the Father of the Nation's birthday. Attendees included representatives from all walks of life and over a thousand citizens. The presidium consisted of Wu Guozhen, Li Shizeng, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Zhang Wei, Zhang Xiaosong, Cao Jun, Xie Renzhao, Wang Xiaolai, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Xianqing, Jin Zhenyu, and others.

As the assembly began, Mayor Wu led the attendees in observing traditional ceremonies. In his address, he stated, "We should silently contemplate the greatness of the Father of the Nation and strive to emulate him. Every action of the Father of the Nation was for the sake of the nation and its people, ultimately leading to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the creation of the Republic of China. All of us citizens should deeply reflect on whether we are being selfish and self-serving, and whether our actions are worthy of the nation and its people. We must be inspired by the Father of the Nation's great spirit and put it into practice." Central Committee member Li Shizeng, in his address, elucidated that the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is to achieve universal harmony. He emphasized that abstract and formalistic commemorations of the Father of the Nation's birthday are meaningless; it is essential to embody his spirit and concretely demonstrate it in our work.

Emulating Revolutionary Spirit

Director Fang of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, in his address, stated: "As we commemorate the Father of the Nation, we should re-examine and reflect upon the revolutionary environment and our own responsibilities. How should we strive in the future? First, we must emulate the Father of the Nation's revolutionary spirit. The Father of the Nation dedicated his life to revolution, experiencing countless failures. However, with each failure, his revolutionary conviction grew stronger. Failure is the mother of success, and he was able to overcome hardships and difficulties, realizing his vision. The Father of the Nation faced peril in London and Guangzhou, remaining steadfast and composed in the face of adversity. This resolute will and indomitable spirit are worthy of our emulation. Not only the Father of the Nation, but also President Chiang, faced similar trials. When Chen Jiongming betrayed the revolution, President Chiang, then in his hometown of Fenghua, upon hearing the news, traveled day and night to face the crisis. This spirit of sharing weal and woe is truly worthy of our emulation."

Practicing Thrift and Frugality

"Second, we must emulate the Father of the Nation's spirit of thrift and frugality. The Father of the Nation dedicated himself to the revolution, enduring hardships and striving for the nation and its people, paying little attention to his own clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. The Father of the Nation was not particular about his clothing, not even owning a complete set of formal robes. Once, when receiving foreign dignitaries, he had to borrow a set from the current President of the Examination Yuan, Dai Jitao. This set of clothes was later carefully wrapped by Madam Sun and returned to Mr. Dai after the Father of the Nation passed away in Beijing. Our President, influenced by the Father of the Nation, also embodies a spirit of frugality similar to that of the Father of the Nation. The President eats very simply and dresses very plainly, a stark contrast to those who are extravagant. In short, as we practice thrift today, we must emulate the Father of the Nation's spirit of frugality and take the President's frugal lifestyle as a model for the daily lives of all citizens."

Intensifying the Suppression of Bandits and Nation-Building

"Third, intensify the suppression of bandits and nation-building. Why must we emulate the Father of the Nation's revolutionary spirit and his spirit of frugality? It is for the sake of suppressing bandits and building the nation. In the case of Nanjing and Shanghai, we seek stability in society. As the saying goes, 'Stability first, construction comes next.' We will not tolerate underground communist agents and their echo chambers disrupting and sabotaging Shanghai. Speaking of nation-building, we must uphold the Father of the Nation's teachings and implement democratic constitutionalism. Now that the general election is approaching, provinces and cities must organize elections for the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan. Shanghai, as a national model and for the sake of international reputation, must pay special attention to this election. Those engaged in campaigning must have the demeanor and ethics of democratic politics. Voters should value character and cherish their right to vote, not belittling themselves or abandoning their rights. We must ensure that the effects of democratic politics are fully realized in Shanghai, making Shanghai's election a model for the entire nation."

Continuing to Fulfill His Legacy

Speaker Pan stated in his address: "Today, the entire nation is focusing its will and gathering its strength to suppress bandits and build the nation. President Chiang has already instructed that bandit suppression is 30% military and 70% political. Without enlightened politics, bandit suppression cannot be completed quickly, and if politics are not clear, then while we are suppressing bandits on one hand, the people are unable to live, and poverty and frustration are creating bandits on the other. Mencius said, 'If the ruler has no moral standards and the subordinates have no laws to follow, then the country is sure to perish.' A country must have moral standards, which is governance through virtue, and laws to follow, which is governance through law. Governing the country within the scope of morality and law ensures that politics are clear. Article 1 of the Constitution states that the Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People, democracy, and civil rights. Today, we use the Three Principles of the People as our moral standard and the Constitution as our law to follow. With moral standards above and laws to follow below, a republic based on the Three Principles of the People can be built. The Father of the Nation dedicated his life to the nation and its people, exhausting himself. His legacy awaits those of us who are still alive to continue and complete." Following this, Commander Xuan, Wang Xiao, Jin Zhenyu, and others delivered their addresses.

### Health Competition Held, Awards Presented

After the speeches, Zhang Wei, Director of the Bureau of Health, reported on the progress of the competition promoting children and youth health. Mayor Wu presented awards to twelve outstanding children. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the assembly concluded at 10:30 AM. A screening of the film "China's Resistance Against Japan" followed as entertainment.

### Transportation Company to Celebrate Second Anniversary of Service

"This Newspaper Reports" The Shanghai Public Bus Transportation Company will celebrate its second anniversary of service on December 10th at the company's original location on Gongping Road and will award safety and service medals.

Since the armistice two years ago, the recovery and progress of various countries have been extremely rapid. French industrial production has recovered to 93% of pre-war levels. The Benelux countries have almost fully recovered. Italy's recovery has reached 60%. The recovery in the British and American occupied zones of western Germany has reached 46%. Although Britain suffered heavy losses during the war, its merchant shipping tonnage has almost recovered by half, its export trade has exceeded pre-war levels, and its industrial production has increased to 115% of pre-war levels. In fact, the recovery plans of various countries are generally no more than the usual methods of increasing production, practicing economy, and controlling prices and finance. There are no surprising secrets or shortcuts. The reason for such rapid success, although there are various reasons, the most important is still the long-term democratic politics. The government can clearly distinguish between right and wrong, strictly reward and punish, and have the determination to implement government orders. The people can recognize their interests, abide by the law, and embrace the spirit of shared prosperity and common survival for the country. I have been away from the country for over a year and am not very familiar with the recent situation in the country. I will contact and discuss with all parties at any time in the future, hoping to make some practical suggestions on the current economic problems.

### Grand Opening of the Commodity Exhibition Hall, Unprecedented Enthusiasm from Visitors

"This Newspaper Reports" The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall held its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday in the Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. No less than thousands of attendees, including heads of various government offices, Chamber of Commerce representatives, and guests from all walks of life, created an unprecedentedly grand scene. Before the meeting even began, the auditorium was already packed. The crowd's mood was extremely enthusiastic. Chairman Xu Jiyin first delivered an opening speech, briefly stating: The exhibition hall was originally created by Nie Yuntai in 1921. After the August 13th Incident, it was occupied by Japanese invaders and completely destroyed. After two years of restoration, it has been successfully rebuilt. I hope that the entire country will unite to promote domestic goods to make up for losses. Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech urging the people of the country to pay attention to industry and commerce, consolidate the foundation of the nation, and hope that Shanghai will take the lead in creating greater stability and prosperity. Wang Xiaolai, who had just returned from the United States at 8:00 PM the night before, also rushed to participate. He expressed admiration for the American spirit of law-abidingness and service and hoped that the people would catch up, never again living in a state of blissful ignorance. Subsequently, Zhang Renyou (on behalf of Wu Kaixian), Qin Runqing, Xia Chang, and Shou Jingying delivered speeches. After the ceremony, they led guests to visit the exhibition hall and presented coupons. At this point, the crowd rushed out of the door, crowding towards the exhibition hall. North Henan Road was congested as a result. The length of the "queue" was truly an unprecedented feat since the victory.

The driver entered and asked, "Where is the corpse?" Zhang was greatly shocked to hear this. After questioning, it was learned that someone had called the hearse to his residence to pick up a corpse. It is reported that Zhang considered this to be very unlucky and negotiated with the Shangtian Funeral Home. He also reported the matter to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation.

### Escaped Slaughter-Bound Ox Injures Four

"This Newspaper Reports" Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, a cattle dealer named Cao Shengxian transported several oxen from the countryside to the Hongkou slaughterhouse for slaughter.

After police officers arrived, they took the ox to the police precinct and sent the injured to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment.

### Rapid Progress in European Recovery Through Unified Effort; Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Tong Jiling Discusses His Observations After Returning from Overseas

During my spare time, I investigated the economic situation in Europe and the United States. Over the years, I have had many observations.

### Wang Xiaolai Returns to Shanghai, Praises American Lawfulness, Newspaper Stands Do Not Require Supervision, Every Citizen is Literate

"This Newspaper Reports" Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, returned to Shanghai yesterday after visiting the United States on the first passenger flight of the China National Aviation Corporation to the United States on the 6th of last month. He spent a total of thirty-five days, traveling through half of America. Last night, reporters paid a special visit to Mr. Wang to ask him to share his observations from the trip. According to him, this trip to the United States was entirely in a private capacity and under no official title. He has traveled to almost all major cities and important industries in the United States, and has been warmly received by overseas Chinese and local business groups everywhere, who led him to visit and explained things in detail, which has greatly increased his knowledge. Although the democratic and rule-of-law spirit of American politics has long been praised, it is difficult to know the truth without experiencing it firsthand. During these thirty days in the United States, I was able to appreciate the truth. Every government order can be implemented, and the people can abide by the law. For example, if a car violates the law, the police come forward to correct it and issue a notice. The driver then goes to the designated police station the next day to receive the penalty according to the notice. Public security has indeed been able to achieve a state where doors are not closed at night and lost items are not picked up. Newspaper stands on the streets of New York City allow pedestrians to take the newspaper themselves and put the amount due in the box. No one manages it, but no one takes a newspaper without paying. Cars rarely honk on the road, which shows the excellence of their traffic order. Even more commendable is the universality and development of American national education, which can be a model for our country. From elementary school to high school, education is compulsory and obligatory. All expenses are borne by the state, and books and stationery are also provided free of charge. If parents do not allow their children to attend school, the parents will be subject to legal punishment. Therefore, every American citizen is literate, and college students are everywhere. The use of machinery has reached its peak. Not only is machinery used in industry, but agriculture is also completely mechanized. A farmer can cultivate hundreds of acres of land with the help of machinery.

Mr. Wang also stated that the prosperity of the United States has reached a state of truth, goodness, and beauty. From the White House to the farmhouses, everything is beautiful. Even the arrangement of a small fruit shop strives for beautification. Bananas and apples are arranged according to color to attract customers.

Mr. Wang praised the humorous broadcasting of American commercial advertisements as "living comedy." The method is very different from the comedians singing in the city's radio stations. When these artists perform comedy, they allow listeners to ask questions freely, and they answer on the spot. The listeners are sure to choose the most sudden and embarrassing questions to ask, and the artists are sure to be able to answer in the most agile and humorous tone. Now, American radio listeners love to listen to this kind of "comedy," so the advertising effect is also very strong.

### Ding Guitang Clarifies Allegations in the Java Returnee Smuggling Case

"This Newspaper Reports" Recent reports that Deputy Chief Tax Officer Ding Guitang went to the wharf to welcome Huang Yuyi of the Zhongnan Bank and was suspected of shielding smuggling have attracted considerable attention. Yesterday, reporters paid a special visit to Deputy Chief Tax Officer Ding to inquire about what happened that day. According to him, Mr. Huang Yuyi is a long-time friend, and he returned from Java on the Zhizhajialian transport. He went to the wharf to welcome him out of friendship, which is only natural. At that time, Mr. Huang was not carrying luggage, and I did not know how much luggage he had. I only told the customs officer on duty to "inspect" and release Mr. Huang's luggage as soon as possible. It was not until 6:00 PM that day that someone from Zhongnan Bank called to inform me that Mr. Huang's luggage had been detained and they did not know why. I immediately called the customs officer to inquire. It was reported that he was carrying a lot of luggage, and some of it seemed suspicious. I told the customs officer in charge to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations, and at the same time, I replied to Zhongnan, informing them of the relevant customs regulations and that I was sorry that I could not help. This is the complete truth of what happened that day from my side. This can be verified by the report of the customs officer on duty at the Jianghai Customs. As for whether there are indeed smuggled goods in the luggage, it remains to be inspected. If there are smuggled goods, the Jianghai Customs will naturally handle them in accordance with the regulations. Not only am I inconvenienced, but I also do not want to inquire or intervene. I have served in the customs for more than thirty years and I am confident that I have been dedicated to public service, abiding by the law, and strictly disciplining myself. I do not engage in business for profit, nor do I engage in fraud for personal gain. To say that I am shielding smuggling is something I have never dreamed of since entering the customs. Although I now live in a residence and have transportation, all of these are publicly owned properties. If I am no longer a customs official, then my living and transportation will become a problem, and I may even feel anxious about my food and clothing. I am molded by the good discipline of the customs and I am honest and upright by nature, abiding by the law and not being biased. Perhaps because of this, I have offended people. In the past ten years, people have anonymously accused and fabricated accusations against me at the higher levels, but the results have all been unfounded. All of these have been recorded in the Ministry. I live my life with a clear conscience and I believe that I can be considered to have fulfilled my duties to the country and the customs. However, in this time of rampant desires and moral decay, one cannot help but sigh, "It is difficult to be an official, and it is even more difficult to be a good official."

### Ancient Burial Figurines with Historical Value: Artifacts from the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty Displayed in the Museum, Different Poses Come Across Vividly

"This Newspaper Special" The Municipal Museum displays relics from the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty called "Yong" (figurines).

The so-called "Yong" can be interpreted as "slaves or servants of the dead." They are magnetic clay figures that resemble toys and are most commonly found in ancient tombs near Luoyang.

Chinese customs believe that the soul does not perish after death, that there is a ghost world and an underworld, and that ghosts, like humans, have needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Therefore, when a person dies, his family prepares for his posthumous enjoyment. Modern folk customs involve burning paper figures and funerary objects to be used by the dead, but during the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty, "Yong" and their objects were made of clay, coated with glazed porcelain, and buried with the deceased in the tomb.

Various Kinds and Shapes

The "Yong" displayed in the museum range from about two feet in height to as small as three or four inches. There are various kinds and shapes, including "Wen Yong" (civilian figurines) holding ; "Wu Yong" (military figurines) riding horses with special shields; "Wu Yong" (dancing figurines) in dancing poses; and "Xiaochou Yong" (clown figurines) in funny poses. Although these ancient relics were excavated after so many years, they still look lifelike except for the peeling of the glaze.

One type is called "Hu Yong" (barbarian figurines), with loose hair, sunken eyes, high noses, and faces that are very similar to those of Westerners. One "Hu Yong" has an aquiline nose, and another "Hu Yong" has a mustache with upturned tips. Several "Hu Yong" have a bulge on the side of their waists, which looks like a modern pistol. It is thought to be a type of weapon at the time. The job of these "Hu Yong" is probably like that of modern bodyguards. There is also a naked "Hu Yong" that looks somewhat like a native of Southeast Asia, with a buttocks that protrude to an "absurd" degree. This is probably an exaggeration of the Tang people's imagination.

Why are there so many "Hu Yong" in the tombs of the Tang Dynasty? According to archaeologists, during the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty, our country was strong, the people were rich, and contact with the Western Regions and Southeast Asia must have been quite frequent. At that time, border officials or wealthy families may have bought some so-called "Hu people" to be servants or slaves. Therefore, after death, "Hu Yong" were made to be buried with them.

The Clothes They Wear Are Very Interesting

In addition to "Hu Yong", there are also "Xiao Kunlun Yong" (little Kunlun figurines) that look like black people, and "Zhuru Yong" (dwarf figurines) that look like Japanese people, all of which are made with great care. One "Xiao Kunlun Yong" has lines close to a Greek statue, showing the artistic achievements of the time.

The clothes worn by the various "Yong" are very interesting. Many male costumes are very similar to modern Western-style coats and swallowtail coats with lapels in the front and an arc in the back. The female "Yong" costumes include revealing breasts and arms and evening dresses identical to those of modern Western women. Several of them are carrying handbags, which are no different from modern glass leather bags. Even more interesting is the hairstyle of the female "Yong", some of which are parted in the middle and high in the front, which can be said to be the ancestor of the "airplane head".

These various funerary "Yong" were only a custom at the time, but they left later generations with excellent materials for studying history and culture. If you observe carefully, you can discover even more interesting facts.

### Former Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang's Speech: Post-War American Trends - Concern for the Movements of Various Countries, Policy Towards China Will Change

"Our Newspaper's Report" Former Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang, who has returned from a tour of the United States, was invited by the Youth Association last night to give a two-hour public lecture entitled "Post-War American Trends." He gave a broad and concise account of transportation, industry, education, economic and social problems, and world policy. The main points of his speech are recorded below:

"Brothers, I studied in the United States twenty years ago. This time, when I revisited the old place, I felt that the United States has made much progress compared to twenty years ago. In terms of transportation, the equipment of trains has been greatly improved, with movable reclining chairs, just like the reclining chairs in airplanes. The speed of trains has increased, and they can travel eighty miles per hour, and you don't feel any vibration when sitting inside. The highways have been converted into cement pavements, and the road surface is wide enough to allow eight cars to drive at the same time. The most advanced is air transportation. The density of its network is almost equal to that of railways. Therefore, in the United States, buying an airplane ticket is as simple as buying a train ticket. The speed of airplanes is also increasing day by day. Now, it takes 32 hours to cross the Pacific Ocean from Seattle to Shanghai without stopping. I visited the Seattle aircraft factory and saw the stratospheric aircraft under construction, which can seat eighty people. If you take that plane from Seattle to Shanghai next year, you can fly there in just one day.

Stepping Up the Manufacturing of Cars and Refrigerators

In terms of industry, there has also been great progress in technology. The first reason is that the top scientists from Germany and Austria were recruited by the United States, and the second reason is that the war stimulated and accelerated industrial research and invention. Now the United States is restoring all military factories to civilian factories, and is stepping up the manufacture of cars, refrigerators, radios, etc. However, because they have not been manufactured for four years due to the war, there is a great feeling of shortage. People generally think that it is easy to buy cars and other items in the United States, but this is not the case. Because there are so many people who need them, you often have to register and wait for several months before you can buy one. The current peak of steel production in the United States is 100 million tons per year, and the annual output of gasoline is 1.4 billion barrels, which is more than the total output of all countries in the world. In terms of education and culture, higher education in the United States is very developed. The University of California has the most students, with 43,000 people. Columbia University has more than 40,000 people. The University of Illinois has 28,000 people. There are more than 3 million students above the junior college level. Compared with only 110,000 college students in our country, it is naturally not the same. American education has not only increased in quantity, but also improved in quality. For example, the invention of the atomic bomb is the result of research by American scientists. Now the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are assisting universities in scientific research. In order to improve the quality of their products, large factories have also established complete laboratories and hired scientists to conduct research.

General Commodity Prices Have Approximately Doubled

In terms of the economy, the living standards of people in various countries have declined after the war, but the United States still maintains its pre-war standards. The price increase is extremely slow. From the Pearl Harbor incident to the surrender of Japan, prices rose by about 30% to 35%. After the war, price controls were lifted, rising to 60% to 70%. To date, general commodity prices are approximately double what they were before the war, while public utilities have not only not increased, but have actually decreased. For example, the subway was five cents twenty years ago, and it is still five cents now. During the war, airmail within the country was one dime, and it cost 75 cents to send it to China. Now it has been reduced to five cents within the country and 25 cents to China. The general income of Americans has also doubled. The total annual income of the people in the United States is 180 billion US dollars. The average annual income per person is 1,300 US dollars, which is the highest income in the world. After the war, 13 million soldiers were demobilized, 9 million people have found jobs, and 1.5 million people have entered universities to study. There are currently only more than 500,000 unemployed people living on government subsidies. As for the entire United States, there are less than 2 million unemployed people nationwide. Given the development of capitalism in the United States, a social revolution should have occurred. In reality, socialism is the least popular in the United States. Among the 140 million people in the United States, there are fewer than 100,000 Communist Party members. The two major labor groups, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, are both opposed to communism. Because American workers are paid very well, a skilled worker earns an average of more than 600 US dollars per month, and an ordinary worker earns more than 200 US dollars per month. Since their lives are stable, their dissatisfaction with the status quo is naturally reduced. Therefore, there is not a single Communist Party member in the U.S. Congress or Senate.

Waste of Resources and Moral Degradation

Social problems: A. Waste of resources. When Paris and London are experiencing coal shortages, every household in the United States burns coal, with temperatures above eighty degrees. This year, the potato harvest in Kansas in the southern United States is very good. Because there are too many potatoes, fearing that the price of potatoes will fall, a large number of potatoes are doused with kerosene and burned, while many countries in Europe are experiencing shortages. B. Moral degradation and increased crime. On average, one in three couples divorces, and the number of juvenile delinquents is increasing. In June of this year, a sixteen-year-old child in Wisconsin killed four of his companions. In July, a seventeen-year-old girl in California conspired with her lover to kill her parents. World policy and Sino-American relations: After World War I, the United States adopted an isolationist policy. After World War II, its policy was completely reversed, and even Vandenberg, who had always advocated the most extreme isolationism, changed his style. He greatly protected the United Nations and was very concerned about the movements of various countries in the world. As far as Sino-American relations are concerned, Sino-American relations have been the best in history, because the United States is vast and rich in resources and has no territorial ambitions, which is the same as China's national spirit. Because the policies of the two countries do not conflict, they have not only been good friends in the past, but they will always be good friends in the future. For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, the United States helped China. After the Pearl Harbor incident, the two countries became allies. After the victory, the United States assisted China in receiving airfields. These are all obvious facts. Later, due to the propaganda of the Communist Party in the United States and the dissatisfaction of American reporters in China due to their difficult lives, the United States' aid to China became lukewarm, which caused a small misunderstanding between Sino-American friendship. However, the general trend of the world and the needs of the United States prompted it to change its policy of standing idly by and move towards a more active role. Recently, the publication of Pulitzer's "Impressions of a Visit to China" and Marshall's upcoming request to Congress for 300 million US dollars in aid to China illustrate that the United States' policy towards China will change. Conversely, we need assistance from others, and we must also eliminate corruption, establish a clean and honest atmosphere, and improve work efficiency. As the saying goes, Heaven helps those who help themselves."

### The "China Youth and Teenagers Democratic Republic Experiment Country" Declares Its Birth and Holds Its First Parliamentary Election

The "China Youth and Teenagers Democratic Republic Experiment Country," a juvenile self-government organization with civic education significance sponsored by the China Youth Association, has been preparing for more than a year and was declared born in Shanghai yesterday. At the same time, the first parliamentary election was held. This republic, which has 913 citizens, is undoubtedly the smallest and most democratic country in the world.

Yesterday's grand and enthusiastic founding meeting of the Republic was held at the Youth Association on Sichuan Road at 2:00 pm. A national flag with a red background, blue triangle, and ten white plum blossoms in the center was hung in front of the rostrum. Hundreds of citizens of the Republic were all filled with joy, waiting for the birth of this smallest country. Many responsible persons of the Youth Association, in the capacity of guests, first expressed their sincere congratulations, hoping that this concrete and miniature national organization could help young people fully understand the true meaning of democracy and be conducive to promoting democratic education. When Lu Meiseng spoke, he criticized the erroneous concept in society that only knows the family and the individual. Therefore, he hoped that the citizens of the youth country should be careful in voting, so that the elected members can do things for the country and society. He also hoped that the young people would promote the practical experience of democratic politics to their relatives and friends, so that people in society would increase their understanding of democratic politics. Lu Ganchen used Premier Sun Yat-sen's "to build a republic and to advance to the world commonwealth" as encouragement. He also pointed out three points that people should pay attention to under democratic politics: have an attitude of respecting the value and personality of others; have a spirit of not being proud of employing people but being ashamed of serving people; and have the qualifications of "cultivating virtue and achieving talent." Tian Gengxin believed that the purpose of the Republic is to cultivate talents, serve the public, develop Christian personality and society, and practice democratic education.

All citizens then sang the national anthem of the Republic in unison, and then immediately held the election speeches of 46 candidates for parliament, each with three minutes. Then, voting began. Each citizen had 20 ballots, which were cast in the ballot boxes of the 20 members they supported. The citizens of the Republic are required to be members of the Youth Association between the ages of twelve and eighteen. Although there are more than 900 people, there are only more than 310 citizens with the right to vote, so the order was well-maintained, and it was completed in about an hour. The 20 elected members will convene the first Congress on a selected date, elect 9 people to form the Central Executive Committee, and elect a president and vice president each, as well as ministers of internal affairs, foreign affairs, finance, justice, industry, education, and social affairs, and convene a National Assembly to pass the constitution. The new government will decide to announce its establishment next year.

### Three Thousand Miles of Northern Jiangsu - The Heartfelt Songs of the People

"Our Newspaper's Huaiyin Report on the 7th" This reporter followed the Huaihai Pacification Zone's pacification work inspection team to inspect various counties in northern Jiangsu. In the extremely short time of 20 days, he traveled through 15 counties and cities including Huai, Huai, Gao, Bao, Xing, Tai, Dong, Yan, Lian, Si, Su, Sui, Hai, Guan, and Lianyungang, traveling more than 3,000 li back and forth. The journey was arduous and dusty. In addition, the old turmoil had not been quelled, and wherever the vehicle went, preparations were made for combat in case of emergency. If the reporter can express the suffering accumulated in the hearts of my millions of compatriots in northern Jiangsu to the readers, then it will be more than fulfilled!

Although in this vast and fertile plain of northern Jiangsu, there is still a large "area" under the control or roaming of the bandit army, and although in the areas they control, they use all kinds of seductive tricks or unscrupulous terrorist policies to seduce and oppress the people into their nets, these despicable and brutal measures cannot stop the people's inclination towards the government, and cannot destroy the people's support for the government.

The people of northern Jiangsu, in the face of the Communist bandits’ struggles, which have surpassed the landlord and petty bourgeois classes and extended to the proletariat, are more and more convinced: the embrace of the government is warm; only by exerting all their strength and striving toward the supreme goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, can they truly protect their nation and themselves. "The lovable people of northern Jiangsu have already taken out all the strength they can muster," as former Jiangsu Sixth District Commissioner Zhang Naipan (currently the Seventh District Commissioner) told this reporter. Here, I can write a few facts to prove it.

The Origin of a Long Gown

Before Yancheng fell into enemy hands, the middle and primary school teachers there, from the time of the recovery until the eve of the withdrawal of the national army, never received a penny of salary or other allowances. They devoted themselves to public service despite their empty stomachs. In the educational circles of Yancheng, which educated for education's sake, this kind of dignified and sacred spirit has been brought into full play. One teacher once said painfully: "Fortunately, the Su Ning Sub-Office issued me a long gown, otherwise I would not have had a long gown to wear to the classroom, and would have lost the appearance of a 'teacher'."

In northern Jiangsu, Yancheng is the most unfortunate city. It can be said that since its recovery, it has been in a state of isolation from the outside world. Therefore, the Taicang fishermen's self-defense force, mainly composed of Yancheng people, organized a commando team for their hometown a few months ago. They entered Xinyang Port from the sea and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's rear. They were about to reach the suburbs of Yancheng, but the military authorities, fearing that they would not be able to coordinate their efforts, advised them to temporarily retreat. This time, strategically speaking, although it did not achieve great results, it has given the bandit army a heavy lesson. The power of the people is infinite!

Ma Yuhong Designed to Bomb the Bandits

Staff Officer Gao Huaiyu of the Sui District told me a dramatic story. Ma Yuhong, of the Xiqiao Township Self-Defense Force in the eleventh district of Huaian County, stayed at the home of his friend Dong on August 18 this year. More than 30 bandits suddenly came at night, carrying more than 20 long and short guns, led by bandit officer Yan Taifa, and rushed into Dong's house to capture Ma Yuhong, and prepared to execute him at any time. In desperation, Ma Yuhong declared to the bandits that there were still two rifles hidden in the house. The bandits entered the house to search. Ma Yuhong took the opportunity to take a grenade and threw it at the bandit group, killing three people on the spot: the bandit district chief, the joint defense director, and the village chief. Ma then escaped over the wall. This is a story woven with blood and tears. After tasting all kinds of vicious methods of the traitorous bandits, the people of northern Jiangsu have long made up their minds that they cannot coexist with the bandits.

Adults Shed Tears for Children

Before northern Jiangsu was fully recovered, Guanyun and Donghai were isolated islands in the northeast corner of northern Jiangsu. At that time, under the heavy encirclement of the bandit army, Guanyun County had formed a situation of food exhaustion. In addition to struggling on the hunger line, everyone had to use blood and flesh to resist the bandit army's attacks. In this environment, you can often see adults shedding tears for children. Why shed tears? Because the adults saw the children's sallow faces and felt that these little lives were suffering the same incomparable torment as the masses in this tragic era, it was really too miserable. Therefore, the reporter, when he was transferred to Guanyun, felt that although the environment was bad a month ago, it was fortunate to have regained freedom after all the tribulations.

### Jiangsu Provincial Security Command Telegraphs Each County to Ensure Public Security

[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Report on the 11th] The Provincial Security Command recently telegraphed each commissioner's office and each county and municipal government, stating that the remaining bandits on the border of southern Jiangsu have not been cleared, and northern Jiangsu is the center of gravity of the military rear bordering Shandong, Anhui, and Henan. The public security of each county urgently needs to be established. All county military police and militia forces should be unified under the command of the county magistrate. When encountering bandits, they should be wiped out immediately, and various tangible and intangible methods should be used to ensure the public security of the county. As for the public security of each district and the joint defense and encirclement matters of each county, each commissioner's office is responsible. From now on, if there are bandits in a county, only the county magistrate will be questioned. If there are bandits in a district, only the commissioner will be questioned. The provincial security team stationed in each county should cooperate with the commissioner and the county magistrate and must not be slack in the slightest.

### Yixing Searches for Bandits - Young Women and Old Women Pretend to Be Asleep, Lift Up the Quilt, and the Hidden Bandits Appear Under the Bed, and a Pistol and Bullets Are Found

"Our Newspaper's Yixing Report on the 9th" Zhang Yongqiang, 21 years old, the deputy district chief of the bandit area in Tangsong District, assisted the bandit district chief Zhou Jinsheng in being extremely active in Xushe, secretly instigating peasants to resist rent and interest, and at the end of last month, he sneaked back to his wife's family in Shexu Village, Xushe, using it as cover. The Xushe District Office received a secret report that Zhang Yongqiang was indeed haunting Shexu Village, so it sent its directly subordinate squadron at dusk on the 5th to surround it. First, the household registration was checked, which matched the registration book. The squadron leader ordered the squadron soldiers to search separately, but there was no movement. In a bedroom, a young woman and an old woman were seen covering themselves with a quilt, pretending to be asleep. They were ordered to get up, but the young woman pretended to be sick and refused to get up. The squadron soldiers lifted up the quilt and saw Zhang Yongqiang hiding under the bed. He was arrested on the spot. A pistol and a lot of bullets were found under the bed, as well as a bundle of ridiculous red and green slogans. The diary also recorded the bandit's "nine killings and six resistances" clauses. The young woman, 17 years old, is Zhang Yongqiang's wife. Zhang Yongqiang and his wife, his wife's brother, and his mother-in-law, a total of five people, were immediately sent to the county, and their accomplices were strictly interrogated in order to continue the search and arrest.

### Autumn Grain Comes to Market - Xue Bandits Organize a Peasants' Self-Defense Army, Attempting to Forcibly Collect Public Grain - Wuxian County Government Secretly Orders Strict Surveillance

"Our Newspaper's Suzhou Telegram on the 12th" The Wuxian County Government received a secret report: Bandit Xue Yonghui ordered a large number of party members to attempt to forcibly collect 40,000 yuan of public grain per mu from farmers in the areas he roams, taking advantage of the autumn grain coming to market. He is also using ignorant farmers to organize an underground peasants' self-defense army. County Magistrate Wang has secretly ordered the bandit suppression troops to monitor nearby. Another report: The Wuxian County Government recently received a secret report: The villages and towns along Taihu Lake, fearing the rampant Xue bandits, do not hesitate to submit to them, and even adopt their own children as adopted sons of the Xue bandits in order to win the bandits' favor. After learning of this, County Magistrate Wang was extremely angry and ordered the police to arrest the township chiefs, intending to punish them for colluding with bandits as a warning to others.

### International Broadcasting Station Strengthens External Propaganda

"Our Newspaper's Chongqing Airmail on the 10th" The International Broadcasting Station (called "Voice of China" by foreign allies) has become the most powerful tool for China's external cultural propaganda after the victory. It currently has a 35KW shortwave broadcasting machine produced by the British Marconi Company and a self-made 10K shortwave broadcasting machine. It broadcasts to the world in Mandarin, Cantonese, English, and Thai from 5:00 pm to 12:00 am every day. In order to strengthen cultural exchanges between the United Kingdom and the United States, the station is negotiating with the British BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), the American CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System), and NBC (National Broadcasting Company) to exchange and rebroadcast special programs with each other.

According to what this newspaper reporter has learned: The American WTAG radio station recently sent a special letter specifying topics related to Chinese politics and economy, inviting the station to broadcast to the audience across the United States. Director Feng Jian arrived in France in August of this year, representing the Chinese government to participate in the World Broadcasting Experts Conference convened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Committee. After the meeting, he passed through England and Norway, and rushed to the Arctic Circle to study the aurora borealis. He has now returned to China and will return to Chongqing from Beijing within days.

It is reported that as soon as the two new 20KW shortwave broadcasting machines (produced by the British Standard Company) newly installed in Nanjing complete the trial run, it is planned to move the capital to facilitate propaganda.

### Shaanxi Cotton for Export - The Contract Is Signed Is Said to Be Inaccurate

"Our Newspaper's Xi'an Telegram on the 11th" A person in charge of the Shaanxi Finance Department said: The main income of various counties in this province is still field tax and various taxes. As for the special tax previously stipulated by the central government, only three or five counties have established departments to collect it due to the limitations of laws and regulations and local conditions, but the benefits are minimal. Lin Shuen, the secretary-general of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, said: Regarding the export of Shaanxi cotton, due to certain reasons, no contract has been signed with Chennault so far. The previous news that a contract had been signed was inaccurate. In the future, the export of Shaanxi cotton will be hoped for on the Tongguan-Luoyang road line that is about to be opened.

### Guisui Highway Construction

"Our Newspaper's Guilin Report on the 9th" The Gui (lin) Sui (sansui) highway, a shortcut to Guizhou, was destroyed during the war and has now been started to be repaired. Once this road is open, it will take three days to travel from Guilin to Guiyang.

### Support for the Yang Dazhan Case - Hunan Sports Circles Strike Evaluation

Before the Yang case is thoroughly investigated and dealt with, they will absolutely not lead or participate in any public sports activities or serve as referees. The Hengyang mayor resigned passively, and the new appointment will be announced within days.

### Lawsuit Filed in Chongming County for Embezzlement of Low-Priced Rice; Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, and Others Indicted

"Special dispatch from Chongming, 10th of this month" The case of Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, Huang Yixiao, and others from this county, who allegedly abused their positions to embezzle 6,600 bags of low-priced rice for personal gain, has caused a great stir throughout the county, with public resentment boiling over. The details of the case are as follows:

Due to recent banditry, many good citizens from neighboring Qidong, Haimen, and other counties have fled to Chongming, numbering in the tens of thousands. This small island, which could barely sustain itself, has suddenly seen such a large increase in population, making the food supply a serious problem. During the lean months of March and April this spring, grain prices soared, with multiple price increases daily. Ordinary people were unable to survive and were on the verge of starvation. The former County Magistrate Guo, witnessing this situation and fearing a major disaster, urgently convened a meeting to regulate food supplies in order to find a solution. It was decided that the county government would negotiate with grain merchants from within and outside the county who had recently won bids for 24,000 bags of provincial tax rice in the county, to obtain 6,600 bags. The County General Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Industry Association, and the Fishery Association were then instructed to distribute the rice at a low price in different districts, according to the original bid price of 50,000 yuan per bag, plus a reasonable profit margin for retailers. This benevolent policy was met with jubilation by the people. However, more than a month passed without any sign of the rice being distributed at a low price. Initially, it was thought that the handover between the old and new county magistrates had caused delays. Finally, boatmen transporting the rice secretly revealed that the rice had been embezzled by Wu Qiuping, director of the County General Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Qixiang, director of the Grain Industry Association, Wang Yixiao, director of the Fishery Association, and others, who colluded to transport it secretly to Shanghai for sale, reaping profits of hundreds of millions. When this news spread, public anger erupted. Town and village representatives Chen Yonghui and Cai Shaolun from Chengqiao Town, believing that the county government had worked hard to manage the low-price distribution and stabilize the local area, while Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, and others were only concerned with personal gain, ignoring the plight of starving people, repeatedly petitioned the relevant authorities for a thorough investigation. However, because these individuals were local dignitaries who used any means necessary to curry favor everywhere, their appeals were ignored. Undeterred, Chen Yonghui and others, disregarding everything, reported Wu Qiuping, Zhou Qixiang, Huang Yixiao, and more than ten others to the District Prosecutor's Office in late July, accusing them of abusing their power, engaging in fraudulent practices, and embezzling funds. After months of investigation, the case has been brought to public prosecution and was publicly heard on the 5th of this month. A massive crowd of people attended. The court opened at 2:00 PM, and the judge questioned the defendants repeatedly. The defendants attempted to quibble, but when asked where, when, and at what price the rice had been sold, they were speechless. At this point, the judge believed that the facts of the case were clear. However, because several other defendants had not been summoned to court, the court adjourned the hearing until a later date.

### Political Departments to Be Established in Each District Commissioner's Office in Guangxi

"Special dispatch from Guilin, 9th of this month" Recently, a major robbery occurred on the highway near Shatang, Liuzhou. More than 30 bandits, armed with light machine guns and other weapons, robbed more than 20 passengers of all their belongings.

The plan has been drafted and will be implemented after being approved by the Provincial Committee meeting on the 13th.

The ceremony began at 10:00 AM with the New Life National School band leading the staff of the conference, the school flags of each school, and all the athletes around the venue. Then, music was played, the flag was raised, and 100 carrier pigeons were released, soaring high into the sky, reflecting the 123 school flags, making it a splendid and solemn occasion.

The second phase, from the morning of the 14th to the afternoon of the 16th, is for the city sports meet and group exercise performances, lasting a total of five days.

Due to transportation issues, only a few schools from rural areas participated. However, the total number of participants was higher than in previous years, and the city sports meet was the first one held after the victory, making it an unprecedented event. Throughout the day, boy scouts maintained order, and police and health bureaus sent guards and medical personnel to the venue, ensuring excellent order.

### Behind the Scenes at the Venue

[Special report by this newspaper] The city sports meet opened at Zhongzheng Park yesterday, coinciding with the anniversary of the founding of the Republic, and all agencies were on holiday, so Zhongzheng Park was packed.

Like a scene from an ancient battlefield: From morning to night, bugles and drums echoed in Zhongzheng Park, flags fluttered, and doors opened on all sides (the venue has eight gates: east, south, west, north, southeast, northeast, southwest, and northwest). In addition, more than 100 tents were scattered around the venue, creating an atmosphere of intense battle, making people feel like they were facing a formidable enemy.

Competing to Be First

Among the tents of various schools, this newspaper's large tent attracted the most attention from the audience. The large characters "Shen Bao" written in red ink on the top of the tent attracted countless spectators to ask for news, copy records, and read the wall newspaper. Thus, this newspaper's tent became a temporary service center and information station for the venue.

Because they were presiding over the celebration of the anniversary of the founding of the Republic, Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan did not arrive at the venue until 11:15 AM. Amid applause, Mayor Wu said emotionally: "Middle-aged people always feel endless excitement when they see the younger generation. Bearing great responsibilities, middle-aged people have at most another 20 years, while the hopes of young people are infinite. Seeing the vitality of the next generation active in the venue today makes me feel like I am seeing the future of China." His words were heartfelt, and the students were deeply moved.

Before the opening ceremony, carrier pigeons soared into the sky. Because this item was not included in the program beforehand, the newspaper photographers missed this shot. During the flag-raising ceremony, because the flag-bearer was too nervous, the national flag failed to unfurl and became entangled on the rope, so the photographers regretted not being able to capture a magnificent shot of the flag flying high.

Ponds Everywhere

The most annoying thing at the venue was the difficulty of relieving oneself. Many elementary school students, unable to find a toilet, used their ingenuity and gathered several classmates to form a circle and take turns relieving themselves within the circle. As a result, many ponds and heaps of were added around the venue.

The group exercise performances were indeed competitive. Each school created its own unique style in terms of clothing and movements, so the venue was colorful and very moving. A parent, seeing his child wearing a brightly colored uniform and performing vigorously, suddenly sighed and said: "My son pestered me to make this outfit last week. When I refused, he cried several times and even refused to eat!"

Among the performances, the carpenter dance by Dongming Branch School, the sailor dance by Yanping Road National Elementary School, the sweeping dance by Feihong, the oar flag exercise by Chun, and the towel dance by Bide Branch School were the most outstanding. These students were mostly children under the age of ten, and the youngest were not even five years old. Their movements were coordinated and harmonious, and the audience applauded unanimously.

Two Little Ones, No Suspicion

When the Dongming kindergarteners performed the "Little Lamb Dance," the photographers were busy looking for shots of these innocent children. An old grandmother-like woman smiled and said, "My granddaughter danced so well, please take a picture of her! Put it in the paper tomorrow so she can be lively and cute."

The prizes displayed on the podium included 15 silver shields, 22 silver cups, and many framed silk banners. Most of the silver shields and silver cups were donated by the banking industry. The cups and shields from China, Central, Central Exchange, Guohua, Dalu, Jin Cheng, Silk Industry, and other banks were all exquisitely crafted and tempting. The athletes, as they walked past the podium, all gave them their attention.

At least 40 temporary stalls sprang up in Zhongzheng Park yesterday. One stall selling "peep shows" was surrounded by children, almost pushing over the stall and revealing the secrets of the peep shows!

A friendly football match was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM between Donghua and White Eagle at the Yiyuan football field.

Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Linggen, Han Longbo, Tan Fuzhen, Jin Chuanhan (out), Lin Wenhu (in), Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe, Qian Yongqing (out), Jia Youliang (in) White Eagle: Ivanov, Xu Erzi, Si Dangu, Orlov, Griffis, F.

### Fujian Putian Track and Field Team Arrives in Shanghai This Morning

The Shanghai expedition team from the Fujian Putian Men and Women Track and Field Team, which departed from Fuzhou on the Xin Kang ship on the 9th of this month, was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday. However, due to excessive wind and waves at sea, they were unable to arrive as scheduled. Last night, reporters inquired with the Customs and learned that the Xin Kang ship had arrived off the coast of Wusongkou at around 9:00 PM last night. Due to port regulations, it will enter the port at 8:00 AM this morning and berth at the twelfth pier of Yangjiadu. The 99 and Yishe track and field teams in this city are scheduled to welcome them at the pier this morning.

### Full Schedule for Football League (Group A) Determined

The Football Committee of the Sports Association held the third Shanghai Football League, but because of the Malayan Lianhua team's visit to Shanghai and to host trials for choosing teams to participate in the Hua Zhong and Hua Bei districts matches of next year's World Games, the league was delayed. At the committee's fifth meeting, it was decided that Group A would adopt a single round-robin system, starting on November 29th and 30th, and all original schedules were cancelled. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the committee convened representatives from each team participating in Group A. Under the supervision of Rong Qizhao, chairman of the Football Committee, and Tan Yi, chairman of the Referees Committee, a new draw was held to determine the schedule, as follows:

### Brief News

Due to the war, some faculty and students from Soochow University and Hangzhou University were unable to relocate inland. As a result, they established East China University in Shanghai. The authorities of both Soochow and Hangzhou Universities have now petitioned the Ministry of Education to exempt East China University graduates from qualification examinations or to allow each university to conduct its own examinations to simplify the process. The matter is currently awaiting approval from the Ministry of Education.

The Municipal People's Schools of this city are holding district work discussion meetings. The work discussion meetings for the Tilanqiao, Yulin, and Yangshupu districts were convened the day before yesterday at 9:00 AM at the Huimin Road No. 47 People's School. Additionally, the three districts of Putuo, Jiangning, and Xincheng held a joint work discussion meeting the day before yesterday at the Weihaiwei Road No. 54 School.

### Ministry of Education to First Request a Loan from the Four Banks for Winter Coal Expenses for Faculty and Staff of Northern Universities

"Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th" The Ministry of Education, in response to the Beiping Executive Headquarters' suggestion to allocate 1 million national currency to each faculty and staff member of colleges and universities in Beiping and Tianjin for winter coal expenses to purchase coal for heating and warding off the cold, has comprehensively considered and addressed the matter, handling it in conjunction with the case of faculty and staff of colleges and universities in the Northeast and Northwest regions. The Ministry of Education has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for a special appropriation for these coal expenses. However, given the early onset of cold weather in the North, the Ministry of Education, for the sake of providing swift relief, immediately consulted with the Four Joint Offices to apply for a loan for immediate use, which will be repaid once the Executive Yuan approves the special appropriation.

### Once American Aid Loans to China are Realized, Commodity Prices in This City Should Improve; The Circumstances of Domestic Industries May Inevitably Face Difficulties

[Reported by This Newspaper] A responsible person from the financial sector stated: Under the current circumstances, the United States is bound to provide aid to Europe and China. Therefore, the arrival of loans is inevitable. However, after our country obtains the loans, we must practice greater frugality and streamline operations, using the funds in the most beneficial ways. American government officials have a pragmatic view on economic aid to China, believing that the main resources China lacks, such as food, medicine, and textiles, the United States can independently supply. Once the prices of these few resources are stabilized, the issue of commodity prices will be largely resolved. Washington is currently considering how much aid to China will cost and will formulate a comprehensive plan based on this. American economic aid will certainly take the form of transporting goods to China, mainly food, medicine, and clothing. This will be of great help. However, on the other hand, the loan will have its conditions in exchange. In the future, the popular sales of American goods in our country's market are also inevitable. Especially in the field of pharmaceuticals, in the past, the United States, Germany, and Switzerland competed in our country's market. Now, the United States has taken over Germany's production. The strength of its power goes without saying. Currently, the United States is enthusiastically training our country's medical personnel, teaching them how to use American medicines, providing assistance on the one hand with good intentions, but also incidentally serving their own country's industry and commerce. This one aspect can encompass the rest. In the future, the circumstances of our country's industries will inevitably face difficulties.

[Another Dispatch] An individual responsible for the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee recently expressed his views on the U.S. government's plan to lend 300 million yuan to China, stating that since the U.S. government intends to loan money to China, it must have a definite plan for its use. This matter is within the purview of the United States, and it is inconvenient to make any comments. Because Washington's report was too brief, the terms of the loan are unknown. However, in the future, there will be lengthy and heated debates in Congress, and the contents will become clear. What can be said is that monthly assistance of 20 million U.S. dollars will be of considerable benefit to our country's economy. After the announcement of the Marshall talks, the black market for gold notes immediately fell, which shows one aspect of its effect.

[Another Dispatch] A responsible person from a civic organization in this city expressed his views on the U.S. loan, stating briefly that this matter has been anticipated by the government and the public in our country for a long time. It is gratifying that the U.S. government can formally propose it to Congress. On this day, when there is a severe shortage of foreign exchange head counts, a subsidy of 20 million U.S. dollars per month is of great benefit. I believe that this loan will assist our country's economic construction and will not be used entirely to aid China with daily necessities. At the same time, once the loan is established, it will have a significant impact on commodity prices.

### The First Batch of American Flour and Wheat Can Be Shipped Within the Month, Totaling Approximately 28,000 Tons

The first batch of food in the Sino-American relief agreement, which has been approved, is 17,000 tons of wheat and 11,000 tons of flour, and is planned to be shipped within the month and arrive in China within the year. It is now known that after the U.S. Consulate has discussed the matter with the Central Trust Bureau for several days, the U.S. side agrees that the CTB can set up a receiving agency in the U.S. in advance and handle transportation matters.

It is also known that the wheat portion may be handed over to various flour mills in this city for processing and milling, calculated at a ratio of seven to three for raw materials and finished products. In the future, 11,900 tons of foreign flour can be obtained.

### Application Registration Method for Profitable and Freelance Professions

Article 6 and 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Profit and Tax Law by the Ministry of Finance have been approved and notified to various direct tax bureaus on record. According to the provisions of the amended document, all business premises for profit-making businesses and freelancers should apply for registration with the local competent direct tax collection agency. The previously promulgated "Application Registration Method for Income Tax Paying Businesses and Residences" should be amended to comply. The Ministry has now formulated a "Application Registration Method for Business Premises of Profitable Businesses and Freelancers," and has abolished the "Application Registration Method for Income Tax Paying Businesses and Residences." The main points of the "Application Registration Method for Business Application and Registration of Profitable Businesses and Freelancers" are now recorded as follows: All newly opened, reorganized, merged, topped, newly established or surviving profitable businesses should apply for registration with the local competent collection agency within one month after the start of business, and issue an A-type income tax registration certificate. All business premises for freelance professions should apply for registration with the local competent collection agency within one month after the start of business, and issue a B-type income tax registration certificate. All current business premises for profitable businesses that perform business or freelance professions whose whereabouts are unknown must be registered in accordance with the provisions of this method within one month from the date of promulgation of this method.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Electrically Requests the Legislative Yuan to Consider Reducing the Business License Tax Rate

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently telegraphed the Legislative Yuan, stating briefly that according to letters from the Municipal Automobile Transportation Business Association and other associations, after reading the newspaper reports, the revised and passed Use License Tax Law by the Legislative Yuan has increased the tax rate by more than thirty times compared to that stipulated in the tax law of December 4, 1946. Such a multiple tax increase is unprecedented. During the Anti-Japanese War, transportation merchants suffered great losses and have not yet recovered. They already feel heavily burdened by the various taxes and levies they pay at ordinary times, and they are already struggling to maintain their business in the face of business depression and difficult circumstances. How can they bear further tax burdens? For the sake of the survival of all members, the Chamber of Commerce cannot remain silent. It dares to express its urgent words and respectfully requests your council to promptly submit the actual situation to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. Grant consideration and reduction of the revised tax rate for use licenses to show courtesy and avoid hardship. The Chamber is extremely hopeful. The Chamber of Commerce has calculated and considered the aforementioned letters from the public association, and believes that the aforementioned tax rate is more than thirty times higher than the current tax law. The burden is heavy, and the results are still transferred in a cycle to consumers. The Chamber believes that the tax is no less than thirty times more than now and that the issues related to people's livelihood are too serious. The Chamber still requests your hospital to seriously consider and reduce the burden on the people in accordance with the two Western Yang and Western Geng generations of this Chamber and the sections presented in this telegram.

### The Central Trust Bureau Promotes Spring Silk Exports, Hoping That All Silk Factories Will Deliver Goods Quickly

The Central Trust Bureau is handling the work of purchasing spring silk. As of now, a total of 4,097 bales have been delivered by various manufacturers (each bale contains 133 and one-third pounds). Among them, there are 105 bales of grade A, 755 bales of grade B, 1,305 bales of grade C, 1,300 bales of grade D, 560 bales of grade E, 17 bales of 16-18 filament, 25 bales of 13-15 filament, and 30 bales of thrown silk. In order to earn foreign exchange, the Bureau has successively shipped 2,460 bales abroad. Among them, the United States and India account for the majority, each accounting for about 40%, and the rest are in Europe and other places. Recently, the Bureau sold another 300 bales to India, which are waiting to be shipped. In addition, it also plans to ship 800 bales to the United States and 1,500 bales to the Soviet Union before the end of the month. According to the current raw silk in hand, there are only 1,637 bales left. If all of them are shipped out, the shortage will be 963 bales. The Central Trust Bureau hopes that the factories will deliver the goods quickly so that they can be shipped on time.

### Taiwan's Light and Heavy Industries Are Progressing Rapidly; Sugar Factories Will All Start Operations Soon; Taiwan Sugar Plans to Export 100,000 Tons Next Year

Wu Zhaohong, Chief Secretary of the Resources Committee and Chairman of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, said before returning to Beijing via Shanghai: During this trip to Taiwan, the second joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the company was held, and the company's work plan and business budget for the next year have been finalized. Taiwan's grain industry has been actively reorganized and restored by the company for the past two years. The original 36 sugar factories can all start sugar production by the end of the year. The area planted with sugarcane has also increased from 30,000 acres to 89,000 acres, and will be further increased to 118,000 acres next year. Taiwan's farmers have benefited greatly from the company's implementation of the sugar distribution method, so they are very enthusiastic about planting sugarcane. Last year, the area planted with sugarcane has reached the original plan. The amount of fertilizer applied per acre has also gradually increased from 80 kg to about 400 kg. The warehouse area has built more than 200,000 square feet this year. The grain production season this year will begin next month. It is estimated that the output this season can reach 300,000 metric tons. Currently, Japan, Korea, the South Seas, and the Middle East all need sugar very much. In order to earn foreign exchange, we have negotiated with the Central Bank to increase export methods. It is expected that we plan to export 100,000 tons next year. The United Kingdom is now advocating famine exports. Although sugar is not an indispensable item for people's daily use, the Taiwan sugar produced in our country is of excellent quality. For the sake of the entire national economy, we should try our best to conserve consumption and increase the quantity of exports in order to increase foreign exchange income.

Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, and his party arrived in Shanghai by plane from Taipei a few days ago. According to Weng, the results of the inspection in Taiwan this time were quite satisfactory. All light and heavy industries have made considerable progress. For example, the output of sugar in the last season was more than 30,000 tons, and it can be increased to more than 300,000 tons in the next season. The Luodong Paper Mill produced 400,000 tons of paper last year, and it has increased to 1.1 million tons this year. In addition, such as cement, fertilizer, are also in mass production. There are also some new products, such as cars, diesel, oil, brake oil, etc., which were not produced before the war.

### The Pig Bristle Industry Has Initially Succeeded in Obtaining Loans from the Agricultural Bank

The Pig Bristle Industry Association of this city convened a meeting in order to collect a large amount of raw materials this year in order to maintain its operations, and collected spot goods by district to pledge to the Farmers Bank for loans. According to Mr. Fei Meisheng, Director of the Association, the loan process has been quite smooth and has achieved initial success. Fei also said that this pledge of loan funds will benefit the industry. With this loan, a large amount of raw materials can be purchased in the place of origin. At the same time, the export can be maintained regularly in the international market without fear of interruption.

### Reduced Exports of Salt to Japan Replaced with Iron Sand

[Reported by This Newspaper] It is reported that after the Ministry of Economic Affairs learned that iron sand produced in Hainan Island was exported to Japan in exchange for locomotives, it ordered the Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office to conduct a detailed survey of the supply and demand of raw materials in steel plants in Guangdong in order to consider the situation and give priority to supplying raw materials to domestic manufacturers and then exporting the surplus. According to the previous government decision to export iron sand to Japan, there were two main points: 1. Our country does not currently need this iron sand; 2. In the barter trade between China and Japan, Japan needs food, coal, and iron raw materials. Our country is not self-sufficient in grain and coal. In the past, salt exported to Japan was the main product. Due to the situation, the amount has been sharply reduced, and the amount exported to Japan is only one-eleventh of the original contract. Therefore, iron yarn has to be exported.

### Jiangxi Porcelain Plans to Promote Sales to the United States

Jiangxi porcelain was once famous in the world. In recent years, the business has declined due to the failure to improve the technology. Currently, Dali Import and Export Company has a lot of contact with the Jiangxi porcelain industry, and plans to promote the sales of Western-style porcelain to North and South America. However, in view of the fact that this market was previously estimated by Japan, in order to prevent the revival of Japanese porcelain dumping, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce will be entrusted to investigate the situation of the Japanese porcelain industry. In addition, banks in Jiangxi do not operate foreign exchange business, and letters of credit can only be opened to Shanghai. The Jiangxi-Shanghai exchange rate is very high (currently 6%). The cost has increased and the procedures are complicated. Recently, the loan period for Japanese exports has suddenly been shortened from 90 days to 30 days, while the porcelain manufacturing kiln time is two months, and the Jiangxi-Shanghai transportation also takes one month, so the loan cannot be fully utilized. It is hoped that the competent authority will seek remedies as soon as possible.

### Cigarettes and Soap Both Fall

Yesterday morning, the cigarette market was characterized by nervousness on all sides. Furthermore, because money was tight, selling was incessant. Ten packs of Great Britain cigarettes fell 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and Old Knife and Hade Men both fell 250,000 yuan. Merchants like British American Tobacco and Beauty Bank followed suit, falling 500 to 1,000 yuan per carton.

In terms of daily necessities, soap, because many bulls had closed their positions and sold off, and there were six batches of sales, the price was lower than the factory price, and sales were only four mouths in each star. As a result, Gu Ben soap fell another 10,000 yuan per box compared to the previous day, Jian Dao fell 6,000 yuan, and other soaps were flat. Ji brand candles fell slightly by 20,000 yuan, and matches also fell slightly.

### Tea Export Association to Convene General Meeting on Schedule to Discuss Tea Export Steps

The Shanghai Tea Export Association believes that since the government opened up foreign exchange nearly two years ago, the export industry has been sluggish, and the difficulty of exporting tea is even more severe. Although it is due to the failure to improve quality as much as possible, other factors such as transportation, capital adjustment, and high costs affect tea exports. It is true that there are major problems. Now, the government is planning the balance of international payments, and it is time for export trade. My country's tea specialty is one of the main exports. In order to improve the tea export steps and cooperate with the government's export trade policy, the general meeting of members will be held on the 18th of this month. The City Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting to discuss the promotion of tea exports.

### World Rice Production Prospects This Year Slightly Higher Than Last Year, Still Less Than Pre-War Average

According to the preliminary estimates of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, world rice production for the 1947-48 crop year will be approximately 695,000,000,000 bushels, slightly higher than last year but still 7% lower than the pre-war average. Rice production prospects are improving in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia excluding the Indian peninsula. Rice production in South America is somewhat uncertain due to timing issues, but it is not expected to be lower than last year.

Paddy fields in China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, and Malaysia have all increased, and the weather before harvesting is conducive to rice production. The total output of the three rice-surplus countries, Siam, Burma, and Vietnam, is expected to increase by 100,000,000,000 bushels compared to last year.

The area of ​​rice cultivation in Burma has been increased by 10,000 acres, but the floods in August have caused great damage to the paddy fields. Rice production in Siam has suffered from drought during the transplanting period, which has hindered its maximum recovery. However, rice production is still expected to increase compared to last year. On the Vietnam side, due to the unstable situation, rice production is expected to decrease this year.

It is estimated that the Indian Peninsula has 80,500,000 acres of paddy fields, and rice production is expected to be approximately 1,980,000,000 bushels in 1947-48. Last year, there were 81,800,000 acres, which produced 2,105,000,000 bushels. The increase in planting of hemp this year has resulted in a decrease in both the acreage and production of paddy fields.

It is estimated that the increase in rice production this year is: North America 6,000,000 bushels, Europe 7,000,000 bushels, Africa 2,000,000 bushels. The above bushel figures are all brown rice, not white rice.

### New Trends in Popular Education

— Lu Cheng

Author: Gu Mei Publisher: China Book Bureau

How important is popular education to the construction of a new China! However, in the barren publishing industry, it is extremely difficult to find a book that can point out the trends in popular education and explain the correct path of popular education. Recently, we were fortunate enough to read Gu Mei's "New Trends in Popular Education."

Popular education in China has a history of several decades, and many books and newspapers discussing popular education have also been published. The more famous ones include Gan Yuyuan's "Popular Education" (Zhonghua), Meng Xiancheng's "Popular Education" (World Edition), Zhao Buxia's "Outline of Popular Education" (Zhonghua), Gao Jiansi's "Popular Education" (Commercial Press), Chen Lijiang's "Popular Education" (Commercial Press), and Yu Qingtang's "Popular Education" (Zhengzhong). These works have made some contributions to the development of popular education in China. However, after China experienced eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people, especially the working masses, suffered unprecedented hardships. It should be very clear that popular education must change its direction of effort to shoulder the mission of national reconstruction.

The author, Mr. Gu, has been engaged in popular education for nearly twenty years and has a deep understanding and research of popular education. He is respected by colleagues in popular education. This book first observes the trends of popular education from the process of its development, then lists the implementation methods of various policies, and criticizes their gains and losses, so that those who study or manage popular education know what to take and what to discard. As stated in the preface: "This book describes the process of development of popular education, so that it can be clear about its changes before and after; changes are restricted by subjective and objective conditions and are not completely made out of thin air; personnel who handle popular education must deeply understand these conditions, and then they can grasp them, work hard to move forward, and embark on the bright road."

Popular education in China is of course particularly in need of promotion, but whether past popular education has been beneficial or harmful to the Chinese people is indeed something to be carefully considered. Mr. Gu reminds colleagues in popular education to pay attention to the subjective and objective conditions for the implementation of popular education, which is particularly earnest and deeply admired!

The book has seven chapters in total: What is Popular Education? The Content of Popular Education, Popular Supplementary Education, Comprehensive Popular Education, Separate Popular Education, New Developments in Popular Education, and Where is Popular Education Moving?

From these contents, this book has a complete system of popular education. The author praises this book because it has the following advantages:

It has profound and unique insights, especially pointing out the trends in popular education from the process of its development, without any prejudice, which is particularly commendable. For example, Mr. Gu pointed out that the reason why each family has different interpretations of popular education is that they have ignored the development process and the limitations of conditions. Therefore, in the section on the meaning of popular education, the author says: "Popular education at the present stage is the education that develops the lives of the people." This is such an appropriate and pertinent way to explain the meaning of popular education using dialectical methods.

Accurate to reality, and the argument does not advocate empty words: Mr. Gu is a simple and honest scholar. His arguments are always based on evidence, with no fabricated elements and no excessive prejudices. For example, Mr. Gu says in the section on the object of popular education: "Some people think that the object of popular education in China is the whole people, unconditionally saying that regardless of gender, occupation, wealth, social status, educated or uneducated, from national leaders to vendors and peddlers" are all objects of popular education. In fact, it is inevitable that the description is exaggerated and too grandiose." However, Mr. Gu pointed out that the object of popular education in China at the present stage should be all the working masses, especially the adult working masses, which is such a realistic statement.

At the end of each chapter, there are research and discussion questions, and these questions can make people think deeply, so that readers can have a deeper understanding of the content of the chapter, and for popular education workers, they also indicate the direction of their efforts.

From the preface, we know that this book was written by the author after the War of Resistance Against Japan in those years when life was most difficult. At that time, the author was trapped in Shanghai (then called the isolated island), and the suffering of life was unimaginable. However, Mr. Gu was able to engage in writing this book during his spare time from teaching, which is particularly precious. From time to time, pessimistic and negative arguments are revealed in the article, which shows how bad the author's mood was at that time and how tragic the situation was! However, because this book is the child of a crisis, it is even more great!

### Math is Fun

— Zhong Huan

Written by Liu Xunyu Published by Kaiming

For higher algebra, the most common textbook is Fan's Higher Algebra, and the best reference book is Horner's Higher Algebra and Ueno Kiyoshi's Lecture Notes on Higher Algebra. Fan's compilation is suitable, while Horner and Ueno's books excel in exercises. The special feature of "Math is Fun" introduced here is "clear explanation." The author, Mr. Liu Xunyu, uses a fluent and relaxed style, and simple theories to explain profound theories, and bases his explanations on things in daily life, unlike the boring and tasteless nature of ordinary math books.

The content of this book is roughly the same as that of Horner's, including arrangement and combination, the solution of indefinite equations, the problem of product bombs, advanced arithmetic series, and numeration methods. The selection of materials is novel. For example, the discussion of the problem of product bombs starts with selling soup, and the discussion of probability starts with playing mahjong, which naturally arouses interest and makes people concentrate. It is a good reference book and also a beneficial novel.

As for applications, I think it should be used together with Horner's, because Horner's seems too deep, and there is still no good translation, so in terms of theory, we use "Math is Fun" to supplement the deficiencies of Horner's, but "Math is Fun" does not have exercises, so we still have to rely on Horner's to help, so that they can complement each other.

The price of this book is not high. A novel of the same thickness may be more expensive than it, so I advise high school students to buy a copy, which can be used as a reference book and also as a novel.

### Atomic Energy and Life

— Lin Houlun

(By G. Gamow, translated by Chen Zhongjie and Shu Chongze, "Atomic Energy and the Universe and Life," published by Commercial Press, priced at 15,000 yuan.)

Since the victory, the number of new books published by various bookstores cannot be considered small. However, popular science books like "Atomic Energy and the Universe and Life" seem quite rare. Here, we must admire the vision of the Commercial Press authorities and the efforts of the two translators. Thanks to their sacrifice, the Chinese people have gained a genuine opportunity to increase their knowledge.

G. Gamow is a professor at the University of Washington in the United States. He played an important role in the US military's research on atomic energy, making significant contributions to the theory and technology of liberating atomic energy. It seems like a "waste of talent" for him to write this small book with the knowledge he gained from his research. However, this also becomes the biggest regret of the whole book: it cannot yet become a "popular science book that everyone can understand." Inevitably, there are many parts in the book that are a bit too profound. Although the fluent writing style has made up for some of it, it still needs to remove a few pages of profound descriptions to be considered a popular science book that everyone can understand.

Several illustrations and photos in the book are very interesting and meaningful. Especially the first photo, which has a great allegorical meaning: atomic energy was quietly discovered, and in less than fifty years, it has been vigorously developed, destroying a large city in one fell swoop. The progress of physics in the past fifty years is astonishing.

However, the praiseworthy aspects of the book are not limited to some photos and illustrations. It can be considered very appropriate to use this book as a reference book for high school students. Recently, many parts of high school courses require explanations of atomic structure. In those profound and obscure texts, it is quite difficult to specifically understand the atomic structure and shape. It is even more difficult to understand how the energy contained within the atom can be liberated. However, in this book, it uniquely explains it using the surface energy of a drop of water, which is both concrete and easy to understand, and is ten thousand times clearer than the explanation in textbooks.

After Professor G. Gamow finished explaining the analogy of atomic structure and the principle of liberating atomic energy, he went on to a narrative from the ends of the earth to write the second chapter of the book. This chapter talks about the origin of us humans, the origin of the earth, how the sun is produced, the Milky Way in which the solar system is entrusted, the nebulae outside the Milky Way, and even the relationship between that large area outside the clouds and the small atoms. The original description is so beautiful, and the expression of the translation is even more full of literary atmosphere. This chapter is probably the most attractive part of the whole book for readers. The origin of humans, the origin of the earth... this series of questions is what everyone wants to know, and this book can actually write it in words that everyone can understand. Although it does not make much contribution to pure academics, it is very valuable in terms of popularizing science and arousing people's interest in science.

After talking about the relationship between atoms and the universe, we will talk about atomic energy and life. This issue becomes the third chapter of the book. The first half of the third chapter is very specialized and inappropriate, and ordinary middle school students in our country cannot understand it, while science and engineering college students already understand it. Only the last section of the chapter seems to be of general interest. It tells us about many uses of atomic energy and future prospects.

### Biography of Madame Curie

— Written by Chen Zhengren, published by World Book Company

Radium is the most mysterious and rare thing in the world. The discoverer of radium is the Polish female scientist Madame Curie. I think everyone is very familiar with this name. This book is about the life of Madame Curie.

The whole book is divided into twenty-eight chapters: the first chapter talks about the hatred of Poland's subjugation. At that time, Poland was under the sphere of influence of Russia. The second chapter introduces radioactive elements. The third chapter talks about her childhood. Her father was a teacher, and she had three older sisters and one older brother. From the fourth to the eighth chapter is her school days, "Among this class, Marie (Madame Curie's former name) was the youngest, but in all subjects, she always ranked among the best and was the champion of her classmates." It can be seen that she was very smart and hardworking at that time. After middle school, her family did not go to university due to financial difficulties. She worked as a tutor for several years. Xu Lai was helped by her third sister before she went to Paris to study at university. After the tenth chapter, it talks about the process of her and Mr. Curie extracting pure radium after their marriage. At first, their economy was very difficult, and they did not have money to buy raw materials. They used a factory shed as a laboratory. After they discovered radium, they won several bonuses and gradually became famous. Later, after Mr. Curie passed away, she became a female professor. The United States sent her two grams of radium. She gave one gram to France and one gram to her motherland. Later, her body gradually weakened due to hard work. She died in Sancerre on July 4 of the year she was sixty-seven years old (1934).

The last chapter is the conclusion. Einstein said, "Among all the celebrities, the only one who was not overwhelmed by fame was Madame Curie." Madame Curie's door-knocking, hard work, and finally achieved the result and gained great reputation. But she herself was not proud at all. She worked for the sake of work!

### "The Art of Poetry"

— Hu Jide

Written by Li Guangtian, published by Kaiming Bookstore. "The Art of Poetry" and Ai Qing's "On Poetry" can be said to be two relatively perfect treatises in the new poetry world. The former is half theory and half criticism, while the latter focuses entirely on theory. This is the difference between the two books.

The articles in "The Art of Poetry" are not divided into chapters and sections or have a systematic nature. The Taoer collection contains five articles, all written one after another. "The Art of Poetry" is also one of them and is used as the title of the book. Now, the characteristics of this book are briefly described on the left to introduce it to young readers who love new poetry. (As the author said, "Young people with enthusiasm are all a poem. It is most hygienic for young people to use poetry to vent their emotions." Then let us appreciate the art of this poem!)

Analysis of the Prose of New Poetry: Since the New Culture Movement, new poetry has been liberated from the old shackles and restrictions. It stands to reason that the beginning of a new era. Every time is the day when poetry blooms. The examples of Goethe and Schiller in Germany are well known. In France, during the era of the Great Revolution, many great poets were produced, which is the reason. However, the path of our Chinese new poetry is still being developed in thorns. The author points out in the first article that the current poetry is prose poetry, and has not yet crossed into the ideal realm. However, with so many readers supporting it, the future development is still optimistic, and it is mentioned in the article that: "In the past, bookstore owners shook their heads when they saw new poetry, but now, businessmen's abacuses are also hitting this stroke quite loudly." New poetry has not entered a stage of superiority, and the author analyzes it in detail in the book, let me excerpt a few sentences here: "In response to the current trend of prose in poetry, we just say that poets should always create (or use) various different forms themselves, and do not ignore the form, in order to perfectly convey those thoughts, feelings, or "complete experiences" that are worthy of poetry, and to improve them."

Discussion of Form and Content: Poetry becomes prose, and then it involves the issue of form and content. He (hereinafter refers to the author himself) said: "I believe that "content determines form", therefore, I also believe that content has a superiority over form." "Paying attention to form does not mean ignoring content, but to improve content." In the second article, he takes the criticism of Xia Zhilin's "Ten Years of Poetry Drafts" as an example, and discusses chapters, syntax, format, and rhyme in all aspects. It is definitely not a superficial theory for readers. Similarly, it also shows us the attitude of studying new poetry.

Careful Criticism of Word Usage: "The poet's voice is our voice, the voice of the times. The poet breathes for us, speaks for us, and shines." Then, since poetry represents people's voices, why should we "bite words" and ponder? We can find the answer to this question in the book. "Life comes first. Art comes second. Only those who are faithful to life can be artists and can be faithful to art." Poetry has its depth in the artistic techniques and essence, so no matter a word or a phrase is never sloppy. From the fourth article criticizing Fang Jing's poems, he explains the height of the tone by using the single words "呢", "吗", and "哪". Obviously, he has unique insights into the careful study of word usage. This is enough to warn the efforts of people who study new poetry.

Indicating the Path for Learners: In the last article, he indicates the path for young authors who study new poetry, and the shortcomings that should be corrected. The method of learning is compared to a tree, "Wildness is the wanton growth of a small tree; cleanliness is when you prune it and tidy it up; but this pruning and this tidying is precisely for it to grow more like it, and it will have a very substantial completion." This indicates the problem that learners are not "clean" when writing poetry; and warns every young learner against the taboos of the "exhibitionist" and "enthusiast" problems. Every sentence prescribes the right medicine, which is definitely not without benefit to us.

To Mr. Ding Xingjian of Shanghai: Money shops that closed down due to the Anti-Japanese War can apply for resumption of business after the war. As for the money shops that declared closure in the 24th year of the Republic of China, it was not due to the Anti-Japanese War. Moreover, even for money shops that closed down due to the Anti-Japanese War, the period for applying for resumption of business has passed, and they cannot resume business again. If the money shop has already opened, it cannot apply to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation. As for the dispute between the other two brothers over the eldest brother, it is a matter of equity within the money shop and can be filed in the district court.
