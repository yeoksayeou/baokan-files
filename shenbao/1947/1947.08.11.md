### Wei's Envoy Calls on Chairman Chiang for Extensive Talks; Now Going to Taiwan to Gather Information; Will Come to Shanghai to Contact Sino-American Business Circles

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] Wei Te-mai called on Chairman Chiang at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 10:00 AM on the 10th. This was the envoy's first meeting with the Chairman since returning to Nanjing from the north. They talked for four hours and had lunch together. The content of the talks is not known, but it is widely believed that the current situation and prospects in North China and the Northeast must have been one of the main topics. According to a member of the mission, Wei and his party were deeply impressed by the unfortunate situation in northern China. Wei himself also believes that if the North achieves stability and industrial construction has opportunities for development, China should not have serious economic problems. In the afternoon, Wei held a meeting with his advisors and discussed the information collected during their trip to North China and the Northeast. At 5:00 PM, Wei and the Minister went to the Lai San Xiu Hall of Jinling University for worship. The Minister wore a white suit, and Wei wore a navy blue jacket and white pants. They sat in the front right corner near the organ, silently participating in prayer, listening to the sermon, and singing hymns with the congregation. After the service ended at 6:00 PM, they laughed and talked as they boarded the car and left. In the evening, Wei went to No. 5 Ninghai Road again to dine with General Lucas, head of the US military advisory group. Wei and his party, except for Colonel He Qin, the secretary, who remained in Nanjing, will fly to Taiwan on the 11th for inspection, and are scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 13th to contact Sino-American business circles again. On the 15th, they will fly to Guangzhou, stay for one or two days, and then return to fully organize the information obtained in China in preparation for their report, before flying to Japan and then to Korea.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Vice President Sun Ke recently stated that Special Envoy Wei is not entirely satisfied with the information he has obtained in China. In an exclusive interview with United Press reporter Mr. Jun Hobart, Sun said: Wei Te-mai found the situation in China to be worse than expected. The envoy also criticized some of the government's efforts to solve the current problems. Sun declined to reveal the confidential talks he had with the special envoy, but said that his personal feeling was that what Wei had obtained seemed to be "everything is not 100% on track." Sun added: "Of course, we also know this. Like the special envoy, we understand that China is facing many difficult problems. He is trying his best to collect as much information as possible so that he can make a judgment on the situation.

Sun said that after a long talk with Wei Te-mai, he believed that the special envoy had not yet made a decision on the future Chinese government. Sun believes that Wei's report to the United States in the future will have a great effect." Sun added: "In any case, the Communists are trying to expand and hold on, but the current government intends to strengthen its defense lines, as solid as gold." He pointed out that the Communist army may develop into a greater threat than it is now, and said: The Communist army is not up to the standard of a regular army. Sun believes that the Communist army sometimes uses terrorist tactics and forces unwilling people to fight. When asked by reporters if he had concrete evidence to prove the various points claimed by the Chinese side that the Soviet Union was aiding the Chinese Communists, Sun replied that Soviet ships were traveling between Dalian and Yantai, and they must have something to do. Their actions were definitely not for amusement.

Regarding Wei's trip to Taiwan, Sun said that it would be inappropriate to compare the high production of the Japanese before the war with the economy after the takeover. Sun believes that the Japanese should be held responsible for the decline in sugar production in Taiwan, because Japan converted sugarcane fields into rice paddies during the war to supply food to the three islands, and US air raids also destroyed some factories, and the land fertility has been exhausted and urgently needs fertilization. When the government took over Taiwan, it found the situation to be dire. It will take a long time for Taiwan to return to its original state in the future, but the government will do its best.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th] Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, denied the newspaper reports that the Democratic League had submitted a memorandum to Envoy Wei requesting the United States to stop aid to China.

### To Safeguard the Completeness of Sovereignty Over Lushun and Dalian, We Are Considering Appropriate Measures; American Newspapers Criticize the Soviet Union's Exclusive Occupation of Dalian

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] We are paying close attention to the United States' renewed protest against the Soviet military's forceful occupation of Datong. It is reported that the outside world hopes for the recovery of Lushun and Dalian, and is also considering taking further measures at an appropriate time to safeguard the completeness of our territorial sovereignty.

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Among all the newspapers here, only the New York World-Telegram of the Scripps-Howard chain and the American newspaper of the Hearst chain prominently published the news that the Soviet Union prohibited American ships from entering Dalian, and only the World-Telegram wrote a commentary criticizing the matter. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune both published the news on the inside pages. The New York Times' headline was "The United States Succumbs to the Soviet Union's Announced Ban in Dalian," and the New York Herald Tribune's headline was "American Ships Prohibited from Entering Dalian Owned by the Soviet Union." An editorial in the World-Telegram stated that the Soviet Union arbitrarily interpreted the Sino-Soviet Treaty and retained military control in Dalian until the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. If the Soviet Union refuses to sign a peace treaty with Japan based on this theory, it can continue to retain permanent control of the area. The World-Telegram also pointed out that in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union agreed to support the National Government led by Chairman Chiang, but the Soviet Union is now openly supporting the Chinese Communist Party, the enemy of the National Government, and is using Dalian as their operational base. The first to report the news that the Soviet Union prohibited American ships from entering Dalian was Scripps-Howard reporter Newton's Shanghai dispatch, which stated that unarmed American naval ships had been prohibited from entering Dalian since March of this year. The news was later confirmed by the US State Department, which is now considering submitting another stronger protest to the Soviet Union. According to the information released by the US military, this protest may be similar to the same note sent to Moscow and Nanjing in January of this year, but the wording will be stronger.

### Vice President Sun Arrives in Shanghai

Zhang Junmai Leaves Shanghai for Guling

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Vice President Sun took the express train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 10th.

[Our City News] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, took a boat to Xun from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th and transferred to Guling to escape the heat, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in half a month.

### Matters Related to Military Training in Taiwan Are Still in the Planning Stage

The Army Military Academy Is Still Located in Chengdu

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] According to informed sources: Regarding the matters of military training in Taiwan by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, the US Army Advisory Group will participate as advisors, but this matter is still in the planning stage and must be approved by the governments of China and the United States. The Chinese side will be chaired by Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, so that the newly trained soldiers can become modernized divisions. However, according to reliable sources, Wei's trip to Taiwan has nothing to do with this matter and is considered not to be within the scope of his investigation. The US Army Advisory Group did not express its opinion on the military training plan.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] According to the Military News Agency: The Central Army Military Academy has been taken over by the Army Headquarters, and the headquarters has sent personnel to discuss with the Fifth Department of the Ministry of National Defense. It is reported that the school will not be relocated for the time being and will still be run in Chengdu.

### Lei Zhen Talks About Sino-Japanese Trade

Strict Control Will Not Be Unfavorable to Us

[Central News Agency, This City News] Lei Zhen, a member of the Political Affairs Committee and Director of the East Asian Association, expressed his opinion yesterday on the issue of opening up Sino-Japanese trade, saying: "Under the current circumstances, we do not need to worry too much about restoring Sino-Japanese trade, because the government has decided to strictly control Sino-Japanese trade. If the imported Japanese goods are not needed by our country, it will be difficult to obtain an import permit. At the same time, the commodities exported to Japan will also consider whether we should export them, and whether the Japanese side needs to purchase them. As for the future mode of trade, its nature will be similar to "barter trade." Anyone who intends to purchase a certain quantity of Japanese goods must export national goods of equal value."

### Peng Xuepei Arrives in Xi'an

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 10th] Peng Xuepei of the Political Affairs Committee arrived in Xi'an from Lanzhou at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Peng will stay here briefly and then return to Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th] Peng Xuepei of the Political Affairs Committee arrived at Lanzhou from Yongdeng at noon on the 9th. Peng said that although the Northwest is poor, it has a great future. The most important thing is political stability. We must work hard to suppress the rebellion, catch up quickly, and seek improvement. Then, he gave a general explanation of the situation in Xinjiang, saying that the current situation is not as serious as imagined. He remained silent on the Beitashan incident, only saying: After staying in Dihua for five days, he took a car to Beitashan for on-site inspection and stayed on the mountain for one day. The information obtained will be released after returning to Nanjing. Peng will return to the capital in the coming days, and the trip to Ningxia is said to have been cancelled.

### The National Boundary Markers in Manchuria and Mishan Were Forced to Be Moved Fifteen Li by the Soviets; Outer Mongolia's Statement Will Be Refuted by Us

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 10th] According to intelligence received by the military, the Sino-Soviet national boundary markers in Manchuria and Mishan in Xing'an Province were forcibly moved 15 li into our territory by the Soviets, and the local people are very angry.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] A tea diplomacy authority told reporters that according to the Moscow dispatch of the United Press on the 9th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Outer Mongolian government issued a communique stating that the Chinese government condoned its troops invading the Mongolian territory seven times, etc., which was purely their consistent false accusation. Our government will issue a formal statement in the coming days to refute it. As for the boundary line issue mentioned at the end of the communique, it is indeed the cause of the recent dispute, but whether the Soviet-Mongolian map is reliable is a big question. The speech made by Luo Jialun, our ambassador to India, in Delhi a week ago is very noteworthy. The evidence provided in the speech makes us keenly aware of the past events in the late Qing Dynasty. The large tracts of land outside the Anling Mountains north of Heilongjiang were lost due to the fact that the Imperial Russia transplanted boundary stones. Outer Mongolia's pretext for sophistry on the Beitashan incident is nothing but a clumsy plagiarism. We have already seen through its deceit and will not allow it to do whatever it wants.

### The Significance of the Pilgrimage Site for Muslims

— Wu Tegong

Every year, the pilgrimage groups organized by Muslims from various provinces must take a boat from this city to their destination—Mecca (called Mank by Muslims). In previous years, when the pilgrimages passed through the capital to this city, only the co-religionists entertained them, and no one from the outside world contacted them, so they came and went silently. But this year is very different from previous years. Before everyone set off from their province, they were treated by the local authorities and airlines, who reserved airplane seats. After gathering in the capital, they were summoned and comforted by Chairman Chiang, and entertained by various parties on separate days. Recently, when the group arrived in this city, they were received by Mayor Wu, and Chairman Pan of the City Council held a tea party on behalf of the council to express their welcome. Many field reporters from various newspapers also visited the group's temporary residence (Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Laoximen) to interview everything, wrote articles, and published them in the newspapers, which aroused the enthusiastic attention of the general readers.

Why does the government particularly value the pilgrimage group this year, contrary to its previous attitude, and provide them with various conveniences? There must be a reason for this. Muslims attach great importance to the pilgrimage, because this is one of the main doctrines recorded in the Muslim Quran. However, this act contains not only personal faith and religious significance, but also the relationship of national diplomacy and international politics. There are more than 50 million Muslim compatriots in our country, most of whom live in the northwestern border provinces, and their unity is very strong. Unfortunately, the general national education level in the border provinces is too low, and the transportation is very inconvenient. Most Muslim believers do not know the national language, and they are located in remote areas, and their vision is limited, so they are simple-minded and have a weak national concept, and they are easily tempted by ambitious people outside the border. Pilgrims traveling to Xinjiang Province mostly pass through the Soviet Union in northern Xinjiang, and mostly pass through India in southern Xinjiang: others in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces also take the grassland route and detour through Tibet. When Muslims in our country go abroad, they do not have passports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of their own country. This not only often causes bad effects internationally, but also gives foreigners who hold aggressive doctrines an easier opportunity to divide and alienate. This does contain a potential danger to the country.

The most unfortunate thing is that last year's pilgrimage group, composed of Xinjiang and other provinces, had more than 70 people. After arriving in this city, due to the relationship of returning to the capital, foreign exchange passports and transportation could not be processed in time, and they missed the pilgrimage date. Therefore, the members of the group had to return to their hometowns in disappointment. Just imagine that they spent a lot of money and traveled long distances, but they still could not fulfill their lifelong aspirations when they arrived at the departure point by boat. This will naturally cause a bad impression on the government due to misunderstandings. Not only them, but also the co-religionists in the country and overseas at that time also regarded it as a great regret. This matter has little effect on Muslims, but it has a great effect on the government, because the annual pilgrimage ceremony is attended by Muslims from more than 40 countries around the world, many of whom are important people and scholars. They share the same belief, have the same aspirations, and are as close as brothers. This is very important in national diplomacy. China was the only country missing from the large group of pilgrims last year, so the public had all kinds of questions about our government, and they could not help but have a bad feeling.

The pilgrimage date this year is approaching, and the China Islamic Association in the capital (Chairman is General Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense) has initiated the organization of a pilgrimage group in view of the mistakes of last year, and has prepared everything in advance. Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, also telegraphed the central government to request assistance. Finally, the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee and others asked Chairman Chiang to approve that the pilgrimage group this year be limited to 40 people, and each person would be allowed to purchase 180 pounds of British gold foreign exchange at the official price to cover the travel expenses to the destination. When the group came to Shanghai from Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the China Islamic Association, and the Tianshan Society sent personnel to escort them and help them complete all the procedures for going abroad. Moreover, because there were several Uyghurs from Xinjiang in the pilgrimage, who could not speak the language, the Central Organization Department sent two translators to serve as interpreters. The hospitality this time was unprecedented, and the pilgrimage group was of course very grateful. When they reach their destination in the future and return to their hometowns in the future, they will naturally publicize the government's benevolence and wash away the bad things of last year.

### The Radium Institute of the Peking Research Institute Begins to Study Atomic Energy; Yan Jici Talks About the Soviet Union's Ability to Manufacture Atomic Bombs; The Saying of Flying Saucers and Flying Discs Is Just Worrying Unnecessarily

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Director of the Electrical Research Institute of the Peking Research Institute, Mr. Yan Jici, arrived in Nanjing and stayed at the Academia Sinica. He talked with reporters about the following four questions: (1) The current status of atomic energy research in our country. (2) Whether the Soviet Union can manufacture atomic bombs. (3) The possibility of applying atomic energy to general industries. (4) What kind of attitude should we take to the appearance of so-called "flying saucers." Mr. Yan said: (1) The study of atomic energy in our country has just begun. As far as the colleagues of the Radium Institute of the Peking Research Institute are concerned, they are now focusing their energy on this topic. Deputy Director Li Shuhua also has considerable knowledge of this. The relationship between the various academic departments is very close, so physicists are now involved in atomic energy issues. The institute's personnel and equipment still need to be actively enriched so that research work can be carried out in a planned manner. Researcher Qian Sanqiang discovered a new method of atomic nucleus fission in France, and atomic physics authority Joliot and others praised it highly. The institute did not urge him to return to the country, because the domestic research equipment is certainly not as perfect as the research institutes in Europe. (2) There is no doubt that the Soviet Union can now manufacture atomic bombs. If the Soviet Union cannot manufacture them, then we cannot understand. The research on atomic energy has been kept secret by various countries since 1939. At that time, Germany, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain had all achieved considerable results. Scientists do not need to exchange experimental reports, and in fact, they can invent each other. The performance and power of the atomic bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima is nothing less than an encouragement or stimulus to Soviet scientists. Today, two years have passed, and it is not surprising that the Soviet Union can manufacture atomic bombs. The Soviet Union's political system is conducive to concentrating manpower and material resources to carry out this specialized experiment, and their original intention and vigilance also prompted them to engage in the manufacture of atomic bombs. As for France, science is also very prosperous, but we may not dare to assert that it can manufacture atomic bombs, because the political system, economic system and other conditions are very different from those of the Soviet Union. (3) Atomic energy will certainly be applied to general industries in the future. Atomic energy experts are currently conducting various experiments in this area, but the problem is not so simple. Even from the perspective of pure science, atomic energy can be applied to industry, but whether it is implemented depends on the decision of entrepreneurs and the political system and economic system at the time. (4) The appearance of "flying saucers" is an unconscious manifestation of human fear. Since the invention of the atomic bomb, all mankind has been in danger.

### Chief Chen Inspects Kaiyuan; The Northeast Headquarters Expands Its Organization; The Commander's Offices Will Be Set Up in Shenyang, Changchun, and Longjiang

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 10th] The expansion of the organization of the Northeast Headquarters is actively underway. It is reported that the Headquarters will set up three Pacification Commander's Offices, namely Shenyang, Changchun, and Longjiang. The candidate for the Director of Longjiang is Ma Zhanshan, and the others are not yet known.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 10th] Chief Chen Cheng, accompanied by Zheng Dongguo and Zhou Fucheng, went to Kaiyuan for inspection at 9:00 AM on the 10th and returned to Shenyang on the same day.

[United Press, Beiping, 10th] Shenyang electric report: Chief of Staff General Chen Cheng has personally arranged to defend against the most intense offensive of the Northeast Communists in the autumn. Chen is busy presiding over military conferences. If the Communist army attacks again, he may personally command the battle. The National Army has made considerable progress in Jilin and has crossed the Songhua River into the Communist army area. However, the Communist army that withdrew from Siguping has not escaped far and is now re-gathering in Siping and near Changchun.

[United Press, Shenyang, 10th] The victory or defeat of the National Army in the sixth offensive launched by the Northeast Communist Army in the future is enough to determine the fate of the national military. Informed sources in China said that this was the theme of the sudden arrival of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng a few days ago and his evening talk with Special Envoy Wei Te-mai. The Northeast military authorities have made resolute preparations for the offensive. The military and political affairs here will be unified under the command of Chief Chen, with Zheng Dongguo, Commander of the Northeast Security, as his deputy. Once the affairs in North China come to an end, troops will be transferred from Shandong to strengthen the defense here. The unification of the military and political affairs is an essential step to remedy the existing shortcomings. However, the overall mechanism is still very weak, and it must be presided over by a strong person to cope with the future offensive of the Communist army. The war in the Northeast is currently silent, and it is unusually peaceful here. Only the sound of artillery testing can be heard remotely in the suburbs at night. The curfew time has also been extended from 10:00 PM to 11:30 PM. However, all life is still serious.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, arrived in Beiping by plane from Shanghai at 1:30 PM on the 10th. On the 11th and 12th, he will fly to Changchun to participate in the memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the New First Army held in Changchun on August 13th.

### Military and Political Conference Held in Beiping to Discuss Ways to Simplify the Organization

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 10th] The Beiping Headquarters held military and political conferences on the evening of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, presided over by Li Zongren. Participants included the newly appointed Deputy Director Wu Qiwei, Chief of Staff Xu Qiming, Sun Lianzhong, Director of the Baoding Pacification Office and Chairman of Hebei Province, Deputy Directors Chen Jicheng and Song Kentang, Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, and Fu Zuoyi, Director of the Zhangyuan Pacification Office and Chairman of Chahar Province, who rushed over at 7:00 PM last night. Zhu Ke participated late, and had a long private conversation with Li Zongren until late at night. It is said that Fu returned to Zhangyuan by plane at 3:00 PM on the 10th. The Beiping Headquarters continued to hold a meeting on the morning of the 10th, presided over by Chief Secretary Xiao Yishan. Participants included Shi Delin, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, Song Kentang, Deputy Director of the Baoding Pacification Office, Deng Jiyu, Secretary-General of the Beiping Municipal Government, Liang Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Government, Li Teng, Director of the Zhangyuan Pacification Office in Beiping, and Su Ting, Director of the Education Department of the Suiyuan Provincial Government. At the leaders' meeting last night, the division of powers between the headquarters and the pacification offices was discussed in detail, and it was decided to strengthen the supervisory power of the headquarters. At the same time, research was also conducted on the coordination of military and political affairs and the simplification of the organization, and five principles were determined. On the morning of the 10th, the chiefs of staff of the provinces and cities continued to study the specific ways to simplify the organization and rectify financial problems. It is reported that Li Zongren received instructions from the highest authorities in Nanjing to adjust and simplify the military and political organizations in the north.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th] Director Fu Zuoyi returned to Zhangyuan by official plane from Beiping at 4:40 PM on the 10th.

### The Communist Bandits Are Obviously Traitorous; Usurping the Title of the Chinese Soviet People's Republic; Cadres Are Being "Purged" and Fleeing One After Another

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 10th] The Communist bandits are usurping the title of the Chinese Soviet People's Republic, and important documents and foreign propaganda have been changed accordingly. The so-called Northwest Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will be set up in Ximatigou, Suide. Communist bandit cadres captured in western Shanxi confessed: The bandits' current method of struggle is to kill landlords and overthrow owner-peasants. Even landlords and gentry who are impoverished and driven by the bandits will eventually be killed. In Heshun and Liaoxian, the Communist bandits force women to go barefoot and stipulate that whoever wears socks will be struggled against.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The Communist bandits in northern Songjiang have clearly announced their betrayal of the motherland and ordered the people in northern Songjiang to tear up the flag of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth and change to the Soviet flag. This was compared to the news obtained by a certain agency in the interim listening to the Harbin Xinhua News Agency radio station. The Communist bandits held a meeting of the pseudo-Northeast Administrative Committee in Harbin on August 1. Bandit leaders Lin Feng, Lu Zhengcao, Chen Yun, Zhang Xueji, Tang Kai, and Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China, who had just returned to Harbin from North Korea, attended the meeting. They decided to arm the "liberated areas," arm the people's spirit, and arm the people's property, and expand the military recruitment movement. After the meeting, they telegraphed the Soviet Union to thank them for their "many aids." The decision to change the national flag was also included. Previously, in the Siping campaign, the "Labor Hero" badge captured by the National Army from the Communist bandits was painted with the Soviet Red Star and the sickle and hammer.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th] The Communist bandits' "purge" has affected cadres. It is reported that in Guoxian, northern Shanxi, no less than hundreds of middle and lower-level cadres of the Communist bandits have been purged by their superiors. One Liu, a villager of Nanmai, had been running a cooperative for the bandits in Jingle for ten years. Because he had accumulated a little wealth, he was coveted by his superiors, who used the name of poverty to launch a purge struggle against him. Recently, he committed suicide out of anger because he could not bear the humiliation, which caused uneasiness among the middle and lower-level cadres of the bandits, who fled one after another. Fearing that their fragile lives could not last until tomorrow morning, they became suspicious, and "flying saucers" and "airplanes" filled the sky. As for whether it was originally a meteorite or some kind of aircraft, it is not important. What is reflected here is the most important significance of human fear. Finally, Mr. Yan elaborated on whether the United Nations should control Japan's research on atomic energy. Mr. Yan believes that even if Japan is given full freedom to research atomic energy, Japan does not have to bury itself in research. The national character of the country values practicality most, and scientists will concentrate their efforts to study some more urgent problems. Also, their narrow-mindedness may often turn their thoughts to retaliating against the United States in the future, but they may not plan to retaliate with atomic bombs.

### Mongol Bandits Invade on Two Routes, Attempting to Attack Tumurtay

Yulin Airfield Has Been Recovered

[This newspaper, Suiyuan, 9th] On the morning of the 8th, Mongol bandits attacked Gehuasizhao, 20 miles northeast of Tumurtay, in two routes. They have been driven by the National Army to a location two miles southeast of Gehuasizhao, and are now awaiting subsequent troops, with a major offensive planned against Tumurtay Heqigang. Also, they launched an attack from Honggeertu on the National Army, and the Mongol bandits were repelled at Wayaogou. Uleji Aosuer burned Shangdu Tunken Township and then fled to Shang Wangfu.

[This newspaper, Gui Sui, 9th] Today, there is no change in the situation at Qing Shuihe, Youwang. Three hundred bandits were discovered 20 miles south of Zuoyun City on the evening of the 7th, and they set fire to five villages before fleeing.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 10th] On the 5th, Communist bandit Wang Zhen led five brigades and briefly occupied the airfield outside the south gate of Yulin, causing damage. Now the garrison in Yulin has counterattacked and recovered the airfield, and aircraft can now land.

### Jilin's Defense Capabilities Strengthened, Hada Bay Airfield Completed

[This newspaper, Changchun, 10th] Military News Agency reports: The Jilin Hada Bay Airfield, which began construction one month ago, has now been completed and a completion ceremony was held on the 9th.

[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 10th] Liang Huasheng, Chairman of Jilin Province, told reporters in a firm tone: "Jilin's defense capabilities have been greatly strengthened. Before the completion of the Communist bandits' sixth offensive, our army can launch an attack at any time." The Jilin Changyi Volunteer Army has been formed under widespread military education, with a strength of over 50,000 people.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 10th] Communist bandits in the northern Jilin area seem to be reinforcing for a counterattack, and small battles are occurring everywhere. However, the bandits are all new recruits and are defeated with a single blow. The bandit troops in Fengkou Tun, Xiaoguang Tun and other places have all been severely attacked by the National Army and fled back.

### Lu's 8th District Commissioner Zhang Tianzuo Receives Great Merit

The Chairman Also Awarded 100 Million Yuan

[This newspaper, Qingdao, 10th] Weixian telegram: Zhang Tianzuo, Commissioner of the 8th District, led his troops to support the National Army in relieving the siege of Linqu and recovering Yidu, making great contributions. Chairman Jiang sent a special telegram of condolences, recording a major meritorious service and awarding 100 million legal currency.

### Black Communist Aircraft Attack Qingdao, Possibly Flying from Lushun-Dalian, Plains War in Shandong Province Underway

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Well-informed sources here do not deny the report of Communist aircraft bombing Qingdao, and said: Communist aircraft attacks are not the first. Before this, Linyi, Tengxian, and other places have been attacked. The Communist army has concentrated more than 160 aircraft in Lushun-Dalian, which were received from the Japanese by a certain party. Also, Xin Yourui, Director of the Air Defense Department of the Air Force Headquarters (not the Army Headquarters), has been ordered to inspect the national air defense, and a group of more than ten people has arrived in Beiping. According to a Beiping dispatch reported here on the 10th, "Qingdao Airport was attacked by black aircraft, and four bombs landed at the airport, which did not explode and caused no damage. It is estimated that it may be Communist aircraft flying from Lushun-Dalian, or it may be for propaganda purposes. Officials claim that there is absolutely no problem with the air defense in North China, and even if aircraft from outside the Communist bandits attack, they will be repelled."

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Chairman Sun Dao stated that he had not heard of the strange aircraft bombing Qingdao Airport on the 9th as reported in Chinese newspapers. Also, the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense confirmed on the afternoon of the 10th that an unidentified black aircraft bombed Qingdao Airport on the 9th. The spokesperson initially said he had no information, but then agreed to investigate the details. He later said that the incident did occur, but he had not yet learned the details. Another neutral military source here, who should have known about this matter, claimed that he had no knowledge of the Qingdao bombing.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 10th] The situation of the National Army in Shandong is gradually developing. In the past week, about 5,500 square kilometers of land have been recovered, totaling 52,000 square kilometers, with 85,000 square kilometers still in the hands of the Communists. The mountain warfare has ended, and the plains war is now underway. The remnants of six columns and seven thousand troops of the Communist bandits who collapsed in the mountainous area have retreated to the area north of the Jiaoji Railway and south of the Xiaoqing River, around Linzi, Guangrao, Shangao, Yuanyi, and Zhangdian, where they are being reorganized. The wounded soldiers, factories, and machinery have been transported to the north bank of the Yellow River. The Zichuan and Boshan mining areas have been without electricity for many days, and the machinery seems to have been transported away. In the area west of the Grand Canal in western Shandong and south of the Yellow River, there are about 40,000 remnants of Chen Yi's troops and about 50,000 remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops. The National Army is now besieging them from the east, west, and south, reaching four kilometers east of Yuncheng and seven kilometers south of Liangshan. The western front has also reached Liuzhuang, coordinating with the air force for a fierce attack. It is expected that the Communist bandits in western Shandong can be largely annihilated after the next battle.

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army, advancing northwest from Jinxiang in western Shandong, formally recovered Juye at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. On the 10th, they continued to mop up the remnants of Liu Bocheng's 23rd Column and Independent Brigade in the suburbs.

### Jakarta Chinese General Association Issues Appeal, Curbing Indonesian Military Atrocities, Overseas Chinese in Java and Other Places Are Being Massacred

[Central News Agency, Jakarta, 9th] This Jakarta Chinese General Association broadcast today, asking the world's press, the Chairman and members of the United Nations, and people's organizations around the world to work together to stop the atrocities of the Indonesian military in Java and Sumatra, who are killing overseas Chinese. [[United Press, Batavia, 9th] Hong Yuan (transliteration), Chairman of the Chinese General Association, a Chinese overseas group in the Dutch East Indies, broadcast today that the withdrawal of Dutch troops from the occupied areas of Java and Sumatra would lead to the slaughter of thousands of overseas Chinese by Indonesians, and asked the United Nations to urge the Indonesian government to release the thousands of overseas Chinese who have been captured by Indonesia. Hong had previously telegraphed the Security Council to take immediate steps to protect the minorities in the Indonesian Republic. It is estimated that there are now about two million overseas Chinese in the East Indies. Since the outbreak of the Dutch-Indonesian war, Dutch and Chinese officials have reported the killing of overseas Chinese by Indonesians from time to time. According to Hong, since the Japanese surrender, overseas Chinese have often been murdered, robbed, despised, and exploited by Indonesians. A year ago, 1,831 overseas Chinese were killed in Tanggerang. Since the recent outbreak of war, many overseas Chinese have been killed in Sumatra, where sixty overseas Chinese were locked in a house and burned alive, and some children were beheaded in Malang, Java. The Indonesian Republic in Java and Sumatra has often proven unable to control its troops, and the lives and property of overseas Chinese are still threatened. He asked the United Nations not to make a hasty decision on the Indonesian issue before listening to the statements of the overseas Chinese, and demanded that Indonesia compensate the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese.

Other photos showed unimaginable heinous acts. At least five of them could not be identified by their relatives. One of the victims was wearing a red dress when he was killed, and the genitals of several male victims were also cut off. A husband and wife died embracing each other.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today solemnly denied the broadcast by Radio Jogjakarta in the Indonesian Republic accusing overseas Chinese of assisting the Dutch army in capturing Cirebon and Tegal, calling it "malicious propaganda, which is absolutely not true."

### Yingde Bridge Train Plunges into River Tragedy, Guangdong Provincial Assembly Releases Investigation Report, Estimated Deaths at Over 200

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] After the tragedy of the train plunging into the river at Yingde Bridge on the Yuehan Railway on July 14, people in society paid great attention to the responsibility and the number of deaths. In order to understand the truth, the Provincial Assembly and the Journalists Association, the Architects Association, and other groups formed an investigation team to Yingde. The investigation has now been completed, and its report was officially released by the Provincial Assembly, determining that the cause of the accident was indeed the bridge breaking and the train falling. Regarding the number of passengers and casualties, the report stated that the total number of passengers should be more than 400. The number of safe people and the number of injured reported by the Railway Bureau are still based, but the number of deaths is only calculated based on the number of recovered dead bodies, which is not accurate. According to the injured, the village chief of Nangang, and the residents of local boatmen and Niuweishan, more than a hundred corpses and broken limbs floated down the river afterward. The estimated number of deaths is often more than 200. The report finally pointed out that the railway's engineering equipment is incomplete. Due to the urgent post-war recovery, limited by time and material difficulties, everything was done simply, the vehicles were used for too long, and the telecommunications equipment was insufficient. The Ministry of Communications must seek remedies immediately and improve them quickly to ensure the safety of passengers and goods. The report also strongly condemned the illegal behavior of the garrison troops when the train fell into the river, and believed that the Railway Bureau, the garrison troops, and the local government were all responsible for the case.

### Editorial: The Alertness of the American People

The American magazine *Newsweek* recently published an editorial advocating direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to resolve the disputes between the two countries around the world. The reasoning was: "If we are to avoid another world war, the only way is for the United States and the Soviet Union to negotiate directly. The Soviet Union has certain intentions and ambitions. The problems in Korea, Austria, and Germany are secondary, just part of the overall problem. But the main problem is how the United States and the Soviet Union will coexist peacefully in this world?" As for the method of direct negotiation, the magazine called on Secretary of State Marshall, Vandenberg, and Byrnes to form a delegation to meet with Stalin in Moscow to discuss a comprehensive plan to adjust the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. We know that *Newsweek* is the most powerful conservative publication in the United States. The suggestion of direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union at this moment can be regarded as the alertness of the American people. It not only shows that the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has evolved to the point of exhaustion, but also proves the seriousness of the world situation today.

Since the end of World War II, it has been exactly two full years. The evolution of international politics in the past two years has not only completely shattered the ideal world that people yearned for during the war, turning it into a mirage, but it is also completely different from what people expected after the war. We are all disappointed in the face of this crisis-ridden world. In particular, the American government and the public are worried about the evolution of the world situation in the future. *Newsweek*'s editor David Lawrence suddenly proposed the suggestion of direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This is the precursor to a change in the attitude of American public opinion towards the Soviet Union. Our research into the reasons for this change is due to the following factors:

First, the surfacing of the dollar panic in Britain and France has deepened the European economic crisis, which will threaten US exports. The trade situation in June and July of this year has already shown a downward trend. If this continues to deteriorate, it may cause an economic panic in the United States in 1948. The arrival of this economic panic can be said to be unanimously feared by the American government and the public. Therefore, before it arrives, the United States must do everything possible to try to save the economic crisis in European countries.

Second, Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan are both doomed to failure due to the Soviet Union's resolute opposition and unwillingness to compromise. The true meaning of the Truman Doctrine is that the United States uses its dollar diplomacy to assist weak countries in the world to prevent the intrusion of Soviet forces. However, the result of American aid to Greece and Turkey has promoted the coup d'état in Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland, making the division of Europe into Eastern and Western Europe more obvious. However, Eastern and Central Europe, under the control of the Soviet Union, have made significant progress in industrial recovery, which is a major blow to the prestige of the United States. On the contrary, in Western European countries, due to the dollar panic in Britain and France, a very serious economic crisis has been created. Secretary of State Marshall saw this situation and, in order to avoid the division of Europe, proposed a plan to aid European economic recovery. However, the result of the Paris conference was that not only did the Soviet Union refuse to participate, but also all countries controlled by the Soviet Union were unwilling to accept American aid with conditions. Although Britain and France want to proceed alone, the economic crisis in the two countries is becoming increasingly serious, which is another major blow to Marshall's aid to Europe plan.

Third, although the United States has continuously exerted pressure on the Soviet Union under the banner of the Truman Doctrine, it has encountered strong resistance from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union exercises its veto power on any important issue, causing the United States and the Soviet Union to fall into a stalemate. Not only can the problem of Europe not be resolved, but also the deadlock in the Far East cannot be broken. For example, on the German issue, because the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference ended unhappily, the German peace treaty failed to be negotiated. The United States then changed its goal and attempted to build Germany first, originally wanting to raise Germany's production level, but it was met with strong opposition from France. If France cannot suppress the opinions of the left wing, then France's opposition will be even stronger. Another example is the Japanese issue. The United States advocated convening a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty. The Soviet Union has expressed its refusal. Even if the United States abandons the Soviet Union and proceeds alone, other problems will arise between the United States and other countries. At present, China, Britain, the Philippines, Australia, Canada, and other countries have mostly expressed that they are not completely satisfied with the US policy toward Japan.

Therefore, the United States today is facing such a serious world crisis and should think deeply, adopt a wise policy that will benefit both itself and others once and for all, so that the post-war world can safely overcome this major difficulty. Otherwise, if it allows the overall situation to develop naturally without trying to save it, the ending will eventually threaten the peace and prosperity of the United States.

### The Soviet Union Closes the Port of Dalian

The US Information Service yesterday issued a message saying that the US State Department has confirmed that the Soviet Union notified the US authorities in March of this year that Dalian had become a closed port under military administration. Therefore, since March, US naval vessels have no longer entered Dalian. After this news was released, the American newspapers attached great importance to it and expressed indignation. Among them, the *World Telegram* refuted the Soviet Union's reasoning, saying: "The Soviet Union arbitrarily distorts the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, claiming that before the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, the Soviet Union can permanently maintain its military control over Dalian. According to this, the Soviet Union only needs to refuse to sign the Japanese peace treaty, and it can control Dalian forever." At the same time, according to the Associated Press, the US State Department is also very indignant at the Soviet Union's illegal behavior and plans to protest to the Soviet government in the shortest possible time.

Regarding the Dalian issue, the US government issued instructions to the embassies in China and the Soviet Union on January 3 of this year, notifying the governments of China and the Soviet Union to quickly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty on Dalian so that Dalian could resume normal status under the administration of the Chinese government. China has also repeatedly negotiated with the Soviet Union on the issue of receiving Dalian. However, the Soviet Union has adopted a delaying policy, repeatedly perfunctory, and has no sincerity in returning Dalian to China. Whether in terms of legal principles or in terms of affection and righteousness, the Soviet Union has no reason to refuse to return Dalian to China. In theory, after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the Soviet Union should have returned Dalian to China. However, the Soviet Union insisted that Dalian was still in a state of war with Japan and that the Soviet Union could not transfer Dalian to China until after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty. This unreasonable argument is really not worth arguing, and it almost makes people suspect that the Soviet Union's foreign affairs authorities do not even have a little common sense of international justice. So what is the Soviet Union's intention? Clear-sighted people can see it at a glance? There is no need to elaborate. Dalian Mayor Long Xuesui told reporters in Beijing in February of this year about the issue of receiving Dalian, saying: "Recently, the municipal government sent people to Dalian for inspection. There are 40,000 to 50,000 CCP troops in the city, and the Soviet army is not stationed in the city. Therefore, the issue of receiving Dalian depends entirely on the CCP army. If only a few people are sent, they cannot be received. If troops are sent to cooperate, a conflict with the CCP army will inevitably occur."

Although the United States has long paid attention to the Dalian issue, a note will not be effective if it is not followed by diplomatic action. Moreover, the Soviet Union closed Dalian in March. Why did the United States remain silent at that time? Why is it only being released now? Therefore, the United States must bear considerable responsibility for the development of the situation in the Far East to this day due to its diplomatic inaction. We only hope that the US authorities will change their style from now on and make decisive decisions on everything. The so-called "preventing problems before they arise" must never miss the opportunity!

### The Significance of Muslim Pilgrimage Sites

(Continued from the first page)

At present, Islam abroad has a vigorous revival. The Arab League has long been established, and the autonomous territories of India and Pakistan have recently been born. Egypt hopes to create the unity of the Nile River basin and is competing with Britain. The Republic of Indonesia (Muslims account for more than 90% of the total population) holds a scorched earth policy and is determined to fight the Netherlands to the death. Turkey, in this World War, remained neutral between the two great powers and served as a barrier to the Mediterranean, greatly assisting the United Nations. Even Morocco in French Africa has a movement for independence. The trend is turbulent and difficult to contain. The Islam in our country may have a response and a new movement. At the same time, foreign forces are politically enticing the Muslims in the border provinces. There are now six small Muslim republics in the Soviet Union outside Xinjiang Province, with a total of 30 million Muslims. Their material construction, cultural level, and living standards are all higher than those of the Muslims in Xinjiang Province. This kind of attraction is really frightening. I hope that the government authorities will have a broad vision and set policies early, promote their cultural undertakings, and increase all their welfare for the domestic Muslims in the future. For example, the excellent treatment given to the pilgrimage group this time will undoubtedly receive great results. It is hoped that the economy will improve in the future, foreign exchange will be relaxed, and a large pilgrimage group will be organized by the government every year, and they will be welcomed to Beijing early to stay for a considerable period of time. Scholars should be invited to explain to them the general situation of foreign countries, the situation of domestic politics, and the responsibilities of the people every day, and they should be allowed to put forward suggestions on Islam, which will be adopted by the government. This will definitely create a great centripetal force for Muslims towards the government.

This time, the pilgrimage group has a total of 40 people, more than half of whom are from Xinjiang Province, including one female. The oldest is Xinjiang Aibudula Da Mullah, 79 years old, and 19 people are over 60 years old. The youngest is Xinjiang Abudurexit, only 16 years old. Among them, the most prestigious people are briefly listed as follows:

(1) The above-mentioned Aibudula Da Mullah is from Kashi District, Xinjiang, of Uyghur ethnicity, knowledgeable and respected, and highly admired by the local co-religionists. His national concept is also very strong. This year is his second pilgrimage in his life. Chairman Maisut specially allocated a special plane to take him from Ili to Dihua, and then fly directly to the capital.

(2) Naizeer Da Achong (ie, Da Imam) is from Dihua District, Xinjiang, of Uyghur ethnicity, 73 years old this year. He has served as a member of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, a member of the Political Affairs Committee, and other important positions. He is loyal to his duties, has excellent character and academics, and is respected and loved by the general co-religionists. He is currently the Imam of Dihua District.

(3) Muhammad Ali is from Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, 65 years old this year, proficient in Arabic, especially good at reading the scriptures. He has stayed in various countries in the Near East for more than ten years. He is currently hired by Chairman Ma of Qinghai as the Da Imam of Xining."

The pilgrimage group is scheduled to take a boat to Hong Kong on the 13th of this year, change to a Blue Funnel Line ship to sail to Jeddah on the Red Sea, which is the gateway to Arabia. After landing, they will take a long-distance bus to Mecca, rest for a while, and then participate in the pilgrimage ceremony.

The newspapers in Tokyo have also published articles about the pilgrimage group. Because it is dictated on the one hand and recorded on the other, there are many discrepancies with the facts, which are often read by Muslims with dissatisfaction. As a Muslim, the author knows more accurately, and in order to seek the truth, I have written a few lines to contribute to non-Muslim readers.

Islam has four main teachings, called the Four Pillars: (1) Prayer: From dawn to early night every day, pray to God five times, at fixed times, and everyone must gather in the mosque to hold it together. (2) Fasting: In the ninth month of the Islamic calendar every year, you must fast for a month, starting at dawn, and absolutely not eating or drinking. Break the fast at sunset, and you can eat as usual. (3) Zakat: Those who have accumulated money to a certain amount must give one-fortieth of it to the poor every year, called Zakat. Other products also have Zakat, but the donation rate is lower. (4) Pilgrimage: You must go to Mecca for pilgrimage once in your life. Those who do not have enough financial resources or are sick can be exempted. Each has its own meaning, but due to space limitations, it cannot be described in detail. Now I will only describe the pilgrimage.

Pilgrimage, translated from Arabic as "Hajj", is traditionally called "Chao Hajj" by Muslims in our country, which is read as "Chao Han Zhi". Han Zhi is the name of the province, and Mecca is the capital of the province. The use of the term "pilgrimage group" this time has caused many misunderstandings, thinking that what is being visited is the tomb of the Prophet Muhammad. In fact, the Prophet is buried in Medina, which is quite a distance from Mecca. Pilgrims who are wealthy may go to visit by the way, but it is not within the etiquette of the pilgrimage. The so-called "pilgrimage" is actually a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. Because Mecca has the relics of ancient saints and is the birthplace of Islam, it is called the holy city. The ancient site is an ancient building, called "Kaaba" by Arabs and "Heavenly House" by Muslims in our country. According to the Quran, God ordered the ancient saint Ibrahim (ie, Abraham in the Old Testament Genesis) and his son to build the ancient room, which became the first place in the world to worship the Lord. There are also two small mountains, one called Safa and the other called Marwa, about 420 meters apart. When the Prophet Muhammad's ancestor Isma'il was held by his mother and entered Arabia for the first time, and reached between the two small mountains, the water in the leather bag he was carrying was completely drunk, so his mother circled the two small mountains to find water, and finally found it, so that the mother and son could quench their thirst and avoid dying of thirst under the scorching sun. The Heavenly House and the two small mountains had long been revered as holy sites before the establishment of Islam.

Pilgrims must arrive in Mecca before the seventh day of the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, that is, bathe and cleanse themselves, and change into the clothes of abstinence. The clothes of abstinence are two pieces of white cloth, not sewn, wrapped around the whole body, and no hat is worn on the head. The clothes usually worn, as well as all ornaments, must be removed. Women must not use cosmetics. Because pilgrimage means to abandon all the superficiality of the world and dedicate oneself to God. Pilgrims first go to the Kaaba, that is, the Heavenly House, and circle it seven times, and kiss a small black stone inlaid on the wall to show their sincerity in loving God. (2) After performing a short prayer in the Heavenly House, they run between the two small mountains mentioned above to express their perseverance. On the seventh day, everyone gathers to listen to the meaning of the pilgrimage. On the eighth day, the official ceremony begins, and everyone enters the Mina Valley (about six miles north of Mecca) to spend the night. On the ninth day, they advance to the Arafat Plain and Mount Arafat, about five miles further north, to commemorate the reunion of Adam and Eve after they were separated. The tenth day is Eid al-Adha. Each pilgrim slaughters an animal in the Mina Valley, symbolizing their willingness to sacrifice themselves for God. The slaughtered animals are distributed to the nearby poor, and seven stones are thrown to express their rejection of evil. Then the ceremony is completed, and the clothes of abstinence can be removed and the usual clothes can be changed. After that, you can stay for two or three days, and then set off back home.

For these etiquettes, they do not hesitate to travel thousands of miles through the dust, and this year, the sixth month of the Chinese lunar calendar is the month of Ramadan, and they endure hunger and thirst every day from morning to evening on the long journey of pilgrimage. Moreover, Mecca is located in the tropics, and the weather is very hot. During the few days of the ceremony, they walk bareheaded under the scorching sun. Old people in their seventies and eighties can endure this kind of hardship. Their enthusiasm for respecting God and their perseverance can be regarded as unparalleled in the world.

Therefore, in the languages of various countries, the term "Mecca" is used as a metaphor for "a place to which all people are inclined" or "the birthplace of faith, policies, great undertakings, etc." (End)

### The Labour Party's Internal Opinions Cannot Be Unanimous: The British Government Faces a Crisis; The Issue of Steel Nationalization Is the Most Important; Labour MPs Will Hold a Special Meeting Today for Secret Review

[Reuters, London, 10th] The Labour Party is now facing the most serious threat of internal division in its two years in power. Attlee and his cabinet are now facing opposition from both the left and right wings. The right-wing Conservative Party and Liberal Party have formed a united front to oppose the emergency powers to guide manpower requested by the Labour Party. On the left, some members of the Labour Party have expressed stronger protests than last year when they opposed Bevin's foreign policy. About 400 Labour MPs are scheduled to meet on Monday to question Attlee and his advisors on three issues: demanding more troop reductions, adopting a more powerful design to concentrate national manpower and resources on production industries, and most importantly, demanding that the government fully implement the Labour Party's steel nationalization plan. Minister of Health Bevin has recently emerged as the leader of the left wing. He has made it clear that he is absolutely opposed to any concessions on the steel nationalization plan, and the newspaper report that he would resign if he did not achieve his goal has not been denied by Bevin to this day. The issue of steel nationalization has gradually become an indication of whether the government will make concessions in the implementation of its livelihood policy or move more aggressively. Therefore, Labour backbenchers attach great importance to this issue. Any decision made by the government on the steel nationalization plan will affect the entire approach to coping with the economic crisis. Among the key government ministers, only Commerce Secretary and Economic Design Officer Cripps has maintained his reputation in the face of the division of opinions within the Labour Party. The left wing accuses Foreign Secretary Bevin of being one of the strongest opponents of troop reductions, and Privy Council President Morrison is accused of delaying the implementation of the steel nationalization plan.

[United Press, London, 9th] Prime Minister Attlee was accused by the Conservative Party today of seeking "totalitarianism" in dealing with the British economic crisis. At the same time, new disputes have arisen within the Labour Party over the government's nationalization plan. It is heard that some cabinet members are opposed to implementing the steel nationalization plan in this time of economic danger, so a special secret meeting of Labour MPs has been convened.

[Associated Press, London, 10th] According to reliable diplomatic sources, the British Labour government will withdraw British troops stationed in Italy and Greece within a month to save the British economic crisis. The source said: According to unofficial estimates, there are about 10,000 to 15,000 British troops stationed in Italy, and Britain will withdraw them regardless of whether the peace treaty with Italy is absorbed or implemented. Left-wing liberals have put pressure on the Labour government to withdraw troops stationed in Greece, and the number of British troops stationed in Greece has now been reduced to more than 5,000. It is also reported that Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to broadcast to the nation at 8:15 pm on the 10th, asking the nation to work hard during this economic period.

### Britain, the United States, and France Will Hold a Meeting to Review the German Industrial Standard, but It Will Not Affect the British-American Ruhr Coal Production Meeting

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall has agreed to hold a meeting of Britain, France, and the United States as soon as possible to discuss the German industrial standard and the coal issue. Marshall's decision was informed to the French government by the US Ambassador to Britain today, and a copy was given to Ballantyne, the British Chargé d'Affaires in Washington.

Marshall's note to the French government said: "The United States government is prepared to agree to convene a meeting of representatives of the United States, Britain, and France without delay to discuss the plan to revise the German industrial standard, so that the French opinion can be taken into account before the plan is finally adopted by the British and American governments, and to study and explain the goal of the plan. Regarding the management and control of the Ruhr coal mine, the United States government is also prepared to accept and discuss the French government's opinion with the governments of Britain and France. The French government will be notified of the suggestion to hold discussions on the German industrial standard and the management and control of the Ruhr coal mine." A State Department spokesman said: The date and location of this meeting will be announced later. The representatives attending the meeting will not be cabinet members, but it is hoped that the French government can soon send senior experts to Washington. He also stated that the plan to convene a three-nation meeting will not hinder the British-American Ruhr coal production meeting scheduled for Tuesday. Marshall's note indicated that he had accepted France's protest against the German industrial standard plan agreed upon by Britain and the United States. Marshall acknowledged that he had received a note from French Ambassador Bonnet, in which he stated that the French government attached great importance to the German issue. He also revealed that he had informed Paris on July 21 that he would postpone the announcement of the German industrial plan until the French government had a reasonable opportunity to express its opinion. At that time, Marshall had said that he was exchanging opinions with Foreign Secretary Bevin on this issue, and Bevin replied that the British government was considering the entire issue. From this, it can be seen that Marshall's note to France today has the complete agreement of the British government. A State Department spokesman added: There are currently no plans to include France in next Tuesday's British-American Ruhr coal production meeting.

### American Film Merchants Hope the State Department Will Assist in Forcing Britain to Change Its Tax Policy

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] It is reported that representatives of Hollywood British film merchants will meet with State Department officials so that the State Department can support the film merchants' position and force the British government to change its policy of levying 75% of film income tax. Observers believe that the emergency embargo measures announced by Johnston, President of the Motion Picture Association of America, yesterday are intended to intimidate Britain and force it to change its original intention. The extension of the embargo is a major blow to the American film industry, and it will have to greatly reduce the production of Hollywood and only produce cheap films.

### Austin Advocates That the Veto Power Must Not Be Abused

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Austin, the US chief representative to the United Nations, broadcast today that the United Nations does not need to change its charter to solve various world problems. Austin is convinced that the charter does not need to be amended, but believes that the charter is not a static tool, but an active organism. He said that the main thing we want to end is in this respect. This is not a question of the use of the veto power, but a question of the abuse of the veto power, so the level of Internet ethics must be promoted and raised. Another US representative to the United Nations, Dulles, recently requested a reduction in the five veto powers of the Security Council. It is generally believed that Austin's statement today further indicates that the United States may propose amending the use of the five veto powers at the future United Nations General Assembly, but regardless of the actual amendment of the charter. Dulles once stated that the veto power should not be used for administrative affairs.

### Statement from the Republic of Indonesia: Willing to Accept Mediation by the U.S. and Australia; Sends Note to the Security Council Accusing the Netherlands of Violating the Ceasefire

[Reuters, London, 9th] Radio Yogyakarta broadcasted a letter from Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir to Australian Prime Minister Chifley, expressing gratitude and accepting Australia's willingness to participate in mediating the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The statement declared that the Indonesian government fully accepts the Australian government's proposal to participate in the Security Council's efforts to achieve a fair resolution of the Indonesian-Dutch dispute. The joint U.S.-Australian proposal for mediating the Indonesian dispute was put forward in the Security Council meeting last night.

[United Press, Batavia, 9th] The Republic of Indonesia sent a note to the Security Council stating that the Netherlands continues to engage in military activities with the aim of expanding its territory. Therefore, Republican troops have been forced to undertake pacification and defensive movements. Supported by aircraft and artillery, Dutch forces have occupied Huakir, approximately two miles south of Malang in East Java, and are attacking in several other locations. The Dutch forces violated the ceasefire order between August 1st and 8th, taking hostile actions intended to undermine the Republic of Indonesia's efforts to maintain a ceasefire. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out pacification and defensive movements in several locations to counter Dutch aggression and safeguard the Republic's position.

### Dutch Aggression More Thorough Than Japanese; Sjahrir Arrives in U.S. to Speak

[Reuters, New York, 9th] Former Prime Minister Sjahrir, Plenipotentiary Representative of the Republic of Indonesia, told reporters today that the recent Dutch offensive is more thorough than the Japanese invasion. This is a thorough, planned, and thoroughly executed real war. He also pointed out that Dutch forces used flamethrowers and heavy weapons, but could not specify where they were used. Sjahrir added that his arrival in New York was to make contact with the Indian and Australian delegations, who have already raised the Indonesian issue in the Security Council. Sjahrir said: "My government has already suggested that the Security Council immediately send a commission to Indonesia to determine whether both sides are adhering to the ceasefire order. The current dispute in Indonesia began with the Netherlands failing to fulfill its treaty obligations. We accept the U.S. mediation proposal because we believe the U.S. recognizes this as part of the Security Council's planned actions. We sincerely hope that the Security Council can appoint countries such as India and Australia, together with the U.S., to implement the measures deemed necessary by the Council." Sjahrir continued, saying that the Republic of Indonesia has retreated to the point before the Linggadjati Agreement was established and will demand the establishment of a sovereign state encompassing all of Indonesia, not merely the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. Sjahrir also stated that he does not intend to speak with representatives of the Dutch delegation to the United Nations. When reporters asked about his policy in future negotiations with the Netherlands, he said that if the Indonesian people can achieve independence in 1949, their goal can be achieved, and during the transition period, the Republic of Indonesia should have the right to normal existence.

A memorandum has been submitted to U.S. Ambassador to Greece, MacVeagh, detailing Greece's current dual problems: combating insurgents and post-war reconstruction. The memorandum states that guerrilla forces are very active and constantly receiving supplies from the north. Therefore, Greece urgently needs U.S. military equipment to seal the northern border and cut off external aid to the guerrillas.

[United Press, Athens, 9th] Military authorities confirmed on the 9th that Bulgarian troops have gathered on the Greek border, but did not disclose detailed information.

### Nehru Sympathizes with Indonesia; Reaffirms Asian "Monroe Doctrine"

[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] Indian Interim Government Foreign Minister Nehru declared here: "We must clearly state that we will never tolerate foreign troops operating within Asian territory. The governance of India has given some foreign countries an excuse to govern smaller, weaker nations in Asia. Some small countries, because of their location on the route from England to Asia, have come under British control. These countries will gradually escape the clutches of imperialism. The Netherlands has no right to retain troops or military power in Indonesia. I am, in principle, opposed to the troops of one country stationed in another country. The Netherlands, which was unable to protect itself a few years ago, should not have the right to become an imperialist power again. The success of the Indonesian people depends on their own strength."

### Germ Warfare Horrifying; Even Worse Than Atomic Warfare

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] If another world war were to occur and germ weapons were used, eleven pounds of diphtheria toxin could wipe out the entire population of the United States, estimated at 140 million. This terrifying prediction was published by Harvard University botany professor Sherman in an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

A third type, diphtheria toxin and other similar toxins produced by bacteria, would be even more lethal than atomic bombs. Predicting the horrors of germ warfare, he concluded that humans, as organic organisms dependent on other organisms for sustenance, can be destroyed biologically, along with their food.

### Committee for European Economic Cooperation Drafts Report Outline

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] After three and a half weeks of intense work, the outline of the report on the state of European resources and needs, drafted by the sixteen-nation Committee for European Economic Cooperation, will soon be clear. Most of the figures and information required to complete this report have been collected, and the remainder will arrive shortly. The members have intensified their work in compiling it. Officials are unwilling to make predictions about the future economic shape of Europe, as this largely depends on Germany's future industrial level. The Cooperation Committee can only roughly estimate the potential contribution of German steel supplies to the European economy. The final decision must be made by another body. In addition, an event that could assist the work of the Cooperation Committee and help alleviate the world's dollar shortage is the establishment of a rational monetary system in Germany, enabling Germany to pay for its imports. This event is also not within the purview of the Cooperation Committee. The Cooperation Committee is currently studying the possibility of making the currencies of the sixteen countries freely convertible. Germany's lack of a currency for external use will be a serious obstacle to this task.

[Report by this newspaper] There are a total of more than 20,000 Soviet overseas Chinese in this city, many of whom have had drifting lives and years of wandering, and have been running bars, cafes, and other businesses in Shanghai for more than ten years. Recently, the Soviet Union has been attracting overseas Chinese to return home in batches. The repatriation ship Ilyitch arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Yesterday, the first batch of Soviet overseas Chinese to board the ship numbered more than 1,000, half of whom were women. It is said that many had been unemployed for a long time. There were also some senior businessmen who had accumulated assets in Shanghai and voluntarily boarded the ship to return home.

The Ilyitch was originally a German oil tanker. After the war, it was classified as a reparations ship and incorporated into the Soviet Union, with a deadweight tonnage of 15,000 tons. The ship departed from Shanghai at 5:00 p.m. yesterday and sailed directly to Vladivostok. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai within a week to continue the repatriation work.

They have been in China for a long time and seemed quite saddened by this evacuation. In addition, most of the women and children changed into new clothes and waved farewell to those seeing them off on the pier from the railing. The people on the ship and the pier gazed at each other in the hot sun, silently, and the situation was very desolate. The meals on the ship were simple. At lunch, each person had only a black bread and a small amount of vegetarian dishes. When eating, the elderly often looked back at the Huangpu River and sighed. Other young people sat silently with their chins in their hands. When reporters inquired about the past struggles of staying in Shanghai and how they would live after returning home, they smiled and did not answer, only frequently expressing their reluctance to leave.

### Buying Cloth with Bounced Checks: Cotton Mill Fooled

[Our Newspaper's Report] A certain cotton mill (owner Luo Haoliang, 40 years old, from Ningbo) at No. 15 Zhengxing Lane, Guangdong Street, North Sichuan Road, was visited by a Yu Haokun (around 20 years old) at around 9 a.m. yesterday. He selected ten bolts of cotton cloth and immediately paid with a check from the Guofu Bank for 10.04 million national currency. He also instructed that the goods be quickly delivered to No. 7 Xiangyu Lane, South Sichuan Road.  The factory sent someone to deliver the goods to the address and then sent someone to the bank to cash the check. Unexpectedly, the check was returned. Only then did they realize they had been deceived. They reported the incident to the Huangpu Police Bureau, which dispatched officers to investigate.

### Staggering, Crowded, and Endless: A Cross-Section of Life at the Post Office Building

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Under the blazing sun, the green postal flag seemed to be panting as it faced the Suzhou Creek.

Inside this building, people sending letters were holding letters and anxiously searching for the window that could help them, and behind the windows, postal workers were constantly wiping sweat from their brows...

Amitabha, You Mustn't Touch It!

Suddenly, a monk squeezed into the "Registered Mail" window, solemnly pulling out a neatly sealed square package from his cassock.

"Great monk, what book is in this package?" the female postal worker inside the window asked kindly.

The monk put his hands together, palms touching: "This is a copy of the Diamond Sutra that this humble monk respectfully transcribed after washing my hands. I want to register it and send it to..." The female employee was about to take it to weigh it and determine the postage, but the monk immediately pulled back the package, shaking his head. "Amitabha, you mustn't touch it!" As a result, a male employee wiped his hands clean with a towel and respectfully accepted the mail item.

Four Words, Bold and Black: Urgent!

After the monk left contentedly, a man who looked like a country bumpkin came staggering up to the "Express Mail" window. He had a letter in his hand, one corner of which was charred, and two trembling chicken feathers were stuck on it. He anxiously and worriedly said to the window:

"This is an important letter. Please be sure to send it by 'Chicken Feather Express'!"

The postal workers were touched by the four large, black characters "Ten Thousand Fire Urgency" on his letter. They earnestly explained that there was no longer a "Chicken Feather Express" for postal delivery, but there was airmail that could travel a thousand miles a day. He gently assured the country man that the post office would deliver the letter to its destination as quickly as possible.

Lovers at Opposite Ends of the Earth: Where is the Beloved?

A letter from Gongcheng, Guangxi, had an incomplete address on the envelope: "Liu Yuxiang, No. 2424, Shanghai." There was also a letter from a Mr. Yang, perhaps a love letter. Probably because he was too nervous when writing it, the envelope only had the sweet and vague words "Miss He Xinglian, this city." Though the distance is near, it feels so far, where can these gentlemen and ladies be guided to? So these mails were all checked into a corner of the post office basement. Dark and cold, rows of rectangular wooden boxes display countless letters that have trekked over mountains and deep waters from faraway places. Inside there may be fragrant kisses from Guan Zhong, or warm comfort, anxious anticipation, or urgent appeals; now the postal workers share the fate of their reunion!

One Word Mistake, Searching in All Directions

Because of a one-word error on a letter, the post office must wander and search in the five directions of "East, South, West, North, and Center" of the seven Zhongzheng Roads and five Zhongshan Roads; or go to the "Extra-Settlement Roads" area to excavate among three road names and four house numbers; or go to Shanghai's two same-named Ningbo Roads, Huanghe Roads… to inquire; but many letters that were in critical despair are finally rescued.

A Bizarre Batch of Stolen Goods

There is also a large-scale second-hand stall in the post office. Although the source of these second-hand goods is not private property, it is indeed stolen goods. Thieves, after succeeding in the city, generously shove everything except money into the post box, as usual. So checks, keys, ID cards... flow steadily into the green lost-and-found counter every day, adding many bizarre and dazzling new "second-hand goods" to the post office. A Miss Xiang Hua from Sichuan was probably also a victim of pickpockets, so there are many photos of her and her lover here, filled with tender affection.

The Meaning of Green: Bamboo Announces Peace

An old accountant from a large Shanghai firm suddenly brought dozens of letters to post one day. The staff carefully read them and found that the dates on these letters were all from half a month ago. When asked about the reason, they learned that he had left them at home and forgotten about them for two weeks. The postal workers smiled wryly and said, "If the recipients don't know the truth, our express mailboxes, mobile post office vehicles, and all the hard work to improve the postal service will be lightly erased by him."

It is said that Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications once felt that the green color representing Chinese postal service was too dark and instructed it to be changed to a lighter shade. The use of green in the postal service was originally based on the phrase "Bamboo Announces Peace." Since green bamboo symbolizes peace, the postal service under the light green glow can be even more youthful in seeking progress for the convenience of the public.

Strange Noises from Yiyuan, "Miss International" Selected in Three Minutes

[Our Newspaper's Report] The so-called "1947 Miss International" election dance party was finally held last night at Yiyuan. There were seven female candidates participating, representing only two nationalities. Besides the two Chinese candidates, the rest were Russian. They were listed as numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 16. Finally, it was announced that No. 4 (Zhang Yuqing) was elected first place with 8,100 votes, No. 3 (Liu Yun) was elected second place with 6,000 votes, and No. 6 (Russian nationality) was elected third place with 400 votes.

Advertisements for the "Miss International" election had been plastered all over the streets. It was originally scheduled to be held on the 7th of this month, but was temporarily postponed to yesterday. However, as of 10 p.m. last night, there was still no news, seemingly without any prior preparation. It was not until after 11 p.m. that the microphone announced, "The election of Miss International is about to begin, please those participating come to the stage." The contestants were coy for a long time, and then a Russian man named Petrov individually escorted them to the music stage, announced their number and name, and then Petrov supported them to walk a circle around the dance floor. The contestants were all dressed in casual clothes, with the most colorful being an Russian woman named Angel. She wore a pink linen suit trimmed with white edges, but her age made her seem unsuited. When "Miss International" walked around the dance floor, their postures were different. The most experienced walking posture was No. 6, but it was a pity that she was relatively fat and slightly limped.

The "Miss International" election was completed in about fifteen minutes. The audience who came to the meeting were inevitably disappointed by the perfunctory "ceremony". At five o'clock, there were a lot of opinions, strange noises were everywhere, and they dispersed in a rush.

Yesterday, the reporter asked the person in charge of Yiyuan who was in charge of electing "Miss International". It was said that a Russian borrowed the venue in the name of the Twentieth Century Theater Association, which had nothing to do with the Yiyuan authorities. When asked about the total revenue of the election tickets on that day, it was said that it was still impossible to estimate. However, according to the total number of votes for the top three "Miss International" announced, which was 18,100 votes (each ticket sold for 50,000 yuan), the revenue for one night reached 905 million yuan.

All candidates for "Miss International", the second person from the right is No. 4, the third person is No. 3, and the seventh person is No. 6. (Photo by Our Newspaper)

### Liangjiang Swimming Pool: An Undersea Wrongful Death, Printing Plant Employee Drowns, the Number Thirteen is Indeed Unlucky

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiangwan Liangjiang Swimming Pool was crowded with swimmers yesterday due to the weekend holiday. A tragic drowning occurred at noon amidst the chaos. The deceased was named Lin Zongtang, 27 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, currently employed at the Central Printing Plant. Due to poor swimming skills, he unfortunately drowned. It was not discovered at first until his colleagues searched for him without success, and then someone familiar with water properties dived to the bottom of the pool and found him. By the time he was rescued from the water, his jaw was already clenched and his face was purple. It was estimated that he had been underwater for at least half an hour. Although he was given first aid and rushed to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment, he was unable to be resuscitated due to being submerged for too long. Afterwards, according to his colleagues, "There were thirteen of us here this time. At that time, we had a premonition that thirteen was an unlucky number, and now it has unfortunately come true."

### Zhu Qingsheng Released After Serving Sentence and Attempting Suicide

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Zhu Qingsheng theft case was previously sentenced to four months imprisonment by the District Court. He was not released after his sentence was completed, which led Zhu to attempt suicide in prison. It was previously reported that the District Prosecutor's Office had not sent the release warrant. According to investigation, it was because the case file was in the District Court and the District Prosecutor's Office was not aware of it. Therefore, it was not the responsibility of that office. It is also heard that Zhu Qingsheng was released from prison a few days ago.

### Mi Xichong Broadcasts on Life of Overseas Chinese in Latin America

[Our Newspaper's Report] This newspaper held its nineteenth special Sunday broadcast at the China Free Radio Station yesterday, inviting Mi Xichong (Guo Jian), former consul to Nicaragua in Latin America, to broadcast: "Overview of Overseas Chinese in Latin America." Mr. Mi has now been transferred to Davao City, Philippines. He has served in Latin America for twenty years. The main points of his speech are recorded below:

Spanish Legacy Remains

Latin America, geographically speaking, extends from Mexico in the north through Central America to Argentina in the south, together with Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, totaling twenty countries. Except for Haiti using French and Brazil using Portuguese, the language and writing of the other eighteen countries are mainly in Spanish. The Spanish legacy still remains today. This area is rich in resources and natural endowments. Coffee is the largest export, and other exports such as sugar from Cuba, cotton from Peru, silver from Mexico, and gold from Nicaragua also have considerable importance internationally. Overseas Chinese have been in Latin America for more than eighty years, with the largest number being Cantonese. There are more than 100,000 Overseas Chinese in Cuba, nearly 10,000 in Peru, and 2,000-3,000 or 4,000-5,000 in other countries. Overseas Chinese are engaged in many types of businesses, mostly small businesses, but there are also many engaged in farming with considerable success.

Various Restrictions Before the War

Before this war, there were 60,000 Japanese residents in Peru and 480,000 in Brazil. However, because Japan was one of the world's powers at that time, the governments of Latin American countries had complete freedom of entry for Japanese residents, but there were various restrictions on Chinese people. Their immigration laws often contained words prohibiting entry, and Overseas Chinese who had already entered were treated harshly in terms of residency procedures and general business. For example, the minimum capital requirement: those with less than the set amount were not allowed to start a business. For example, restrictions on store locations: general stores must not be freely moved without prior government approval. They can move from lively streets to remote areas, but they cannot move from quiet areas to the central city. For example, the enactment of the labor protection regulations: all employees of foreign-owned industrial and commercial enterprises must be citizens of the country in which they are located, with a ratio of either 75% or 80%. For example, the oppression suffered by Overseas Chinese education: in addition to registering with the local government as usual, the principal of an Overseas Chinese school must be a citizen of that country, and the time for teaching Chinese in some countries must not exceed six hours per week.

Always Enthusiastic About the Motherland

In short, although the number of Overseas Chinese in Latin America is not large, the capital is not large, and the business is not large, they are always enthusiastic about the motherland. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, they were able to work hard to promote the country and contribute money and effort. They enthusiastically contributed to various donations, such as medical donations, cotton clothing donations, straw shoe donations, and aviation salvation donations. They also purchased a large number of national currency public bonds, US dollar public bonds, and savings bonds, and followed the government's constitution and decree, assisting embassies and consulates at any time and anywhere with the demeanor of a great citizen to realize the work of people's diplomacy.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the embassies and consulates stationed in Latin America, in accordance with the central government's policy of resisting Japan and building the country, signed friendly treaties with the governments of the countries in which they were stationed, including Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Ecuador. Not only were they completely equal in principle, but there were also many improvements in the issue of entry for the people of the two contracting countries.

Increasing the Number of Embassies and Consulates in Many Places

In order to enhance diplomatic relations and protect Overseas Chinese, the government has increased the number of embassies and consulates in Latin America in the past few years. Currently, there are embassies in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, and legations in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. The number of newly established consulates general and consulates is also not small.

The United Nations is currently the only organization for maintaining world peace. The twenty countries of Latin America are all member states of the United Nations and have considerable power and voting rights in the General Assembly, which are valued by various governments, as a matter of course.

### Zhou Fohai's Cousin Tang Jianhou Sued for Serving in Puppet Government Posts and Hoarding

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tang Jianhou from Hunan is the cousin of the traitor Zhou Fohai. When Zhou betrayed the country, he organized the puppet Zhongbao News Agency in Nanjing as a propaganda organ. Tang joined the printing department of the agency (also known as the Xinzhong Printing Company) in 1940 as manager, and was later promoted to manager of the Zhongbao News Agency until the victory. Usually engaged in speculative hoarding, he once served as the puppet Bengbu Anti-Smoking Bureau director. The former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau sent a letter to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The Capital High Prosecutor's Office also transferred the case for joint handling based on Qiu Zhongde's accusation. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, it was found that Tang had served in the puppet Zhongbao News Agency, successively serving as the manager of the printing department and the manager of the Zhongbao News Agency. Based on Qiu Zhongde's accusation and the investigation report by the staff of the former Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the facts are very clear. The High Court re-examined Jin Xiongbo, the deputy director of the puppet Zhongbao News Agency, who confessed that it was true. As for Tang's appointment as the director of the puppet Bengbu Anti-Smoking Bureau, Qiu Zhongde's accusation was detailed and credible. The defendant usually hoarded goods, and the description in the Handling Bureau's investigation documents was clear. His actions clearly constituted the crime of Article 3 and Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

[Another Report] Lin Lan'an, the puppet Shanghai Education Bureau Director, was recently prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office.

### Li Mi, Commander of the Eighth Army, Who Tenaciously Defended Linqu and Completed a Great Victory

[Special Correspondent Shao Changzhi from Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] In the great victory at Linqu, the troops under Li Mi of the Eighth Army were tenacious and unyielding, firmly defending Linqu and accomplishing their mission. Observers believe that the steadfast defense of Linqu was like the battle of Sipingjie in Shandong. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram commending Li Mi, the army commander. Li's given name is Bingren. He is a native of Baoshan, Yunnan. He is currently 40 years old. He graduated from the fourth term of the Central Military Academy. He has served as platoon, company, and battalion commander. He joined the military and the Northern Expedition in 1927. He also served in political work. During the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, he was in charge of county administration and made many achievements in local administration. During the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to his military life and served as a brigade commander and deputy division commander. Later, he fought under the leadership of Chen Cheng, commander-in-chief of the Sixth War Area in western Hubei. The troops he led were the Honorary First Division, which is now famous throughout the country. At that time, he was the division commander of that division. Li was promoted to deputy army commander of the Eighth Army and commander of the Hongjiang Division Management District in Hunan due to his outstanding military achievements, where he worked to reorganize the troops. When the military situation in Yunnan and Burma became tense, the army was ordered to rush to reinforce it, resulting in the famous "Songshan Victory", which was valued by China and foreign countries. After that, he was promoted to army commander until today.

Li is very frugal in his personal life, and he is considerate of his subordinates. The whole army is of one heart and mind, thanks to Li's usual edification. When Li was a regimental commander under General Zhu Peide, an incident occurred. One day, General Chen Cheng received a secret order to disarm and reorganize Zhu's troops. Li learned of this news and took all the regimental troops to the Nanchang Camp to personally report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, saying that he was a student of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and was educated by him: "Revolutionary soldiers do not disarm or surrender." Therefore, he brought the troops here and asked Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to send someone to inspect and take over. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave him comfort. This also shows a glimpse of Li's personality.

### Flood Area Locust Suppression: Failure to Suppress Within Three Weeks Will Inevitably Extend to Neighboring Counties

[Special Correspondent Wang Shoumei, Kaifeng, 7th] The Henan Locust Control Association reported, according to Team Leader He Jun, that the locust situation in the flood area is as follows: (A) Lian Temple area: in a 3,000 square li area, locations such as Gucheng, Jinqiao, Binwanggang, and Zhengqiao have a density of 40 to 120 locusts per square foot. (B) Xihua area: in a 1,850 square li area, locations such as Songgang, Huodangcheng, Zhangzhuang Dongdongqiao, Qinghe, Yidao, Lugang, and Zaokou have 100 locusts per square foot. (C) Honghua Ji area: in a 1,500 square li area, locations such as Liucheng, Pangang, and Nanliang have a density of 40 to 100 locusts per square foot. The most severely affected area is 6,350 square li, the moderately affected area is 3,650 square li, totaling 10,000 square li. The situation is very serious. Currently, over 50 locust control personnel are being dispatched, and approximately 150,000 civilians are being mobilized to actively control the locusts using methods such as pesticides, torn cloth bait, ditch digging, and encirclement. From July 17th to 25th, over 40,000 jin of locust nymphs were exchanged for flour, and pesticide bait and liquid were sprayed, ditches were dug, and locusts were beaten, killing an estimated 4 million jin. However, the environment in the flood area is extremely unfavorable, making the work very difficult. The locust nymphs in the flood area are in the second, third, fourth, and fifth instars. Under the principles of a permissive environment and smooth work, most can be suppressed within three weeks; otherwise, locust control personnel will be unable to enter the area. If they become flying locusts in the future, the damage to neighboring counties will be difficult to avoid. It is reported that the provincial government has urgently telegraphed various locations in the flood area, urging them to be on strict alert in order to thoroughly eliminate the locusts and prevent the harm from spreading.

Li Zhengang, special supervisor of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Chen Jiaxiang, technician; Guo Erpu, chief supervisor; Qiu Shibang, special commissioner; Guo Shouzhu, special commissioner; Gao Wenbin, special commissioner; and six others went to the flood area to supervise locust control and inspect the locust nymph activity. They have now returned to Bian after completing their official duties. According to them, over 700,000 jin of autumn locusts have already been collected in the flood area. However, the locust situation is still raging. In addition to the over 40 personnel sent to the area by the Henan Locust Control Committee, efforts are currently being made to capture and kill them. They are also working with various units of the Flood Area Administrative Headquarters to intensify efforts using all available locust control materials. If the environment changes favorably, the autumn locusts can all be eliminated, preventing a widespread disaster.

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 6th] From 8:00 PM on July 13th to 5:00 AM on the 14th this year, Nangcheng suffered a catastrophic hail disaster lasting a total of ten hours. Fields and tobacco were completely destroyed, and the flooding of both the Ying and Ru rivers caused unprecedented devastation. The people's livelihoods are on the verge of collapse. Currently, the county has publicly elected Councilor Sun Xizhang and Chamber of Commerce President Yu Zihe as representatives of the entire county to come to Bian to appeal for reduced taxes. Yesterday (the 5th) at 12:00 PM, they hosted members of the city's press at Weichun Restaurant, inviting over ten people, including the heads of various newspapers and news agencies. Representative Sun Xizhang gave an on-the-spot report on the details of the disaster in the county, stating briefly that: The hailstones that fell in Xiangcheng this time were as large as peaches or as small as apricots. The most severely affected areas include Gaoqiao Town, Wangluo Town, Yingqiao Town, Huayu Township, and Yaocheng Township, covering an area of 138,864 mu. This is the most severe disaster since the Republic of China. At the same time, continuous rain caused the Ying and Ru rivers to flood, inundating the autumn crops. Moreover, the disaster-stricken areas are all tobacco-producing areas. Tobacco is the main agricultural product of Xiangcheng, and the people rely on it for their livelihoods. Now, faced with this enormous disaster, the livelihoods of the people in the entire county are on the verge of collapse. The County Council, County Party Department, Youth Corps, and County Government have attached disaster photos and detailed reports and submitted them to the Provincial Government, Provincial Council, and relevant agencies, requesting tax reductions and emergency relief.

A Bizarre Fish Caught in Haining

[Our Haining Dispatch, 9th] A farmer in Zhuqiao Town in this county discovered a bizarre fish in a field ditch while drawing water to irrigate his fields. It swam quite quickly.

Its head resembled a rat's head, and its body was shaped like a dumpling. Its back was slightly hunched, and it had four legs with sharp, slender claws and could stand upright. Its abdomen had soft fur, and its tail was flat and long. It weighed over twenty jin, and a knife could not damage it in the slightest. Soon after, he sought out experts in the town to identify it. All the viewers were amazed, and the whole city was in an uproar, blocking the roads. Later, a Mr. Chen bought it for 70,000 yuan and is now raising it at home.

### To Prevent Food Shortages and Rice Riots, Zhejiang Provincial Government Formulates Purchase and Sale Plan

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 10th] Zhejiang Province is a grain-deficient area. Last year and this spring, food shortages led to rice riots.

This year, it has decided to provide 70 billion in grain loans and 20 billion in collateralized loans to store 300,000 shi of grain and control food supplies.

### Hefei Gunshots, Wishing for a Bountiful Harvest

[Our Hefei Dispatch] The rice-producing areas of over thirty counties in central and eastern Anhui have recently received special blessings. During the flowering season, they were baked by high heat, growing vigorously as if pulled up by hand, and a harvest is expected that will be no less than last year's.

The price of rice has fallen from nearly 300,000 per shi to 200,000, and in some villages, it has fallen to 140,000 to 150,000. In recent nights, the suburbs of Hefei have been filled with the sound of crackling gunfire, as dense as a string of pearls. Many residents in the city were startled awake from their sleep, not understanding what was happening. After investigation, it was learned that it was the rural areas competing to fire earthen guns to celebrate the green signs of a bountiful harvest, and only then did they understand and smile.

### Tuition and Fees for Specialized Schools and Above in this City Have Been Initially Decided: Highest at 2 Million, Lowest at 1.4 Million

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Federation of Specialized Schools and Above held its 11th regular meeting at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Attendees included Fudan President Zhang Yi, Jiaotong University's Wang Zhizhuo, Tongji's Xi Fan, Daxia's Ou Yuanhuai, St. John's Tu Yuqing, Shanghai Jiang's Lin Zhuoran, Zhijiang's Wang Yukai, Shanghai Law School's Zhu Fengyi, Lixin Accounting School's Pan Xulun, Shanghai Conservatory of Music's Dai Cuilun, Aurora University's Hu Wenyao, Shanghai Medical College's Gu Jingyi, Tongde Medical College's Gu Yuqi, Southeast Medical College's Chen Chongchen, Sino-French Pharmaceutical College's Wu Yuwan, Datong's Hu Dunfu, National Defense Medical College's Zhang Jian, Wuxi National College's Tang Wenzhi, Shanghai College of Political Science and Law's Guo Xiaoxian, China Vocational School of Industry and Commerce's Shen Sizhuang, Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts' Liu Haisu, Chengming College of Arts and Sciences' Jiang Weiqiao, Municipal Vocational College's Yang Shuyi, China New College's Chen Gaoyong, Guanghua's Shen Jinguo, and Shanghai Dental College's Situ Bo, and twenty others.

Chairman's Report

Chairman Zhang Yi first reported that a letter was sent to the Shanghai Poor Student Aid Committee to raise funds, and a reply has been received indicating agreement and a commitment to do its best to allocate funds. (2) Guanghua University previously proposed sending a letter to the Municipal Government to exempt various schools from property donations and municipal construction donations. This letter was sent at the end of last month. Immediately afterwards, discussion began on important issues such as tuition fees, professor salaries, and student aid fundraising for the next semester. Representatives from various private schools reported on the tuition fees and professor salaries in their respective schools.

Schools' Opinions

Lixin's Pan Xulun stated that the school plans to charge 1.5 million in tuition next semester. Professor salaries have always been adjusted according to national schools. If the tuition fee is too low, it will not be possible to increase tuition fees midway, and professor salaries cannot be adjusted. As for students, the academic performance of private school students is not inferior. Therefore, scholarships should be set up as much as possible so that poor students can study. Shanghai Jiang's Lin Zhuoran stated that the school plans to charge tuition fees between 1.5 million and 2 million. Daxia's Ou Yuanhuai stated that high tuition fees mean that students' parents cannot afford them, and the number of students decreases. Low tuition fees mean that schools have difficulty operating, and professor salaries cannot be adjusted. Therefore, a reasonable solution must be found that takes both into account. St. John's Tu Yuqing stated that his school, Zhijiang, and Soochow have made preliminary decisions to charge 1.2 million for tuition and 300,000 for miscellaneous fees, a threefold increase compared to last semester. Zhijiang's Wang Yukai cited Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau's current speech on the issue of tuition fees, stating that teacher salaries and school fees should be based on rice prices. Shanghai College of Political Science and Law's Guo Xiaoxian stated that students who received scholarships in the school last semester accounted for a quarter of the total number of students in the school. If the number of scholarships in each school increases, it will help solve the above problems. Shanghai Law School's Chu Fengyi stated that he hoped to refrain from making rigid regulations for the time being.

Discussion Results

After several detailed discussions, the following was decided: (1) Taking into account both the affordability of students' parents and the reasonable salaries that professors should have, a preliminary decision was made: the minimum tuition fee for each school next semester is 1.4 million, and the maximum must not exceed 2 million. (2) The number of scholarships in each school: full exemptions must not be less than 10%, and half exemptions must not be less than 20%. (3) A permanent scholarship committee will be established to promote fundraising work. Fudan, Lixin, Datong, St. John's, Shanghai Jiang's, Academy of Fine Arts, Tongji, Tongde Medical College, Guanghua, and Jiaotong University were designated as members, and Fudan will convene them to plan concrete implementation measures. No decision was made on the issue of professor salaries for the time being.

[Another Dispatch] The committee held a first meeting discussing concrete fundraising methods on the afternoon of the thirteenth.

### Taiwan Education Agency Unifies Printing and Sales of Textbooks

Shanghai Booksellers Express Dissatisfaction

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The Taiwan Provincial Department of Education has recently established a Textbook Supply Committee to centrally plan the printing and distribution of textbooks. The committee entrusted the Provincial Education Association to sell the textbooks at the lowest cost, cutting out middlemen and merchants, in order to reduce the burden on students. 2.5 million copies of textbooks in various subjects have been printed, but this is still not enough to meet the actual needs.

[Our City Dispatch] There are five Shanghai booksellers that have set up branches in Taiwan, including Zhengzhong, Kaiming, Children, Duli, and Shengli. Recently, Zhonghua and Commercial Press have also set up distribution centers in Taiwan, intending to work for the culture of Taiwan Province. However, since the province was reorganized into a provincial government, most of the controls have been abolished. Now, the unified sale of textbooks, which are related to freedom of publication, is akin to competing with booksellers for profit. Shanghai booksellers have expressed dissatisfaction. The only solution is for the branches of various companies that are working hard for the culture of Taiwan Province to completely withdraw from Taiwan Province to avoid being said to be engaged in business.

### The Predicament of Education in the Former Capital

— Our Ping-based Correspondent Song Shaobo

Reading and teaching have become difficult problems to remedy at present.

As the national crisis deepens daily, the education problem becomes even more severe. Today, when discussing education, everyone barely has time to consider the system, faculty, and facilities. The only things that trouble teachers and students daily are their livelihoods. Teachers teach to earn a living, and students apply to schools, choosing their targets not based on the quality of the school, but on how much it costs. This situation is particularly evident in Beiping.

The problem of Beiping students being unable to attend school seems even more worrying this year. In the past, the main reason students could not attend school was that there were few schools and many students. Some students wanted to study but couldn't because they couldn't get into a school. The situation today is different. While the scarcity of schools is still a reason for students being unable to attend, the main problem is that students who already had access to schools and could afford to study are now dropping out in batches. Widespread unemployment and the expansion of war zones are only exacerbating this situation, increasing daily. When people talk about it, they say, "We can barely feed the family, how can we afford to study?" Everyone wants their children who have had some schooling to find work, which further intensifies the panic about unemployment.

In the past, students who were admitted to national colleges and universities could mostly sustain themselves because of public funding. However, according to the Ministry of Education's order, starting in the 36th year (1947), public funding for incoming freshmen has been canceled and replaced with scholarships. According to this method, the percentage of students eligible for public funding (scholarships) has been reduced from 80% to 25% (and there are also restrictions on academic performance and conduct). According to statistics, so-called poor students account for almost 90% of the total student population. They had all originally relied on public funding, but now more than 60% of them will have to drop out of school. This is a serious blow to this year's incoming freshmen. To this end, the preparatory class students of various national universities in Beiping have formed a "Joint Association to Fight for the Continuation of the Public Funding System for Universities" to demand that the Ministry of Education maintain the original method. They believe that since the country has restored the wartime system, logically, the public funding established during wartime should not be canceled. In addition, the Ministry of Education stipulates that public funding will be suspended for those who fail one-third of their credits, which is also a fatal blow to some students who are not doing well in some subjects. After negotiation, Tsinghua University has allowed such students to enjoy half public funding, but Peking University has not yet responded.

The number of students whose families are in communist areas and have had their economic resources cut off is increasing daily. These students, except for a few who study at national universities and receive public funding, have almost no choice but to drop out of school. Some seek employment, but if they cannot find employment, they have to go home. They believe that the government's lip service to winning over young people without solving the problems of these young students is a major blunder. Now, some students who are determined not to return to the communist areas have also organized student associations to seek the same treatment as students in border areas and demobilized soldiers. Some self-funded students must find a guarantor who can pay their meal fees before they can enroll (such as at Tsinghua University), otherwise, they will be refused admission.

The tuition fees for private universities next semester are at least 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Besides the few wealthy children, plus the monthly meal fees, it is really not something that an ordinary family can afford. Some are taking advantage of the summer vacation to do hard labor. For example, at Yenching University, which is known as a school for the elite, many students are dismantling walls and removing military equipment for the school to earn 2,000 yuan per hour. A few other students have received self-help work from the International Christian Student Relief Association, working six hours a day and earning 500,000 yuan a month doing clerical work. Some have formed their own tutoring schools and temporarily collect some tuition fees. Some students at private universities who cannot find a solution do not hesitate to lower their grade level and apply to national university freshmen to save some money. This time, the joint enrollment of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University found many such cases. The three schools can only accommodate 2,000 people in total, and the total number of applicants in the Beiping examination area alone is more than 5,000. How easy is it to hope to attend a free school? How many of those who fail the exam can afford to attend private universities? It's a real question.

The situation for middle school students is even more difficult because even if they are admitted to municipal middle schools and pay a few tuition fees, they must pay for their own meals. Because the tuition fees for municipal middle schools are low (30,000 to 50,000 yuan), everyone comes to apply. This year, Beiping's municipal high schools admitted a total of 986 people, and junior high schools admitted 1,230 people, but there were 25,786 applicants, an average of one out of fourteen being admitted. How many of the remaining 23,000 can afford to attend private middle schools with tuition fees of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan? Moreover, some private middle schools require tuition and meal fees to be paid in full at the time of enrollment to avoid trouble, but how many families can raise 1 to 2 million yuan at once to pay for children who may or may not be able to study?

According to the report from the Ping Municipal Education Bureau, 40% of Beiping's children aged 6 to 12 are out of school. The daily work of these out-of-school children is to pick coal cinders and sell newspapers, working as child laborers. The Education Bureau planned to increase schools and classes by 3 billion yuan after the summer vacation last semester, but the Ministry of Education did not approve it.

The incident a few days ago in which Jin Chengyi, a Tsinghua University student, stabbed a professor out of resentment for failing his grade for fear of losing public funding, is a tragic illustration of this serious problem.

On the teacher's side, the phenomenon of exclusion is also present. In some municipal middle schools, because there are too many personnel, batches of teachers and principals are being squeezed out. What follows is mutual exposure of scandals, which is both laughable and infuriating. When the war in the Northeast reached a confused state, professors fled to the south. To solve the problem of eating, everyone had to manage. Deans and directors did not hesitate to lower their positions, and several people were squeezed out again. Those who can find a way abroad are competing to seek opportunities to go abroad. Professors who should have returned to China this summer after lecturing abroad are mostly unwilling to return. A few days ago, professors from various national colleges and universities jointly wrote a letter to Hu Shi, asking Hu to think of ways to improve their treatment with the government. Can Hu Shi come up with a solution? This is certainly not a simple question.

Leader: Chen Jingtao, Secretary She Meide, Captain Ji Chongtang, Players: (Goalkeeper) Tan Jun'gan, (Defenders) Zeng Zhongyun, Li Guowei, Lin Rushun, (Midfielders) Liu Rongguang, Kong Qingyu, Xie Jinhong, Luo Weiquan, (Forwards) Li Huitang, Li Deqi, Li Shuoyou, Li Yude, Xie Jinhe, Chen Dehui, Zhuo Shijin.

In order to review the strength of the Southern Expedition team, they arranged a match with the Navy team at Jiashan on the 3rd (Sunday). The Navy team had defeated China United in a charity match, so yesterday's match attracted many fans. The match started in the rain. South China was personally supervised by Li Yingtang, and won by three goals in the first half, with the credit going to Jinhe, Shijin, and Shuoyou. In the second half, Yude came on and Deqi retired. "Little Li" showed great promise, scoring two goals alone. The Navy also pulled one back, making it 5-1 at the end of the match. South China's lineup that day:

Translator Jun Gan

Lin Rushun Zeng Zhongyun

Luo Weiquan Xie Jinhong Kong Qingyu

Li Shuoyou Zhuo Shijin Li Huitang Li Yongde (down) Li De (up) Xie Jinhe

Overall, Jun Gan's goalkeeping has not returned to its original form and is not a good general. Left-back Lin Rushun is even less worthy of mention. The midfield line can defend, but the assist is not enough. It is not easy to cooperate with a frontline that lacks energy to compete for the ball in midfield. If they encounter a strong team, it is not optimistic.

### Obstacles to the Reception of the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium: The Building is So Damaged That It is Almost Impossible to Start; Barracks are Covered with New Soldiers

The Jiangwan Municipal Stadium in Shanghai was borrowed by the Joint Logistics Headquarters after the victory. It was originally scheduled to be completely returned by the end of June this year for repairs to prepare for the 7th National Games. However, it failed to materialize for some reason. After repeated negotiations, the Joint Logistics Headquarters ordered the Shanghai Port Headquarters to return it immediately, and the stadium was ordered to take over. In order to discuss the handover procedures, Stadium Director Jiang Xiangqing visited Director He Shoulin of the Ordnance Department of the Port Headquarters on the 4th and 5th of this month. The results were satisfactory. After the negotiation, the Port Headquarters prepared to return it on the 7th. In order to expedite the handover procedures, Director Jiang, together with Director He, Deputy Director Xu, and Chen Meinian, the warehouse director of the Second Ordnance Supply Depot of the Joint Logistics Department, visited Jiangwan again at 9 am on the 8th to survey the entire site and buildings and to discuss specific handover methods. The following agreement was reached: (1) The municipal stadium, which was half destroyed by bombing, can be exchanged around the 15th of this month after the two parties exchange documents. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Stadium, the Municipal Swimming Pool, and other buildings will be returned successively. (3) There are still a large number of dangerous goods in the destroyed area that are pressed at the bottom. The municipal government should send a letter to the Engineering Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters to send sappers to assist in the removal. The current situation of the stadium is described below:

Everywhere Devastated

Except for the municipal stadium, the other buildings are currently in a state that cannot be transferred within two or three months. The first floor of the Shanghai Municipal Stadium has been completely dismantled by enemy soldiers, and the interior has also been severely damaged. The sewers around the building are all blocked, and the inside of the stadium is flooded after every heavy rain. The condition of the swimming pool and buildings is even worse. Although the machine room is still largely intact, one of the water pumps has lost its cover. The track and field inside the municipal stadium is equivalent to the mountainous areas of the western and southern provinces. If you want to find the track, you have to dig several feet deep. Some of the mounds and rocks are six or seven feet high. Most of the plane has been covered by gravel, iron sheets, and scattered cement bones. Weeds grow wildly, and trees are lush. As for the half that has been bombed, there is little hope of rebuilding it in five or six years. Even the cost of clearing it will be staggering, because the steel and cement blocks of broken bricks cannot be moved by manpower. Looking around, it is almost impossible to start. The most troublesome thing is that there are still a considerable number of tons of dangerous goods pressed at the bottom. If they are cleared by ordinary engineering personnel, there will be another explosion. If the sappers are responsible for clearing them, it seems appropriate to do so before the takeover, otherwise, no one will be responsible in the future.

Full of New Recruits

All the houses in the undamaged part of the municipal stadium have been cleared, but they have been used as reception centers for new recruits. Currently, there are 3,000 people living there, and the corridors are also crowded. According to reports, batches of new recruits are arriving, and it is said that another 7,000 people will arrive successively in the coming days. The New Recruit Reception Committee, because there is no place to put its feet in all the houses, has built temporary houses on the field for accommodation. Construction is currently underway, and it is also planned to repair the road of the municipal swimming pool and use it as a place for new recruits to bathe. According to Director Jiang, the reception of the municipal stadium is no longer a problem, but there is nothing to be gained, and the staff who go to the reception as soon as possible also need to build more temporary houses to have a place to stay. Jiang has reported the above situation to Deputy Director Li of the Education Bureau (Director Gu is lecturing in Taiwan) and has asked the municipal government for instructions. The compensation for the bombed part has been 1 billion yuan, and it has been collected by the Public Works Bureau, which is enough to excavate the runway, renovate the field, lay turf, and carry out some sporadic repairs.

### Silk Weaving Industry Holds General Meeting of Members Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Artificial Silk Allocation

Resolution to Submit Four Demands to the Central Trust Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] The Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association held a temporary general meeting of members in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning. Zhou Lianze, a representative of the Municipal Social Bureau, Pan Shihao, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chen Wujie, a representative of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, Tian Heqing, a representative of the Industrial Association, and representatives of more than 300 member units of the association attended. Silk weaving factories from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shengze also sent representatives to attend. Cai Tingtao served as the chairman of the meeting, which lasted until 12 noon.

The focus of yesterday's meeting was to discuss the issue of artificial silk allocation by the Central Trust Bureau (CTB). During the meeting, the emotions of the members were very intense. Silk weaving factories are currently facing difficult times, and the supply of raw materials is extremely difficult. Taking the artificial silk allocated by the CTB as an example, the allocation source has been announced, forcing the factories to resort to the black market. Even when the CTB allocated the most, it was less than one-fifth of the industry's needs. Now the allocation price has been raised to be equal to the black market price, making the factories feel that every step is difficult. At present, the products of the factories are slow-selling and the prices are stagnant. On the one hand, labor costs and other expenses have to be paid regularly. The factories feel negative about the issue of continuing to maintain operations. However, on the other hand, because the factories employ a large number of workers, closing down is not permissible in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers. The factories feel that they are in a dilemma.

During yesterday's meeting, the representatives of the factories expressed their unwillingness to continue operating and their emotions were high. Fortunately, Pan Shihao of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others earnestly persuaded them, and the atmosphere began to ease. After a discussion on the issue of artificial silk allocation by the CTB, four resolutions were obtained:

The General Assembly Resolved Four Requests

(1) Request the CTB to determine the allocation price of artificial silk in accordance with the nationally stipulated profit margin. According to the nationally stipulated general profit, it should be based on the actual cost (it is reported that the cost price of each box of artificial silk at the CTB is 190 US dollars) plus a legal profit percentage.

(2) If the CTB believes that the silk weaving industry has the suspicion of allocating at low prices and selling at high prices on the black market, it can allocate the raw materials to the silk weaving industry in a 代织 (contract weaving) manner, have the industry 代织 finished products, and then purchase them. The industry only charges legal labor costs.

(3) Request the CTB to organize an artificial silk allocation committee. The members of the committee should include representatives from the municipal government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and the Silk Weaving Industry Association in addition to the CTB, so as to openly handle the issue of artificial silk allocation.

(4) Request the CTB to improve the artificial silk allocation method. The current allocation method of the CTB is that after determining the quota at 10 am every Monday, the payment must be made at 11 am, and the storage order can be obtained four or five days later. It takes at least one week for the goods to arrive. Please improve it so that the storage order can be obtained and the goods can be shipped immediately after payment, so as to avoid cost increase due to interest loss on payment.

Elected Representatives to Visit the Mayor

Finally, Cai Xiji, Liu Qingyi, and others were elected as representatives to go to the Municipal Government at 10 am today in response to Mayor Wu's invitation in order to personally present everything.

[Further News] It is reported that the allocation price of artificial silk for this week by the CTB has been determined by the bureau after consulting with the heads of various departments last Saturday, referring to the market conditions of last week, to be 22.3 million yuan per box.

### CTB Organizes Loans for Increased Edible Oil Production, Including Four Types: Soybeans, Sesame, Rapeseed

In order to promote the increased production of edible oil and to cooperate with the general mobilization order plan, the CTB has, according to the 四联总处 (Four Joint Offices), through the material loan method passed in the last board meeting, summoned the relevant lines局 (bureaus) and oil pressing industry institutions last week to exchange preliminary opinions. It was generally agreed that since the principles of the Four Joint Offices have been established, the implementation rules should be followed and implemented quickly. The CTB and the Third District Plant Oil Refining Industry will jointly discuss and decide on all the details to be released on Tuesday (the 12th). This edible oil production increase loan includes four types of raw materials: soybeans, peanuts, sesame, and rapeseed. The procurement work will be carried out in a unified manner, and the storage and transportation of finished products will also be considered. Therefore, it will be of great benefit to domestic production and consumption in the future.

Increase Production

Recently, the supply of edible oil in the city has been rising due to various reasons. Now the Zhongzhi Oil Factory has shipped 3,000 barrels of soybean oil from Qingdao to Shanghai, which are being valued for sale. The factory has also been ordered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to increase the production of edible oil by 20,000 dan per month. The CTB delivered 2,300 tons of soybeans to the oil pressing factories last month, which were refined in 代制 (contract processing) manner. Last week, another 3,700 tons of soybeans were unloaded in Shanghai, and it is planned to entrust each factory to refine them in a 代制 manner after the contract is signed. Combining with the previous 6,000 tons in total, the handling fee may be increased by 50% from the previous 20,000 yuan per dan.

Abundant Raw Materials

This year's oil pressing raw materials are estimated to be abundant by all parties. Therefore, the CTB is currently auditing the output of various types of oil pressing raw materials in China. In addition to considering domestic needs, it is prepared for quantitative export. According to the estimates of knowledgeable people in the oil pressing industry, the soybean output in the Northeast last year reached 122,600,000 hu, and the output in various parts of Guan Nei (areas inside the passes) totaled 166,600,000 hu. This year, except for the losses caused by the war, all parts of the country can be expected to harvest.

Export Difficulties

Merchants from the Eastern Nine Provinces have shipped several batches of goods to various European countries and the Soviet Union. However, due to the unstable political situation and transportation difficulties in the Allied countries, the production and sales of soybeans have not been able to return to normal, so the number of overseas sales is not large. At present, Allied countries want to restore the normal state before the war, but there are many difficulties. According to general estimates, the amount of soybean exports from China within the areas controlled by the National Army this year will not exceed 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 tons. Even after the restoration of full peace in the Eastern Nine Provinces, the demand for soybeans in Guan Nei in China is very high. Unless there is a significant increase in production, the amount of soybeans exported abroad will not reach the pre-war level.

### Large Quantity of Gold Seized En Route to Macau in Manila

[United Press Manila, 10th] It is reported that Philippine Treasury Department detectives yesterday prevented 25,000 ounces of gold (worth US$1,279,000) from being transported from Manila to Macau by air. Although local exporters held gold export permits from the Foreign Exchange Control Administration, Philippine Finance Minister Goteano announced that these permits expired on July 18. All applications from merchants to extend the gold export permits were rejected by Goteano in order to comply with the International Monetary Fund's regulations, which stipulate that gold sales must not exceed US$35 per ounce.

Currently, the price of gold in Macau is above US$51 per ounce, attracting smugglers like moths to a flame. Gold flows from Macau into the Chinese black market. At a recent cabinet meeting, the Philippine cabinet discussed the gold issue, and Goteano reiterated the Philippines' obligations under international monetary agreements. Presidential Secretary Abejero stated that the Philippines is investigating in Washington the intention of U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder's recent statement, in which Snyder said that the U.S. does not oppose the re-export of gold imported into Canada for refining.

### Diesel Oil Industry Writes to the National Economic Commission, Requesting Relaxation of Diesel Oil Quota

Due to the perceived shortage of diesel oil in the third-period quota of the Transport Control Commission, the quota was uniquely increased by more than 7 million US dollars in order to ensure a universal supply of diesel oil and prevent the resurgence of the black market. In the past, privately-owned industries could procure the diesel fuel they needed from various oil companies, but in recent months, due to reduced supply, oil companies have refused to sell. To survive, private industries have been forced to turn to the black market, where prices are more than four times the controlled price. The government originally approved an increase of more than 7 million US dollars in the third-period quota. The amount of the increase is too small, and the diesel oil industry has now written to the National Economic Commission, requesting a greater increase.

### Production of Sanitary Materials and Supplies - No Technical Problems; Imports Should Apparently Be Prohibited Due to Foreign Competition

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to statistics from the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, sanitary materials can be broadly classified into rubber plasters, cotton gauze, cloth tape, and other types. Ten years ago, our country mostly relied on imported goods. In 1935, the Xinyi Factory established a rubber plaster factory. In 1937, the Xin Ya Sanitary Material Factory was established to specialize in the production of Xing brand rubber plaster. The above two factories each produce 15,000 rolls per month (each roll 12 x 5 yards). In 1939, Xin Ya expanded its scope, adding weaving, degreasing, and bleaching equipment to manufacture degreased gauze, cotton, cloth tape, and the like. Other factories, such as Tianping, Datong, Huisheng, Xinhua, and Kuaile, manufacture cotton and gauze. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the supply of sanitary materials to the rear was mostly transported from this city via Hong Kong, the Yunnan-Burma Road, and eastern Zhejiang into the interior. Since the victory, the industry has been greatly affected by large quantities of American relief goods and surplus sanitary materials coming into China, as the domestic manufacturing costs are too high for effective competition.

Currently, the manufacturers of rubber plasters include Xinyi, Xin Ya, Tianping, and other factories. Those who manufacture gauze include Xin Ya, Datong, Huisheng, and other factories. The manufacturers of cotton include Datong, Huisheng, Xin Ya, Xinhua, Kuaile, and other factories. Except for cotton, the current production volume of rubber plasters and gauze is far from the maximum production volume, some as low as 20-30%. The Guidance Office believes that the manufacturing of sanitary materials no longer has technical problems and that the equipment is simple, making it very easy to increase production when needed. Since domestic products can be adequately supplied, imports should apparently be prohibited.

### National Bank Dispatches Two Auditors to Supervise the Liquidation of Ba Chuan and Zheng He

According to a responsible person from the National Bank yesterday, after the Shanghai branches of Ba Chuan and Zheng He stopped exchanging currency, the Ministry of Finance revoked the business licenses of both banks in accordance with the Financial Control Measures. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the National Bank's Auditing Department, instructing them to supervise the liquidation of the two banks. After receiving the order, the National Bank appointed auditors Shen and Yu on the 10th to proceed to the above two banks to handle the liquidation matters.

The total amount of liabilities for the two banks is 15 billion yuan, including ordinary deposits and interbank lending. The liquidation process will first repay the normal deposits, and then liquidate interbank lending. It is expected that this work can be completed within two months.

It was also stated that the branches of the two banks outside of Shanghai will continue to operate as usual. Recently, the money supply in Shanghai has eased, so the liquidation of the two banks will not affect the local market.

### Chinese Medicine Weak and Depressed

Market conditions are mostly weak and sluggish, except for Sichuan currency and Tianjin currency, which remain firm. Imported and Guangdong goods once rose due to bandit-related disturbances. Guangdong benzoin reached 120,000 yuan. Compared with Hankou, the price difference with Shanghai is almost half, so people are going to Hankou to buy it. Sales in local pharmacies are sluggish, leading to a further lack of sales. Guangdong Costus Root has now fallen below the 100,000 yuan mark, even quoted at 80,000 yuan, and Indian Costus Root has also been affected. Taichang musk, nearing the expiration of its sales order, has fallen to 28,000 yuan. Sandalwood rice has fallen to 32,000 yuan, with very few transactions, and confidence is very weak.

### Hong Kong Rubber Trade

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 10th] The Hong Kong rubber trade is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. In the first half of the year, 241,300 piculs of raw rubber were imported and 159,800 piculs were exported. The imported rubber came from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. On the export side, except for 5,000 piculs shipped to the United States, the remaining 150,000 piculs were shipped to our country.

### Our Country Should Urgently Develop the South American Market for Silk Fabrics and Can Largely Replace Japan's Original Position

Since the war, the United States has become a competitive market for silk-producing countries around the world. Japanese silk shipments to the United States have substantial inventories, and the production volume of American nylon is astonishing. All of these factors make China's raw silk face strong competitors for export, resulting in an oversupply of raw silk in the United States and a sharp drop in market prices. The silk industry in our country is paying close attention to this issue. It is estimated that the government will purchase 14,000 dan of raw silk this spring, and autumn silkworms are about to be hatched. The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee and the Silk Fabric Export Coordination Committee are both anticipating these materials will be used for export or manufactured into satins for re-export, and are devising appropriate policies.

It is reported that related parties recently received reports from qualified individuals in the South American silk industry, stating that Chinese businesses are too negligent in this area. The reason for this is the long distance and the lack of direct contact. Regular orders are often relayed through the United States by mail, which takes no less than two or three months, and shipping takes even longer. However, there are still many good opportunities to expand the development of domestic goods, for the following reasons: (1) South American countries did not suffer losses during World War II. On the contrary, they absorbed a lot of foreign exchange due to increased wartime trade, and their purchasing power has increased. (2) Before the war, Japanese goods were dumped in the region and gained a considerable position. The preference for Japanese goods has not completely disappeared, especially for silk products and satins. In this period of sluggish sales of British raw silk, it is possible to change course, open new avenues, and dump silk finished products in the region to replace Japan's original position.

Based on the above factors, our country has been negligent, so the active expansion of the market in the region is being handled by British, French, and Italian merchants. Their marketing methods even use the "Chinese goods" label or refer to them as mixed Japanese goods, rarely directly stating they are European products. Although sales are not entirely satisfactory, the market is attracting attention, as can be seen from this.

The person reporting also suggested improving the approach by urging our country to quickly organize an inspection tour to South America, bringing finished products, in addition to the main silk fabrics and satins, as well as porcelain, lacquerware, and embroidery, to attract the attention of the people there and restore the trend of loving Chinese goods. In addition, it may be worthwhile to imitate Italy's approach to selling silk satin in the region, that is, send finished products to the region for exhibition. As a result, the goods were completely sold out, and import taxes were avoided.

### More Than 200 Types of Cotton Fabrics to Be Shipped to Southeast Asia Tomorrow

The China Cotton Textile Production and Sales Joint Corporation, in order to actively promote trade in Southeast Asia, convened an important joint meeting the other night to discuss issues related to exports to Southeast Asia. It was decided that: (1) 268 types of products that have been reviewed and approved for export will be selected, and a number of dozens of each type will be shipped by the company itself to various parts of Southeast Asia tomorrow (12th). (2) Chen Youjun will be appointed to represent the company and will go to Southeast Asia immediately to handle sales matters. (3) The company will request relevant government agencies to provide raw materials and loans so that the factories affiliated with the company can start producing export products as soon as possible.

It is also learned that overseas Chinese importers in Southeast Asia have been sending letters and telegrams to inquire about the establishment of the company. Recently, they plan to send representatives to Shanghai one after another to formally negotiate and place orders with the company. It is also learned that the chairman of the Philippine Importers Association will be coming to Shanghai soon.

### Purchasing Three Batches of Rapeseed, Estimated at 10 Billion Yuan

The Central Trust Bureau's purchase of rapeseed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to increase rapeseed oil production, of which the first and second batches have arrived in Shanghai one after another, totaled approximately 100,000 dan by the 9th, including approximately 30,000 dan from the Pinghu area, 25,000 dan from Wuhu, and 40,000 dan from Suzhou. The total amount is approximately 25 billion yuan. In order to help the government secure a large quantity of essential daily necessities, in addition to continuing to purchase the remaining rapeseed from the above three regions, the bureau will also include Zhujiajiao in the purchase area, and it is estimated that the total amount for the third batch of purchases will be approximately 10 billion yuan. After this work is completed, the purchase will be temporarily suspended.

### Fuzhou Scented Tea in Dire Straits Due to Stagnant Tea Sales

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th] Fuzhou's famous scented tea is currently in the production season, but due to the recent stagnation of tea sales, tea merchants are unwilling to cultivate it, and more than 100,000 tea farmers, flower farmers, and tea workers who depend on it for their livelihoods are in dire straits.

Fuzhou scented tea used to have a large export volume before the war, and sales to the northeastern and northern provinces accounted for the largest share of domestic tea sales. According to statistics, in 1933, Fuzhou's total export value of scented tea reached more than 140,000 piculs, worth more than 60 million yuan. Production and sales declined during the war, and flower farmers removed flower plants and switched to growing grain, and tea merchants went bankrupt. The former prosperity of "flowers as white as snow, fragrance spreading for miles, and tea shops lining the streets with boats like weaving shuttles" has become a historical trace.

After the victory, the scented tea market became active again, and last year tea shops rushed to produce it, hoping to make a huge profit. However, the total output of various scented flowers last year was only more than 7,000 dan. As a result of competitive purchasing, flower prices soared, so the cost of scented tea suddenly increased. In addition, the turmoil caused by the Communist bandits in North China affected sales, which stagnated.

According to investigations, the use of scented flowers to process tea leaves in Fuzhou has been going on for nearly a hundred years. Initially, people from Changle brought jasmine flower seeds back to their hometown from Guangzhou, and planted them for their pure white color and rich fragrance, exclusively for viewing and selling and for women's decoration.

During the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, a merchant from Beijing, Wang Zhengda, brought snuff to Changle and discovered that jasmine flowers had an excellent aftertaste. Tea merchants in Changle then used jasmine flower tea, and sales increased significantly. Tea merchants from Gutian followed suit, and the scented tea manufacturing industry became increasingly popular, leading to a shortage of scented flowers. Farmers in various villages in Fuzhou saw the benefits and planted them one after another. Moreover, due to Fuzhou's convenient transportation and developed trade, tea shops gradually concentrated, making it the main producing area of scented tea.

Subsequently, tea shops began to use various scented flowers to try scenting tea leaves, and it was determined that pomelo flowers, pearl orchids, magnolias, jade orchids, water gardenias, and hawksbill flowers could all be used for scenting, but those made with jasmine and pearl orchid were sold at a better price. Scented tea is divided into two types: "熏" (xun, smoked) and "提" (ti, infused). "熏" refers to removing the residual flowers and then roasting it again, while "提" refers to removing the flowers without roasting. The more times it is smoked, the deeper the flower fragrance penetrates into the tea. After brewing, the fragrance is fragrant and refreshing.

### Hangzhou Tea Industry Declines; Several Tea Shops Have Closed

[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] Hangzhou's tea market this year is weak in sales and difficult to bear the heavy profits. Moreover, the commodity tax has been repeatedly increased, making it difficult to make progress. Due to sparse business in the city, several companies have announced their closure, including Lian Pei Tea Shop, Deda Xin Tea Shop, Tongtai Xiang Hangzhou Branch, Weng Qitai Tea Shop, and Wu Yongtai Tea Zhuang.

### National Treasury Bureau Moves to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The head office of the Central Bank has been ordered to move to Nanjing to work. The National Treasury Bureau was the first to move. The first batch of staff from the bureau moved to Nanjing to work on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month, bringing their office supplies. The director of the bureau, Xiong, and the deputy director, Yu Zhuang, have already gone to Nanjing ahead of schedule, and have established more than 500 sections in Nanjing, including revenue and expenditure accounting, remittance, and documents. The remaining parts are also actively preparing.

### Riding Breeches Cloth Offered at Low Prices

The retail sale and custom tailoring of woolen fabrics were still quiet yesterday. However, jobbers showed some activity. Old goods were being cleared, and autumn and winter goods were successively put on the market. The prices of "Zhenshi" (genuine) woolen cloth and broadcloth have improved a lot since buyers from Sichuan, Changsha, and Xi'an procured them last week, and the market remained firm yesterday. Riding breeches cloth and camel cashmere were also discussed at recent tea gatherings, and their prices were far cheaper than Zhenshi woolen cloth. (In the past, riding breeches cloth was priced alongside Zhenshi woolen cloth, and sometimes even exceeded it.) Consignment sales were quoted at less than 500,000 yuan. The reason for this is that the popularity of Melton overcoats and long robes has led to a sharp decrease in the actual sales of riding breeches cloth and camel cashmere overcoats.

### U.S. Wood Oil Consumption Soars

[United Press, San Francisco, 8th] According to Logan, president of the Pinghe Vegetable Oil Company, a major U.S. tung oil importer, U.S. tung oil consumption has soared, with the amount of tung oil used to make paint currently reaching 7 million pounds per month. The consumption of tung oil for a whole year before the war was only 12 million pounds. According to the Department of Commerce, the value of tung oil loaded and unloaded at various wharves in San Francisco this year is more than US$5.1 million, which is more than the total imports for the entire year of 1946.

### Chinese Modern Women Writers' Novel Collection - Preface to "Untitled Collection"

— Zhao Qingge

Strictly speaking, there are not many truly accomplished writers in modern China's literary and artistic circles, and even fewer female writers! If we count the numbers, there have been only a few dozen since the May Fourth Movement. Moreover, many have already stopped writing. In terms of writing, each has its own merits, and all have their own glorious history in Chinese literature. These female writers have also made epoch-making contributions during the evolution of new literary and artistic trends in China. We can briefly list them in periods: Around the May Fourth Movement, female writers were very active, such as Bing Xin, Yuan Changying, Feng Yuanjun, Su Xuelin, Huang Luyin, Chen Hengzhe, Lin Huiyin, Ling Shuhua, Fang Lingru, Mu Jingqing, Lu Xiaoman, and Shen Ying, all of whom were major figures in opposing the old and establishing new literary and artistic standards at the time. Before and after the September 18th Incident, progressive female writers such as Ding Ling, Bai Wei, Wu Sihong, Jing Song, Xie Bingying, and Xiao Hong bravely fought for revolutionary literature against imperialism, achieving great fame for a time. Around the July 7th Incident, An E, Feng Zi, Wang Ying, Bai Lang, Cao Ming, Ge Qin, Luo Hong, Yang Jiang, and others enthusiastically participated in national defense literature for the War of Resistance Against Japan. Naturally, the performances of female writers in each era (I am just listing these female writers' names from memory, omissions are unavoidable, but certainly not intentional) were not limited to that era. Except for a few who died or changed careers, these female writers continued to contribute with the times.

China was originally a backward country in all aspects, and the Chinese women's community was even more backward! Due to the traditional view that Chinese women have always been neglected by society, female writers were also neglected without exception. However, according to the brief statistics above, although there are few modern Chinese female writers in number, they are not inferior to male writers in writing spirit, so they are worthy of our praise. Due to the neglect of female writers in the Chinese literary world and even the reasons for their existence, there has rarely been a systematic introduction and collection of works by female writers. Occasionally, some selected collections and critical books are published, but they all seem imperfect, lacking in rigor and objectivity. Recognizing this point, Chenguang Bookstore Company felt that from the May Fourth Movement to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today, it seemed to have come to a major conclusion. It was necessary to collect the latest works of new and old female writers over these nearly thirty years in a relatively systematic way, so that readers could glimpse their progress and trends with the evolution of literary and artistic trends! Therefore, they entrusted me to compile this collection.

However, China's current political and economic chaos has created social instability and cultural desolation, especially in literature and art! Literary and artistic writers are under pressure from changes in material and spiritual conditions, unable to write good articles, and even less able to engage in literary and artistic revival activities. Therefore, the decline of literature and art is inevitable; it is unprecedented in the past thirty years. Therefore, during this period, it is already difficult to run a literary and artistic publication, and it is even more difficult to run a more specialized literary and artistic publication!

I remember when Mr. Jia Bi (the publisher of this book) first talked to me about the plan to publish "Chinese Modern Women Writers' Novel Collection," it was still in February of this year. For the sake of friendship with Jia Bi, and for the historical significance of this work, I reluctantly accepted the task despite knowing its difficulty. First of all, contacting the female writers alone took a great deal of effort, because they were scattered all over the country and abroad. After establishing a communication network, we separately solicited manuscripts, specifically asking each of them to write a novel for this collection. Fortunately, they all agreed very kindly (a few did not submit their manuscripts due to illness or busyness). However, it took several months to collect the manuscripts. Despite this, the collection was finally compiled.

As for the content of this collection, there is no need for me to elaborate on it, readers will have their own fair judgment. However, what I need to tell the readers is that every article in this collection is very precious. Ms. Bing Xin has not created novels for many years. This time, after returning to China from Japan, she went to Japan again, regardless of the fatigue of the journey, avoiding the sultry heat, and wrote "Untitled" in sweat. Her writing is concise, and her artistic conception is outstanding, which is truly a rare work. Ms. Feng Yuanjun has not written novels for twenty years. Now she made an exception to write "This One Fallen," which is short and exquisite, simple and skillful! Ms. Yuan Changying has also not written for a long time, but recently completed "Ox" while ill. Ms. Su Xuelin wrote "Huangshan Qi in Jinling Prison" in her busy schedule. The words of the two are more beautiful, and the skills are also very pure, worthy of being from the hands of predecessors. Ms. Chen Xiaoman stopped writing for twenty years, but recently specially wrote "Daughter's Calamity," depicting vividly and delicately. Ms. Lu Jingqing sent the exotic "Riverside Apartment" from England, Ms. Wang Ying sent the retrospective "After Parting" from New York, and Ms. Shen Ying's ethical work "Doll" are all masterpieces that readers have not easily seen in recent years; because the three of them have not held a pen for a long time. In addition, Ms. Bingying's "Divorce," Ms. Fengzi's "Linked Portraits," and Ms. Luo Hong's "Executioner" are all powerful works, each with unique features! As for my own [Boundless Sorrow of Falling Leaves], I am just at the bottom, filling the space. I dare not call myself a writer, but I hope to follow the lead of all the predecessors, learn tirelessly, and achieve a small success in the future.

In order to continue compiling prose, poetry, and drama collections, the female writers invited this time were not widespread. At the same time, the female writers who have already written in this collection will still be invited to participate next time. For example, Ms. Xie Bingxin, Ms. Feng Yuanjun, Ms. Su Xuelin, and Ms. Lu Jingqing can write novels and poems, so they will be indispensable in the poetry collection. Ms. Yuan Changying, Ms. Wang Ying, and others can write novels and dramas, so they will be indispensable in the drama collection. Ms. Shen Ying, Ms. Bingying, Ms. Lu Xiaoman, Ms. Fengzi, and Ms. Luo Hong can write novels and prose, so they will be indispensable in the prose collection. In short, I hope that all the female writers will jointly complete these four volumes. It's just that due to transportation relations, Ms. Ding Ling's work could not be obtained this time, which is really a great regret, but I will still try in the future.

Regarding the editing method of this collection, according to the idea of ​​Baiguang Bookstore Company, imitating the style of European and American publishers, a photo and handwriting of the author are printed before each work. This may not be without someone who wants to slander, but in fact, it is only to strengthen the historical value and give readers a deeper impression. Moreover, a short biography of each author is attached, which is convenient for readers to study each female writer. If someone insists on misunderstanding it as a swindle, then so be it. Anyway, my conscience is clear.

Finally, thank you to all my friends who contributed to this collection! I wish you all forever write well, and forever open up the most brilliant literary and artistic flowers for China! (Late night on the sea, August 1, 1947) (Note: The Untitled Collection is published by Chenguang Bookstore Company and will be published in September)

### Old Words, New Talk

— Li Baifeng

Mr. Wang Jing'an said: "The habits of society kill many good people; the habits of literature kill many geniuses." Although this statement feels bold, after careful consideration, it has a bit of bittersweet self-awareness. Humans are a kind of animal that obeys habits, which is what Mr. Lu Xun meant by "even moving table legs and benches requires bloodshed." This application in literary creation is adherence - adherence to the past and adherence to the present, both are obeying established rules.

Liu Shuqing's lyrics were despised by the literati of the time because they used a lot of colloquialisms. The result of this contempt could not erase the fact that "where there is well water, there is Liu's lyrics." So even Su Xue, who held the reins of the literary world at the time, couldn't help but ask his disciples: "How are my lyrics compared to Liu Qi?"

However, true genius cannot be suppressed. "The willow bank, the morning breeze, and the waning moon" not only spread, but also became the mainstay of Northern Song lyricists using vernacular.

"Fashion" may be good, but don't make the mistake of being trendy. Although novelty sometimes seems isolated and humble, it is still a bit more adorable than a literary figure who floats with the world.

Su Xue's disciples said it well: "Liu's lyrics are suitable for seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls, with red ivory clappers, singing 'The willow bank, the morning breeze, and the waning moon'; Xue's lyrics are suitable for strong men from Guanxi, with copper clappers and iron boards, singing 'The great river flows eastward'!", which illustrates that Su is Su, and Liu is Liu, there is no need to unify the format, "those who are not of my race must have different hearts."

Therefore, genius can not only use form, transform form, but also break through the shackles of form; mediocrity is the opposite.

Yuan Yishan's quatrain on poetry said: "The pond spring grass is a special skill of the Xie family, ten thousand ages and a thousand autumns, the five characters are new; tell Chen Zhengzi, who closes the door, it is a pity to waste his spirit without making up for it." Jing'an said that "the Mengchuang and Yutian generations will not be happy with this sentence." Taking this as a divination, the Southern Song lyrics are indeed inferior to the Northern Song lyrics. Although the style is very different, the hand and eye also feel dusty. There are many painters of beautiful women in the world, but only Fei Xiaoqi and Qiu Shizhou are famous. It is not about skill but about divine understanding. Xiao Xie's "The clear river is as quiet as silk" is a masterpiece of all time. Although Taibai continued it with "Love Dao, the clear river is as quiet as silk, which makes people remember Xie Xuanhui for a long time," it became a dog's tail; Zhu Qingyu's "After dressing up, she asks her husband in a low voice, whether the eyebrows are deep or shallow, in time." The daughter's love is vividly on paper, but Ouyang Yongshu easily changed it to ".........When she comes and goes, she helps each other under the window and loves Dao's eyebrows, deep or shallow, are in time." Then she feels deliberately contrived. Taibai Yongshu, poetry and lyrics are shining for thousands of years, and even a step towards the trend will become Dong Shi.

There is also this feeling in new poems. Balmang's poem:

"The reason why I live

is to love the sun——"

There are as many imitators as the Jiangzhe, but none of them are as inferior as they feel. The reason is also here.

Baishi Mengchuang's lyrics are too ornate, so it is easy to lose its natural beauty. Its "Dark Fragrance" and "Sparse Shadow" are actually derivations of Lin Hejing's "Sparse shadows cross the shallow clear water, and dark fragrance floats in the dim moon." Writing lyrics is like painting, "sparse places can gallop horses, and dense places cannot insert needles." Hejing's poems are already so dense that needles cannot be inserted, and even if they are hung on the national gate, it is impossible to change a word. How can we talk about detailed details?

I love to scribble the most in my life, but I don't leave a word when I go to Qinglian's tomb in Caishiji. Why? I feel that "those who come and go write two lines, and lose the big axe in front of Lu Ban's door"; Tui praises Qing Yun Gongbu for having the "Qing Ting Stone Pillar" proposal. If I write it down, wouldn't it become "Sun Xingzhe travels here"? At most, it will only leave a bit of coquettishness in other people's palms. Why bother?

In Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe" Volume 1, Jean's grandfather was an unknown musician. In his life of depression, he suddenly got a musical genius grandson. The joy is conceivable, but he still couldn't help but secretly add a note to Jean's music, thinking that there was also his own effort in it and secretly feeling relieved. If you don't eliminate this kind of psychology when writing articles, you will never have yourself.

Qing Yun ascended the Yellow Crane Tower and greatly admired Cui Hao's sentence "The ancients have taken the Yellow Crane to go." All day long, "There is a scenery in front of me that I can't say, and Cui Hao wrote a poem on the top." Self-knowledge must be there. Flattery is like a scholar of rotten bean sprouts in Wu Baicai.

Modern people write a lot of poems about "giving to friends" and "travel notes", but they can't innovate and have their own opinions. They only know how to put together a song, which is like drawing a flower nose on their own face, making it look even uglier; "The falling moon fills the beams of the house, and I still suspect that it shines on my face." The affection is deep and the words are sincere, a masterpiece of all time; "The Qi steams Yunmengze, and the waves shake Yueyang City." The thousands of miles of Dongting Lake are all under the pen; ...... Thinking of this, it is better to put down the bald pen and read more ancient poems until you really have something to say, and then, like Huang Zhengze, "I write with my mouth, how can he restrain me...", even if it doesn't catch the eye of high-ranking elegant scholars, why not learn from Banqiao and write two Daqing songs, sing and enjoy yourself?

Celebrating the Fiftieth Birthday of Layman Dingshan

Looking at the high-rise building from a distance, an old man with a turban talks eloquently (in 1939, you set up a seat in Dingshan, with dozens of disciples, often welding late at night and talking tirelessly.); residual emotions are carried, millenniums are pressed to the beat, inner family singing and dancing; silk and satin good nights, flying cups and drunken moon; still composing now (you are good at music, the gathering of skirts and shoes in Dingshan Hall, the red ivory singing pipes, often until late at night). Leading the deep banquet, black silk red sleeves, how elegant, astonishing the parrot. Are the flags and banners of the strong years still there? The old military参前语 (Xu Shiying sent you to Japan as a secretary, and Zhang Zhizhong stationed troops in Shanghai and sent you as a staff officer, but you refused.) Vermilion gate willow courtyard, late night lights; lingering on the Jiang Road. Weary eyes are dispelled, returning clouds are stretched, how many national affairs (since returning from Dian and Shu, the Hangzhou Municipal Government hired you as the director of the local history museum, but you also refused, and became more dedicated to poetry and painting. People called you Mr. Dingshan). A date to sing in Lantian, in the bamboo forest of Cuo Garden, let's go boating together (you have another property on the lake, and you once invited me to the trap, which is seen in poetry).

Responding to Xin Yuansheng's Gift

Yuan Long is not a hero, thirty years of lakes and seas dissipated his heroic spirit; looking at the scenery in the high autumn, how many lines of wild geese are worth sending? The south province writes in the air, the east mountain affairs are gone, there are still guest plays; where is the mournful zither, under the cherry trees, empty with prostitutes. Betting on the flag pavilion under the sun is over, singing Yangguan's setting sun has no end; Pu Qingmu is green, how many setting sun flying rides in the middle of the view; the trap west of the lake is drawn· the turban is alone; the water grass Xiaosi, the remaining emerald ink in the world, the Songxi sends dreams, and the wine is titled　.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 369

— Ye Jingfeng

"Here, hey!... Liang Qun and Little Tiger Lu entered the hostel, and were walking in when they suddenly heard the person calling them shouting behind them.

The two turned around and saw the receptionist standing in the doorway of a room inside the gate, standing upright, indicating that the two should go to the room first. This is the color of the new paint. Yaoqun didn't know, so he had to invite Little Tiger to turn back and walk back.

"Traveler Registration Office", a small wooden sign hung on the door, with these words painted on the sign.

"Where are you from?" An old fellow with glasses, sitting behind a desk, looked at Yaoqun and Little Tiger with the air of interrogating prisoners, his voice a bit Japanese-accented. On the desk was a large stack of booklets printed in the form of a list. It seemed that each page of each booklet had many items that had to be filled in. If each page of each booklet was asked like this, it would take at least several tens of minutes to fill in.

Even if Longqun had good patience, understood the situation, and knew that this was a way of life under the trampling of iron hooves; but after more than thirty hours of slow car journeys, and having been supporting herself under tense low pressure, she thought that she had reached a station where she could take a temporary breather, but unexpectedly, such a gloomy set came again. Even if she wanted to be more wronged and endure it, I am afraid that the overly tense mood would inevitably have a rebellious reaction.

The whole Little Tiger Lan can be said to be the embodiment of a violent bomb. Along the way, in this journey of more than thirty hours, there were many stimulating impacts that could trigger his explosiveness, but they were all controlled by Jiqun, reducing the amount of his explosion; he himself also had a sweet fantasy and a high pressure of a secret mission to help him control his fire. But this (eye) in front of him was indeed something that he couldn't swallow.

At this time, this violent bomb seemed to have suffered the greatest impact and had reached the sharp peak of explosion. Suppose that Yaoqun glared at the old fellow who asked the question at this time, or gave a sneer, or made any resistive small movement, there is no doubt that Little Tiger must have jumped forward...

But what would be the consequences of this leap forward? Yaoqun and Little Tiger, relying on their wit and bravery, may be able to get away with it; they can rush to the old village overnight, but you must know that at this time, Shenyang is the second largest rear defense of the Japanese army, the headquarters of the "Expeditionary Force", and all the demons and evil spirits are gathered in this country. There must be a strict and thorough security arrangement; although the surface is calm, the more calm it is, the more sinister and terrible the hidden institutions are.

Even if Yaoqun Little Tiger can escape, this hostel is finished. The old fellow who is in charge of registering travelers in this hostel is just a tentacle drawn from the central agency. If this tentacle is moved, the entire arrangement will naturally be affected; this hostel is the center of the accident. Let's say that these two travelers, whose names are not even known, the place where the accident occurred, according to the usual insidious and brutal personality of the Japanese devils, will inevitably be implicated. That blockade, search, false accusation, suspicion, and other unreasonable actions will inevitably be staged step by step. According to a casual estimate, there are at least dozens of people in the hostel's duties, including the innocent travelers, who will suffer innocent disasters. It really corresponds to the saying that "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the pond are affected."

### Scientists Should Speak Up!

— Liu Xian

This time, President Truman sent special envoy General Wedemeyer to China to conduct inspections. As soon as he got off the car, he made a statement saying that the task of this trip was to interview facts, collect materials, and solicit opinions, so that he could bring them to Washington as a reference for the United States to redefine its policy towards China, or even the Far East. In the past ten days, General Wei and his party have visited Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Shen, Bi, Han, Chongqing, Guangdong, Taiwan and other places, and have had frequent contact with all walks of life in our country. It is said that they have obtained many valuable reports and materials. Our country's industrial, commercial, and financial circles, and government departments, have successively provided various reports on politics, diplomacy, military affairs, transportation, and economy. Various parties have also published some opinions on improving politics. Wei has consulted extensively, is tireless in seeking details, and listens with an open mind. He does not express his own opinions, and strives to make the public's opinions and true public opinion put forward without reservation and played without scruples. This is a very enlightened approach and a very democratic expression.

At a time when all parties are offering opinions, what we regret is that until now, we have not heard the voice of the scientific community, and we have not seen any scientists from Yanqiao express some opinions on science. Are we not hoping for American aid? Is it difficult to say that our fragmented, poor, and weak scientific undertakings are not in need of practical help? Furthermore, in terms of improving the national economy and people's livelihood and promoting the great cause of nation-building, which field can do without science? Now that the United States has a plan to assist China's revival, science must occupy an important part. Moreover, the United States is a country with a very developed science, and everyone knows the importance of science. The opinions of our scientific community will definitely be valued by the Americans. We should seek truth from facts, consider the national conditions, and take advantage of this good opportunity to provide some opinions and plans for China's construction of science, so as to be a reference for General Wei. Time waits for no one, and it will be gone in a flash. I think that all scientific institutions, scientific groups, and individual scientists across the country should speak up!

### The Scientific Method of Detecting Lies

— Liang Mu

In recent years, scientists have invented several machines to detect lies, and the results of the experiments are quite astonishing. Various newspapers and magazines have published articles about these machines, and many foreign machinery companies sell them, so let's not dwell on that. Now, let's talk about some interesting stories related to this issue.

Ancient savages knew how to deceive people with lies. However, at that time, there were no good methods to test whether a person's words were lies. Except for those who were not accustomed to lying, when their words were discovered to be inconsistent, they would blush, stammer, be at a loss, and speak incoherently. In such cases, people could immediately see that they were lying. However, those who were accustomed to lying and good at deceiving not only remained composed but could also justify themselves, making people believe them even more, unaware of being deceived. When ordinary people lie, even if they can remain composed, many internal changes occur in their bodies, such as an increased blood circulation, leading to blushing, rapid breathing, and a dry mouth, among other phenomena. Therefore, in ancient China, there was a special method for judging criminals: during questioning, the criminal was made to chew a mouthful of rice, and then asked to spit it out to see if it was drier than usual. If it was drier than usual, it proved that the person was lying and must have committed a crime. There were also some superstitious people who, when they told a lie and did not admit it, if asked to swear to heaven, to a lamp, or to the idols in a temple, would panic, turn pale, and show that they dared not swear, proving that they were lying and deceiving.

In ancient times, people also used psychological methods to detect lies. There is a very interesting story about psychological methods. This story is about an Indian prince who used a very clever method to find the real criminal from among many suspects. His method was to confine these suspects in a room, make them stand facing the wall with their hands behind their backs, and then tell them that there was a sacred donkey in the next room. If the person who committed the crime pulled its tail, it would bray loudly. Each person, in turn, went to pull the donkey's tail and then returned to their original position, standing with their hands behind their backs. As a result, everyone pulled the donkey's tail, but the donkey did not bray. Then the prince came over and asked everyone to stretch out their hands. He immediately knew who the real criminal was. It turned out that when he asked them to pull the donkey's tail, the Indian prince had smeared some black color on the donkey's tail. Everyone who was innocent had their hands covered in black, except for the real criminal, who had no black on his hands at all. This was because of his psychological reaction. He knew he had committed the crime and was afraid that if he pulled the donkey's tail, the donkey would bray and the prince would know he was the criminal, so he dared not pull it. The Indian prince used this psychology and their superstition to identify the criminal.

In ancient times, people had simple minds and were superstitious about ghosts and gods, so psychological or superstitious methods could be used to detect them. Nowadays, people are neither superstitious nor unintelligent, so this method is no longer effective. Therefore, scientists have recently been researching how to use scientific methods to detect lies and have invented several machines. The results of the experiments are very promising. If these machines are foolproof and can be widely adopted, it may be a great contribution to the judicial system in judging criminals. In Europe, people have been researching machines to detect lies for two or three hundred years, but only in recent decades have there been scientific machines and reliable experiments.

In 1922, William Moulton Marston of the Psychology Laboratory at Harvard University in the United States began his research. He conducted many experiments, and as a result, he found that whenever someone lied, their body underwent changes, the most obvious of which was an increase in blood pressure. In 1914, Vittorio Benussi in Graz, Austria, invented a method for detecting lies. The principle he based it on was that when a person lies, their breathing inevitably speeds up, and this acceleration can be measured very accurately. Three years later, Harold Burtt improved Benussi's method in the laboratory at Harvard University. In 1921, Dr. John Larson, in collaboration with the famous criminologist August Vollmer in California, USA, invented a machine for detecting lies called the Erlanger Sphygmomanometer and experimented on many criminals and suspects. The results of the experiments were also very accurate. In 1925, L. Keeler of Stanford University invented a machine called the Polygraph. Keeler became a professor of criminology at Northwestern University in the United States in 1930 and was a world-renowned criminologist. This machine also measures changes in blood pressure and breathing when a person lies. This type of machine is now widely used. Among similar machines, if used properly, this machine is the most reliable. (1)

### Powerful Liquid Explosive

— Bai Gao

Although we are in the atomic age and have atomic bombs, do we still need other explosives? It is questionable how many countries can actually manufacture atomic bombs. Therefore, the liquid explosive I am talking about here is also a novel piece of knowledge.

Lester P. Barlow and his colleague R. G. Holderer have invented a liquid carbon explosive. This explosive is a new type of liquid carbon gas explosive called "Glimite," and its destructive power is truly astonishing. It can cause all people and animals within a circular area with a radius of one thousand feet, centered on the point of explosion, to perish together.

We invited several journalists to observe the results of bombing with this explosive. To prove that this bomb is not affected by fire and vibration, they burned the bombs, shot bullets into the bombs, and fired them from a mortar to a height of five hundred feet, causing them to impact a steel plate and bounce three hundred feet. None of these actions resulted in an explosion. According to Barlow, this explosive is made by absorbing carbon and other secret substances into liquid gas, and its explosive force will not degrade until it is saturated and left for thirty hours. Liquid gas explosives have been used for a long time, but this liquid gas carbon explosive has a greater destructive power due to its extremely high pressure. Another advantage of this explosive is its low production cost. It is said that it costs only four and a half US dollars per pound.

### The Total Mobilization of Soviet Geographers During the War

— Yan Deyi

The completion of the new map of Kazakhstan is a crystallization of this great work. Various maps with scales of 1:1,000,000 to 1:5,000,000 have been surveyed and drawn. Data on resource surveys have been compiled into a new geographical circle of Kazakhstan, which will soon be printed. This kind of practical investigation of original data is extremely valuable.

The Soviet Geographical Research Institute's research on this new region focuses on three key points: industrial development, transportation construction, and urban design. Almaty, originally a village in the Central Asian grasslands, has now been built into the capital of the Kazakh Republic. Its location is a joint transportation station for international traffic between the Soviet Union and Xinjiang, making it a new international contact city in Central Asia.

Before 1941, the geography of Kazakhstan was one of the least documented areas on Earth. Now, it is becoming the most meticulously studied geographical unit in regional geographical research in the world. Not only is its geographical research an innovation in academia, but in terms of scientific application, the creation of "regional design" work is the highest achievement in geographical research methods. When the Kazakh Republic held its 25th anniversary celebration in November 1943, the Soviet Geographical Research Institute specially exhibited a portion of its academic achievements. The scale of operation of the Kazakh Republic and the establishment of its capital, Almaty, immediately demonstrated the achievements of practical undertakings. Geographical research work is a pioneer in modern regional design, which is thought-provoking.

In addition to Kazakhstan, geographical research in Central Asia is also being carried out in its adjacent areas, such as northern Kyrgyzstan in the south, and Omsk, Chelyabinsk, and Kurgan in the north. At the same time, it has also made contributions to the Altai Mountains and the Fergana Valley. The geography within the territory of the Turkmen Republic is the responsibility of the Department of Economic Geography of Moscow University. For the past three years, it has been working in cooperation with the Geographical Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the results are also considerable.

Before the outbreak of World War II, the Soviet Geographical Research Institute was already engaged in the study of inland depression areas. It had attempted to utilize the water power of the Caspian Sea to irrigate the adjacent Kara-Bogaz-Gol depression and develop its iron ore and sulfide resources. After 1943, as the war situation improved, the central work of the Soviet Geographical Research Institute shifted to focusing on the reconstruction work of the Donets Basin and the central industrial area near Moscow.

The diligent contributions of Soviet geographers greatly benefited strategic and tactical aspects during the war, and were highly valued by the military authorities. A military geographical research association was formally established, and geographers were often invited to discuss specialized military issues and express their opinions. Military experts were sent to participate in geographical expeditions to new areas, and geography lectures were established in military schools at all levels across the country to popularize military geographical education. The emphasis on wartime geographical research achievements can be imagined.

The above is not an exhaustive account of all the wartime work of Soviet geographers, as they also devoted much effort to participating in geographical research in the polar regions. After the victory, shifting from wartime work to peacetime work, the Soviet geographical field will continue to study problems in physical geography and historical geography from a purely scientific standpoint. This is the recent view of Grigoriev, the director of the Geographical Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. (End)
