### Discussion of Peace Proposals to be Presented at Today's Meeting; Conference to Adjourn Tonight After Electing Resident Committee Members

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The review of the peace proposals was completed at 11:00 AM on the 1st. The Special Review Committee held its first meeting on the evening of the 31st, preliminarily deciding on the principles for drafting review opinions and designating personnel to draft the resolution of review opinions. This drafting committee convened on the morning of the 1st, engaging in careful discussions and adding details. It was then submitted to the second meeting of the Special Review Committee at 8:00 PM for discussion. Mr. Hu Jianzhong chaired the meeting. After thorough discussion, a conclusion was reached and the meeting adjourned at around 11:00 PM. Many members spoke extensively during the meeting, and the discussions were heated. Mr. Han Fu'e had raised issues related to student protests and newspapers, but they were rejected. Ultimately, the draft of the drafting committee was slightly revised in wording and passed, scheduled for discussion at the general meeting on the 2nd.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The full text of the review opinions on the various peace proposals decided by the Special Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference on the evening of the 1st is as follows:

We have listened attentively to Chairman Chiang of the National Government's address at the opening of this conference on May 20th, stating "to seek the realization of peaceful unification with unwavering determination." Furthermore, we have also listened to Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan's political report to this conference, which also reiterated "regarding the CCP issue, the government is determined to pursue peace, sparing no effort to compromise and tolerate, and adhering to its original intention of a political solution." We are deeply gratified. At the same time, the 20 proposals related to the peace issue submitted by members of this conference, although differing in form, all share a profound understanding of the suffering of the people and the desire for peaceful unification. As the highest representative body of public opinion in the country, this conference should echo the calls of the people, make consistent efforts, and contribute peace strategies to the government and the CCP on behalf of the people. As long as we follow the path of peace and engage in sincere negotiations, it will not be difficult to overcome the current difficulties. We should understand the people's desire for relief from war and aspire for governance, and make appeals that meet the needs and can be implemented immediately. Therefore, based on the spirit of the proposals of the members of this conference, we summarize the following points, hoping for their rapid realization: (1) Request the government to reiterate to China and foreign countries its continued commitment to the policy of "resolving the CCP issue through political means." (2) Request the CCP to promptly send representatives to Nanjing to resume peace talks with the government unconditionally. Based on the principles of "political democratization and nationalization of the military," actively research, discuss, and rapidly implement these principles. (3) After the closure of this conference, the presidium and resident committee of this conference shall continue to strive for the promotion of peace in the spirit of the resolutions of this conference.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The fourth session, third meeting, of the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to hold its closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 2nd. By the afternoon of the 1st, nearly 400 proposals had been passed at this conference, with fewer than 100 remaining. It is expected that the remaining proposals will be discussed and completed at the general meeting on the morning and afternoon of the 2nd. The peace plan formulated by the Special Review Committee will also be presented at the morning session on the 2nd. After holding the general meeting in the afternoon, the closing ceremony will be held immediately. The chairman presiding over the closing ceremony is planned to be Wu Yifang.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] All councilors are scheduled to visit the Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 3rd. The Councilors' Association is scheduled to hold a dinner gathering at the Great Hall on the 2nd.

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Political Consultative Conference will continue to hold general meetings on the morning and afternoon of the 2nd to discuss proposals and elect resident committee members. After the afternoon meeting, the conference will adjourn immediately without holding a separate closing ceremony.

### Military and Police Entering Lushun and Dalian: Sino-Soviet Negotiations Continue; Foreign Minister Wang Answers Questions from Councilors

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] During the foreign affairs report on the 22nd of the Political Consultative Conference, councilors Wang Weixin and Wang Yuyang, among others, raised questions regarding the recovery of Lushun and Dalian and Dalian's access to the sea. Foreign Minister Wang submitted a written response on the 1st, stating in brief: "Over the past year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has strived to ensure the strict implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance by both sides. The Soviet side has announced the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops that entered the Northeast provinces during the war in May of last year. Regarding our recovery of Lushun and Dalian, we have repeatedly consulted with the Soviet side in the past two months. The Soviet side has expressed its willingness to assist us in the recovery work, but opinions on the entry of our military and police into Lushun and Dalian have not yet fully aligned. We have now decided to first send an inspection team by warship to Dalian for inspection. At the same time, we will continue to consult with the Soviet government on the points where our opinions still differ, in order to achieve a solution in the near future. As for the question of the CCP using Dalian to obtain arms supplies, the government has paid close attention and will take necessary measures upon verification."

### Lushun and Dalian Inspection Team to Depart from Shenyang Today

[Report from Our Shenyang Office, 1st] The Lushun and Dalian inspection team, consisting of ten members plus staff, is scheduled to depart from Shenyang by train on the 2nd, heading south to a certain port, and then transfer to our warship to Lushun and Dalian.

[Report from Our News Desk] Our reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Zhengting yesterday, asking for his opinion on the proposal in the Political Consultative Conference to amend the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Mr. Wang declined to give a direct answer, only saying that such major issues should be considered calmly, otherwise it would increase the difficulties for those in charge.

### We Continue to Collect Information on Dismantled Industrial Equipment

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] In Foreign Minister Wang's written response to the Political Consultative Conference on the 1st, the issue of the Soviet Union's removal of factory equipment from the Northeast was addressed. This case was raised by councilors Wang Guoyuan and Liang Shangdong. According to the response: "Regarding the Soviet army's removal of factory machinery and equipment during their stay in the Northeast, this Ministry has repeatedly declared our solemn position to the Soviet side. We disagree with the Soviet side's view that some Japanese industrial assets in the Northeast should be treated as war booty by the Soviet army, as it exceeds the scope recognized by international law and international custom. Therefore, we have repeatedly expressed our disagreement. The UK and the US also agree with our position. We are now contacting the relevant authorities and conducting investigations and collecting various data as the basis for continued negotiations."

### US Military Extraterritoriality Case Reserved After Vote

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] During the discussion of proposals related to judicial administration at the Political Consultative Conference on the afternoon of the 1st, the proposal by Chen Yaodong that "US military personnel in China should obey Chinese law and requesting the National Government to explicitly abolish the 'Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of US Military Personnel in China' to restore national sovereignty" sparked a heated debate. When explaining this case, Mr. Chen pointed out that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, for the sake of facilitating joint operations, our government had promulgated the "Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of US Military Personnel in China" in October of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], with its validity period stipulated to end six months after the end of the joint operations. Subsequently, the National Government explicitly extended it for another year on March 3rd of last year. During this year, criminal cases of US military personnel infringing upon the Chinese people have been numerous. However, the US military courts have disregarded Chinese public opinion and anger, and even declared the defendants not guilty. That foreigners committing crimes in the host country should be subject to the laws of that country is a major principle of international law. The application of the regulations during the joint operations of the two countries was originally an unavoidable expedient measure. Now, a considerable period has passed since the end of the war, but the regulations are still applied as usual, which not only infringes upon our sovereignty but also sets a bad precedent in international law. Therefore, the regulations should be explicitly abolished. He further explained that the method would be: to request the National Government to immediately abolish the Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of US Military Personnel in China and to notify the US government to inform its personnel in China that they should immediately obey Chinese law.

Convener Jiang Yiping refuted from a legal point of view, pointing out that according to international law, troops stationed in foreign countries should enjoy extraterritorial rights. For example, if our country were to station troops in Japan in the future, it would also enjoy such privileges. This matter is of great importance and should be reserved for further consideration. Others also stood up to speak. In the end, after a vote, according to the review opinion, the case was reserved.

### Regulation of Commercial Banks Discussed at the Political Consultative Conference Yesterday

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Whether the government should relax the restrictions on commercial banks, still adhering to a strict policy, was also one of the topics debated at the Political Consultative Conference on the afternoon of the 1st. Those in favor of strictly regulating commercial banks included Chen Gengya and Wu Wangji, among others. Mr. Chen believed that many commercial banks and money shops approved by the Ministry of Finance during the War of Resistance Against Japan sprang up like mushrooms after rain, establishing branches everywhere. Those with insufficient capital relied on absorbing large amounts of deposits and channeling them into speculative markets to engage in illegal businesses, searching and seizing materials everywhere, stimulating prices, hoarding, and monopolizing the market. If they are not regulated, the danger is unimaginable. Wu Wangji also believed that commercial banks are the main base of bureaucratic capital and should be strictly regulated, which may also be a way to support legitimate banking. Those holding the opposite view included Wang Guanying, among others. Wang believed that banks and money shops that had suspended operations due to the War of Resistance should be allowed to resume business. Wang Dequan also suggested that the Ministry of Finance should relax the restrictions on provincial banks and commercial banks, allowing them to establish institutions in various places in order to develop local economic finance. During the discussion, due to conflicting review opinions, Luo Heng raised questions, hoping that the meeting would have a consistent position on the regulation of commercial banks and that it should be consistent with the past tightening policies advocated by the Political Consultative Conference. It was decided that the five cases related to the regulation of commercial banks would be resubmitted to the Fourth Review Committee for review. The committee is scheduled to meet on the evening of the 1st, and the results of the review are expected to be presented to the general meeting on the 2nd.

### National Constitutionalism Society Issues Opinions on the Current National Situation

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The National Constitutionalism Society is an organization formed by representatives to the National Assembly, with branches throughout the country and tens of thousands of members. Recognizing the seriousness of the current situation, they have issued for the first time "Opinions on the Current National Situation," first stating the desire and need for peace by the people and the government. When reviewing the responsibility for the war, the article stated that the government had made final efforts after each failed peace talk and hoped to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an in person to try to break the final deadlock. To this day, the government has repeatedly stated that it will resolve the issue through political means, while the CCP still insists on its two conditions. It is very clear which side is closing the door to negotiations. Secondly, in fact, the CCP-occupied areas are continuing to expand their military without limit, preparing for a long-term, large-scale civil war. We can only create an atmosphere of peace in the government-controlled areas and shout slogans against conscription and civil war, but who has ever heard of anyone in the CCP area opposing their actions? Who does not need peace? Who is resolutely engaged in civil war? The ultimate goal of the CCP is to attempt to drag down the government through a long-term civil war. Making peace with the CCP is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger. The Chinese civil war has an international background, which CCP's Zhou Enlai has openly admitted. In the past, the CCP had no military force in the Northeast. Now, not only does it have one, but it is still able to launch large-scale offensives after each defeat. Fierce battles are currently taking place in Shandong. Where does the military supplies come from, and Mongolians and Koreans are also participating in the Communist army in the Northeast. Understanding these facts can reveal the true picture of the Chinese civil war today. The article concluded that if our understanding is correct, today's problem is no longer a domestic problem, and the core issue is not the issue of war and peace, but whether to have a motherland or not. We believe that solving the civil war requires improving and reforming domestic affairs, but the key still lies in diplomacy, which is the correct approach to reality. So-called peace talks are like climbing a tree to catch fish. We acknowledge that the sincere and pure youth who voiced such calls did so out of love for the country and the people. However, if adults with political minds also make such claims, it is either foolishness or ulterior motives. We have this confidence and are willing to teach the people of the country with it. We hope that all people across the country who truly love the country and the people will rise up and vigorously supervise the improvement of politics and correct the errors in foreign policy.

### Issue of Pardoning Traitors: Heated Debate at the Political Consultative Conference, Original Proposal Reserved After Final Vote

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The issue of pardoning traitors sparked a heated debate at the Political Consultative Conference when it met on the afternoon of the 1st. Legal experts such as Jiang Yiping, Yan Shumo, and Zhang Shizhao cited classics and displayed their eloquence. The National Assembly Hall almost became a courtroom of the High Court, which was also one of the great stories of this conference. This heated debate was caused by Zhang Bangzhen's criticism of Zhang Shizhao's proposal. Zhang's proposal requested the government to expand the scope of amnesty, so that all crimes committed before the end of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], except for killing direct relatives and war criminals, would be handled separately in accordance with the two categories of the amnesty decree, A and C, in order to show leniency and usher in a new beginning. Zhang Bangzhen believed that if traitors were also included in the amnesty, wouldn't it encourage future generations to become traitors? It would be absolutely impermissible, and the review opinion actually said that its "intentions are good," which is really inconceivable. Convener Jiang Yiping explained that the intention of the original proposal was to enable people in the occupied areas who were forced to collaborate with the enemy to be given leniency and reduced punishment, because they were mostly small flies who had no choice but to be dragged into the water. Now, nearly a million people are imprisoned, while big traitors are able to roam free. Wouldn't this encourage everyone to become a big traitor when a third world war breaks out? Zhang Bangzhen retorted that the conveners of the review committee were all lawyers, so were they defending the traitors? Zhao Shu, Wu Chunwu, and others also stood up to speak, advocating that the government should severely punish major traitors such as Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun. Finally, the original proposer, Zhang Shizhao, was publicly invited to explain, and the entire audience listened to the eloquent words of this generation of legal scholars with a feeling of watching a good show. Zhang pointed out with a compassionate tone that, according to statistics, there are no fewer than a million people nationwide who are suspected of being traitors, and their daughters alone number at least two million. The descendants of traitors are also citizens of the Republic of China, and many are engaged in patriotic work. Simply because their fathers and brothers were unworthy, they have no face to see the world. If we put them all in the list of shame, it would not only affect history but also affect the future of the nation. Even in general, the common traitors were just fellow countrymen who failed to move west with the government at the time, and drifted into the occupied areas, reaching two hundred million people. A small number of those people who collaborated with the enemy were forced to do so. The government's underground work relied heavily on them. It would be unfair and unreasonable not to grant them amnesty, hence this proposal. After Zhang finished speaking, Zhang Bangzhen and others still disagreed. In the end, after a vote, the original proposal was reserved.

### Kong Geng's Humorous Proposal: Requesting Treatment for China's Current Three Major Diseases, Resolution Sent to the Government for Serious Attention

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The title of Kong Geng's proposal is "Requesting Prompt Treatment for China's Current Three Major Diseases to Save the National Crisis." The so-called three major diseases are "democracy disease, economic disease, and military disease." The former is the root cause, and the latter two are symptomatic diseases. The root cause must be treated with a radical cure, and the symptomatic diseases must be treated with a palliative cure. The radical cure will take at least ten years, and the palliative cure will take at least three months. It also stated that the lack of democratic cultural knowledge is the disease of ignorance, the lack of democratic economic capacity is the disease of poverty, and the lack of democratic knowledge is that various parties recognize political parties as democracy, which is the disease of putting the cart before the horse. The whole text is extremely humorous. As a result of the discussion, it was sent to the government for serious attention.

### Proposal to Prohibit Commercial Dancing Referred to the Government for Consideration

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The proposal by Zhang Zhijiang and others, "Requesting the government to issue a general order to all provinces and cities strictly prohibiting commercial mixed-gender dancing to promote proper social customs and correct habits," was passed at the 16th session in the morning of the 1st and referred to the government for consideration. The fervent discussion of this proposal was the only interlude in this morning's meeting. Zhang Zhijiang, the original proposer of the motion, had previously submitted a "ban dancing" proposal during the Third Plenary Session, which was rejected. Now, he resubmitted it to the Senate. The review committee, after deliberation, believed that with social progress and young people's social interaction moving toward the right track, the proposal was unnecessary to recommend to the government, and therefore suggested "reservation." However, after it was presented at the general assembly on the 1st, Zhang Zhijiang spoke twice, explaining the importance of prohibiting commercial mixed-gender dancing. Subsequently, many others spoke, and the discussion lasted for a quarter of an hour. The atmosphere at the meeting became heated and tense. The main argument of the proposal was that Western customs are different, and Western dancing is completely incompatible with Chinese sentiments. It elaborated on the virtues of ancient Chinese ritual music, believing that "since the implementation of Western dancing in China, it has indeed fostered lewdness, not only squandering money but also destroying a sense of shame, corrupting morals, and causing numerous malpractices." "The matter of mixed-gender dancing, from a human perspective, should be absolutely prohibited. Mixed-gender dancing is not only a matter of giving and receiving but also increases intimacy and friction, not only removing preventative measures but also opening the door to convenience and indulging in carnal desires." When Zhang made his explanation, he loudly invoked the ancient teaching of "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving," explaining the issue of friction during dancing. Subsequently, Liao Xuezhuan also spoke, stating that "everyone is falling in love at the dance halls," vividly and dramatically, eliciting laughter from the audience. Although Fang Shaoyun, the convener, explained the review process and opinions, opinions in the meeting were clearly divided into two factions: one advocating for reservation, admiring Western civilization, and the other advocating for referring it to the government for consideration, harking back to history and praising China's inherent ritual music. In the end, it was put to a vote. The first vote, with 182 people present, resulted in 90 votes for referring it to the government, which should have been rejected due to it being a minority, but due to the majority of people believing that the count was incorrect and the report was inaccurate, a revote was requested. The result was that only 69 votes favored reservation, and the amended proposal was ultimately passed and referred to the government for consideration, concluding a storm and an interlude.

### Fierce Fighting on the Jihai Railway Line; Shenyang Declares Special Martial Law from Yesterday; National Army Forces on the Changchun-Shenyang Line Approach Gongzhuling

[Our Changchun Correspondent, 1st] The battle for the Changtu Railway Station and surrounding areas has reached its climax, with the Communist army's 5th Artillery Regiment participating in the fighting. Furthermore, the Communist army southeast of Siping continues to move south.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] According to intelligence obtained by relevant authorities here, over 5,000 Communist soldiers besieging Changtu surrendered to the defending National Army on the 31st.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 1st] The fighting on the Jihai Railway Line is intensifying. Fierce battles are taking place in Panshi, Huadian, and Meihekou. Bloodshed has raged for four days and nights on the outskirts of Panshi, with approximately 5,000 Communist soldiers involved. Huilong is currently calm, but the area south from Luhe River to outside Meihekou is entirely controlled by the Communist army.

### Students in Nanjing, Shanghai, North China, and Other Places Decide to Cancel Parades Today and Suspend Strikes from Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The "Joint Student Association of the Five Regions of Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan" has decided to suspend strikes starting from the 3rd, and the planned parade on the 2nd has also been canceled. Representatives of the Student Association hosted journalists at the National Central University on the evening of the 1st to announce the above measures. According to Zhu Chengxue, the vice chairman of the standing committee of the National Central University Student Self-Government Association, the primary reason for the occurrence of this incident was insufficient communication between the government and students. He also stated that this student movement was no different from past student movements. Petitioning the government was a sign of trust in the government, and the demands raised were for the benefit of all students. As for the final occurrence of the incident, it was due to the inability of the Executive Yuan authorities and the police and military authorities to cooperate. They expressed hope that cooperation could be achieved in the future. As for the originally planned parade on the 2nd, it was in response to the parade called for by Peking University and did not consider the significance of the day. However, after persuasion from the authorities of various schools, the Legislative Yuan, and the Senate, the decision was made to stop it, but the originally raised demands will continue to be reasonably negotiated. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM, the Student Association will hold a "Anti-Civil War, Anti-Hunger, Anti-Atrocities" rally in the Great Hall of National Central University to mourn the compatriots who died in the civil war, and will invite legislators, senators, and professors from various schools to speak.

The notice stated: "The naming ceremony was not reported to the school in advance, and the naming of the school buildings at will, as well as the raising of flags, is inappropriate. Students usually love the school, and it is hoped that they will be mindful of the environment and not act rashly."

[Our Guilin Correspondent, 1st] The authorities of Guangxi University issued a statement today, earnestly advising the students to concentrate on their studies and not to take unnecessary actions.

### Hangzhou Takes Emergency Measures to Arrest Twelve Communist Party Members

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 1st] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has taken emergency measures to maintain social order in Hangzhou City and ensure the stability of the people, arresting twelve Communist underground members. Chairman Shen specially hosted journalists and made a statement, stating in brief: "Recently, the hidden elements of the Chinese Communist Party scattered throughout the rear areas have been instigating in various ways, attempting to strike, close markets, and strike in the 62nd, expanding the disaster. With conclusive evidence, this province, in order to comply with public opinion and ensure social order and the safety of the people, has had to take decisive measures, targeting and eradicating the hidden elements in the city. As of now, military and police agencies have arrested twelve people in order to eliminate harm and avoid the sacrifice of many pure young people being exploited by these individuals, placing the entire society in a state of unrest. However, the government will act with leniency and treat the arrested individuals favorably, hoping that they will thoroughly reflect and repent. If they can sincerely reform, they will be dealt with leniently and given an opportunity to rehabilitate. Those who are deeply poisoned and stubbornly unrepentant will have to be sent to the Chinese Communist Party-occupied areas for isolation. In the future, if any disruption of society occurs that is sufficient to harm social order, it will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the emergency measures for maintaining social order promulgated by the central government, and no tolerance will be shown. It is hoped that the media will promote just arguments, and parents will earnestly advise their children to understand right and wrong, abide by the law, cherish their future, and not be misled by heresies to engage in transgressions, resulting in being caught in the net of the law."

Editorial

### Reflections on Borrowing from the United States

Yesterday, the majority of the Political Consultative Council passed the proposal submitted by Jiang Yong and 80 others, "Please urge the government to quickly launch economic reconstruction work and quickly negotiate loans with the United States for construction purposes." The resolution of the case was sent to the government for quick handling. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the loan is used specifically for construction purposes and does not become bureaucratic capital, the General Assembly resolved that after the loan is established in the future, its use will be supervised by the public opinion organs. Since the promulgation of the Truman Doctrine in the United States, countries such as Greece and Turkey have successively received US economic assistance; even Korea, which is under military rule, has received promises of loans to seek its economic recovery. Our country was the vanguard of the Second World War, lasting for a long time and suffering especially heavy damage. Although the US government has allocated 500 million yuan to help our country's economic recovery, it has not yet been used. Now that the Political Consultative Council is meeting in the capital, the passage of this proposal by a majority is enough to reflect the general public's intention, that is, for the sake of our country's heavy economic construction, our government should immediately negotiate with the United States to use this $500 million loan. The so-called $500 million loan was already reserved by the US Export-Import Bank in April last year. It has been more than a year and it has not been realized. Now the deadline of the end of June is imminent. Therefore, standing in the position of the people, we cannot but express ourselves.

From our country's perspective, although Executive Yuan President Zhang, at the beginning of his tenure, had expounded his position, emphasizing self-reliance and unwilling to rely on foreign debt to make up for the overspending on the budget, he also stated at the same time that our country has a vast area that needs to immediately start economic recovery and construction work, and the expenses required for this kind of work are beyond the current capacity of our treasury. In this case, the US loan is of utmost importance. Therefore, foreign telegrams have repeatedly reported that the loan plan has been submitted to the United States. On the US side, Secretary of State Marshall also declared after returning from Moscow that China hopes to use a portion of the US's $500 million loan and has proposed several plans. Recently, it was reported that Secretary Marshall is now urging the early lending of some loans from the US Export-Import Bank to China to meet the urgent needs of its reconstruction work. At the same time, it has been repeatedly reported that the deadline at the end of June may be extended. Judging from these signs, it can be seen that both sides intend to promote this loan. Even if it may not be fully completed by the end of this month due to procedural reasons, the final result is not difficult to predict.

The reason is very simple. Economics has no national boundaries, and the decline of any part of the world will inevitably affect the rest. With the large population and large market of our country, and in the wake of this long-term war of resistance, with wounds all over the place and extremely low purchasing power, if we do not use methods such as credit or loans to provide adequate assistance, then any country that wants to promote its exports to promote trade between the two countries, thereby venting its high industrial production and maintaining its satisfactory employment situation, is indeed difficult to achieve. Now, the degree of economic damage in various countries after the war is far less than that of our country, but the lack of US dollars and the weakness of purchasing power have made it feel riddled with holes and unable to maintain its international balance, let alone our country, which has been in public and private distress for eight years of resistance?

Since the victory, the monthly customs statistics have clearly shown that the country with the largest import and export figures in our country is the United States. The original trade advantage with China has long been taken over by the United States from Britain and Japan. And now, the country that is relatively wealthy and can lend its surplus funds or materials to our country is undoubtedly only the United States. Therefore, even if the $500 million loan has not been realized before the end of June, it cannot but be extended appropriately to wait for the opportunity to mature. This relationship is not so much one-sided to China as it is mutually beneficial to China and the United States. Anyone with a long-term vision and a deep understanding of the country can see this. Therefore, the reason why US loans today are only lip service and not actual is not in the United States but in China. This is worth our deep reflection.

What has become a problem today is the issue of conditions on the US side, that is, the so-called loan plan, and the issue of use in our country, that is, how to prevent waste and corruption. Now the Political Consultative Council has designated the use as the rapid launch of economic reconstruction work, specifically for construction purposes, and has also resolved that the use will be supervised by public opinion organs. Concerns about waste and corruption can at least be expected to have concrete measures to prevent them. This may also be helpful to the plan required by the US. Because whether the use is proper, whether the expenses are excessive, and whether the people who will be in charge of using the loan in the future will be corrupt are of course the most important points that creditors pay attention to. Once the key points are resolved, the rest can be easily solved.

We are not afraid of the cost here and want to remind everyone to pay attention to the government's ability and efficiency in implementing policies. Because economic construction and reconstruction work are very broad terms. After the war, everything is waiting to be done, but we hope to distinguish the urgency and start with items that are essential to people's livelihood. Those that are grandiose, decorate the facade, or are intended to vent surplus goods should be avoided as much as possible to avoid increasing unnecessary burdens. As for the most urgent and most important economic problem now, it is no more than stabilizing the currency value. If the currency value is unstable, then the price cannot be stabilized, and thus wages, interest rates, foreign exchange, production, import and export, people's lives, and even national finance and social order can hardly be stabilized. Does this loan include a foreign exchange fund? If it is included, what percentage does it account for? This is especially worth paying close attention to. However, since this loan is mainly used for reconstruction, we may not be able to say that it does not have fiscal significance, but in name and meaning, it should mainly aim at the revival of our national economy. But no matter its nature and value, the main key is still the government's certainty and perseverance in implementing policies. If the government is hesitant about a certain policy, or undecided, thinks it is right in the morning and wrong in the evening, goes east today and west tomorrow, not only will it make the people at a loss, gradually develop the habit of despising government orders, but also international friends will feel that our government is wandering on a fork in the road, at a loss, how can we expect them to lend us huge sums of money? It must be known that economic construction after the war is not easy, let alone in a situation where there is destruction by the Communist Party on one side and restrictions by multiple parties on the other. Naturally, it is even more difficult.

Finally, when we review borrowing from the United States, we always believe that the United States should know the principle that "timely medicine can cure diseases and save people," while in our country, we should reflect deeply that only a strong and efficient government can gain the full trust of friendly countries.

### Japanese Three-Party Cabinet Formally Established Yesterday; Katayama Announces Policy Guidelines; Foreign Minister Ashida Calls for International Assistance

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The list of cabinet members of the Katayama Cabinet was announced by the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 7:20 PM on the 31st. Those who were in negotiations also agreed to join the cabinet. At 9:30 AM on the 1st, they gathered at the Prime Minister's residence, and at 10:10 AM, they went to the Imperial Palace. At 11:00 AM, with Prime Minister Katayama standing by, the Emperor's certification ceremony was held. (According to Japan's new constitution, the Japanese Emperor no longer holds the appointment ceremony for the new cabinet members, but instead holds the certification ceremony, because according to Articles 6 and 7 of the new constitution, the Japanese Emperor only has the right to appoint the Prime Minister based on the nomination of the Diet. As for the cabinet members, they are appointed by the Prime Minister, and the Japanese Emperor only performs a formal certification.) Prime Minister Katayama handed over the official seals to the ministers, and thus, the Katayama Cabinet was formally established. It has also been announced that Foreign Minister Ashida will concurrently serve as the Director of the Central Liaison Office, and Minister of State Wada will concurrently serve as the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board and the Director-General of the Price Agency.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The Katayama Cabinet held its first full cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's residence at 1:00 PM on the 1st and decided to announce the implementation guidelines for countermeasures to overcome the economic crisis in extraordinary times on the 2nd. After the meeting ended at 2:00 PM, Prime Minister Katayama and the cabinet members met with the press corps and announced the following policy guidelines.

Prime Minister Katayama said: The so-called democratic politics is not a formal human liberation, but must be accompanied by economic liberation; the most important thing for Japan at present is to overcome the food crisis. I believe that those who hold power represent the people and bear the heavy responsibility of administration, not to become a privileged class. As for the economic revolution, it was also implemented during the French Restoration. I intend to work hard to make our country (Japan) move towards the construction of a cultural nation. I originally intended to organize a coalition cabinet of various parties, and after many days of struggle, the result was still a three-party coalition cabinet, while the Liberal Party said that it would cooperate outside the cabinet. However, even though it is said to be a three-party coalition, the current cabinet is not entirely a mixed bag of the three parties, but has become a whole, and will cooperate to overcome the current crisis.

Foreign Minister Ashida said: In order to stabilize the current national life, economic reconstruction is very important. The Japanese are indeed very observant of the Potsdam Declaration in order to improve their international status. Without the goodwill and assistance of foreign countries, it will definitely not be able to recover. The Japanese must become a peace-loving people, a people of a cultural nation that renounces war, and make other countries trust them.

Finance Minister Yano said: Regarding Japan's future fiscal policy, the focus will be on the following matters: (1) The freezing of new Japanese yen will not be considered, nor will the suspension of interest payments on government bonds be considered. (2) Implement the necessary financial control policies: Since the implementation of the tight loan policy in March, important industries have also fallen into a state of financial difficulty. The current low-price policy is also due to the insufficient purchasing power of the people. Therefore, we cannot but consider the tendency of currency contraction. In short, the regulations on loans for important industries will be relaxed again to increase production. (3) Prevent currency inflation; heavy taxes will be levied on improper profits obtained due to currency inflation and the black market, but no new taxes have been considered for this purpose. (4) In the policy agreement, prices and wages will be strongly controlled. Regarding wages, it is hoped that labor and management will hold management consultation meetings to increase production based on this.

Commerce Minister Mizutani said: In order to overcome the economic crisis, Japan has carried out excessive currency and financial countermeasures, which have slowed down the recovery of production. I believe that the recovery of production is the most important thing. It is planned that important industries such as coal, fertilizer, electricity, and ships will be managed by the state in the future. The first is the nationalization of the coal industry and the reorganization of mining areas. The compensation is believed to be in the form of equipment rather than products. Minister of State Hirano Chen said: I had previously hoped to distribute three servings of food (per person per day), but since I took office as minister, I feel that this move cannot be implemented immediately. However, I plan to work hard to solve the food problem. I will form a food adjustment committee to make it easier to obtain food, and establish a national fertilizer committee, and I hope to implement the management of fertilizer in the future.

### Japanese New Cabinet Plans to Implement Scorched Earth Policy Against Communism

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 1st] Prime Minister Katayama declared to the Japanese press corps today that the new government will be consistent and will not engage in hypocrisy. Regarding specific policies, they must be discussed with the cabinet members before they can be decided, and there is nothing to say for the time being. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously issued a statement in Katayama's name, saying that the new cabinet plans to implement a scorched earth policy against communism.

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama today denied that he has a communist background and issued a formal statement, guaranteeing that the new cabinet will take a moderate line that is neither left nor right. Katayama said: "Based on the spirit of the new Japanese constitution, I have formed a new cabinet today. I sincerely regret that we were unable to obtain the participation of the Liberal Party in the cabinet. The new cabinet will adopt a moderate line based on the policies agreed upon by the four parties (including the Liberal Party) on May 16th, neither leaning to the left nor to the right, and especially clearly opposing communism. Therefore, I hope that the Liberal Party will cooperate with the government in this regard. I firmly believe that with the unanimous cooperation of the Japanese people and the goodwill assistance of the Allied nations, Japan will be able to overcome all difficulties."

### Japan to Establish Ministry of Labor

But it still needs to be passed by the current Diet

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The post of Minister of State and Minister of Labor has been announced in the new Katayama Cabinet, but the establishment of the Ministry of Labor is only a plan of the Socialist Party. According to the new Minister of State, Mitsuaki Yonekubo, he has exchanged views with Minister of Health and Welfare, Sadakichi Ichimatsu, on the issue of establishing the Ministry of Labor. All preparations for the establishment of the Ministry of Labor are also completely the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In the future, some of the business of the Ministry of Health and Welfare will be transferred to the management of the Ministry of Labor, but it still needs to be passed by the current Diet before there is a legal basis.

### MacArthur Report: Ryukyu Elections Postponed

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] According to MacArthur's third report on the military government of the Ryukyu Islands, which was released today, the Ryukyu elections have been postponed pending the completion of the repatriation work and the resettlement of returning people. However, he also said that the people of the various islands have made great progress in uniting into a political unit. The people of the Ryukyu Islands are reopening their damaged land and learning modern agricultural and industrial methods under the supervision of the US military government. MacArthur estimates that the Ryukyu Islands can only produce half of the food needed this year, but industrial recovery can make satisfactory progress in areas where raw materials can be obtained.

### US Youth Must Receive Military Training

Universal Military Training Committee Recommends to Congress

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The Universal Military Training Committee appointed by Truman yesterday strongly urged Congress to pass a universal military training bill as an urgent military need to defend the United States against aggression and to achieve peace in the current dangerous world. The committee, led by Dr. Compton of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, unanimously recommended after six months of meticulous research that all able-bodied men who have reached the age of eighteen or have completed secondary education should receive six months of basic military training, and then choose one of the three services of the army, navy, and air force for advanced training. If the recommendation of the Universal Military Training Committee is passed, then 750,000 to 900,000 young people will be trained each year within a few years.

These weather stations will be operated in cooperation with American personnel and Catholic priests.

### New Delhi Under Extraordinary Security; Round Table Conference Opens Today; Indian Governor-General to Announce Plan for Transfer of Power

[Report from this Newspaper] London, May 1 (Broadcast): Indian authorities have taken emergency precautions to prevent riots during the Round Table Conference to be held on Monday between Governor-General Mountbatten and Indian leaders. The British proposal remains secret, but close advisors to Mountbatten are certain that whatever the content of the proposal, its announcement will inevitably trigger new bloodshed between Indians and Muslims, as both sides seek to seize power after Britain's withdrawal from India. On Saturday, police teams searched for weapons everywhere, and mixed teams of Indian and Muslim military police were deployed in various locations.

[Reuters, New Delhi, May 1] Governor-General Mountbatten formally invited five major Indian political leaders last night to meet with him tomorrow, where he will report on the British government's plan for the transfer of power in India. The five invited leaders are Vice President of the Interim Government of India, Nehru; Home Minister Patel (both from the Congress Party); President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah; Finance Minister Ali Khan (both from the Muslim League); and Defense Minister Singh (leader of the Sikh community). Starting today, Delhi police will carry automatic weapons and maintain tight security throughout the city. In the troubled areas of the Punjab province and other provinces, military police will also step up security to prevent major riots during the Delhi conference.

### Auchinleck Rushes Back to India

[Reuters, Karachi, April 30] Field Marshal Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, arrived here today from London and immediately proceeded to New Delhi.

[United Press, New Delhi, April 30] The situation in India is extremely tense. Reliable sources say that arms are being smuggled into India from Burma and Afghanistan, and large numbers of jeeps are being purchased and driven to various provinces of India. Some princely states are hoarding large quantities of arms, and most princely states already possess large armies and large amounts of surplus wartime equipment. It is rumored that some religious sects are encouraging the organization of private armies. Military police in Calcutta have completed security measures throughout the city, and troops in Bombay have also been deployed to areas where recent Indian-Muslim conflicts have occurred.

### The Moment of Decisive Destiny Approaches

[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, New Delhi, April 30] With the return of Governor-General Mountbatten to New Delhi, the moment of decisive destiny for India has arrived. Senior figures from the two major Indian parties are now discussing the British plan for the transfer of power. The outline of the plan has reportedly been submitted to both parties. The Standing Committee of the Congress Party met this afternoon, and the Standing Committee of the Muslim League is scheduled to meet tomorrow. Leaders from relevant provinces of both sides will also participate in the discussions. It is generally believed that Mountbatten may hold a press conference on the 5th to announce the plan for the transfer of power. Currently, the main difficulty for Indian parties remains the question of unity or division. Therefore, what a dozen or twenty politicians decide will have a major impact on hundreds of millions of Indians and will affect their descendants. However, nationwide political demonstrations in India are still relatively rare. The person most eager about the current political situation is Gandhi.

### Truman Schedules Visit to Canada

[Reuters, Washington, April 30] The White House announced tonight that President Truman is scheduled to visit Canada on June 9 and will return on June 12. He will address the Canadian Parliament. Additionally, the President will personally attend and address the memorial service for the soldiers of the US Fifth Infantry Division who died in the Second European War, which will be held in Kansas City on June 7.

### Aiming to Resolve the Financial Crisis: New Italian Cabinet Formed; Left-Wing Parties Excluded

[Report from this Newspaper] London, May 1 (Broadcast): The new Italian cabinet, excluding left-wing parties, was sworn in on May 1. The swearing-in ceremony took place at noon in the Presidential Palace, presided over by President Nicola.

[Reuters, Rome, April 30] Christian Democratic leader Gasperi announced tonight that he had formed a new cabinet composed only of Christian Democrats and independent figures, excluding the Socialist and Communist parties. Earlier, Gasperi told reporters from this agency that his cabinet would not aim for party success but would strive with positive efforts to save the Italian economy. He knew that it was impossible to face major financial difficulties without temporarily abandoning party views. Since attempts to organize a government of all parties had failed, the party with a relatively large majority in parliament should take responsibility for governing the country. Gasperi also said that foreign economic aid to Italy was indispensable to the Italian people's efforts for reconstruction.

The new cabinet lineup is as follows:
Prime Minister: Gasperi
Interior: Celba
Defense: Singolani
Education: Gonella
Public Works: Tubini
Industry and Commerce: Dugni
Labor: Fanfani
Merchant Marine: Caba
Posts and Telecommunications: Merlin
Agriculture: Segni
(All of the above are members of the Christian Democratic Party)
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance: Ainoudi (Governor of the Bank of Italy)
Foreign Affairs: Sforza
Foreign Trade: Messina
Transportation: Gobeini
(All of the above are non-partisan)

### French, Spanish, and Italian Communists Plan to Organize International Brigade to Assist Guerrillas in Greece

(United Press, Rome, April 30) A report from Paris today stated that a group of communists from France, Spain, and Italy, including the famous Spanish Civil War general Miaja, met in southwestern France a month ago and decided to establish a plan for an international brigade to travel to Greece via Yugoslavia and join the guerrillas in fighting the government.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, April 30] Responsible officials here have expressed dismay at the possibility of an "international legion" being formed abroad to fight against Greece. According to recent official war reports, the new strategies adopted by the Greek government vary depending on whether military operations are taking place inland or along the border. For example, in the Thessaly region, government forces are mainly engaged in encircling and annihilating small guerrilla units of no more than fifty people. In the border areas of Thrace and Macedonia, government forces must cut off the lines of communication between the guerrillas and certain foreign countries. Guerrilla units in Thessaly, Thrace, and Macedonia often have "foreigners" mixed in among them. The formation of an "international legion" will further complicate the situation. The guerrillas' military equipment is becoming increasingly advanced, possessing not only machine guns but also anti-aircraft guns, which is causing the Greek government to feel uneasy.

### Bulgarian Steamer Seized by Greek Authorities

[United Press, Athens, April 30] According to a report from Mytilene, authorities on the island of Mytilene have seized a Bulgarian steamer suspected of assisting Greek guerrillas. The steamer, named "Verner," was detained by Greek forces on the night of April 27 while trying to leave the island without flying any flags or lights. The island authorities suspected that the "Verner" was carrying guerrillas to Macedonia, but due to insufficient evidence, it will soon be released.

### De Gaulle Speech: Calls for French-American Cooperation

[Reuters, Paris, April 30] General de Gaulle stated in a speech here today that the economic and social recovery of France is necessary and depends on the assistance of the United States and the efforts of the entire nation. American aid can immediately benefit France and even more benefit the United States itself. However, this assistance should be a loan based entirely on the spirit of friendship. De Gaulle also said that Europe must restore the forms and spirit of the West to become a third major force in the world, in addition to the United States and the Soviet Union. For this reason, France must maintain its Western form.

### Siamese Ambassador to Sweden to Become New Foreign Minister
### British Pacific Fleet Commander Visits Siam

[Reuters, Bangkok, April 30] It was announced today that Prime Minister Luang Thamrong has invited four members of the old cabinet to join the new cabinet. The position of Foreign Minister goes to Atai Kitti, former Siamese Ambassador to Sweden. The ministers of Transportation and Health are also new. Luang Thamrong himself will concurrently serve as Minister of Justice, and the Minister of Commerce, originally held by Osatha Thanon, will be concurrently held by Education Minister Bannag.

[Reuters, Bangkok, April 30] Admiral Sir Boyd, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, is scheduled to visit Bangkok for ceremonial purposes between June 6 and 12.

### US-Soviet Joint Commission Issues Communiqué; Negotiations Have Made Some Progress

[United Press, Seoul, April 30] The US-Soviet Joint Commission issued a communiqué today stating that, regarding the issue of organizing a unified Korean government, the US Chief Representative Brown and the Soviet Chief Representative Shtikov have agreed in principle to consult with various Korean democratic parties and public organizations on a broad basis, and have ordered subcommittees to draft consultation procedures. What needs to be decided is with which parties and factions to consult, who to recognize as representatives of each party and faction, and how to obtain the opinion of the majority of the people. Regarding the issue of publishing news, the commission also announced a policy of relaxing controls. In the future, in addition to issuing joint communiqués after major decisions according to the original method, it will also announce a summary of the contents of each meeting after each meeting. Brown and Shtikov may also separately meet with reporters to give talks, except for matters they have agreed to keep secret.

### The United States Hopes to Retain One Air Base in Greenland

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, April 30] Political figures here have stated that, regarding the Danish government's request to abolish the Greenland Defense Agreement signed in 1942, the United States now hopes to reach a compromise solution so that the United States can continue to use at least one of the air bases built there during the war. The Danish government's request for abolition has put the US Navy in a difficult position. Therefore, the US government is willing to negotiate with Denmark so that it can continue to use one of the air bases.

### Iran Demands Soviet Union Repay Gold Debt

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, April 30] It has been learned that Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Prince Firouz, sent a note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on May 26, demanding that the Soviet Union repay its overdue gold debt. According to this debt agreement, the Soviet State Bank should have repaid the Iranian National Bank on March 2 of last year, but the Soviet Union has not yet fulfilled its obligation.

### Communist Activities in the United States Have Somewhat Subsided

[United Press, Washington, April 30] Attorney General Clark announced today that since President Truman ordered the purge of Communists and other conspirators from government agencies, Communist activities across the country have somewhat subsided, but have not completely stopped.

### Coup in Hungary Concludes; Left-Wing Parties Control the Situation; Most Old Cabinet Members Re-Elected

[United Press, Hungarian Capital, April 30] The coup in Hungary, in which the minority Communist Party seized control of the government with Soviet assistance, was completed today. The Communist Party, which received 16 percent of the national vote in the last election, appears to have manipulated everything. It is clear that the new Prime Minister and his cabinet members have been approved by the Soviet Union. However, according to well-informed sources here, the widespread rumor that Hungary will accept Soviet training and equipment for the Hungarian army is unfounded.

[Reuters, Hungarian Capital, May 1] The new Hungarian cabinet led by General Dinnyés was sworn in last night. Former Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi is no longer the Foreign Minister in the new cabinet; the position of Foreign Minister will be temporarily held by Minister of Information Mihályfi. The swearing-in ceremony was delayed by half an hour due to a discussion among President Tildy, Communist Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi, and Deputy Prime Minister Szakasits over whether to allow Father Balogh to remain as Undersecretary. Father Balogh was considered the last line of defense for the Smallholders Party. In the end, the three decided that the cabinet would decide Father Balogh's fate on Monday.

[Reuters, London, April 30] Diplomatic sources believe that the reorganized Hungarian government will not change the foundation of the old cabinet, and the political forces in Hungary can theoretically still maintain a balance. However, it is expected that the Smallholders Party will have to continue to purge members under pressure from the Communist and Social Democratic parties. Previously, many right-wing members of the Smallholders Party were purged for conspiring to overthrow the republic. After further purging, the Smallholders Party's majority in parliament may decrease. At the same time, it is expected that left-wing parties will intensify their demands for early general elections to strengthen their position. The list of the new cabinet is as follows:
Deputy Prime Ministers: Rákosi (Communist), Szakasits (Social Democrat)
Minister of State: Dobi (Smallholders Party)
Interior: Rák (Communist)
Industry: Bán (Social Democrat)
Transportation: Gerő (Communist)
Agriculture: Balogh (Smallholders Party)
Justice: Ries (Social Democrat)
Social Welfare: Molnár (Communist)
Supply: Erős (Smallholders Party)
(All of the above are re-elected old cabinet members)

New members joining the cabinet include:
Prime Minister and Defense: Dinnyés (Smallholders Party)
Finance: Nyárády (Party not announced)
Education: Ortutay (Party not announced)
Construction: Vályi (Leader of the National Peasants Party)
Foreign Affairs: Kettős (Ambassador to Italy)

### Arab Stance Strengthens; May Openly Declare War on Jews; UN Organization Faces Major Difficulties

[Reuters, Damascus, May 1] The Arab League Political Committee is scheduled to meet here on Thursday. Local newspapers say that the Arab League will declare war on the Jews at this important meeting. The newspapers all claim that this meeting will resolve that if the Arab League cannot achieve its goals through UN organizations, the Arab world will challenge the authority of the UN organizations, regardless of the world's reaction. The Arab world is about to abandon hope for a peaceful solution. In this situation, the only possible result is an open declaration of war on the Jews.

### Public Utility Price Adjustments Limited to Double Starting Next Monday; Electricity Companies Have Special Circumstances, Limits Will Be Slightly Relaxed

[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the issue of adjusting the prices of public utilities in this city, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Huizhao, took the night express train to Beijing last Friday to attend the National Commodity Price Conference held on the [unclear]th. He returned to Shanghai early yesterday morning at 8:00 am after the meeting. According to Director Zhao speaking to reporters, the Central government will continue to subsidize the losses of public utilities in this city for this month, maintaining the subsidy amount at the May figure, which is 16.61 billion yuan. However, because the cost of living and commodity prices in the Beijing and Shanghai areas have risen significantly, if subsidies from the central government at the May amount are still not enough to avoid losses, then the prices of public utilities in Shanghai and Nanjing may be allowed to be slightly adjusted, but only up to double the original price. Unless there are special circumstances, this limit will generally not be exceeded. The reporter then asked what kind of public utility institutions were referred to as special circumstances. According to Director Zhao, for example, the city's electric power company has not been included in the list of central government subsidies, and has suffered heavy losses in recent months, so the limit on price adjustments will have to be slightly relaxed. The reporter then asked when the adjustment of public utility prices in this city would begin. Director Zhao replied that after the various public utility institutions have drafted the adjusted prices, they must be submitted to the National Commodity Price Conference for review and approval before they can be implemented. It is estimated that it will be about a week later. The companies and institutions raising prices include: electricity, gas, trams, buses, telephones, tap water, ferries, and the two small railways of Shangchuan and Shangnan.

### Mayor Wu Visits Arrested Students; All Express Extreme Satisfaction with Treatment

[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu, accompanied by Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, and Commissioner Chen Baotai, departed from the official residence at 4:00 PM yesterday to visit students from various schools arrested in connection with the recent student unrest. According to Mayor Wu, speaking to reporters afterwards, the main purpose of his visit was to inquire about the treatment of the arrested students. He had individual talks with all the arrested students, and as a result, all of the students expressed great satisfaction with their treatment during their detention.

Mayor Wu also told reporters that the rumor that Jiaotong University student Yu Xikun had been tortured after being arrested, resulting in injuries all over his body, was false. The mayor specifically visited Yu Xikun yesterday afternoon and saw that he was in good health and everything was normal. The mayor requested that the student have a photo taken on the spot, but Yu Xikun declined, believing it was unnecessary. Later, at the mayor's request, he wrote a letter in his own hand, reporting that his life after being arrested was very privileged.

[Another Report] It is learned that the municipal authorities have allowed the parents or principals of arrested students to visit their children at their place of residence before they are released on bail. However, prior contact with the municipal authorities is required.

### Municipal Council General Assembly to Postpone Closing

[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Council General Assembly has been discussing the municipal government's policies and other urgent proposals for several days. The assembly was originally scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month. According to the secretariat, the assembly will be postponed due to the large number of cases under discussion. However, the date of the postponement will depend on the proceedings of today's meeting.

The fourth meeting of the General Assembly will continue to discuss proposals this afternoon. At 9:00 AM, the Municipal Government Policy Report Review Committee and the Budget Committee will hold separate meetings. The General Assembly will discuss more important cases tomorrow: (1) Housing Lease Issues, (2) Exchange Issues, (3) Automobile Surtax for Construction, (4) Food Issues, (5) Budget Review, (6) Municipal Government Policy Report Review, (7) Nine Types of Financial Tax Regulations, (8) Ratification of Resolutions of Various Committees, (9) Reorganization of Various Committees, etc.

### Zhao Zukang Reports on Work, Invites Four Councilors for Discussion

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to enable the Municipal Council to understand the internal management of the bureau, invited Tang Shichang, Lu Yinchu, Wang Zhuyi, Chen Gongda, Wei Yunqing, and other councilors from the Council's Public Works Committee to a discussion at the bureau the day before yesterday. Director Zhao reported on the spot, stating that the work of the Bureau of Public Works can be divided into two types: basic and emergency. Internal management adopts scientific methods. As for the workers employed in the bureau, including public country police, heavy laborers, etc., the number has now been reduced to more than 5,400 people. More than 3,000 of them are currently scattered in various districts and locations repairing roads. Due to the shortage of people, it is necessary to use contract work methods for large projects, such as the widening of Tianmu Road. The policy of the Bureau of Public Works in implementing its work is to base its decisions on the resolutions of the Municipal Council, but road repair work is extremely difficult. After eight years of disrepair, not only are the roads severely damaged, but the water pipes are also damaged. According to Shanghai's topography, water pipes should be installed three feet below the road surface, but in the past, most were installed between two and three feet from the road surface, so damage is more likely. In short, although the work of the bureau may not reach the highest standards, it will do its best. Materials and machines are purchased as much as possible from government agencies such as the Central Trust Bureau and the Executive Yuan in order to obtain lower prices.

After the director finished his report, councilors Lu Yinchu and Chen Gongda stood up and stated that Director Zhao had arrived, [unclear], and had done many things, rather than coming to be an official. They hoped that he would continue to work hard in the future. Councilor Tang Shichang hoped that Director Zhao would remember " [unclear] can't be as good as people want, but seek to be worthy of my heart," and suggested [unclear] the director does not necessarily have to execute according to the resolutions of the council. It is permissible for him to initiate them himself, believing that based on the director's past achievements, his new facilities will be trusted. Zhu Zhuyi was concerned about the treatment of technical personnel, hoping that the Municipal Council and people from all walks of life would organize an organization on public works to help the Bureau of Public Works solve problems such as purchasing materials, economics, and personnel.

### In Front of the Atlantic Western Food Restaurant, Shadows of Axes and Gunshots; Dance Hall Employee Injured and Retaliates; Civilians, Both Male and Female, Are Affected

[Report from this Newspaper] At around 11:45 PM last night, a revenge killing occurred in front of the Atlantic Western Food Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. The victim was Qiu Lianhuan, an investigator from a certain agency and an employee of the Cosmon Dance Hall. Qiu lived at No. 1, Gongyi Lane, Wanzhu Street, Nanshi.

At this time, the assailants had scattered and fled. Upon receiving the report, the Old Gate Police Sub-Bureau, led by Criminal Division Chief Jiang Shangpei, rushed to the scene with police officers and a large number of auxiliary police. They rushed the three wounded men and women to the hospital. Afterwards, the bureau captured a suspect, and the rest are being strictly pursued.

### Joint Meeting of Three Committees of the Municipal Council; Approves Standard Method for Rent; Maximum Amount Calculated at 1,800 Times the Pre-War Base

[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Council's Legal, Land Administration, and Social Affairs Committees, in order to discuss the city's housing rental regulations and the Municipal Bureau of Land Administration's proposal regarding housing rental regulations, drafted a preliminary resolution to be submitted to the General Assembly for public decision. A joint meeting was held at the Municipal Council at 4:00 PM yesterday.

The councilors' discussion on housing rental issues was very enthusiastic. Some considered the interests of homeowners, some considered the burden of tenants, and some agreed with the housing rental standard passed by the Municipal Administration Council, which should not exceed 1,800 times the pre-war base, which is currently the multiple of civil servant salaries. However, some councilors believed that this multiple was too low, and landlords were at too much of a disadvantage. Other councilors did not advocate setting a standard at all. The discussion lasted for three and a half hours, and opinions remained divided. In the end, a voting method was adopted, and the majority passed the following standard method for housing rentals in Shanghai:

### Seven Measures

(1) Before the completion of housing registration in this city, the maximum amount of rent in this city shall be temporarily determined to be calculated at 1,800 times the pre-war base. Those who live in schools, charitable organizations, autonomous institutions, or cultural societies shall be calculated at 80% of the amount.

(2) The Bureau of Land Administration shall handle housing registration according to law within six months and stipulate a uniform rental contract.

(3) The lessee shall not sublet the entire leased house to others. If a portion of the house is sublet, whether for residential or business use, the rent shall be calculated according to the ratio of the sublet portion of the house to the original rental amount. The maximum shall not exceed one times the original rent. The calculation method for the original rental deposit shall be the same.

(4) (1) Rent shall be paid monthly and shall not be calculated in foreign currency or in kind. If it was originally calculated in foreign currency or in kind, it shall be converted into legal tender according to the exchange rate or market price of the object on the date of promulgation of these measures. (2) If the agreed housing rent exceeds the provisions of these measures, the excess portion shall be regarded as unjust enrichment, and the lessee may request its return within three months from the date of promulgation of these measures.

(5) In addition to rent, a rental deposit may be collected for housing rental. The maximum amount shall not exceed the total amount of three months' rent. If the foregoing provision is violated, the excess portion shall be returned to the lessee.

(6) In addition to rent and security deposits, the lessor shall not collect tips or other expenses under any name. Violators shall return all fees and be subject to a fine of up to three times the amount by the competent authority.

(7) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Recent Status of Xu Shiqi's Painting Exhibition: All Works Sold Out

The renowned painter Professor Xu Shiqi taught at National Central University during the War of Resistance. While in Sichuan, he traveled to various southwestern provinces and held solo exhibitions in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming. In the spring of the 31st year, Madame Chiang Kai-shek commissioned the giant painting "Soaring Ambitions" as a gift to General Chennault of the Flying Tigers, earning international acclaim. After returning to Shanghai, he founded the Yiyuan Art Studio. Recently, over sixty works were displayed at [whitespace] Science [whitespace] on Southwest Road, organized by Li Shizeng and [whitespace] Kong [whitespace]. Attendees included Ke [whitespace], Pan Gong [whitespace], Ren [whitespace], Bingzhi, and over a hundred others. Xu's works primarily depict Mount Huang, the Wu [whitespace], [whitespace] police [whitespace], among which the "Evergreen [whitespace]" [whitespace], twelve feet tall and twenty feet wide, [whitespace] exquisite workmanship, has already been purchased by collector [whitespace] Zhou. All other works have been sold out. It is reported that there are still four days left in the exhibition.

### Police Officers Possess High National Consciousness and Cannot Be Incited: Deputy Director Yu Issues Statement

Deputy Director Shu Ping of the Municipal Police Bureau issued the following statement regarding recent rumors of reactionary elements exploiting student strikes to incite Shanghai police to participate in the "June 2nd" march and demonstration: It has been found that approximately half of the current police force in this city consists of officers retained from the Municipal Council, with many having served for one or two decades or more. They possess extensive work experience and a strong interest in serving. Most of their families have side businesses, and their lives are relatively stable. As for the new police officers, they are all graduates of junior high school or higher, have undergone rigorous training, possess a high level of national consciousness, and are mostly single, with lighter burdens. Coming from rural areas, they are also extremely simple in nature, and their usual dedication to service is commendable. Therefore, not only is there no room for incitement, but they will forever be a spiritual fortress of Shanghai, which I can guarantee. Yu also stated: The salaries and benefits of police officers in this city have also been improved as much as possible. Currently, in addition to a base salary of 340,000 yuan, police officers receive a multiplier of 1,800, plus an adjustment allowance of approximately 20,000 yuan issued by the municipal government, accounting for 10% of their base salary. Based on the lowest base salary of 55 yuan, each officer can receive at least 460,000 yuan per month. As for senior police officers, in addition to a base salary of 238,000 yuan, they receive a multiplier of 1,800 [whitespace], plus an adjustment allowance of approximately 30,000 yuan issued by the municipal government, accounting for 20% of their base salary. Even based on the lowest salary grade of 45 yuan for senior officers, they can still receive at least 310,000 yuan or more. In addition, senior police officers receive an extra five dou of rice, which, when converted to the market price, makes their benefits comparable to those of police officers. Furthermore, in consideration of the difficult living conditions of senior officers, the mayor has also allocated daily necessities. Therefore, given the city's current financial constraints, the salaries and benefits received by police officers in this city can be considered generous compared to those in other parts of the country. Moreover, the police bureau's welfare programs, such as the police hospital, elementary school for children, and mutual assistance for police officers and workers injured or killed in the line of duty, provide significant assistance to the lives of police officers. Therefore, they would never act recklessly and make unnecessary sacrifices.

### Opening Ceremony of the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Society's Fundraising Campaign: Hoping to Contribute Money and Effort

[Report from Our Newspaper] The opening ceremony of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society's 1947 fundraising campaign was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the New Life Movement Club. Attendees included Wang Zhengting, He Dequi, Zhang Xiaosong, Liu Hongsheng, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Guanqing representing Mayor Wu, Xu Mingya representing Chairman Fang, Mike Bian representing the China International Relief Committee, and others. Chairman Wang Zhengting of the Central Red Cross Society delivered the opening remarks, recalling the Red Cross's wartime achievements and the touching international donations. He expressed hope that the Chinese people would enthusiastically join the Red Cross Society and contribute both "money and effort."

### Residents Assigned to Enemy-Occupied Housing Petitioned the Municipal Council Yesterday

Yesterday, the three committees of the Municipal Council—Legal Affairs, Land Administration, and Social Affairs—held a joint meeting to discuss the issue of rent. The "Association of Residents Assigned to Enemy-Occupied Housing" in this city sent ten representatives to petition the council. Councillors Ma Junshuo, Wang Weizhi, and Shao Yongsheng received them on behalf of the council. The petitioning representatives presented four points: (1) The association represents tens of thousands of military, government, and educational personnel who have been assigned housing and requests continued lease agreements, hoping the council will fully support this to maintain social stability. (2) Regarding the housing allocation issue, the association hopes the council will reaffirm the resolution of the previous general meeting, determine specific measures, and submit them to the municipal government for implementation. (3) The association expresses support for the proposals submitted by Councillors Feng Youzhen, Zhao Junhao, and Zhang Zhihan and hopes the council will adopt and pass them. (4) The housing allocation issue is different in nature from the rent issue and cannot be confused. If the council passes reasonable rent standards, the assigned residents will absolutely comply. Councillors Ma, Wang, and Shao expressed sincere sympathy for the opinions presented by the petitioning representatives and stated their willingness to propose the formation of a small committee on housing allocation at the joint meeting of the three committees to specifically discuss this issue and seek a reasonable resolution.

### Empathy and Enthusiastic Participation

Liu Hongsheng gave a passionate speech, stating that the Chinese Red Cross Society's funding largely depends on donations from friendly nations and a small portion from government subsidies. During the war, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia made great efforts, but later, Southeast Asia was swept by the enemy, suffering from poison and devastation. Today, they have not yet recovered their vitality and themselves need relief. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that the Chinese people will consider it an honor to join the Red Cross Society and participate widely to increase the strength of the Red Cross. Subsequently, He Dequi, the representative of Mayor Wu, the representative of Chairman Fang, and the representative of the Garrison Command all gave speeches, emphasizing that the Red Cross Society is an unconditional charitable organization and aid agency. The Chinese people should, out of human compassion, extend empathy and participate enthusiastically to achieve the fundraising goals. Mike Bian, the representative of the China International Relief Committee, was also invited to speak. Mr. Bian worked in western China during the War of Resistance and once served in the medical team during the Nu River Campaign, expressing deep admiration for China's wartime relief efforts. He stated that foreign workers in China would do their best to assist in promoting this great plan.

### Only Success Allowed, Failure Not Permitted

Shui Xiangyun spoke on behalf of the Federation of Labor Unions, stating that the success or failure of the fundraising effort can test the conscience of the people of Shanghai. For the sake of Shanghai's honor, only success is allowed, and failure is not permitted. Shanghai's workers, numbering 800,000, will do their utmost under the principle of "contributing effort when possible." Wang Zhengting immediately stated: American workers donate one US dollar each to join the Red Cross Society, accumulating little by little. Therefore, he hopes that each of the 800,000 workers will contribute 12,000 yuan, which would total over 9 billion yuan. Mr. Wang's emotions were passionate at the time, and all attendees applauded greatly. The meeting adjourned in an atmosphere of excitement at 4:50 PM.

### Persons Responsible for the Robbery of the Li Steamer Detained for Questioning

This day was originally the date when Communist conspirators planned to launch the "Three Strikes and One Tragedy" movement in major cities across the country. The military and political authorities in this city had already received this intelligence and taken careful precautions, so the danger of "June 2nd" has already been eliminated. However, as a precaution, security has been slightly strengthened last night and today compared to usual.

### Zhao Zengjue Invited to Broadcast: An Outline of Public Utilities in This City; This Newspaper's Ninth Weekly Special Broadcast Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its ninth weekly special broadcast at Asia Radio yesterday, inviting Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to broadcast "An Outline of Public Utilities in This City." The text of his speech is as follows: "The agency in charge of public utilities in this city is the Public Utilities Bureau. Since the restoration, the Public Utilities Bureau has adhered to four principles in organizing and developing public utilities in this city, which are outlined as follows: (1) Shanghai's position is that of an international commercial port externally and an industrial and commercial center internally. The facilities of public utilities must recognize this position and coordinate with its development. (2) The facilities of public utilities should have integrity and unity and should not be divided. Although a certain public utility may be operated by several units, it should be operated under a unified plan, with mutual connection and coordination. (3) Although public utilities have developed in an unreasonable state in the past, the current discussion of rationalization does not mean starting from scratch, but rather using the method of organizing and improving to bring the original business into the right track. (4) The operation of public utilities in a publicly-owned enterprise is naturally the most ideal. However, the municipal treasury has limited financial resources. Therefore, any public utility that has been operated successfully or is preparing to be operated, whether by foreign or Chinese businesses, is welcome as long as it can be operated in accordance with the principles of rationalization, enterprise, and public benefit. Next, let's talk about the general situation of public utilities: (1) Electricity. Shanghai is an industrial center, and electricity is the mother of industry, so there should be a sufficient supply. Before the war, the total capacity of Shanghai's power plants was 260,000 kilowatts. According to pre-war statistics, it was predicted that it might increase to 410,000 kilowatts within the next five years. Adding 15% of the standby capacity, it should be 470,000 kilowatts. However, due to wartime losses, it currently only has 180,000 kilowatts, and it may increase to 200,000 kilowatts by the end of this year, but it is still short of 270,000 kilowatts. According to the plan of the Public Utilities Bureau, on the one hand, while retaining the original state of individual operation of each power plant, technical connections will be made to complete the joint high-voltage transmission network. On the other hand, it will initiate the organization of a joint electric power company to establish a large power plant. It is also planned to request the central government to allocate Japanese war reparations for electrical machinery, which the joint company will have priority to purchase, in order to facilitate the development of industry in this city. (2) Water supply. Not only does the suburbs of this city still lack water supply equipment, but even within the urban area, it is still not possible to fully supply water. The plan of the Public Utilities Bureau is: on the one hand, to make the water plants as technically connected as possible, connecting the main pipes to supply each other, and on the other hand, to prepare to set up a new plant in western Shanghai. The bureau has now established the Shanghai West Waterworks Design Office to carry out preparatory work, and at the same time, it has formulated an emergency project plan: (A) Opening three self-flowing wells, which can be completed by mid-July. (B) Adding reservoirs, transferring and reselling water from the French Concession. (C) Instructing the British company to extend the water injection time at the Jiaozhou Road water station, and the British company has been notified to handle it. (3) Gas. Gas is a cheap and clean fuel. In cities like London and New York, gas users account for almost half of all households, while this city currently only has 20,000 households, so gas definitely has a bright future in Shanghai. Currently, the total daily output of the British Gas Company and the Public Utilities Bureau's Wusong Gas Plant is less than 5 million cubic feet. The plan of the Public Utilities Bureau: to prepare to establish a new plant in Nanshi, assuming a capacity of 5 million cubic feet per day. In the future, the Wusong plant will be increased to 2 million cubic feet per day, and the British Gas Company will be 4 million cubic feet, and the three units will jointly supply a total of 10 million cubic feet. The Wusong plant and the British company have already implemented joint supply. (4) Telephone. Telephone is the nerve system of this city. However, the operators of telephones in this city are the American Shanghai Telephone Company and the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications. Having two telephone organizations in one place, and using different systems of telephones, causes various shortcomings. The Public Utilities Bureau believes that in order to rationalize the telephone system in Shanghai, a uniform system must be adopted technically, and a unified organization must be adopted in operation. In order to adapt to future development, a zoning and phased implementation plan has been formulated based on the current distribution of industry, commerce, and population, and is currently being submitted to the central government for approval. (5) Land Transportation. This city is an industrial center and an international commercial port, so urban transportation should be connected and coordinated with wharves, railway stations, and airports. Internally, it should be connected and coordinated with industrial areas, commercial areas, residential areas, and school districts. Before the war, because the municipal institutions were divided into three, there were few mutually connected traffic arteries in each district, especially in the north and south. Now that the municipality has been unified, all vertical and horizontal traffic arteries should be re-planned. First, the British Electric Tramway Company, the French Electric Tramway Company, and the Preparatory Committee of the Public Transportation Company of the Public Utilities Bureau should be technically coordinated in unison, and at the same time, they should do their best to expand the Public Transportation Company. The company currently has 164 buses operating on 11 routes. Long-distance buses in the suburbs are contracted out to merchants, and a total of eight routes have been opened. (6) Water Transportation. Pudong and Puxi are only separated by a river, but their development status is very different. To develop Pudong, water transportation must first be developed. The Public Utilities Bureau has now reorganized the self-operated ferry into a joint public-private company, striving to expand ferry equipment, and has begun the truck crossing project, which is expected to open in the autumn of this year.

Finally, it should be explained that the Public Utilities Bureau is the administrative agency for public utilities, responsible for the design, guidance, and supervision of public utilities, while other water plants, power plants, etc. are the operational organizations for public utilities. We hope that citizens of this city who have opinions on public utilities will put them forward as much as possible. The bureau will do its best within the possible scope to strive for the progress and rationalization of public utilities."

### Chinese Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers Holds 1947 Annual Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers held its 1947 annual meeting yesterday at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy in Gaochangmiao in this city, starting from 9:30 AM and ending around 7:00 PM.

After the opening meeting in the morning, Li Yuncheng (pictured), Chairman of the Society's Board of Directors, first reported on the Society's move from Chongqing to Shanghai, and then elaborated on the importance of naval architecture and marine engineering in military affairs, social economy, and the development of other heavy industries.

Zhao Zukang, representing the Chairman of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Hui Yangfu, delivered a speech, suggesting that naval architecture departments be universally added to the national universities with engineering departments across the country to cultivate shipbuilding talents. Huang Muzong, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Administration, based on his practical experience in managing maritime affairs, compared the current state of China's shipping with that of foreign countries, and felt deeply that we were lagging behind. He said that we must actively promote and help the government. After the chairman reported on the association's work in the past year, there was a photo opportunity and a break.

The discussion of this year's association affairs began in the afternoon, and important resolutions were decided: (1) It is recommended that the government allocate special funds to compile a dictionary of naval architecture and marine engineering terms. (2) Shipbuilding factories and maritime affairs and shipping agencies are urged to accommodate as many graduates from naval architecture and marine engineering departments as possible. (3) The Board of Directors will appoint experts to form a technical research committee to formulate freeboard regulations, ship inspection rules, etc., to prepare for China's participation in the International Conference on Water Safety held in England, and it is recommended that the government send Member Wang Shiquan to attend. (4) It is recommended that the government allocate special funds to set up a ship model test pool to facilitate research.

### Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan Held Tea Party Yesterday to Entertain Fudan University Professors and Exchange Views on Guiding Student Protests

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan invited Fudan University professors to a tea party at the mayor's residence on Anfu Road at 10:00 AM yesterday to exchange views on guiding the student protests at the university. About thirty people attended, including Chen Wangdao, Ma Zongrong, Zhang Zhirang, Gu Zhongyi, and Wu Fu, members of the university's faculty association. Fang, the chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhao Yangxiong, Yan Yilin, municipal councilors and alumni of the university, and Sun Jiulu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, also attended.

During the tea party, the mayor explained to the Fudan professors the government's difficult position in dealing with the protests. He said that it was very difficult to arrest those who disrupt social stability among the majority of people, which could easily lead to disputes. However, the government was determined to implement the resolutions of the Municipal Council. The Fudan professors immediately expressed that the strike was also a last resort. They hoped that the authorities would decide on a proper solution and considered the resolutions of the Council to be quite appropriate. However, they asked if the mayor could show special leniency to the youth, not arrest those who had not yet been arrested, and release all those who had been arrested on bail by the school.

The mayor continued that the government's investigation list was very careful. To avoid some elements causing strikes and affecting the safety of the city, it was necessary to temporarily isolate them. At the same time, due to concerns that those with more serious offenses would be released and no one would be responsible for the summons, it was necessary to consider the severity of the situation and act in accordance with the resolution of the Council, which was the most reasonable approach.

The conversation lasted until 2:00 PM. The professors immediately stated that they had just been elected as members of the faculty association the day before and that the faculty association had not yet formally discussed the matter. Therefore, they promised to convene a faculty association meeting after returning to the university to report the conversation and make explanations.

The professors reported on the strike to protest the "May 30th" incident and protect the safety of students. Qiu Weiyu, chairman of the faculty association, presided over the reception.

Attitude of the Faculty Association

Professor Ji Wenmei reported on the evolution of the strike at the university, stating that the Jiaotong University professors had made great efforts to persuade the students to restore order, but the arrest of students by a large number of military police at 2:00 AM on the 30th was unexpected. Not only were the students emotionally agitated, but they also felt that there was no way to save the situation. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to appeal, they announced a strike to protest. Ji also clarified the attitude of the university's faculty association: (1) They have always tried their best to dissuade students from striking; (2) Student protests should be guided, not suppressed; (3) The military and police authorities should improve their measures in dealing with student protests. Ji also reported the results of the exchange of views between the professors and the mayor at the mayor's residence on the evening of the 31st, which had been decided by the faculty association talk on the 1st of today: "If the government agrees with the suggestions from this association, classes can resume."

Mayor Wu's Opinion

Professor Chen Hu then reported that Mayor Wu had signed and agreed to the six suggestions provided by the association yesterday morning: (1) The municipal government and the garrison headquarters will jointly issue a notice at the school gate that, if the situation at the school is peaceful, no more students will be arrested except for the eighteen (the authorities believe that eighteen students at the school should be arrested, two have already been arrested, and sixteen are still at large). (2) The municipal government will inform the school by letter that no military police will be sent to the school to arrest people without the school's prior consent. (3) The arrested students will be dealt with in accordance with the measures announced by the Municipal Council in the newspapers on June 1st. After the school resumes classes, if the sixteen who have not yet been arrested come to the school, the school will accompany them to surrender to the municipal government or the garrison headquarters and handle them according to the following methods based on the severity of the situation: (1) The school will be responsible for management; (2) Parents or guarantors will take them back; (3) If the school and the municipal authorities confirm that the evidence is accurate, they will be handled in accordance with the methods passed by the Municipal Council. (4) The municipal government and the garrison headquarters will be responsible for severely punishing the murderers of the "May 30th" incident, but due to the urgency of time, it will be handled after June 2nd. (5) The medical expenses of the injured students and the losses of the school will be paid by the municipal government after the council's investigation. (6) The school may send professor representatives to observe the arrest of students. Fan, the speaker of the Municipal Council, and Zhao Cengjue, the person in charge of the school's alumni association, signed as witnesses to the above items. The faculty association expressed satisfaction with this.

Finally, Qiu specifically stated that the reports in a certain newspaper and a certain evening newspaper that Professor Zhong Weicheng of the school incited student protests and that students grabbed guns in the "May 30th" incident were inaccurate and hoped to be corrected. He also said that, according to Mayor Wu, the arrested students were treated with absolute courtesy, and the food and drink were better than usual at school. The Health Bureau sent doctors to check their health. Mayor Wu also visited the living and eating conditions of the detained students yesterday. The press conference ended at about 5:00 PM.

Regarding the arrest of students, Chen said that the measures taken by the local authorities might not be without criticism, but the authorities had no choice but to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the city's residents in order to avoid a "June 2nd" incident. Therefore, from the perspective of education, they hoped that the professors would help to quell the student protests and restore classes as soon as possible. Zhao Cengyu, from the Alumni Association, explained that the country was facing serious difficulties, even greater than during the war, and hoped that the professors would prioritize the country, the school, and education, and assist the government in stabilizing the youth. Councilor Li Kaidi explained that the national student protests this time were indeed different from previous student protests, and the measures taken by the local authorities could be described as "well-intentioned." The current situation should be carefully considered and calmly analyzed. After several professors expressed their opinions, it was decided that the six suggestions provided by the association would be implemented if the authorities agreed, and classes would resume in the shortest possible time.

### The Patriotic Education Association Will Expand to a National Level, and Major Middle Schools in the City Are Automatically Responding

[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Chongde, Chen Siyi, and ten other representatives of the Nanjing Patriotic Student Union arrived in Shanghai and immediately began activities, contacting university authorities, professors, and students in the city in order to unite with the university students in the city and expand the Patriotic Education Association into a national and permanent organization. At 3:00 PM yesterday, representatives of the association entertained reporters at the New Life Club in the city. Liu Chongde, a representative, first reported on the causes of the student protests in Beijing and the establishment, history and significance of the Patriotic Education Association, stating that the student protests were caused by students demanding an increase in food expenses, the so-called "eat up the movement." In fact, the non-staple food expenses currently amount to about 100,000 yuan per month. Now 90% of the people in the country cannot enjoy this kind of thing. The conspirators took the opportunity to instigate and create violent student protests. Some ignorant students followed and were used by them. The students realized that this kind of tram-rail action would endanger the country, and could no longer remain silent. So, under the call of justice, they stood up and formed a patriotic student union with students from more than 30 schools, including Zhongda, Jin University, and the Oriental Language College, and began to publicize to all sectors of society in Beijing on May 29th. The results were very good. The propaganda team was warmly welcomed by the people wherever they went. As a result of the propaganda on May 29th and 30th, the students in Beijing had turned 180 degrees. More than 80% of the students were against strikes. The conspirators have exhausted their plans, and their planned "June 2nd General Strike" will not be realized. Nanjing is as quiet as ever. Now, the working goal of the Patriotic Education Association is to awaken students across the country so that they are not used by others. We are also dissatisfied with the current situation, and we also have demands for reform, but we will proceed in a proper manner and will never allow any deviant actions. Chen Siyi then reported on the significance of coming to Shanghai, stating that there were two missions this time: first, to represent the students in Beijing to express condolences to Shanghai; second, to bring the results obtained in Nanjing to Shanghai, and is currently taking contact with various schools, and intends to cooperate with students from various schools, and intends to contact all parts of the country such as Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and Kunming. Today (1st) he went to Fudan University and saw that the students were in a very good mood. If the professors have no problems, classes can be resumed. He also reported the source of funds for the Patriotic Education School Association, which came from the 500-yuan movement and was donated by students, with no background. In addition, it was reported that students from major middle schools in the city have automatically responded to this patriotic education movement. "Patriotism First" and "Protecting Education First". Students' parents also expressed deep sympathy.

### Daxia Celebrated its Anniversary Yesterday

Sun Ke Presided over the Celebration Ceremony

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the 23rd anniversary of Daxia University. The school held a celebration ceremony at 9:00 AM, and more than 2,000 guests from all walks of life, alumni, faculty and staff attended. Sun Ke, the chairman of the school's board of directors, and his wife came to the school to preside over the ceremony and elaborated on the current peace issue, stating that peace is the unanimous demand of the government and the people. Both sides should not use force. Since the people have called for peace under the rule of the National Government, it is hoped that the same call will be made to the CCP region. The current dispute in China is for the government to seek unity and the realization of the constitution. If the Communist Party lays down its arms and participates in national politics and becomes an opposition party, it is very reasonable. If the constitution can be implemented, national affairs can be resolved without resorting to force. The main reason for the various unstable situations in society is internal strife. Taking the student protests in various places as an example, the central government is required to increase education funding by 15%, which is stipulated in the constitution, but now all of it is consumed by internal strife. If everyone lays down their arms, China will definitely be able to achieve peace. Zhu Jingnong, the president of Guanghua University, then delivered a speech, representing Guanghua University, wishing "Daxia shines, and China shines." Representatives from the Municipal Party Committee then delivered speeches, offering many congratulations. Yesterday afternoon, the school's alumni, faculty, staff, and guests enjoyed "The Joy of a Family," which was presided over by the school's vice president, Zhu Yuxiang. President Ou Yuanhuai reported on the overall situation of the school's reconstruction and the students' self-love, love of the school, no strikes, no parades, and no fighting during the student protests. Laughter and applause lasted for three hours. At that time, it was also decided that the first Sunday of November each year would be the Alumni Return Day. The school also had a two-day holiday, with entertainment in the afternoon and evening each day, as well as performances of "A Little Man's Daydream," "Counter-espionage," and "The Wilderness," which made the whole school rejoice and the event was very grand.

### Past and Present of the Zheng Lun Team

[Our Newspaper's Report] Luo Yanglu

Last year's roster: Wu Zhuoming (leader), Zhang Yiwen, Luo HouTang (manager), Wei Lingxiao (captain), Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengche, Yu Ruizhang, Zhang Gensheng, Wang Binghuan (players).

This year's roster: Hou Canzhang (leader), Wu Jian (deputy leader), Peng Zhongheng (manager), Cai Zhongqiang (captain), Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Yu Ruizhang, Zhang Gensheng. Wang Binghuan. Ji Dezang. Chen Baoshu, Ma Xilin (players). The past year's record and situation and the performance of the six consecutive victories this time are described later, and readers can make a comparison. The strength of the expeditionary force is clear at a glance. Do not regard it as a thing of the past.

Last year's record: (1) Lost to Renyu...33-36 (2) Won Shantou...39-32 (3) Won Giant...40-28 (4) Lost to Encas...32-51 (5) Won Hualian...79-50 (6) Lost to Qunsheng...53-63 (7) Drew with Huasheng...47-47 (8) Won Black and White...55-53 (9) Won McLarens...51-39

A brief description of the various matches is as follows: (1) In the first visit to Shanghai, the venue was unfamiliar, the movements were flustered, and it was impossible to control the opponent's activities. They lost to Renyu by four points. (2) Displayed power and won against the Shantou team by seven points, but there were many fouls, and at critical moments, they hesitated to hold the ball. The Shantou team also lost their usual self-centeredness, with only six out of nineteen free throws. (3) Relied on cooperation to seize the opportunity and accurate shooting, making the Giants helpless, winning by as many as twelve points. (4) Heavily defeated by Encas, because of panic and confusion, they lost the opportunity, and eight foreign players, seven of whom could shoot, lost nineteen points. (5) Won against Hualian by luck. At that time, Hualian "was careless about their diet" and had a group of dysentery. (6) Although they were no match for Qunsheng, it was still a wonderful match, putting Qunsheng in a difficult situation. (7) The charity match against Huasheng was difficult to distinguish, resulting in a 47-point draw, but in the last second, they were still leading by two points, showing courtesy, and both sides missed many shots. (8) Won against Black and White by two points, and the situation was still tense. In the overall situation, Black and White often led by one or two points, and Zheng Lun finally succeeded. There was nothing good to say about the war. (9) Demonstrated a fast offensive and won against McLarens, thanks to the momentum of the first quarter and the wonderful shots of Yu and Cai in the final quarter.

This time, they came again (1) Won Chenyou...57-38 (2) Won Renyu...55-29 (3) Won Shantou...56-38 (4) Won John...65-25 (5) Won Encas...49-40 (6) Won Giant...42-40

Description of the six performances: (1) The fierce offensive and shooting of the three musketeers Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqiang, and Yu Ruizhang made Chenyou difficult to deal with. However, the state at the beginning of the game seemed sluggish for the expeditionary force. (2) Big victory over Renyu, in "tightening" and "speeding up". (3) Winning the Shantou team by as many as eighteen points was due to sufficient strength and calm response. (4) Against John, the champion of the city's university basketball, Zheng Lun won by forty points, and new players participated in the war, controlling the overall situation. (5) Revenge, defeating the aggressive Encas, Cai Yu and Wang were all injured one after another, which shows the intensity of the battle. (6) Overwhelming the Giant, achieving six wins in six games, the battle situation was slightly dull, and Zheng Lun led all the way.

### In Order to Rationalize Gauze Adjustment, the Central Government Plans to Establish a New Organization; Government Policies and Private Interests Are Both Considered

[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that the central authorities may consider establishing a special agency under the National Economic Commission to handle gauze adjustment in order to rationalize gauze adjustment. Relevant parties stated that the current implementation of the rigid price control system for gauze has clearly deviated from the actual needs. For example, the gauze produced by state-owned yarn factories is always allocated and sold according to the controlled price, but because the black market price is often higher than the controlled price, the business management of state-owned yarn factories has faced great difficulties. How to eliminate this contradictory phenomenon will inevitably require adjusting the current gauze policy so that both state-owned and private yarn factories can benefit. Therefore, the emergence of a new gauze adjustment organization has the need for an objective environment. The establishment of this new organization and the selection of its leaders must be carefully considered. In terms of execution, it is especially necessary to strive for impartiality so that both government gauze policies and private interests can be considered and the most satisfactory solution for gauze can be obtained.

It is also learned that the central authorities deeply sympathize with the current undetermined business policy and the low wages of employees of the China Textile Construction Company and have decided to improve them based on the actual situation. It is reported that the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Chen Qitian, will come to Shanghai this week. Chen will conduct an on-site inspection of the cotton yarn industry in this city and decide on a reorganization policy for gauze.

### Central Cooperative Treasury Promotes Cooperative Financial System Cooperative Loans Through Unified Lending Plan to Issue Bonds of 50 Billion to Replenish Funds

A person in charge of the Central Cooperative Treasury told reporters that the treasury's current main task is to support the development of cooperative undertakings in the pacification areas. However, after eight years of separation and chaos in our country, the vast rural areas, barren land, and shrinking production have become an important part of the entire economic problem. Therefore, developing cooperative undertakings to improve the rural economy is a truly urgent plan. The treasury has established six sub-treasuries and eight branch treasuries throughout the country. Its original cooperative treasuries in Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and other six provinces, and the Chongqing Cooperative Treasury, will all be reorganized in accordance with the law and officially opened in the near future. However, with the current treasury funds of only 3 billion yuan allocated by the national treasury, it will be difficult to undertake the above-mentioned arduous tasks. Therefore, the authorities have considered giving the following support: (1) The government will notify the Four Joint Offices to inform the various banks and bureaus to provide the treasury with a large amount of overdraft funds. (2) All bank cooperative loans should be lent through the treasury in a unified manner. (3) The treasury will issue bonds of 50 billion yuan, which will be separately underwritten by the various banks and bureaus. (4) The treasury may discount or rediscount bills to various national banks separately and may reinsure insurance policies with the China Trust Bureau, thereby laying the foundation for the cooperative financial system.

### Soap and Candle Raw Materials Sell Well

### Civil Food Allocation Committee Officially Established Today; Seven Committee Members Headed by Wu Kaixian, Over Eighty Staff Members Temporarily Transferred from Various Agencies

The Civil Food Allocation Committee, tasked with supplying food to the citizens of Shanghai and stabilizing rice prices, has been established after consultations between Mayor Wu, Minister of Grain Gu, and Governor of the Central Bank Zhang Jia'ao. Previously, Vice Minister Pang of the Grain Department convened a preparatory meeting in Shanghai with representatives from relevant agencies, formulating organizational plans and work scopes, which were then taken to Nanjing for final decisions. It is now known that the committee will consist of seven members, including Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, Counselor Ye of the Grain Department, Ren Xianzhang of the Central Trust Bureau, as well as representatives from the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union. Director Wu Kaixian will concurrently serve as the Chairman. Director Wu returned to Shanghai today after attending the National Price Conference in Nanjing. Therefore, the Civil Food Allocation Committee is scheduled to be formally established this afternoon at the Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association on Ximen Road.

Failure to meet this deadline will result in the cancellation of loan qualifications.

### Approaching Mold Season Dampens Cigarette Market

The cigarette market has seen a decline due to the approaching mold season, with significant selling activity in the market. Dealers, with ample reserves, are less interested in buying. This morning, ten cases of Great Britain cigarettes opened at 7.45 million yuan, but quickly dropped to 2.5 million yuan before buyers emerged. The afternoon market saw further decline, with more sellers than buyers. Ten cases of Great Britain cigarettes closed at 7.18 million yuan, a decrease of 3.2 million yuan per case compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also saw a slight decrease to 6.18 million yuan, while Five-Flower and Hardman brands also saw price decreases of 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. Other brands from various factories, including Big Beauty, Portman, Brandy, and 20-pack cigarettes, also saw overall price declines.

### Chinese Tea Exporters Request Government Relief

The China Tea Joint Operations Company Manager, 　 Cheng, conveyed to the authorities the current difficulties faced by tea exporters. He traveled to Nanjing last night. It is reported that this trip will present two points to the Four Banks Joint Treasury:

(1) Please expedite the loan disbursement for new tea. Although Qimen tea has been abandoned, Ping Shui and Tunxi tea need urgent assistance. The loan amount should be temporarily set at 20 billion, with the total amount to be discussed later.

(2) Last year's old tea amounted to approximately × 10,000 dan, pledged to the Agricultural Bank of China, with a value of approximately 1.6 million US dollars. However, tea merchants suffered significant losses due to last year's capital stagnation. If sold at current international market prices, it would not be enough to cover the pledged amount. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will support this only major export industry and instruct the Agricultural Bank of China to handle it flexibly.

### Matches Highly Profitable, Soap Market Weakens

Among daily necessities, matches are the most profitable. The final price of New Beauty matches rose to 2.69 million yuan, a further increase of 60,000 yuan from the previous day. Phoenix brand also rose to 2.72 million yuan, a substantial increase of 100,000 yuan per case. New brands such as Rose, Nanjing, and Golden Tripod also increased by varying amounts of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

The soap market is relatively weak, reportedly due to eager demand from other ports, leading to significant selling activity in the market. Furthermore, a large batch of Huang Xiangmao brand soap was directly purchased from the factory at 2.6 million yuan per case, with delivery in one week, leading to a sluggish market. 　　　　　 Soap, 120 pieces per 　　, at a small 11,000 yuan, was 2.63 million yuan. Gu Benguan, Dao Guang, and other brands also saw price decreases ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 yuan. It is reported that the China 　 Soap Company plans to make slight adjustments to the factory prices of Huang Xiangmao and other brands, with Huang Xiangmao set at 2.6 million yuan per case, Sunlight soap at 3.9 million yuan, and Medicated soap at 3.7 million yuan. However, the prices of Bai Xiangmao and other goods will remain unchanged. As for Gu Ben soap from the Five Continents Soap Factory, distribution is expected to begin this week, with each dealer receiving 10 to 20 cases.

### Import and Export Industry Seeks Self-Reliance, Organizes Joint Operations Company, Capital Set at 10 Billion to 50 Billion

The city's import and export industry is currently facing losses in exports and a lack of foreign exchange supply for imports, resulting in a state of near-shutdown. This is detrimental to agriculture, industry, and commerce, and severely impacts the future development of the national economy. To rescue the import industry from this crisis, a large-scale China Import and Export Joint Operations Company is planned, with a projected total capital of 10 billion to 50 billion yuan. Details are as follows:

Organizational Principles: The organizational principles of the company are as follows: (1) It will bring together all willing import and export businesses, whether they solely engage in import, export, or both, as well as overseas Chinese holding remittances and domestic individuals holding foreign exchange, and entrepreneurs willing to import raw materials and machinery or export their finished products. (2) Groups with similar goals will operate under the same organization. Exporters, as shareholders, will provide their foreign exchange earnings to importers, who are also shareholders. The profits earned by importers, as shareholders, will offset the losses incurred by exporters, who are also shareholders. In short, whether importing, exporting, or both, all parties will have the same shareholder status within the same organization, with the aim of maintaining and developing international trade, working together in mutually beneficial ways. (3) With everyone under the same organization and holding the same shareholder status, the disposal of foreign exchange earned from exports will naturally not be an issue. The foreign exchange needed for imports will still be handled by the private sector. Just like recovering what was lost, international trade can gradually prosper as a result, and the shortcomings of the import-export linkage system can be effectively remedied through collective efforts. (4) The government's current international trade policy aims to strictly control 　save foreign exchange, encourage exports, restrict imports, and maintain and expand international markets. The China Import and Export Joint Operations Company is well-suited to meet the government's expectations. The target of control becomes simpler rather than complex, which can achieve twice the results with half the effort. Secondly, the Joint Operations Company will use its own foreign exchange earnings to conduct import business. If it can develop fully, it will not only not have to rely on the government for foreign exchange supply, but the government can also request a portion of the foreign exchange from the company if it is in need. Thirdly, under a comprehensive business strategy, the Joint Operations Company will offset export losses with high import profits, focusing on practical matters rather than empty talk. This will not only make impossible exports possible and keep international markets from declining, achieving the goal of export promotion, but also boost imports, which will greatly benefit the continued industrial production of our country, the suppression of prices, and the balance of international payments.

Founding Characteristics: The founding characteristics of the company are as follows: (1) The Joint Operations Company should be an enterprise organized to break the deadlock for import and export businesses and seek mutual benefits, not a trust that monopolizes international trade. (2) The Joint Operations Company should be an open organization that takes into account the welfare of other industries, and should not be exclusive or exclusionary. Under this premise, the needs of Chinese industry and agriculture should be fully met. For example, finding outlets for the export of Chinese industrial and agricultural products, increasing imports of machinery and raw materials needed for construction and continued production, and absorbing overseas remittances and foreign deposits through imported materials. (3) The Joint Operations Company should assist the government's economic policies, increase national tax revenue, and support post-war economic construction policies to cultivate the foundation of the national economy, not create alternative paths outside of national policy. (4) With the aim of assisting import and export businesses, the Joint Operations Company adopts a mutual trust and joint operation system. It will bear the risk of international market price fluctuations for those engaging in export within the industry who have a commercial relationship with the company. Under the premise that they hand over their foreign exchange earnings to the Joint Operations Company, impossible exports become possible, and they can obtain reasonable profits. Those engaging in import can also be entrusted by the company to conduct import trade, without being threatened by domestic market price fluctuations, making difficult imports possible and obtaining reasonable profits. (5) The Joint Operations Company should be a purely people's enterprise, with its capital coming from the private sector.

### Geneva, 15th (Airmail) Zhuang Zhihuan: China as Seen from Europe

I was fortunate to be sent to Europe at the beginning of March this year. I recall that my first trip abroad was in 1920, when I continued my studies in Europe and traveled to fourteen European countries during summer vacations. Twenty-three years have passed since I returned. At the same time, I was first sent as a young graduate to observe the situation after the First World War, compared to this time as a middle-aged man after more than twenty years of service observing the situation after the Second World War, my feelings and observations are very different. The peace conference could not be held immediately after the victory. The contradictions and conflicts between the countries, the scenes of intrigue and struggle, are still unfolding, all of which are affecting our country. Suffering China has sacrificed greatly in eight years of arduous resistance, originally hoping to compensate for everything after the victory. Who knew that the international status gained in the War of Resistance would fall sharply again, like a mute person eating bitter melon, unable to express the suffering! I set off on April 5th to rush to the Geneva conference on April 10th. The time was extremely tight. Now, I will write down my observations and opinions along the way, to provide readers with some review and reference materials.

"French Sky Island"

From Asia to Africa to Europe in five days.

I got up early on the 5th and rushed to Air France, then transferred to a large bus to Jiangwan Airport. Military airports usually cannot be entered without a pass; however, when the large bus arrived at the airport gate, the guard was stretching lazily, too tired to check the pass. Our country's "legislation must be strict, enforcement must be lenient" attitude, the guard's dereliction of duty is just another example of the sloppy character of the Chinese people and the failure of the rule of law. The French plane was named "French Sky Island" and looked exactly like the American transport planes parked next to it; they were originally from the same source, just adopted by someone else, so it is not surprising. However, the French are ultimately able to use it to organize an international flight network. At 7:00, the engine started, and at 7:20, it took off over Shanghai and the coastal provinces of China; looking down, the flat lands were all cultivated. The Chinese are the most industrious agricultural people, and farming is their forte, but apart from farming, they are not good at many other aspects of agriculture, such as forestry and animal husbandry; therefore, forests have been excessively cut down, and high slopes have been turned into terraced fields, making the soil more prone to deterioration. From the perspective of the nation's long-term interests, guidance and improvement are needed. In the past, Guanzhong was a fertile plain for thousands of miles, but now it is suffering from frequent droughts, and the yellow earth is cracked; the southeast coast has more rainfall, so it is naturally not so bad, but whether many slopes suitable for animal husbandry are worth being converted into farmland is still a big question. County governments are busy carrying out the orders of their superiors, and administrative expenses are even smaller. Which county magistrate has the leisure to investigate the geology and topography of his jurisdiction to guide farmers?

Flying over Hong Kong and Hainan Island, we entered Vietnam, and the primeval forests, rice fields, and rivers were clearly visible. Along the way, the seawater was like indigo, and the white clouds were like mountains, and gray clouds often passed between them; the same clouds, one moving and one still, the clouds changing in myriad ways, and the bottoms of the clouds were mostly flat. We on the ground do not have this feeling. At 4:00 PM, we arrived at Saigon Airport, a flight of about nine hours. In the air, you could wear an overcoat, but on the ground, you would sweat in a single shirt. The climate change was too drastic, which made travelers complain. Upon arrival, several procedures must be completed before reaching the hotel. The streets of Saigon are still quite orderly, but the streets are full of soldiers. It is said that the French army in Vietnam totals about 200,000, but other than in major cities, the French still do not dare to go.

A Short Stay in Saigon

I stayed in Saigon for a day on the 6th because Saigon is the end point of the French Far East air route, and the flight to Shanghai is an extension of this route. Saigon is a concentration of overseas Chinese, with a population of about 300,000, divided into Cantonese, Zhaoqing, Hainanese, Chaoshan, Fujian, and other groups. The above five groups each have their own organizations and compete with each other. There are Kuomintang branches and Youth Corps, and they also carry out their own activities. Disputes among overseas Chinese and the various struggles for position between the French and the Viet Minh often make it difficult for the local consulate general. Sometimes, hanging flags at gatherings becomes a big problem. To avoid disputes, only one flag is hung. The future of the French-Vietnamese issue is difficult, and our government's attitude towards France and Vietnam should be carefully considered, so as not to repeat the hasty signing of the Sino-French Agreement including Vietnam, which put our occupying forces accepting surrender in northern Vietnam in a dilemma.

At 6:30 AM on the 7th, I left the hotel to go to the airport. Among the few passengers, I boarded the plane after careful inquiry. At 7:30, it took off. At 9:00, it flew low over Angkor in Cambodia, circling once. The city was orderly, the architecture magnificent, but the deserted grass and palace ruins could only be imagined. According to archaeologists, this ancient palace, built of huge stones, was built by a resurgent and heroic ruler who believed in Buddhism and commemorated his queen, while also constructing his own image as a Buddha. It consumed money and manpower, eventually exhausting the country's power. There are still many such countries in the modern world, and we do not have time to mourn the already extinct Champs tribe!

Passing Yangon, it was already 11:45. The houses were densely packed, and the golden pagodas were dazzling. At 1:10 PM, we passed Akyab—the westernmost point reached by the Japanese army. At 3:00 PM, we arrived in Calcutta. Because we gained time every day as we traveled west, the local time was only 1:30 PM. It was very hot on the ground. I saw three China National Aviation Corporation planes at the airport, and the joy and excitement of seeing the national flag abroad can be imagined. After checking the immunization certificates and passports, we had a meal at the airport and rested for an hour before boarding the plane again. It gradually cooled down in the air. We flew between two layers of clouds, and the plane swayed and rocked in the wind. At night (10:00 PM local time), we arrived in Karachi, which was already brightly lit. After completing the inspection procedures, we went upstairs to the hotel room. I talked with Nguyen Van Hien in the plane: This man was the Grand Secretary in the Palace of Bao Dai, the abdicated emperor of Vietnam, and now he is sending his daughter to study in France, and is talking to his eldest son who works in Paris. He said that officials in the past were more respected by the people the more honest and incorruptible they were. Their affairs after death were handled by the government according to the circumstances. This is not as good as officials in recent times, who must seek compensation commensurate with their work. This is precisely the divergence between Eastern civilization and Western civilization. Calcutta and Karachi both have integrated land and air transport, which is better than Shanghai. Shanghai is the largest commercial port in China, but the failure to integrate land, sea, and air transport is a major shortcoming.

The Power of Examination and Constitutional Government

I got up at 5:00 AM on the 8th and boarded the plane at 6:10 AM, which took off immediately. The bright moon was still hanging high, and the misty air had not yet receded. Karachi was a place entrusted during the war. Its development was also during the war as a base for the Allied forces. Our expeditionary forces also trained here, but the land is very barren, and most of the hills are red and cannot be cultivated. Most of the buildings are old-style barracks.

Reading a magazine, I learned that Americans are criticizing their Congress, saying that members of Congress, in order to please voters, mostly fight for local interests and industry interests, regardless of the country's losses, which is one of the malpractices of parliamentary politics. In the past, our country's politicians were selected by examination to serve as officials, and they had to be in other provinces. This inherently had the meaning of the emperor maintaining his power, but the merit of maintaining great unity and making the rights and interests of the whole country and the whole people higher than private interests should not be ignored. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's use of five powers to replace three powers was also intended to remedy the evils of elections with examinations. Unfortunately, we have not made good use of this power of examination today, and only use the college entrance examination and the general examination as a kind of qualification for being promoted to official positions. It is still a concept of "becoming famous all over the world in one examination," "big selection of county magistrates," or "tiger class prefects and county magistrates," or a consciousness of being proud of presiding over examinations, how can it be truly thought of using the examination system to correct the abuses of elections? The implementation of constitutional government in our country is not far away, and our government should also pay attention to this issue.

Crossing the Arabian Desert

The plane flew along the coast of the Arabian Sea, crossed the Cape of Oman and entered the Persian Gulf. Most of the territory of Iran and Iraq was gray and yellow, without trees or flowers. Near Basra, the rivers were crisscrossed, the palm trees formed forests, and the deep green was interspersed with white Arabian-style buildings, creating a different kind of scenery. At 1:10 PM, we arrived at Basra Airport. This place has integrated land, sea, and air transport, with railways to Baghdad and several ships of 5,000 to 6,000 tons berthed. After getting off the plane, we ate at the station. The waiters were all Muslims, and we only ate beef and mutton. At 2:00 PM, we boarded the plane again, and at 2:40 PM, we took off (local time was 12:10 PM). When crossing the Arabian Desert, the plane shook constantly because the airflow on the desert was unstable. After flying for another forty minutes, we arrived in Cairo. After getting off the plane and going through immunization certificate and passport checks, the medical officers lined up the passengers in front of them, but they were still chatting and minding their own business, with a very arrogant attitude. Mr. Li Jiou, a military attache, was detained by the police because he was wearing a military uniform. Since the British army withdrew from Egypt on March 1, the Egyptians are now completely independent and self-satisfied, and no longer care about international etiquette. Humans often have complicated psychology, which is really pitiful and regrettable. Leaving the airport, we went to the hotel, which was magnificent and luxurious. The streets were also clean and tidy, and the city was bustling with traffic. This is a symbol of the British Empire's century of hard work. Once abandoned, it is no wonder that Churchill and his ilk were heartbroken. In a hurry, I also went with my traveling companions Qian Tang and Jun San to visit the pyramids and the Sphinx, and to admire the blue and slow-flowing Nile River. Flowing between the tall buildings on both banks, this pyramid and this river have gone through many vicissitudes, and Egypt is now independent again. The royal palace is decorated with neon crowns, which is a bit vulgar. It is said that the Egyptian government often hosts diplomatic personnel from various countries, and there are almost no empty evenings, or is it accustomed to the lingering traditions of French court diplomacy? Egypt is politically influenced by Britain and culturally influenced by France, with a deeper influence. French can be used in Cairo. Unfortunately, the pronunciation of the average Egyptian is special, and their French and English are not easy to understand. All shops and institutions are marked in Arabic, and car license plates are also listed in Arabic. In fact, the numbers used are Arabic, but they have been simplified. Men have mostly retained their flat-topped red and black hats, and some still wear long robes, but they have all changed to Western suits. Most women wear Egyptian clothes, but the face veils have been removed, which is no longer the scene of twenty years ago. There are about forty overseas Chinese in Egypt, mostly peddlers of national goods such as silk and silk fabrics. Now that the goods have no source, they have all become homeless, and our government should find a way to send them back to their country.

From the Mediterranean to Paris

I started at 2:00 AM on April 9th. After completing the inspection procedures at the airport, I took off at 3:00 AM, traveling along the African coast. The bright moon was on the left, and the white clouds were piled up. At 6:00, the sun rose, and the rays of light shone on the cloud peaks, forming a spectacular sight. At 8:00, we passed Malta Island. Looking down, the four walls were steep, and the flat land was all cultivated. The transportation roads were like spider webs. The ability of this small place to resist the German bombing and attack and to persevere to the end is actually related to the strategic situation in the Mediterranean and the victory or defeat of the war. At 9:30, we arrived in Tunis, a city in French North Africa, all green, with mountains and lakes, with abundant land and rich production. We rested for an hour, and it rained heavily, which is said to happen only ten times a year. We were lucky to encounter it.

Crossing the Mediterranean Sea

When the plane crossed the Mediterranean Sea, it was all 　　. I discussed the various troubles of crossing borders and customs with the two Catholic priests (one American and one French) on the same plane, wondering when it would be possible to achieve "one family under heaven"? Unexpectedly, they immediately replied that it was never possible. From this, we can see the basic difference between Eastern and Western cultures. In the eyes of Easterners, their concept of power is not as profound as that of Europeans and Americans, so in spirit, they believe that it is possible to gradually form a unified world from small to large, from oneself to family to country to the world. Moreover, religious figures believe in one God and take teaching people and persuading people to do good as their duty, but they also do not believe that "one family under heaven" is possible. At 12:07, we saw Marseille. The weather was cold and the air was condensed. We saw the rivers, railways, cities, and farms within France. At 3:00, we arrived at the Bourget Airport in Paris. This place was originally a military airport and served as a base for the recapture of Paris. Now it is a commercial airport. Because France lacks resources and has inflation, there are many smugglers. Customs inspection of passengers' luggage and declaration of foreign currency entering the country are particularly strict, but customs officials also accept bribes and simplify procedures. I personally saw a person bribing customs officials with cigarettes (French cigarettes are a state-run business, so foreign cigarettes have become valuable), and they were exempted from inspection.

It has been more than twenty years since I arrived in Paris. As I entered the city, it took me a long time to recognize it accurately. I arrived at the "Prince of Wales" hotel booked by our embassy in France, which was beautiful and clean, and the staff could all speak English, which proves the great power of English. The elevator operator wore many medals on his chest. When asked, he was 65 years old and still a hero of the First World War. He had many feelings about the current situation, especially the high cost of living. After the victory of the war, all countries and nations are in hardship and distress, and international conferences are frequent, but the dawn of peace has not yet appeared. Compared with the ability to hold a peace conference as soon as possible after the First World War, the scene is even more tragic and deplorable.

### The Embryo of the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway

— Hangzhou, 27th Fast News Dispatch by Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng

If there were no wars across the country, then the construction projects within Zhejiang Province might not be proceeding so quickly and smoothly. Take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, for instance. Many of these steel rails were originally needed for railways in Central China, North China, and the Northeast, but because war is raging there, most of them can be used for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Take water conservancy projects, for example. Originally, water conservancy projects were to be undertaken all over the country, and there would not be enough water conservancy experts to go around. Now, Zhejiang has many experts in permanent benefit projects. Shouldn't Zhejiang be congratulated for this? The people and officials of Zhejiang should seize this opportunity and catch up! Shen Chengzhang, the Chairman of Zhejiang Province, once had detailed and grand construction plans. The most important of these was to dredge the Qiantang River and use its water power for various construction projects. Another was to connect the transportation of the two Zhejiangs, complete the Zhejiang railway network, and build the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway. Shen once said that if these two things were accomplished, he would die content. With this spirit to engage in the construction of Zhejiang, we should wish him success in advance.

Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway Should Follow Route

There has already been much discussion about the funds, and the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau has already been established. The initial steps for harnessing the Qiantang River have already begun. As for the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway, it is still in the planning stage. We might as well say it is in its embryonic stage. The reporter would like to describe everything about this embryo:

Although Zhejiang Province is called a province with progress in various undertakings, due to the obstruction of mountains and rivers between eastern and western Zhejiang, it takes a very long time to get from western Zhejiang to eastern Zhejiang. It is actually faster to go via Shanghai, sail south by sea, and then travel upstream by inland river. Therefore, from the point of view of transportation, it is not yet an ideal situation. Shen Chengzhang then proposed the construction of the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway. The so-called "Hang" and "Yong" refer to Hangzhou and Yongjia, respectively. Yongjia, formerly known as Wenzhou, is a major port on the coast of Zhejiang. After Shen reported this to the central government, he requested the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to survey the route on his behalf. Those ordered to conduct the survey prepared in early February, departed from Hangzhou on the 18th, and completed the survey on April 3rd.

The route of the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway could originally go through Shaoxing, Pingshui, Wangcheng, Yi'lai, Fengtianling, and then south along a tributary of the Yan Stream, passing through Wuyan, Chengtan, Shuangxikou, Wangduli, and then reaching Majia Stream, directly to the foot of Houshiling, and then south along Jia Stream and Zhanshanmao Stream to Tiantai, and then from Tiantai to Yongjia. It could also go from Cao'e, Shengxian, change course along the eastward-flowing Yan Stream to reach Xinchang, and then to Banzhu, near Houjiang, and then along another small stream to Wangduli, and then reaching Majia Stream, directly to the foot of Houshiling, and then south along Jia Stream and Zhanshanmao Stream to Tiantai, and then from Tiantai to Yongjia. However, according to the surveyors, the construction of the above two routes is larger and will take longer. There are many places where tunnels need to be built, and the shortest tunnel is still two kilometers long. The production of silk, tea, tobacco, wood, and other products along the route has decreased sharply in recent years, and there is also a lack of large amounts of mineral resources. Whether from an engineering or economic standpoint, there is no reason to adopt these two routes. According to the surveyors' proposal, the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway should follow the Hangzhou-Ningbo Road from Ningbo Bridge, cross the Yuyao River, and then follow the left bank of the Yin River, passing through Jieshe, Jiangkou, to Fenghua. From Fenghua, it should go south, passing through Fangmen, Xikou, Fuxi, bypassing Yangmeiling and then south, passing through Meilin, Guanzhuang, reaching Ninghai, and then west, passing Jianxi, to Huangtan Street, and then through Guxiu Ridge, reaching Liangwang Street and further south, passing through Daxiwang, to near Bailiang Bridge, crossing the Bai Stream. After this, it must gradually ascend along the hillside to Sangzhou Ridge, then turn southeast, follow Yong Stream, and after passing Heliu Town, turn south, cross Tongpan Ridge, and then turn west to reach Haiyou Town. Afterwards, it should go upstream along the Zhu Stream, passing south of Zhuao, and then west to Jiaoshi and Hengtou Dai, and further to near Tingtouzhai, then follow the Shifeng Stream upwards directly to Tiantai. This section requires a tunnel to be built in Sangzhou Ridge, about 340 meters long; a large bridge needs to be built on the Yuyao River, but it is easier to build than the two inland routes. Therefore, the surveyors plan to adopt this route. From Ningbo, passing through Fenghua, Ninghai, Haiyou to near Tingtouzhai, the route must be divided into two lines, one to Tiantai County, which is called the Tiantai branch line, and one following the Shifeng Stream south, which is the main line. The main line passes through Zhongdu, Chimu, Shifoyang to Linhai, and in the vicinity of Linhai County, it crosses the Shilai Stream, changes course to the right bank and goes down to Sandong Bridge and Changdian, still goes down along the river bank, reaches near Jiangkou Town, and crosses the Yongning River, but at this point the river is about 700 meters wide, or the route may be extended to near Huangyan to cross the river. After crossing the Yongning River, the route is divided into an eastward line to Haimen, which is the Haimen branch line, and a southeastward line through Luqiao, Muxu, Hengfeng Bridge, Wenling Street, which is the main line, and then goes along the coast, then passes through the south of Huwu and Dajing, and Baixi Street to reach Qingjiangdu, where a large bridge needs to be built, then passes through Longzhailing, which can be opened up, and reaches Hongqiao Town, then passes through Yueqing County, goes south to the west of Liushi and Guantou, and then turns west and goes upstream along the north bank of the Ou River, directly to Gangtou opposite Yongjia. The entire route can be divided into two stages. From Ningbo to Ninghai, it is about 83 kilometers. From Ninghai via Haiyou to Tiantai, it is about 83 kilometers. From Tiantai to Haimen, it is about 84 kilometers. The total length is 250 kilometers, which is planned as the first stage. From Jiangkou to Qingjiangdu, it is about 73 kilometers, and from Qingjiangdu to Gangtou, it is about 62 kilometers. The total length is 135 kilometers, which is planned as the second stage. The total length of the entire line is 385 kilometers.

Three Reasons for Choosing the Route

The reasons for adopting this route for the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway are: (1) The coastal area has a dense population, rich products, and famous scenic spots such as Tiantai and Yandang, which can attract tourists and increase business income. (2) Xiangshan Port, Sanmen Bay, Yueqing Bay, and other natural military, commercial, and fishing harbors urgently need to be renovated and developed, and they must rely on railway supplies and cultivation. (3) This route is just the necessary coastal line between the two major ports, East and South, in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan. If this road is completed, it will directly strengthen national defense, develop industry and commerce, and indirectly promote the realization of the coastal line between the two major ports in the plan. All counties along the line mainly produce grain. Other products include Yinxian's mat grass and flour, Fenghua's bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal, Yongjia's canned goods, Ninghai's wood, bamboo, fish, and seaweed, Sanmen's cotton, hemp, coal, zinc, iron, and fish, Tiantai's tung oil, firewood, sulfur, quartz, and iron, Linhai's cotton, hemp, native silk, cloth, fish, lime, and fluorite, Huangyan's aquatic vegetables and fish, Wenling's cotton, cigarettes, pottery, and fish, Yueqing's fish, and Yongjia's vegetable oil, oranges, tea, tobacco silk, cotton thread, wax paper, medicine, umbrellas, cigarettes, and matches.

Countless Scenic Spots Along the Line

The scenic spots along the line include the famous Tiantong Temple in the territory of Yin County, which began in the Jin Dynasty, and contains the scenic spots of Guanyin Cave and Linglong Rock, about 60 li from the city. In the territory of Zhenhai County, there is the Yuwang Temple, which began in the time of King Li of Zhou, and the Dongqian Lake, which is 18 li wide, with many peaks standing and containing seventy-two streams; in the territory of Fenghua, there are Xuedou Temple, Qianzhangyan, Miaogao Terrace, Yintan, Jinping Mountain, Zhongta, Yuelin Temple, etc.; Ninghai has the Yuelong Mountain, where Ming Dynasty sage Fang Zhengxue studied, the Zhuwo Bing Pavilion, where the remains of Fang Zhengxue's relatives were buried, the Cimu Stone, where Luo Shi cried for his mother, and the Shijing Hermitage Temple, where Fang Zhengxue began his studies; Sanmen has the ancient Guangrun Temple of the Jin Dynasty, the Chikan, the righteous homeland of Fang Guozhen of the Ming Dynasty, the Chema Ferry, where Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty crossed the river, Yuan Sheng Xi Lai, where Zhang Cangshui was martyred, and the Sanmen tides between the three mountains, etc. Tiantai has eight scenic spots, the magnificent Guoqing Temple, the Chicheng Mountain where Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty celebrated the New Year, the Huading Temple where the East China Sea can be viewed, the Baijing Terrace, the Fangguang Temple with the Stone Liang Flying Waterfall, the Wannian Temple with many ancient artifacts bestowed by emperors of past dynasties, the Luoxi Fishing Rod, known as Shitong, the Tongbai Palace where Boyi and Shuqi starved to death, the Hanyan Mingyue, where 30,000 troops can be stationed in the cave, as well as Xianren Zuo, Qingxi Luoyan, and Duanqiao Jixue, etc.; Linhai has the Jinzi Mountain, Longgu Mountain, Jinshan Mountain, Baifeng Mountain and other scenic spots, Huangyan has the Jiufeng Mountain where Zhu Xi of the Song Dynasty once lectured; Liushi has the Danyai where Ge Xian is said to have cultivated Taoism, and Yueqing has the famous Yandang Mountain, which is famous at home and abroad. The peaks of this mountain are steep and strange, soaring thousands of feet, and densely piercing the sky. There is a lake on the top of the mountain, ten li in circumference, the water does not dry up, and when the spring geese return, they often roost here; the mountain has east, west, inner and outer valleys, the east outer valley has five peaks, the east inner valley has forty-eight peaks, and the west inner and outer valleys have twenty-four peaks. There are eighteen temples built, each with a different name. The peaks have stone walls hundreds of feet high, flying waterfalls thousands of feet high, and a huge abyss formed by the confluence of streams. On the side of the abyss, the stone railing has a cave like a well, deep and immeasurable, and other strange sights; Yongjia has Rongshan, Tuotou Ancient Temple, etc.

All Parties Estimate a Three-Year Payback

According to the surveyors' report: The first phase, from Ningbo to Haimen, is 250 kilometers, including general affairs, preparation, land purchase, roadbed construction, tunnels, bridge construction, route protection, telegraph and telephone, track, signals and switches, stations and houses, machinery, vehicles, maintenance and other expenses. The domestic materials and labor costs are estimated at 154.12645 million yuan, and the foreign materials are estimated at 7.11205 million US dollars. The second phase, from Haimen to Yongjia, is 135 kilometers, including the same expenses as the first phase. The domestic materials and labor costs are estimated at 91.88145 million yuan, and the foreign materials are estimated at 4.17348 million US dollars. In total, the entire project requires a total of 246 million yuan in national currency and 7.9 million yuan, and a total of 11.28553 million US dollars. According to the official price of 12,000 yuan in legal currency per US dollar, it is 135.42636 million yuan. The total is 381.43426 million yuan in national currency. The railway operating income is determined by referring to the national railway fare, with passenger transport at 40 yuan per person per kilometer. The estimated total number of passengers from Ningbo to Haimen is 2.6827 million, and the total number of passengers on the entire Ningbo-Yongjia line is 4.0442 million. The total annual passenger revenue for Ninghai is 171.6928 million yuan, and the total revenue for the entire line is 258.8288 million yuan. Furthermore, referring to the national railway freight rate of 60 yuan per ton-kilometer, assuming that the annual income of the first phase of Ninghai is 51 million yuan, and the entire line is 57.18 million yuan. If the total income from passenger and freight transport is assumed to be as above, then it is a total of 538.5216 million yuan. If this number is followed, then the principal can be repaid in six years. However, this estimate is for the first year, and it is also estimated that the entire project can be completed in the first year. If the entire project can be completed on schedule in the first year, it is believed that the operating income in the second year will definitely double, and then the principal may be repaid in less than three years.

Form the Embryo and Promote Its Birth

The main problem now is that the Zhejiang Provincial Government is determined to do this, but does not have the money. Some people suggest issuing public bonds, and the provincial government is carefully planning this. In fact, the figure of 30 million yuan only requires a few far-sighted wealthy merchants to donate it. I personally know that there are many wealthy merchants in Shanghai who spend more than ten million yuan on a single banquet. I see that they have no less than 200 banquets a year, and there are more than a thousand such wealthy merchants in Shanghai. Then, they only need to save the banquets. However, in China today, no one is willing to do things without rights. For example, issuing public bonds, the Chinese people are simply not interested in public bonds. And although the allocation of public bonds is taken by wealthy merchants, the wealthy merchants then allocate them to the lower levels, and the lower levels then allocate them to the lower levels. In the end, it is still the poor and loyal farmers who bear this responsibility. I suggest that if the government cannot raise the money to do this for a while, and if public bonds cannot be issued, then it is better to do it under official supervision and commercial management. There are many such examples in the United States. Today's China, I think this can also be done, perhaps it can reduce the improper activities of hot money, and the current economic situation will be slightly more stable.

Time is of the essence, and now is the best opportunity for Zhejiang's construction. Since there is already an embryo, which was already in February of this year, then according to the usual human birth, it can be born nine months later. Of course, a huge undertaking cannot be compared with a human birth, but in October of this year, we all hope to see its construction begin.

### How Should Shanghai Port Be Developed?

— Shi Konghuai

The main conditions for the establishment of a port are: first, it must have sufficient depth so that import and export ships can navigate without hindrance; second, it must have natural or artificial barriers to protect ships from wind and waves. In addition, to facilitate the docking of ships, there should be pier facilities; to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods, there should be loading and unloading equipment; to facilitate the storage of goods, there should be warehouse construction; to facilitate the distribution of goods, there should be convenient transportation to connect with domestic and foreign countries. However, the prosperity of a port depends purely on the condition of its hinterland. Shanghai is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, with the Yangtze River basin, which has abundant products, an area of 750,000 square miles (half of mainland China), and a population of 200 million, as its hinterland. In terms of the coast, Shanghai is the starting and ending point of north-south ocean shipping. Since it was opened as a commercial port in the 22nd year of Daoguang of the former Qing Dynasty (1842), after more than 100 years of continuous human effort, the population has reached more than 4.5 million, factories are densely packed, trade is prosperous, and the amount of production and consumption is considerable. Therefore, Shanghai's superior position and possible future development are unmatched by any port in the world. It is appropriate that before the war, the annual import and export trade volume was nearly 50% of the total national import and export trade volume, and its import and export ship tonnage reached 40 million tons, making it the ninth largest port in the world.

In 1946, Shanghai's import and export ship statistics were 14 million tons. If there had been no US seafarers' strike in the second half of the year, its tonnage would have increased, but it would not have exceeded 20 million tons. Since Shanghai port could accommodate 40 million tons before the war, why is it that after the war, ships were less than 20 million tons, and the port became congested? The reasons are nothing more than: (1) the docks damaged during the war have not been completely repaired; (2) most of the floating docks that were taken away by the enemy for use have not been recovered and replenished; (3) the enemy and puppet goods stored in the warehouses have not been completely cleared; (4) the loading and unloading of goods is slow; (5) some docks are silted up; (6) some dock pontoons are designated for military use. However, the above situations are all temporary phenomena, and after a considerable period of time, they can be gradually improved, and there is no doubt that the pre-war throughput capacity will be restored.

This time, the Anti-Japanese War was victorious, and the homeland was restored, but the losses suffered by our country's materials during the war were enormous. Therefore, after the war, we were busy with repatriation and relief, and there was no spare energy to engage in active construction for a while, let alone economic prosperity. However, construction is the key to our country's future survival, and the start of construction cannot be delayed. Once it starts, the required equipment will be large, and anything that cannot be supplied domestically must be obtained from abroad. After construction, if the domestic market cannot absorb our country's production materials, we must promote them abroad. Therefore, even if Shanghai port recovers to its pre-war capacity, it will still feel insufficient to meet the needs. According to past statistics, Shanghai's import and export ship tonnage has doubled every 30 years, which can be taken as proof. Furthermore, domestic and foreign人士 all agree that if our country's political and economic situation is stable, Shanghai port will be listed alongside New York and London as a major port in the world. Therefore, how should Shanghai port be developed in order to shoulder this important mission? This is a crucial issue. I would like to offer the following points for discussion:

(1) Water Depth Issues

In order to facilitate the entry and exit of ships, the port water surface must have an appropriate depth. According to economic principles, the larger the ship's deadweight, the lower the transportation cost. However, the larger the ship's deadweight, the deeper its draft must be. Therefore, the International Shipping Conference has stipulated that the standard water depth for ports should be 48 feet. The water depth of New York port, the Suez Canal, and the Panama Canal are all around 40 feet. The shallowest water depth of the Shanghai Huangpu River channel is 26 feet below the lowest water level. During high flood season, the tide height is 8 feet, which can give a water depth of 34 feet. During low flood season, the tide height is 6 feet, which can give a water depth of 32 feet. The draft of ocean-going ships entering and leaving Shanghai port is usually from 24 feet to 18 feet, but there are also many ships with a draft of more than 30 feet. The postal ship President Coolidge with a draft of 31 feet 6 inches entered Shanghai port in 1941, and the oil tanker Walden with a draft of 32 feet 1 inch entered Shanghai port in 1937. It can be seen that although the current water depth of Shanghai port can cope with the situation, it is still far from the 40 feet water depth generally used by major ports in the world. In the near future, the export volume of our country's industrial and agricultural products will increase, and the quantity of imports and exports will gradually balance out. The increase in the draft of Shanghai's import and export ships is to be expected. Therefore, the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau plans to deepen the Shentan of the Yangtze River estuary to 37 feet during low high tide in the near future, and to deepen the Huangpu River channel to 30 feet below the lowest water level, so that ships with a draft of 33 feet can enter and exit conveniently, and then gradually deepen it according to actual needs, in order to benefit navigation and business.

(2) Port Layout Issues

Docks are the necessary equipment for ships to dock. In the future, as the number of ships increases, docks must be added. According to the construction of docks, there are three types: protruding, recessed, and parallel. Protruding docks are built protruding from the river bank towards the river, such as the docks on both banks of the Hudson River in New York. However, the river is more than a mile wide, so although the docks on both banks are 1,200 feet long, there is still a width of 3,000 feet in the middle of the river channel, which can be used as a turning area for navigation. The width of the lower reaches of the Huangpu River is only 2,000 feet, so protruding docks cannot be used. Recessed docks are built by excavating from the shore, such as the docks in London, Liverpool, and Hamburg. The advantage of this type of dock is that it can increase the length of the dock by several times with a limited shoreline, and its effect is the same as that of protruding docks, this is one. In addition, it is extremely inconvenient for ships to load and unload goods in places where the water level varies greatly. Therefore, recessed docks are usually used when the water level difference is more than 12 feet, and ship locks are built to maintain the water level and facilitate loading and unloading. Ships are required to enter and exit at high tide, this is two. Parallel docks are built along the coast parallel to the shore, and Shanghai has always used this type of design. Whether to follow the old practice in the future or adopt other methods, the opinions of people in the society are quite divided. Some advocate that Shanghai port should be thoroughly re-planned, abolishing the areas on both sides of the Puxi and Pudong as dock and warehouse areas, and choosing other places such as Wusong Rihuigang to build recessed docks. The main reason is that the docking of ships along the Huangpu River will easily cause street traffic congestion due to the movement of goods. In addition, recessed docks are equipped with railways, which can enable combined rail-water transportation and increase transportation efficiency. This issue can be studied from the aspects of transportation economics and shoreline. The water level difference of Shanghai port is usually no more than 8 feet. According to the opinions of shipping companies, entering and leaving parallel docks is considered to be the most convenient. As for combined rail-water transportation, there is no difference in efficiency between building all the railway tracks behind the parallel docks and building them above the recessed docks. Furthermore, the Huangpu River, from the Zhangjiatang upstream port boundary line to the Wusongkou downstream port boundary line, is 23 miles long, which means that the shoreline on both sides is 46 miles long, and only half of it is currently used and developed. In particular, the undeveloped and usable shoreline on both sides from the Qiujiang Wharf to the Wusongkou is sufficient for expansion in the next few decades. Before the war, the docks were concentrated near the concession due to concession relations. In the future, it would be most reasonable to develop towards Wusong. According to past statistics, 40% of Shanghai's imported goods are re-exported to coastal and riverine areas. These goods can be unloaded in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River and transferred to river and sea ships or trains for export, without having to dock at wharves in the central area, reducing port congestion. In October 1946, a comparison was made of the construction costs of recessed and parallel docks. Assuming that 4,000 feet of docks were built, the construction cost of parallel docks was 11.7 billion legal tender, while the construction cost of recessed docks was 17.1 billion, a difference of 5.4 billion. In other words, the construction cost of recessed docks is about 50% higher than that of parallel docks. Not only that, but parallel docks can be built in deep water areas, without the need for annual dredging. On the contrary, according to past statistics, recessed docks silt up to 5 feet per year. Therefore, the annual dredging cost is more than 500 million yuan. This increased cost will be borne by ships and goods, which is tantamount to increasing the price of goods. Furthermore, in the past, a considerable amount of Shanghai's imported goods were directly unloaded from ships to barges and transferred to riverside factories and warehouses, and less was transferred from ships to docks and then to trucks. If the current docks are scattered along the Huangpu River, and cargo trucks are already considered to be obstructing traffic, then after the adoption of recessed docks, ships will be concentrated in several places for loading and unloading goods, and the congestion at the main roads that trucks must pass will be even more severe. Based on the above arguments, the following considerations can be made for the layout of Shanghai port in the future:

(1) The Huangpu River is the lifeline of Shanghai port. The deep water areas on both sides of the Huangpu River should be utilized as much as possible to maintain and expand parallel docks, especially the area below the Qiujiang Wharf as the future development target location.

(2) If the shoreline required for parallel docks is indeed insufficient in a few decades, then the construction of recessed docks should be considered. The land on both sides below the Qiujiang Wharf should be reserved in advance, with a width of 3,000 feet from the shore.

(3) Cargo Loading and Unloading Equipment Issues

The faster the loading and unloading of cargo on ships, the shorter the time they stay in the port, which means that the effective sailing time for cargo can be increased. Therefore, the equipment for loading and unloading cargo in the port should be studied extensively. Before the war, labor in Shanghai was cheap. For economic reasons, it was utilized as much as possible, so that there was almost no mechanical equipment on the docks. The efficiency of cargo loading and unloading in a seaport is measured by the number of tons of cargo that can be loaded and unloaded per foot of dock per year. In 1924, Shanghai unloaded 285 tons of cargo per foot of dock, which was better than New York's 150 tons per foot of dock per year. The reason for this is that passenger ships and postal ships in New York travel frequently, these ships carry more passengers and less cargo, and secondly, the shipping companies in New York have not made full use of the docks they have leased to berth ships. However, compared with the record of 1,500 tons of cargo unloaded per foot of dock per year at the Marseille docks, the efficiency of Shanghai port is far behind. At the same time, the current labor cost in Shanghai is almost the highest in the world. In order to increase port efficiency and reduce transportation costs, all docks should be mechanized. However, some loading and unloading workers will inevitably lose their jobs as a result. This is a social problem that should be considered in advance.

(4) Combined Water, Land, and Air Transportation Issues

After foreign imported goods arrive in Shanghai, in addition to a portion being absorbed locally, 40% must be transshipped to other parts of our country. For export goods, the opposite is true: they are concentrated in Shanghai from various places and then exported from the port. Shanghai is the hub of water, land, and air transportation, and its relationship is important. It is necessary to ensure that ocean-going ships are closely connected with our country's river ships, sea ships, railways, highways, and airplanes. Therefore, the docks to be built in the future must not only be equipped with railways and highways to connect with the main lines, but also have close connections with airports. General psychology believes that air transport has a small capacity and high freight rates, and is often neglected, but air transport is fast. Shanghai will soon be one of the important stations in the world's air transport network. The layout of the airport and the connection with the docks should be equally emphasized to achieve the goal of convenient collection and distribution of goods and reduce warehouse congestion.

(5) Traffic Issues on Both Sides of the Huangpu River

The Huangpu River is one of the important assets of Shanghai port, and the deep water areas on both sides should be utilized as much as possible to build docks, as mentioned earlier. However, how to transport the goods unloaded in Pudong that need to be used in Puxi, or need to be transshipped to both sides of the Puxi River, is a point worth studying. The current method of transportation is to use barges. This is not inconvenient if the storage or use location of the goods is close to the riverbank. If it is far from the shore, vehicles must be used for transshipment, which requires additional loading and unloading procedures. Therefore, a simple solution is: one is to build bridges over the Huangpu River. However, if low bridges are built, bridge piers must be built in the middle of the river line on both sides, which will inevitably change the river system and damage the Huangpu River dredging project. Even if the middle part of the bridge can be moved to allow ships to pass, it will still hinder free navigation. If high bridges are built, the bridge surface must be more than 135 feet above the water surface. There is no obstacle for ships to pass under the bridge, but the approach bridges are too long and require a lot of land. This is obviously difficult in busy areas. The second is to build a tunnel 90 feet below the water surface of the Huangpu River, which will not hinder the Huangpu River or ship navigation, and the approach road does not need to be as long as the approach bridge, which is the most ideal. In places as far away as under the Thames River in London, under the Elbe River in Hamburg, and as close as under the Hudson River in New York, under the Mersey River in Liverpool, and under the Schlde River in Antwerp, tunnels have been built, which can be taken as evidence. However, the construction of tunnels requires sufficient time for surveying, design, fundraising, and so on. It seems that the car ferries planned to be built by the municipal ferry company should be actively built and expanded in various places. In the future, a low bridge with a movable middle hole can also be built near the new Longhua Railway Station, so that the railway tracks can be extended to the Gaogiao area of Pudong, forming a ring port railway, so that railways can share part of the responsibility for short- and long-distance cross-river freight transportation.

(6) Management Issues

The efficiency of a port depends not only on the perfection of its equipment, but also on its management. The management methods of ports in various countries often vary depending on their historical background, political system, and economic environment. In the United States, laws are passed by Congress, and state governors appoint and people elect representatives to organize committees to handle port affairs, such as the ports of New York, Boston, and New Orleans. However, river and marine engineering, quarantine, and customs work related to waterways are still the responsibility of the federal government. Furthermore, the docks in New York and Philadelphia are managed separately by the municipal government. There are also port public companies in the United States, authorized by Congress, and representatives elected by local people to manage port affairs. Their scope is not very large, such as Oregon and Portiand in California. In the United Kingdom, the seaport autonomy system is popular. Laws are formulated by Congress, the central government appoints committee members, local council agencies elect representatives, and companies and people who pay taxes to the port elect representatives to organize committees to handle waterway, dock, warehouse, loading and unloading and other businesses. It is worth noting that the number of elected representatives is greater than the number of appointed representatives, which is a major feature of port management methods. Shanghai port adopts a division of labor and cooperation method for its management. The control of the port is the responsibility of the Jianghai Customs; the security of the port is jointly handled by the port police of the Jianghai Customs and the water police of the municipal government; quarantine is handled by the quarantine office of the Health Department; the dredging of the Huangpu River is the responsibility of the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau; and the docks and warehouses are operated by Chinese and foreign merchants. The number of public docks and warehouses is limited. In order to establish close connections, the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee was established in October last year to promote port efficiency. Whether to proceed to centralize the organization and unify management in the future, like the port affairs of London and Liverpool, remains to be discussed and decided. In short, the local government believes that port affairs in a place are local in nature and should be managed by the local government. The central government believes that the function of the port has a huge impact on the country's foreign trade and international navigation, exceeding the scope of the local area, and should be managed by the central government. The port organizations of London and Liverpool can be called democratic, taking into account the interests of the central government, local government, shipping companies, and exporters, which is worth studying.

Spring and Autumn

### Soviet Literature in America

— Zhao Jingshen

Ernest J. Simmons is the chairman of the American-Soviet Association, a professor of Soviet literature in the Slavic Department at Columbia University, and has written monographs on Dostoevsky, Pushkin, and Tolstoy. Recently, he wrote a book review introducing the newly translated American versions of Gorky's "Orphan Paul" and a newly edited collection of Tolstoy's novellas. In addition, America has recently published a collection of Gorky's plays.

"Orphan Paul" is a collection of novellas, and also includes an unfinished manuscript "How I Became a Writer," all of which have been translated into English for the first time. Realism is not based on Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy, but on Gorky. Orphan Paul, originally named "The Unfortunate Pavel," was published by Gorky in 1894 in a newspaper in Nizhny Novgorod when he first began writing literature. It had not been noticed by biographers and critics for many years. It was not until the Soviet Union held a 10th anniversary commemoration of Gorky's death last year that they paid attention to this work.

Like many of Gorky's early novels, this novel is about childhood and boyhood memories, writing about the poor environment of his grandfather's family, the childhood labor, the strange employers, and his love for birds and nature. In fact, Paul is, in some ways, an avatar of Gorky. His particular loneliness and introspection, as well as his pure ideal of harlots, show that there is something of himself in it. Paul was raised by the woman-hater Arifey, whose character is a mixture of police and religion. Later, Arifey's mind becomes unbalanced, suffering from holiness and sin, and finally enters a mental hospital, where he dies. Later, Paul becomes an apprentice under a drunken shoemaker. He gradually grows up, distrusting people, especially women—Arifey taught him that women are the root of all evil. However, he meets the prostitute Natalya, which adds vitality to his life, removes the loneliness of his daily life, and ensures a happy future. The story to this point can be said to have the fragrance of "Man郎攝什戈" (likely a typo or reference I can't find a direct translation for, possibly a book or poem). Paul proposes to her, but she is not used to this kind of rigid life and does not agree to the marriage. As a result, she falls into the gloom of Dostoevsky's novels, like the murderer in "The Idiot," Paul kills the prostitute.

"Tolstoy's Novellas" is a praiseworthy book in the "Dial Permanent Library" series, just like the previously published "Dostoevsky's Novellas." This volume includes "The Cossacks," "The Death of Ivan Ilyich," "The Snowstorm," and "Family Happiness," using Aylmer Maude's translation. However, masterpieces such as "The Devil," "Polikushka," and "Master and Man" are not included, apparently due to space limitations. The editor, Philip Rahv, pointed out that Tolstoy's style is true and simple, without mystery or sentimentality, and what is expressed in the novel is life itself.

### To Dispel Sorrow with Music and Books

— Xu Shiqi

### "Cutting Smoke" Self-Preface

— Sikong Wuji

I cannot repress my emotions; I love to gaze afar at the curling village smoke, I love to look up at the spreading white clouds, I love to stand alone on the mountaintop in a daze, gazing at the misty, shifting miasma below. Filled with compassionate tears, I foolishly face the dreamlike world.

Once, I borrowed a mirror from my soul and looked into my own heart. What was there? – Clouds, dense fog; wisps of blue smoke. Enveloping a seemingly eternal mystery of life.

Thus, I felt lost and even melancholic. However, I could not bear to endure it, so I wearily lay on the ground, opened the lid of my soul, and let the clouds and dense fog transform into wisps of blue smoke; drifting, drifting, slowly drifting away.

How I longed to see what was hidden behind the clouds and dense fog!

Thus, I impetuously threw many innocent questions into the worldly and mercenary world. But I never expected that it would arouse the disgust of many people with excessive fastidiousness. So, I was imprisoned, drifted about, and struggled on the line of death... inexplicably accepting a great deal of undeserved pain.

There was a time when I suspected I had lost the elasticity of life—I even thought of leaving this world of suffering. It was love (what a tremendous force it is!) that saved me from utter despair. I thought of the deceased Ye Zi, and the reserved Lu Yan; I realized that escape was never a good solution to pain.

So, I decided to live well again. Due to the rise of this hope for a new life, I began to realize that there was a glimmer of light faintly flashing in my heart; like a firefly on a summer night, shining brightly; how precious this little bit of light was in the darkness! Some say that it is the sun of my hope. Yes, I sincerely hope that the sun will drive away the melancholy in my heart—those clouds and that dense fog.

Now, I should mention the origin of my poetry writing.

Speaking of which, it's been four years. At that time, I suffered the same pain as Juyin; externally, we were plagued by poverty and illness, and internally, we were burdened by national and family sorrows. In short, we were mentally and physically exhausted, and I still can't bear to recall it. I lived in Xiangjiapo on the South Bank of Chongqing. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, it was late. The moonlight poured down like silver, reflecting the scaly waves of the Yangtze River. I crossed the river to visit Juyin. How I longed to see my friend in distress! But Juyin was not in the theater troupe. He had gone out and did not return late at night. Who knew where his tears had flowed again?

I lonely raised my heavy head and looked at the pale moonlight. I groaned Lao Po's "Shui Diao Ge Tou." – "Not leaving has resentment, why always part?" For the first time, I shed tears that I hadn't shed in ten years. The wind, cold and sharp, pierced my heart. With the little money I had, I got myself very drunk. Although my eyes were a little blurred, my heart was very clear. Dragging my staggering steps, I returned to the South Bank. It was the last ferry. It was not too far from the riverbank to Xiangjiapo. But it took me three full hours. By the time I tried to put my weary body on the bed, the moon had already been torn apart by the western clouds. Extreme fatigue caused extreme pain. I tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep. I got up, turned on the light, and wrote a poem to comfort Juyin. – This was my first new poem.

I had never dared to try writing new poetry. But after this, I felt that no literary form could express my feelings at that time more appropriately or suitably than poetry.

Then, I wrote a total of more than a dozen short poems. I had several of them published in Wanqiu's "Qingguang." Later, I used the pseudonym Bai Ke and sent them to Brother Kejia and Mr. Bian Zhilin, who was far away in Kunming. Kejia didn't know it was me. He wrote several lines of comments on the back of the poems. He said that these poems were indeed something squeezed out of life, but they were too tragic; even the meaning, the tone, and even every word. Mr. Zhilin sincerely wanted me to cherish this basic inspiration. The praise from my friends gave me some confidence. I began to scribble some little things that could also be considered poems. Speaking of why the meaning, tone, and even every word are tragic; of course, the oppression of life is the main reason. I really don't want to explain any further. At this point, I ask Brother Kejia to especially forgive me. I have never told you that Bai Ke is another pen name of mine. Because I really didn't have the courage to shamelessly offer my own immature voice in front of a poet who had been writing poetry for fifteen years. I also deceived an old poet—he is a giant star in the Chinese literary world. I said that these little poems were written by my young friend, a young man who had just turned twenty, who was learning to write; asking him to correct them. He didn't correct them. He just pondered for a long time, smiled sadly, and said; "Too heavy! These are the feelings of middle-aged people, and only middle-aged people can understand them."

Thanks to a big fire, it burned away some of my clothes, and it also generously burned away my first dozen or so overly dark little poems.

In this era, tall buildings and people's lives are equally fragile. What's more, a dozen or so little poems have always been despised as pretentious moaning (?).

But they are the bitter juice squeezed out of my life; I exchanged them for my haggard face; their cremation has a flesh-and-blood connection with me. Although they are poems that are so insignificant as to be ridiculous. But, please forgive me, I am Chinese, I do not have Gogol's generosity.

I was silent for a year!

When in pain, I read the Songs of Chu. Qu Yuan should be the poet I admire the most. Stirred by so many emotions, I picked up the pen to write poetry for the second time. Most of them are preserved in this little collection. Almost every poem in it hides a story, a destiny. But I don't want to add any notes, like adding feet to a snake. If it is not clear enough, I can only blame my weak ability to express myself. What I should apologize for is that these poems may be, as Mr. Xu Chi said, too slow and lack gunpowder. They cannot reflect the times. Then let them be a summons to the souls of those who are possessed!

If someone blames my poems for not being written for the masses. Then I can only look back on my shameful life process with resentful eyes.

Wait! Wait for the "world fire" that Tolstoy spoke of to come! Let it burn away the melancholy of the century, the suffering of mankind. Then, the small knot in my soul will naturally turn into smoke and be sprayed into the sky by that huge and intense flame.

Look! The clouds and dense fog have all dispersed. The sun poked her blood-red face out from below the horizon. (1945 · Spring Night · Yu.)

(Postscript) This manuscript was found in the files. Remembering old friends, I feel deeply lost.

### Night Walk

— Zhang Muyao

It was a late autumn evening.

Looking up, there were a few stars reflecting in tired little eyes. The fields were bald. The roots of the corn were tied together in bundles and laid down by the edge of the fields, looking like a group of sleeping animals from a distance. The wind was very slight, but piercing.

"Brother, how much further is it?"

I turned my head to look at Wenluo, a childish face already etched with a lot of dust, two thin lips like withered leaves wriggling.

"Soon."

This was the fifth time giving the same answer. He tightened his pace, constantly shrugging the small bundle hanging diagonally on his left shoulder, staring at me with suspicious eyes.

"Is it really soon?"

This time I didn't answer, bit my teeth hard, and swung my numb feet, protruding two steps away from Wenluo.

"Brother, shall we rest for a while?"

The voice was like the cry of a desperate man. I hesitated slightly—continuing to lift my painful feet after the blisters burst.

"Wenluo, bear with it a little longer, it's really almost there."

The yellow mud formed village road was churning under my feet, sand gritty in my eye sockets; teeth grinding, making a subtle rustling sound.

"Brother, do you have guokui (big pancake)?"

"No more. We'll have a good meal when we get to the county seat."

"Eat—?"

He jumped up and affectionately grabbed my right arm, I felt his hand trembling.

I raised a travel bag with my left hand, and he understood the meaning.

"You want to sell it?"

"Yeah—"

He suddenly loosened my arm and quietly wiped the corner of his eye with his sleeve.

In the distance, a cluster of bonfires was shining, like a lamp. A corner of a lonely thatched hut was reflected.

"Brother, don't sell it, you only have this one set, sell mine—the Director Chen you mentioned, if he wants it, that's good!"

I grabbed his cold hand, gently stroking it, feeling a pang in my heart, suppressing my voice and saying softly:

"Don't be childish, it's the same anyway; sell it and have a good meal, who cares about Director Chen!"

Walking, walking, the pace was a little heavy, the heart, as if grasped by something. The sound of footsteps startled an old crow on the tip of a pine tree.

"Brother, I'm a little scared. I remember the year I came home from Zhuanba, my sister fell asleep on my shoulder, the sky was also so dark, Mom called Changlin to bring a lantern to pick me up, and also brought a bag of Xianggao—"

"Don't mention the past." I shouted madly.

"Um—"

I secretly saw Wenluo raise his sleeve again to wipe the corner of his eye...

The wind was subtle, but piercing. Looking out, it was a blur of pitch black. At the end of the road, there were stars reflecting in tired little eyes.

Wenluo re-shifted the package to the right corner.

### Heart Sacrifice

— Zi

Dedicated to Fengjia, who rests in peace in the northwestern cemetery

It is such a lonely and quiet night, a dark sky, sparsely dotted with a few stars, accompanied by a half-moon crescent, emitting a faint light, shining on the face of this frustrated person, making her heart even heavier and older. A gust of evening wind, blowing the long hair scattered on her shoulders, stirred up my thousands of strands of sorrow, and the past quietly returned to my side, and the pain began to devour my broken and fragmented heart again, and I fell back into the bitter memories.

I can't remember how I spent these three long years, I only feel like a burdened camel, carrying a heavy burden of thousands of pounds of sorrow, taking difficult steps, and spending these miserable days, all the way until now. I can't forget the farewell in this miserable wind and rain, but who knew that this heart-wrenching farewell would be our eternal farewell?

Because of the lack of economic strength, and in order to complete your aspirations, after several consultations, it was decided to sacrifice my studies to complete you. I remember we talked late into the night on the eve of our departure. We agreed to expect a joyful reunion under the principle of responding to all changes with constancy. The next morning, on a drizzly morning, you embarked on the journey, and I sent you to the riverbank. In order to comfort each other, we both held back our crystal-clear tears, but in the end, we tearfully bid farewell in voices full of care. Leaning on the riverbank, I watched you standing on the stern of the boat with blurred, teary eyes, waving again and again, until I couldn't see your shadow. When I got home, I couldn't help but collapse on the bed and cry. But when I thought of our agreement and the future reunion, I endured everything, entrusting thousands of bushels of parting emotions to the beautiful dreams of the future. But, who knew that you would never return? I couldn't bear the grievance and complained to you. Every time I could get more comfort from you. I remember you wrote to me: "...Lianyu, don't be too hard on yourself. I know that when we return victoriously, your gray dream will fade away." But now, victory has been so long, and the gray dream has turned black, but where is your return? You tell me!

Because you lacked care, you lost the ability to care. Due to pleurisy and then pulmonary disease, you were forever separated from the world. Who killed you! For fear of making me anxious, you didn't let me know you were sick. When you were laid to rest in the northwestern cemetery, I was still hoping for a joyful meeting. When I couldn't get a reply to many letters, I began to suspect. Finally, the bad news came and I fainted. I received a letter from your friend, who said: "I have kept this shocking news a secret until now. I dare not tell Fengjia's relatives and friends, because it is like a sharp blade that will shatter everyone's heart, but looking at your snow-like letters flying over, I really can't bear to deceive you anymore. I opened every one of your letters, and when I finished reading them with tears, I always sent them to Fengjia's grave and burned them in front of his tomb, as if forwarding them to you. When he was dying, although he opened his mouth wide, he couldn't say a word. Although he wanted a pen, his stiff hand couldn't write a word. When he died not far away, his eyes were still wide open. I know that in his heart, he couldn't let go of the lover from afar - you!" When I woke up and regained consciousness, I suspected that I had just had a nightmare. I didn't believe that a kind person like you would really die, but when I saw the shadow of your tomb and your last appearance in my hand, I couldn't help but burst into tears and fainted again.

Now, on this occasion when the green willows are forming shade, I imagine that the grass on your grave must be full of lush greenery. The dim moonlight shines on me, and also shines on a cemetery in the Northwest. Thinking of this lonely scene, I really want to fly over on wings, even if I can't see your welcoming smile, just kiss your grave. Because underneath it lies you, sleeping forever. In your deep netherworld, is your body healthy? Will you answer me? Because I want to ask you, why haven't you come back yet?

The endless stream of mourning, the endless sorrow, let thousands of strands of sorrow stay here, you are dead, but you will live forever in my heart, forever, forever.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 524

— Ye Jingfeng

"And also left very safely!" Shouyi said, then turned around and invited Hejian to walk out of the room.

"Left safely?" Hejian asked as he walked.

"That's right!" Shouyi seemed to be touring a museum, calm and composed, ready to admire, his mind very leisurely.

"..., did you mention Pingzi's matter?" Hejian did not forget the main purpose of this trip, and also believed that the colored lines left by those naughty people were as precise as the electrical signal codes he invented, and could transmit messages.

"Pingzi's matter?" Shouyi seemed to have thrown Pingzi's matter to Java a long time ago: "According to my guess, since the mischievous people came, they must not go back empty-handed. What do you think they came for? Isn't it for Pingzi? Now that they're gone, of course they took Pingzi away, - as long as she was trapped here..."

"This is your guess, or is it explained on the symbols?" Hejian followed Shouyi to the back door of the house, went up the stone steps, and stood on the small corridor, refusing to leave. This action was a very clear indication: if Shouyi was not sure, explaining that Pingzi had escaped, Hejian would probably go alone and chase after the group of bandits who had just escaped.

"These symbols only indicate that someone has been here, and point out the person's current whereabouts, direction." As Shouyi said this, he suddenly discovered that there were many lines on the door frame of the main house, which, although in a backlight, seemed to contain a phosphorescent component, faintly emitting various colors of light, and pointed them out to Hejian: "Look, these lines, the first one is pink, which is the designated color of the big naughty Huijun, the sharp tip pointing to the inside of the house, indicating that she wants to enter the house; the two irregular small circles at the end indicate that she knows that the imaginary Miss Pingzi and another hostage are definitely in the house..."

"Oh, does one color represent one person?" Hejian was attracted by these lines, temporarily putting down Pingzi's matter, seemingly studying the theory, and his spirit was calmer.

"That's right, each of us in Bain Ren Zhuang has a designated line color," Shouyi said, taking out a pink-like thing from his pocket: "This is my designated color," he said, drawing a large circle around those color lines, which was a bright yellow. (According to the regulations of Bain Ren Zhuang when designating these colors, the more obvious the color, the higher the ability.)

After Shouyi drew this circle, he pointed to the second pale purple line and said; "This is the symbol of that little mischievous person who went to the hotel to visit you, although the sharp tip also points to the inside of the house, but it uses dotted lines, indicating that she entered the house from another direction; the third line, this pale blue one, is the younger sister of the little mischievous person, Ziyu, but she followed the big mischievous person into the room in an orderly manner; the pale gray line below, although it is also the color of a very naughty character, the person is relatively the most gentle, with some of the habits of the young ladies in the Dream of the Red Chamber, named Shaohua, her older brother Shaoqiu, is one of the brains of Bain Ren Zhuang, her lines indicate security..."

Shouyi, like a university professor, was slowly explaining the colors and markings of the various naughty lines here, when he had just said this, he suddenly heard gunshots outside, a total of three two-shots, the first "bang bang" was from the due south, aimed at the main door of this house; the second was in the due west, and the third two-shots were in the due east. Shouyi listened, immediately reached out and drew out the twenty-shot gun from Hejian's waist, leaped down the steps, and fired four shots into the sky in the open space, "Bang, - bang bang bang -" This was the agreed safety signal.

Free Talk

### Random Talks on Independent Mooring

— Wang Cong

Recently, there is a film in Shanghai, it's quite popular, the title is "Cleopatra" (Caesar and Cleopatra) it's said to be written by Shaw. A friend asked me to watch this film, I left less than fifteen minutes after entering.

I know very well that this is a play, and I can watch it with a "playing the field" attitude, but I don't like it from the bottom of my heart. I don't want to force myself too much.

Many people compliment Shaw as the sun of the world, I think if the sun is really like this, I would rather live in darkness forever.

This old show-off has been distorting history from beginning to end. Cleopatra in his writing has completely changed her appearance. I can't recognize who he wrote. At the same time, I also have no ability to understand Cleopatra's silence.

Of course, I have already anticipated that many "some experts" will criticize my ignorance.

Let's look at it from another angle!

Towards Caesar, and only towards Caesar, the dead demon king Mussolini had a truly religious reverence. He said: "Caesar's assassination is a misfortune for mankind." He also said: "I love Caesar, he is the greatest man of all time. People want to compare him to his friend Pompey (the famous Roman general and consul), but it's like comparing silk to coarse cloth. He foresaw the brilliance of the Iron Age. He is a unique man, with the will of a politician, the philosophy of a philosopher, the talent of a genius, and the human touch of a man. He is a philosopher at heart, and his eternal pursuit of everything has not alienated him from human feelings."

On another occasion, when he was talking about Caesar with a foreign friend, he glanced around, picked up a book on the table behind him, and read aloud the first few lines of Shakespeare's Caesar play in Italian. Then he slowly put the painting back and leaned on his elbow, as he needed the same pause in philosophical conversations as he did when giving speeches. He finally said: "However, it is incredible that Caesar would fall into a trap." He was asked if he meant the scene of Caesar's assassination, "Of course. Didn't he know everything about the conspirators? His death was probably because he didn't know what to do next, and he deliberately sought death."

This strange interpretation of Caesar, and his consistent love for Caesar, are the elements of Mussolini's contempt for the masses, a contempt he shared with Caesar.

"Good is bad, and bad is good." Great Bernard! Forgive me for not understanding your humorous prank.

### An Admonishment to the Nobel Laureates of Today

— Robbie

Although the invention of dynamite made Nobel's career a success and brought him wealth, it also became his lifelong regret. Because it was later used in wars, causing countless lives to be lost, which he did not expect. Originally, dynamite was researched to facilitate mining, but once it was invented, it was used by arms dealers as the best product. As a scientist with a conscience, how could he not feel guilty? Therefore, when Nobel was about to bid farewell to the world, he wanted to transfer all his property to a fund to reward academics, and he also specifically proposed a sum to be awarded to people who made great contributions to world peace, in order to make up for his deep unease and pain.

Originally, science is innocent, and the purpose of science is to benefit mankind, but because it has helped or deepened the harm of war, it is still condemned by people as all evil today. Such as the "radioactive cloud" and germ warfare, which are more terrible than atomic bombs, recently invented by American scientists, have kept us trembling with anxiety for a long time. Reporters are exaggerating the amazing power of these two weapons, and at the same time pointing out that in germ warfare, there are already thirty-three kinds of bacteria that can have powerful effects. This makes us fear war and fear science.

If our scientists are only diligently researching how to harm mankind, we really have to mourn for the white hair in the laboratory, and also mourn for science. We hope that a scientist must have a scientist's conscience in addition to his profound knowledge. Nobel's lifelong guilt was only someone else's mistake, but if today's scientists directly serve the war, this is an even greater trauma to science.

Therefore, for the sake of human peace, we must loudly appeal, Mr. Nobel Laureates of today's world, please stop immediately!

### Loquats of Tangqi

— Yuanzhang

In the orchards near paradise, the dense green branches are already laden with golden loquats, as well as heart-shaped peaches and crisp green plums. From Anpan Township in the western suburbs of Tangqi to Dinghe and Chaoshan Townships, the area was known as the "Thirty Li Fragrant Snow Sea" when the plum blossoms were in bloom. Now, including the lush loquat forests of Hongpan Township for ten li, this vast orchard truly deserves to be called the "Forty Li Flower and Fruit Market." Among the fruits, loquats have the highest yield, followed by plums, and peaches have the lowest yield. There are many varieties of loquats, which can be roughly divided into two types: red sand and white sand. The planting method is seedling propagation. Loquats that have not been grafted are called wild loquats. Only after grafting can they be named as a certain variety of loquat that has been transplanted. The lifespan of a loquat tree is at most about sixty years, and at least only twenty years. Furthermore, when the loquats are ripe, they are most afraid of strong sunlight, because the loquats will become stiff after being exposed, resulting in a great loss.

The taste of freshly picked loquats is so fresh and sweet that the loquat juice, known as "fresh from the tree," overflows when the skin is broken. This is incomparable to the taste of loquats that have been picked for some time. The Shanghai Maling Company has also established a branch factory in Tangqi to pack extremely fresh loquats into cans, using scientific methods to preserve this extremely delicious "fresh from the tree" flavor, and transport them to Beijing, Shanghai, and other domestic and foreign regions, so that ladies in distant places can also enjoy this famous fruit. People from nearby Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places also make special trips to this orchard to eat loquats. They immerse themselves in the loquat forest, peeling and eating as many loquats as they can. Those with good appetites can eat up to five jin. Even after eating their fill of loquats, they can still eat their usual amount of food at mealtime, because the loquat pulp is very soft and contains a lot of sugar, making it very easy to digest.

When we went to the countryside to eat loquats, the villagers naively told us stories about the Japanese eating loquats: The Japanese moored their motorboats on the bank of the loquat forest, came ashore and broke off the loquat branches, and left a few barrels of kerosene under the trees, hanging many towels and socks on the trees. Although the villagers were heartbroken that the loquat tree branches were broken and the trees would wither, they were also grateful for the more valuable items they left behind. However, the simple-minded villagers did not know that the things left behind by the Japanese were looted from the shops of ordinary people.

### Introduction to Famous Songs

— Solveig's Song

This is an interlude written by the great Norwegian composer Grieg for Ibsen's famous five-act fantasy play "Peer Gynt." Grieg adapted the music he wrote for the play into two suites, which are the very famous "Peer Gynt Suites." Solveig's Song is included in the second suite and is a beautiful and moving soprano solo.

Solveig's Song is a song of spring. After the prodigal Peer Gynt (the protagonist) abandoned his wife Solveig and left, she still lived in a small house in the Norwegian forest, waiting for her husband to return with hope and longing. By this time, she was a middle-aged woman. As she sat spinning, she wished that her husband would return with the beautiful spring, and sang this exquisitely sad song. The melody is as follows:

Winter will not stay long, spring will leave, spring will leave;

Summer flowers will wither, autumn leaves will fade, autumn leaves will fade;

Though time is merciless, I believe you will come, I believe you will come.

I will always wait, day and night.

Every morning when I pray, I wish you peace, I wish you peace;

Every night when I pray, I wish you health, I wish you health;

When the darkness passes, light will always appear, light will always appear.

I wholeheartedly hope that you will return one day.

### Anji Policy of the Northern Wei Dynasty – Random Notes on History 2

— Xiao Dai

Because traditional racial concepts are deeply rooted in everyone's minds, racial discrimination is inevitable. Therefore, historical conquests and massacres have continued as a political means. Turning the pages of Chinese history, most of the records are about the Han people conquering foreign races or foreign races invading the Han people.

The people suffer from wars, and the people are massacred; but the officials take this opportunity to disturb the people and arbitrarily plunder them. For this reason, racial hatred becomes more and more profound, and the distance between them becomes greater.

Since the establishment of the Northern Wei (Northern and Southern Dynasties) regime, Emperor Shizu saw that his officials were arbitrarily plundering and ravaging people, taking advantage of the power of their masters, and that deepening racial antagonism was not a solution. Therefore, he began to vigorously implement the Anji policy, shifting racial hatred to racial tolerance. He then began to implement two tasks: prohibiting officials from disturbing the people and encouraging cultivation.

In the fourth year of Emperor Shizu's Taiping Zhenjun (443 AD), on the day of Gengyin in June, the following edict was issued:

"I, as the Son of Heaven, care about the people and worry about all nations. I want the people to have enough food and clothing and to promote etiquette and cultivation. However, the officials and governors cannot help me promote kindness and virtue, and care for the people's hidden hardships, and even seize their property and inflict cruelty on them, which is not the way to govern. Now, I will restore the people's assets and taxes for three years, and the land rent will be as usual. The governors and others should carefully and diligently govern, encourage mulberry cultivation, and not arbitrarily collect taxes. The relevant departments should investigate and punish them, and not let them go unpunished."

Prohibiting officials from disturbing the people was a passive measure to implement the Anji policy. The active measure was to encourage agriculture and mulberry cultivation and increase production.

The specific measures to implement the encouragement of agriculture and mulberry cultivation were first to determine the household registration and then to divide the fields equally. Determining household registration allowed the government to easily manage the people's residence and determine their annual income; then, the fields were divided equally according to the determined household registration. After years of war, this could enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment, and to live together regardless of race, and the people would not generate hatred again.

After this, the emperors of the Northern Wei Dynasty gradually united with the Han people by appeasing them. For example, complex surnames were changed to single surnames, intermarriage between foreign races and Han people was encouraged, "the language of the Northern customs was not allowed in the court," and Han official systems were adopted, and Hu clothing was prohibited. Such policies not only eliminated hatred but also further united them.

In terms of the current situation, the Anji and assimilation policies of the Northern Wei Dynasty still have some aspects that we can adopt and implement.

### Abolition of Corporal Punishment

— Sheng Bo

On May 26, the Soviet Union officially abolished the death penalty and stipulated that: from now on, all crimes punishable by death under current law will, in peacetime, be replaced by imprisonment in correctional labor camps for a term of 25 years. The news explained the significance of the abolition of the death penalty order with the reasoning that "the cause of peace is safe and worry-free." Labor News and Foreign Minister Vyshinsky said: This is a historic decree, an unprecedented victory for humanitarianism.

Indeed, the abolition of the death penalty is in line with humanitarianism. However, the abolition of the death penalty cannot be said to be an unprecedented creation of the Soviet Union.

In Chinese history, there was also a period of abolishing corporal punishment. In the thirteenth year of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty, an edict was issued to abolish corporal punishment, which said: "I have heard that in the past, people would wear full dress and change their clothes as a punishment, but the people did not commit crimes. How great is this governance! Now there are three types of corporal punishment, but crimes do not stop. Where does the blame lie? Is it not because my virtue is thin and my teaching is unclear? I am very ashamed. If the teaching is not pure, the foolish people will be trapped. The Book of Songs says: 'A kind and amiable prince is the parent of the people.' Now, when people commit mistakes, punishment is applied before teaching. Some want to change their ways and do good, but the way to it is cut off. I pity them. Punishments such as cutting off limbs and carving the skin cause lifelong pain and cannot be relieved. How can this be called the intention of being the parents of the people? Therefore, I abolish corporal punishment and replace it with other punishments."

Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty not only spoke of humanitarianism but also emphasized education; unfortunately, after a period of order and chaos, corporal punishment was restored. The Soviet Union's abolition of corporal punishment in peacetime is not the highest ideal of peace.

The highest ideal of mankind is no corporal punishment, no punishment, and even no war!

### Talking about Gandhi

— Li Ping

After visiting Gandhi, Dr. Luo Jialun, the Chinese ambassador to India, told reporters: "He is great, very great. I can say nothing else." Indeed, the word "great" is worthy of Mahatma Gandhi.

Speaking of Gandhi, the following impression immediately comes to our minds: a thin and weak old man, wearing a kasaya-like robe, a spinning wheel, and a goat. This is all his property. And he used this meager capital, relying on a spirit of righteousness, to contend with the British Empire, which was known as the "Empire on which the Sun Never Sets." Without weapons and without violence, hundreds of millions of Indian people followed him, going to prison several times without changing his beliefs, and going on hunger strikes several times without dying. In the end, not only were all the Indian people inspired by his spirit, but also people all over the world were shocked by his perseverance. If there is such a thing as a "miracle" in the world, Indian independence is undoubtedly a "miracle"; if there is such a thing as "God" in the world, Gandhi is undoubtedly the incarnation of "God."

In a conversation with Ambassador Luo, there was a philosophical meaning. "Gandhi compared the turmoil of the Indian public to the flowing water of the Ganges. The mud and sand on the surface will eventually settle, and the water will eventually appear clear." (Central News Agency, New Delhi, 28th) After reading these words, we truly have "a special feeling in our hearts." China and India, two great ancient civilizations, have encountered the same fate for hundreds of years. The "Hindu-Muslim" dispute in India is similar to the domestic turmoil in our country. The Indian philosopher Gandhi has already pointed out that "the mud and sand of the Ganges will eventually settle, and the water will eventually appear clear." What about the mud and sand at the bottom of our Yellow River? We believe that there will also be a day when they will settle and clear.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"Okay, thank you! Then let them go to Hechi first! Because one of them is a patient and needs to go to the hospital urgently." Old Zhu felt that it would be better for Lan to get proper treatment sooner than to have her travel long distances on a KMT military truck. To thank the driver for his kindness, he took out a Sheaffer fountain pen from his shirt pocket, which someone had given him not long ago. "Driver Wang, but I can't let you work for nothing. You may not be willing to take my money. Then, I'll give you this pen as a souvenir!"

The driver did not have high hopes. Besides, the pen was shiny and new, probably worth tens of thousands of yuan, so he happily accepted it.

"Then, please hurry up. We're leaving in another hour!" This grandson was definitely counting on the situation.

Zhu Zhaonian touched his empty shirt pocket with a lost expression and immediately urged Lu and Zhang to leave quickly. His steps were so big that Lu Qian, who was limping, could hardly keep up, and Zhang Chang had to jump and run to barely keep a distance of two or three steps behind him.

"But, who will accompany Mrs. Hu?" He asked Old Zhu halfway.

"Of course, you! I can't leave the group and leave." He replied without thinking. "Xiao Zhang, would you please help me this time? Since the director of the hospital over there is your uncle, it would be most appropriate to have you go together!"

"Okay! Okay! Okay!" Zhang Chang kept answering. But he thought of another thing: "But, what about Feifei?"

This was a matter that needed to be considered. Until they walked into the small teahouse, Old Zhu had not made up his mind. He felt that only Lan could decide for herself.

Lan was still lying on the ground in the corner near the stove, with two or three kind female team members sitting beside her. Feifei was also quietly leaning on a female team member, her small eyes red, saying nothing, just stroking the bronze rabbit.

As soon as the three Old Zhu walked into the small teahouse, everyone immediately crowded around to inquire about the news of the car.
