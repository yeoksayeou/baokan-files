### Strengthening the Defense Along the Yangtze River in Anhui and Hubei; National Army Recaptures Qishui in One Swift Stroke; Military Vessels Escort Ships Between Xunyang and Hankou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] As the bandit forces along the Yangtze River in Anhui and Hubei gradually intensify their fighting, the national army’s strong forces recaptured Qishui in one fell swoop on the evening of the 24th, and immediately divided into two routes to pursue the remaining bandits. The northern route went out of Zhulin River, heading straight for Yingshan, and the southern route went out of Caohe, clearing and suppressing the area downstream. The national army, which landed and captured Wuxue, is also advancing eastward along the river under the cover of the air force. The national army, which recovered Huayang and Wangjiang, has already made the bandits in Qianshan and Taihu panic and flee, and the bandit army's political commissar is also unable to control them. The acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Gui Yongqing, flew to Xunyang by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 25th to inspect and strengthen the river defense. The attempt of the remaining bandits to cross the river between Anhui and Hubei at the southern foot of Dabie Mountain has become a bubble. As for the remaining bandits in the triangular area between Gushi, Lu'an, and Shucheng, Huoshan, and Tongcheng at the northeast foot of Dabie Mountain, they are now all in a state of panic under the strong suppression and encirclement of the national army.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 25th] After reinforcement from friendly forces, our defending troops inside Huangmei City are now retreating to more favorable positions. After strengthening the defenses of Jiujiang, Ruichang, Pengze and other places along the Yangtze River, there is no concern for security on the south bank. The bandits' attempt to disturb Guangang north of Konglong was repelled by the national army, and five bandit soldiers were captured.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] Military news: After Wuxue was recovered on the 24th, more than a thousand remaining bandits fled to Caisan, and have already been encircled and suppressed by our army.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] A telegram from Hankou today stated: The government's land, sea and air forces have been dispatched on three routes, and have driven back the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces on the north bank of the Yangtze River, thus reopening the important inland commercial navigation route. Martial law is being implemented in various ports between Hankou and Jiujiang. Merchant ships on the 50-mile stretch of the Yangtze River from Jiujiang to Huangshi Port, which is 10 miles east of Hankou, will be escorted by warships.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an vessel sailed from Hankou to Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. When passing near Wuxue, there was fighting. The ship sailed down at great risk, and arrived safely in Xunyang at noon on the 25th.

After being severely attacked by the national army, the bandits retreated to the mountains. At present, the surrounding battles have become quiet.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 25th] The 16th, 17th, 18th, and 25th Brigades of bandits in western Liaoning, using Jinlingsi and Luotuo Ying as their bases, are fiercely attacking Beipiao.

Note: The Beile Power Plant is quite large in scale, mainly supplying electricity for industrial and mining use in Lüshun, Xin, Jinzhou and other places. The parts have been burned and have not yet been repaired. The 13th Brigade of bandits from Chaoyang Shao continue to attack fiercely. On the morning of the 23rd, the national army transferred again. [Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] The bandit army invading Beipiao was defeated. In recent days, the bandits have used nearly 10,000 troops, day and night, taking turns launching fierce attacks on the national army's positions.

### Chen's Bandits Flee to Southwestern Anhui; National Army in Eastern Henan Enters Yongcheng

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] The remnants of Chen's bandit forces have been forced to split up and flee in three directions, and the national army is pursuing and suppressing them on separate routes.

### American Reporter Reports that International Communist Legion Participates in Northeast Operations

[Associated Press, New York, 24th] Howard's newspaper reporter Finseworth reported from Shanghai: "The Communist army has an international communist corps helping in the offensive in Northeast China, and the number is more than one-third of the total number of the Northeast Communist Army (500,000). This clearly shows the determination and scope of foreign Communist parties interfering in China's internal affairs. Also, because the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that it has not assisted the Chinese Communist Army, the existence of this army in the Northeast is truly a ridiculous international issue."

### Strengthening Local Armed Forces to Clear Scattered Bandits; Jiangsu Province Replenishes Security Teams; Formulating Methods and Issuing Orders for Various Departments to Follow

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 25th] Recently, scattered bandits have been causing disturbances in various counties in northern Jiangsu, resulting in the failure to fully control administration. The provincial government believes that the elimination of scattered bandits depends on local self-defense forces. The Security Command has recently issued a method to strengthen security forces, and issued orders for various counties to follow. The main points are as follows: The security teams of each county should be replenished according to the established organization. Each system in southern Jiangsu shall have no less than one company and no more than four companies. In northern Jiangsu, except for the counties belonging to Xuzhou, which temporarily retain one regiment, the counties shall be organized with three to five companies in principle. Without approval, no increase or decrease in the number of companies shall be allowed. Vacancies filled with nominal names shall be eliminated. The equipment and materials shall be supplemented by the county in a unified manner, and the clothing shall be uniformly manufactured and distributed by the county, and included in the local budget. Public-owned guns shall be selected for priority replenishment of the security forces, and the caliber shall be unified according to the unit of the troop for replenishment, and the weapons shall be strictly inspected and stored, and the washing and maintenance costs shall be paid according to the price. The appointment and removal of personnel in the security forces shall be handled in accordance with laws and regulations, striving for soundness, and implementing rewards and punishments. Telephones should be set up in townships as soon as possible. The security funds have been approved and budgeted, and should be implemented earnestly. The provision for independent security funds should be issued to each county treasury account in advance according to the budget, to avoid confusion with other funds, and to ensure that the salary is paid monthly. Soldiers' treatment should be reasonably subsidized by the county. After receiving the order, various counties in northern Jiangsu are gradually strengthening their security.

### Communist Bandits Kill Executive Yuan Personnel Near Bengbu; UNRRA Protests Seriously

[Our Dispatch] The communist bandits lurking in the Huai River area disregarded the agreement signed with UNRRA and, on the morning of the 18th of this month, near Bengbu, fired machine guns at a petrol boat and a barge of the UNRRA Executive Yuan Tractor Training Class, which had black characters and white flags with obvious signs. One UNRRA staff member was killed, and the other nine people on the ship were also almost killed by secret calculations. Fortunately, they quickly hid and avoided the disaster. According to the report from Di Yu, the Director of the UNRRA Morning Business Committee (who was also on one of the ships that was hit), the communist bandits fired from five miles away from the location of the UNRRA Executive Yuan Tractor Training Class. At that time, there were two petrol boat drivers, three barge crew members, and women and children, who were preparing to go to Bengbu. The boat they were on had a clear white flag with the words "UNRRA Executive Yuan". Therefore, the communist bandits' shooting was definitely not caused by a misunderstanding. Rao Nayan, an inspector of the UNRRA Tractor Training Class, was killed when communist bandits' machine gun bullets entered his left eye. The UNRRA branch in China has filed a strong protest with the Shanghai office of the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration".

### Talk by a Foreigner: On American Aid to China

[Our Dispatch] A foreigner familiar with the national conditions of our country recently commented on Wei Feimai's proposal for military and economic aid to China: "Wei's suggestion to expand the military delegation stationed in China needs to be thoroughly implemented to be effective. The origin of the delegation stemmed from the Allied war period, when American military officials trained young Chinese military officers and soldiers. At that time, the American military officials participated in the command and food supply departments of the Chinese military in the capacity of consultants, and the results were very effective. However, the actual experience of the past two years has proven that even newly trained officers, once led by incompetent old-style commanders, will be unable to exert their effectiveness. Therefore, from a purely military point of view, this type of new training must be implemented from top to bottom." (Continued on page 2, column 1)

### Number of Signatures for Candidates from Free Professional Groups Has Been Revised

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the issue of the number of signatures for candidates from free professional groups, recently the Election General Office considered that the number of members in the Zongzong groups such as reporters, lawyers, technicians, accountants, and medical professionals is relatively small, making it difficult to meet the standard for the number of signatures required to select candidates. The office requested the National Government to approve the minimum number of signatures for the above five occupations to be at least 50 people. It has now received the National Government's order to approve its prior implementation. The office has already notified the election offices under its jurisdiction.

### Burhan Comments on the Reply from Yining, Believes Peace in Xinjiang is Hopeful; Zhang Zhizhong Talks About the Truth of the Dispute in the Yining Three Districts in Taiwan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Xinjiang issue has been stagnant for a long time since Zhang Zhizhong sent a letter to Ahmetjan in Yining on September 1. Because the Yining side has not responded, the stalemate has persisted. Recently, the Yining side's reply has been delivered to Dihua, and its main points have been reported. The reporter specially visited Burhan, a committee member of the National Government from Xinjiang, and asked for his opinion on the content of this reply. Mr. Burhan said: He has not yet seen the full text, but judging from the four requirements mentioned in the report, they are not difficult to solve. Among them, except for the first point, the request to replace Maxwd, is more difficult, the three points raised by the three points are not a problem, because the implementation of peace clauses and the general guidelines for administration are what the government hopes for. Mr. Burhan believes that the people of Xinjiang still hope for peace. This reply shows that the deadlock can be broken. As for the incident of the autumn harvest and arms that the revolutionaries in Yining said in the foreign reports, Mr. Burhan believes that it will not be the case. There is still hope for peace in Xinjiang, and the atmosphere of peace will not worsen. As for the peaceful method, Mr. Burhan said that Director Zhang Zhizhong must be able to think of it. He also said that his wife had recently come from Xinjiang, and the people of Xinjiang were eagerly hoping that Director Zhang would return to Xinjiang. It is also learned that Mr. Zhang has asked for a two-week leave for recuperation. He is still on vacation and is expected to return to Beijing within ten days and can return to Xinjiang to handle all matters and resolve problems.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] The reporter recently inquired about the truth from General Zhang Zhizhong, who is now in Taiwan, about the rumors that the Yining rebellion has risen again. According to Zhang's statement: "According to the provisions of the Yining Incident Peace Clauses, the security of the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan shall be maintained by the six regiments of each of the three districts. Usman is the commissioner of Ashan, and is also the representative of the three districts to the government, which is an example. The conflict with his deputy commissioner, Da Lihan, is entirely a matter of internal disputes in the three districts. The government has not interfered in order to fulfill the peace clauses, and it will not affect the peace of Xinjiang.

### Katayama and Nodata Visit Foreign Minister Wang

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama accompanied Foreign Minister Nodata and Cabinet Secretary-General Nishio to the office of the Chinese delegation on the 29th to visit Foreign Minister Han Shijie. After talking for two and a half hours, they left. In addition, only Chinese delegation members Pin Shangzhen and an interpreter participated in the conversation. Katayama and others all refused to disclose the content of the conversation. However, Japanese observers believe that the discussion was about the future peace conference. The observers pointed out that Mr. Wang must have learned about the United States' attitude towards the peace treaty in Washington. After returning home, he will discuss it with Chairman Chiang.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] On the 25th, the Daily News published a long editorial titled "Expectations for Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's Visit to the White House," describing the extreme importance attached to Foreign Minister Wang's visit to Japan by people from all walks of life in Japan. This editorial by Tokyo's second-largest daily newspaper, describing Foreign Minister Wang's visit to Japan as a most important event, said: "We sincerely hope that Foreign Minister Wang can exert his deep international knowledge and efforts for peace."

### Zhou Yide Talks About the Issue of US Aid to China

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] US Congressman Zhou Yide visited Li Zongren at 10:00 AM on the 25th, and the municipal government at 10:40 AM. He is scheduled to go to Tong County on the 26th and return to Beiping that night. Mr. Zhou told reporters today that all Americans, except for American communists, are willing to aid China. The American public and the government now have a very different understanding of China than they did two years ago. This is also the reason why I came to China after Wedemeyer and Bullitt. In the past, some Americans thought that the Chinese Communist Party was a land reform faction. Since the Communist Party conference of nine European countries, the American people have fully realized that the world's Communist parties value ideology over the nation, and the Chinese Communist Party is no different. Therefore, the goodwill towards the Chinese Communist Party in the past has been lost. He said: There is almost no problem with American aid to China. The House of Representatives originally planned to send four people to China for investigation. Because it was feared that the investigation time would be too long to submit a report to the special Congress in November as soon as possible, it was finally decided to send him alone, because he has stayed in China for a long time, is familiar with the Chinese situation, and has many Chinese friends, making it easy to learn the truth about China in a short time. He hopes to extensively contact all parties in China and meet Chairman Chiang. He will return to the United States on the 11th of next month to attend the special Congress report on the 17th. He also said: China does not have to be afraid of Japan's revival. The United States will never allow Japan to become an aggressor again. The relations between China, Japan, and South Korea are close. If Japan continues to sink and cannot revive, China will also suffer losses.

### British Visiting Delegation Arrives in Taipei

### China-US Chartered Plane "Nanjing" Leaves San Francisco; Four Chinese Reporters Return to Shanghai on the Same Plane

### Currency Reform Plan; Plan to Mint Silver-Nickel Subsidiary Coins

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] There is a concrete plan for currency reform. It is heard that the authorities are based on the use of silver and nickel to cast subsidiary coins. Silver coins are divided into two types: 50 cents and 10 cents. Nickel coins are divided into two types: 5 cents and 1 cent. A new currency will be issued on top of the subsidiary coins. When authoritative people talked about this matter, they also believed that it was possible to cast subsidiary coins with silver and nickel. As for whether the new currency will be linked to the US dollar and other technical issues, they refused to comment. Most economic experts agree with the currency reform, but they hope that balancing the budget and increasing production can be carried out at the same time when the reform is carried out.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 25th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance denied that the government intends to order silver coins from Mexico. It is said that because the Shanghai Mint's machines were seized by the Japanese army, they wanted to purchase new machines and inquired about the price of coining machines from Mexico and other countries. The outside world may have speculated because of this. The Ministry of Finance predicts that the currency system will not change in the near future, but it is very concerned about the casting of hard currency by the Central Mint when the situation permits.

### Taiwan Celebrates Retrocession Day: President Zhang Delivers a Speech Encouraging Compatriots to Uphold the Law and Be Pragmatic; Taipei Holds Costume Parade with Jubilant Crowds

[Our Taipei Correspondent, 25th] Taiwan Province today enthusiastically celebrated the second Retrocession Day. Various exhibitions held in Taipei also opened simultaneously today. The Retrocession Anniversary Grand Assembly was held at Taipei Zhongshan Hall at 9:00 AM. President Zhang, Zhang Zhizhong, Miao Lingtai, and others, accompanied by Chairman Wei and his wife, attended the assembly. The assembly was then addressed by Chairman Huang Chaoqin (Speaker of the Provincial Assembly), followed by a speech by President Zhang. In his address, Mr. Huang, in addition to expressing his gratitude for President Zhang's presence in Taiwan to participate in the grand event, stated: "Certain foreign newspapers are propagating the so-called demand by 15% of Taiwanese compatriots for trusteeship or hoping for independence, etc. As a representative of all the people, I dare to declare to the world that this is malicious reporting or serves other purposes. Some newspapers in the mainland occasionally publish articles claiming that the people of Taiwan Province are xenophobic, which is also a huge misunderstanding."

President Zhang's speech briefly stated: "In the 57 years since Japan occupied Taiwan, Taiwanese compatriots have always yearned for the motherland, and the people of the mainland have always missed their Taiwanese compatriots. Today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of Retrocession Day, I take this opportunity to join with the elders and brothers of this province in extending our congratulations! However, for the past two years, Taiwanese compatriots have shared a common feeling that prices in Taiwan have risen, production has decreased, and unemployment has increased. This phenomenon can be attributed to several reasons: due to the impact of the war on Taiwan during the war, many production facilities were damaged; due to the widespread global economic panic after the war; and due to the incomplete restoration of order in mainland China after the war. Furthermore, there is a special reason, that is, under the long-term Japanese rule of Taiwan, Japan treated the Taiwanese economy as a part of its own domestic economy, using it as a place to obtain raw materials and industrial products. For example, Japan developed agriculture in Taiwan, but most of the fertilizer manufacturing facilities were originally located in Japan and not in Taiwan. The current difficulty is that Taiwan is paying the price for transitioning from a subsidiary form in terms of economics to a complete economic system, and at the same time, it is also paying the price for transforming from colonial politics to autonomous politics. For example, when a person is controlled by others, he certainly has no freedom, but his life can be taken care of by others, and he does not have to worry about himself. Once he becomes his own master, he gains freedom and a broad future, but his responsibilities also become heavier. When one starts a family and establishes a career, the difficulties during the transition period are inevitable." Finally, President Zhang encouraged Taiwanese compatriots to work hard and be pragmatic in their efforts to build Taiwan. After President Zhang's speech, he, along with Zhang Zhizhong, Weng Wenhao, and Miao Yuntai, walked to the balcony, where Huang Chao introduced them to the citizens. The citizens shouted "Long Live Taiwan's Retrocession" and "Long Live the Republic of China." President Zhang and others then waved goodbye to the citizens.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] A costume parade was held here this afternoon, with 100,000 people crowding the streets, creating a jubilant scene for the second Taiwan Retrocession Day. The weather was clear and the autumn breeze was pleasant. The parade was led by a symphony orchestra. The only unfortunate incident amidst today's joyous atmosphere was a fire at the Huaquan Restaurant on Kunming Road due to negligence, with losses estimated at NT$8 million. (President Zhang's attendance at the symposium and Q&A session are on the left corner of page two)

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming broadcasted to Taiwanese compatriots at 5:30 PM on the 25th, encouraging them to recognize the environment, focus their will, and work together to thoroughly implement policies aimed at seeking stability.

### Li Tianxia's Ineffective Combat Performance Leads to Court Martial by the Ministry of National Defense; Case Concluded Yesterday and Awaiting Approval

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Li Tianxia, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Reorganized 83rd Division, was ordered to rush to the rescue during the Menglianggu campaign in the Yimeng Mountains. However, he failed to accomplish his mission, leading to the tragic loss of the 74th Division under our command, and the heroic sacrifice of Division Commander Zhang Lingfu and others. Chairman Chiang, considering the division commander's ineffective combat performance, telegraphed an order to remove him from his post and place him under arrest. He was escorted to the Ministry of National Defense by the Xuzhou Headquarters of the Army Headquarters. Chairman Chiang then ordered the formation of a court-martial, appointing Vice Minister Fa Decun of the Ministry as the presiding judge. The trial was held today at the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and the case has been concluded and is awaiting approval.

### U.S. Policy Toward China in the Past Two Years

— Zhou Youcun

Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, Bullitt, came to China in July of this year. After returning to the United States, he prepared a lengthy report for the American people entitled "Impressions of a Visit to China," which was published in the October 10th issue of "Life Magazine." While we were reading this report, the bad news from the Northeast front came, painfully confirming Bullitt's analysis of the Chinese situation, and his accurate and urgent request for U.S. aid to China, which attracted the attention of people around the world. The TASS correspondent in Washington also inquired of the State Department spokesman about his views on this article; Chairman Eaton of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee also expressed the hope that Bullitt's article would receive close attention from the U.S. government and people of all walks of life. He said: "I believe this article is an infinitely important contribution to the public."

Senator and member of the U.S. Special Committee on National Defense Ferguson also said: "He has a very clear description of the Chinese situation we are facing. No one doubts the impact of the Chinese situation on our well-being." Sims, foreign news editor of the Scripps-Howard chain, even believes that the Chinese crisis is as serious as the European situation. He urged swift aid to China, not only for the sake of the United States itself, but also for the benefit of Western Europe. In his column, Sims warned: "The United States is already surrounded by the Soviet Union in the Far East. The Communists may disrupt Asia while the United States is focusing on the Soviet Union, thereby undermining the United States."

If that is the case, why is U.S. aid to China only "seeing the staircase but not the person coming down?" When this question is raised, we, standing on the position of our own country and nation, cannot help but feel ashamed. Why is China, which originally had sufficient conditions for "self-reliance," now in urgent need of assistance from friendly countries? This should be blamed on the Communist bandits' rebellion, which has forced China to hope for assistance from friendly countries. However, this kind of assistance should come from a friendly attitude.

Some American friends are saying that the National Government should not fail to thoroughly reform internally. Regarding this issue, it is not that the Chinese government lacks the determination to reform and the courage to change. The facts of the past two years are extremely obvious. American friends should also know that unless the Chinese government obtains concrete assistance from friendly countries to end the "civil war," the government will not be able to carry out reforms on a large scale. Because politics, economy, and military affairs are interconnected and cannot be separated. American friends will certainly not fail to know that the reason why military operations in China cannot be stopped is not because of the stubbornness of the Kuomintang or the government, but because the Communist Party wants to rely on external forces to change the color of the entire China in order to launch an attack against the United States and Britain. The development of the situation in the Northeast after the war fully proves this fact.

If we want to analyze it further, the problem of China today is by no means a problem of China alone, nor is it something that China's own strength can solve. All kinds of suspicions and frictions between the United States and the Soviet Union will directly affect China. Therefore, U.S. policy toward China is, at least to a considerable extent, responsible for the current situation in China. Since President Truman issued a statement on China on December 15, 1945, even though the Chinese people deeply felt the friendship of the United States toward China, they also began to yearn for a beautiful vision. In response to President Truman's statement on China, the U.S. Export-Import Bank designated a special fund of $500 million in April 1946, which was prepared to be used as loans to Chinese government agencies and private enterprises. In order to implement its declared policy of conducting an economic war against global communism, the U.S. State Department has also repeatedly urged the Export-Import Bank to lend out a portion of the $500 million it intends to lend to China. On March 24 of this year, the U.S. State Department still expressed the hope that the Export-Import Bank would immediately lend this sum to China; however, the Export-Import Bank said that various individual plans must be approved before the loan can be granted. Thus, the major issue of U.S. loans to China to aid China's recovery has invisibly fallen into a state of freeze.

Well-informed sources in Washington told the Associated Press on June 5 that President Truman, in view of the fact that Chairman Chiang had somewhat completed the foundation of his broad government, was prepared to open the Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to China. Secretary of State Marshall at the time also strongly advocated adopting this policy and firmly believed that the National Government of China should be assisted as soon as possible. Although a large-scale aid plan for China could not be passed this year, the funds originally designated by the Export-Import Bank could be used without congressional approval. However, despite Secretary of State Marshall's unstoppable enthusiasm for China, and despite his declaration that China would be given the same assistance as Greece and Turkey, there was no way to obtain its smooth passage. In our view, there is a very serious contradiction between the U.S. government and the people. The U.S. government sees the seriousness of the Chinese crisis and, standing on the position of international cooperation, wants to provide immediate assistance; however, the American people, standing on a commercial position, believe that the Chinese crisis has increased concerns about loans.

The Chinese people are peace-loving. What they seek after the war is economic stability, political democracy, and perfect education. With all these excellent conditions, a stable force in society will naturally form, and they will have no intention of participating in the vortex of international struggles, let alone dealing with a complicated situation. The Chinese people believe that the U.S. government's decision to adopt a loan plan for China to expand the foundation of the Chinese government and bring the two countries closer to independence, freedom, and democracy is entirely based on the attitude of a loyal and guiding friend toward China. It is planning for China's political future and has no selfish intentions mixed in. However, the facts of the past two years have proven that the United States has not clearly recognized China. For example, the fact that the CCP is not easy to transform into an ordinary political party is known to every Chinese person, but American friends have made a wrong estimate of it. Even Secretary of State Marshall himself did not recognize it clearly. After Secretary of State Marshall arrived in Chongqing on December 20, 1945, he seemed to have achieved considerable success in the initial mediation, such as on January 10, 1946, he made the Chinese Communist Party and the government sign an agreement to stop the conflict and restore transportation. Before he returned to Washington on March 13, 1946, a truce in the Northeast seemed possible, so Marshall's mediation of the Chinese problem was successful. However, during this period, the Communist army calmly transported troops from North China to Northeast China, receiving equipment and materials left behind by the Soviet army. And on March 16, taking advantage of the Soviet army's withdrawal, they entered Sipingjie; when Marshall went to China again on April 17, the Communist army completely captured Changchun the next day. How can this not be said to be a great irony to the U.S. policy toward China?

We watched as Marshall's mission failed to achieve success, but we never expected that the U.S. policy toward China would fall into a state of fatigue from then on. In July 1946, the U.S. government approved the "Air Force Plan of the One-Third Team" started by General Chennault, but it was also terminated by the U.S. unilateral action. Even the contract signed between China and the United States in 1946, in which the United States supplied old vehicles and spare parts left over for application in China, was not fulfilled. This made the administrative measures of the Chinese government even more difficult. The U.S. government had no choice but to send General Wedemeyer as a special envoy to China to investigate the situation in China. Mr. Wei arrived in Nanjing on July 22, and the Chinese people were very happy about the reunion with this old friend.

Moreover, he brought many experts as economic advisors, engineering consultants, financial advisors, and foreign liaison consultants. There should be no problem in studying an effective aid plan for China, so that China can become rich and strong as soon as possible, and the entire Far East problem can be easily solved. But according to reports, General Wei stayed in China for one month and two days, and his footprints reached Shenyang in the Northeast, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan in North China, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou in Central China, Guangzhou in South China, and Taiwan. He also contacted people from all walks of life, and after leaving China on August 24 and flying to the United States via Japan, he has not announced the content of the aid plan, which has caused people who care about Sino-U.S. relations to speculate and feel uneasy. It was not until September 27-8 that the U.S. Business Weekly revealed the news, saying that Wei's aid plan to President Truman was: 1. To assist the National Government in improving military efficiency; 2. To assist the Chinese National Government in promoting the land distribution policy and help the Chinese land revolution; 3. To not grant China huge loans, but to base on gradual assistance; 4. To increase coal production and develop industry; 5. To pay attention to China's economic reform and control China's inflation.

We believe that the United States will never change its consistent policy of aiding China in essence, which is evidenced by the cooperation between China and the United States during the Anti-Japanese War and the assistance to China in restoring its personnel after the war. Moreover, China is the only stabilizing force in the Far East. Although some people proposed the erroneous proposition of emphasizing Europe over Asia during the war, the U.S. authorities did not completely succumb to that mercenary theory, but still paid attention to the Far East war situation at all times, so that both the eastern and western aggressors fell one after another. After the war, the United States will not fail to know that democracy should be promoted in both Europe and Asia, and that it should pay attention to one side and allow the other side to collapse. Therefore, the leaders of seven major organizations, including Secretary Loomis of the U.S. Policy toward China Association, issued a statement when celebrating the 36th National Day of the Republic of China, requesting the United States to re-evaluate the U.S. friendship with China in a realistic way, and determined to adhere to that friendship as the primary factor for world security. General Wedemeyer also published his opinion on the aid to China incident on October 16, requesting the U.S. government to provide assistance to China immediately. He also expressed his deep conviction that Chairman Chiang would be able to lead China into the path of a democratic country, and he would certainly be able to achieve his goal.

In short, we hope that U.S. aid to China can be implemented immediately, and that it will not become a bubble like the $500 million loan problem, because the international situation is on the verge of danger. If China cannot obtain sufficient assistance, she will not be able to immediately eliminate the obstacles to world peace, and China's stability or chaos is closely related to the future of the world. The United States should make a wise choice as soon as possible, support the Chinese government as soon as possible, and eliminate the source of chaos in the international community.

### A Foreigner on U.S. Aid to China

(Continued from page one) As for the current U.S. military officers serving as advisors to the Chinese army, it will make the United States too involved in China's internal affairs, which is not very appropriate. I personally believe that Wei's proposed military assistance can enhance China's military strength, but it cannot help the government achieve a decisive victory. The effectiveness of Wei's proposal depends on China's implementation of political reforms. To mention the major ones, there are two: Appoint wise and capable local administrative officials, and do not restrict them, so that they can have full power to do things. For example, Song Ziwen's appointment to Guangdong has set a good example. Song's political skills and personal attitude are debatable, but his efficiency in doing things is what China's politics need today. He has not been in Guangdong for a long time, but the wind of Guangdong civil servants sitting in tea houses and chatting idly has disappeared. Establish a fair tax system. The current consumption tax is levied uniformly regardless of the ability to pay taxes, which is unfair. Good taxes can only be levied progressively according to the ability to bear. Heavy taxes should also be levied on disruptive hot money. If the National Government can thoroughly implement similar reforms, it will be able to defeat the Communist bandits and clarify the overall situation. As for U.S. economic assistance, it must also be based on China's administrative reforms, otherwise, hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars will be used to cope with the ever-increasing military expenditures, and will be used up in a few months. Only with an increasingly balanced financial statement and effective U.S. participation can economic aid to China be effective. It is rumored that China will issue silver coins and legal tender at the same time. I believe that under the state of the legal tender's daily price drop, once the silver dollar is issued, it will be collected by private individuals, and no one yuan will be seen circulating in the market. Therefore, it is not feasible for China to adopt the silver standard at this time. "

### Transfer of State-Owned Enterprises

(Continued from page one) The government should designate national banks and invite banks and money shops to organize a consortium for the private fundraising of state-owned enterprises, and designate one or two banks as convening banks. Their task is to formulate the organization of each new company according to the units of enterprises to be transferred as stipulated by the government, and to handle the fundraising, collection, and distribution of share funds for the new company. The consortium should be located in Shanghai, and branch offices should be established in various places where state-owned enterprises are sold. The government should set a minimum price for the transfer of each graduating unit, with the principle that each unit can independently form a new company. For each unit of enterprise approved for transfer, the consortium should stipulate the amount of capital of the new company according to the government's valuation, and publicly raise shares, which should be supervised by the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises. After the shares of each unit of enterprise are fully subscribed, the consortium should immediately set a date to collect the share funds, hand them over to the national treasury, and assist the shareholders' meeting of the new company to produce the responsible person of the new company, and take over the enterprise from the government. However, in order to accelerate the sale of state-owned enterprises, it may first collect the subscribed share funds within a limited time after more than half of the shares have been raised, establish a new company, and take over the enterprise from the government. The shares that have not been raised may be entrusted by the government to the consortium to continue to sell, but the price may be increased by the government at any time and paid into the national treasury.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 25th] It is reported that the Central Air Transport C-46 aircraft, which flew from Shifeiping on the 17th, was shot down by the Communist bandits due to flying low to watch the battle.

Moore, out of curiosity, reduced his speed and flew low to watch the battle. At this time, the plane suddenly lost contact with the Ping City Aviation Radio Station. Afterwards, only slight damage to the wings was seen, and the engine was undamaged, so it seemed that it landed safely. However, Moore and others are missing.

### Sharp Drop in Northeast Coal Production This Month; Communist Bandits Severely Damage Coal Mines

[Our Correspondent in Panyang, 25th] The target for coal production in Northeast China this year was 5 million tons. Based on the production in the first half of the year, it was possible to exceed the budget and reach 6 million tons. During the communist bandits' fifth offensive, Xi'an fell and Beipiao was destroyed, resulting in reduced production. However, all mines worked hard to increase production and could still achieve the target of 5 million tons. Unfortunately, during the sixth offensive, the communist bandits focused on destroying coal mines. Fuxin and Yingchengzi were damaged, and production in Fushun decreased. It is estimated that coal production in the Northeast in October will sharply decrease by 210,000 tons, nearly half of the previous production of 450,000 tons. Therefore, the predetermined target has become an empty promise. The coal shortage has now affected the steel industry. The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant lacks coal and may be forced to partially suspend operations. The reduction in coal production has also made the Northeast economically weak.

### Communist Bandits Oppress Mongolians; "East Mongolia" Filled with Atmosphere of Terror

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 25th] The communist bandits' oppression of Mongolians and their atrocities are becoming increasingly evident. The "East Mongolian People's Republic" organized by them has been filled with an atmosphere of terror after more than a year of appeasement. According to information obtained from relevant sources in this area, the communist bandits have begun to cleanse and extort property from Mongolians since this summer. Recently, they have launched widespread bloody struggles in "East Mongolia." He Zizhang, the deputy commander of the "Inner Mongolian Democratic Allied Army," who was temporarily used by the bandits, has also been detained and sent to Wangye Temple for interrogation on suspicion of being "reactionary." His family has been exiled to the Xing'an Mountains. The communist bandits are using even more sinister methods against the educated youth of Mongolia than the Japanese did in Northeast China. Patriotic people have been brutally murdered under the charge of being "reactionaries." For example, Zhou Guanqing and Hong Guozhong, two educated youths who were recently killed in the Left Banner of Bairin, were considered by the communist bandits to have ideas of longing for the central government in their literary works.

### More Than 1,000 Refugees from Dalian Escape to Yantai After a Perilous Journey

[Central News Agency, Yantai, 25th] More than 1,000 "living human corpses" who escaped from Dalian and embraced the motherland arrived in Yantai and landed today. The refugees were on fifteen small boats, and the crowding was like sardines in a can. After thousands of pleas in Dalian, the communist bandits' "Kwantung Public Office" "graciously granted" two days, from October 14th to 16th, as an amnesty period for the people of Dalian to be released. After the deadline, no one was allowed to leave Dalian. During those two days, people flooded to the docks like a tide, scrambling to board wind-powered boats to escape. According to the refugees, more than 50,000 people from Shandong Province registered to return to Shandong. Due to the lack of ships and restrictions, the rest had to stay in Dalian and starve to death. They repeatedly requested Xu Qi, the puppet mayor of Dalian, but were still not allowed to leave. Despite the strict prevention, the refugees who desperately escaped to Yantai continued to arrive. They did not prepare food when they escaped and sat on large wooden boats. After four days of hunger and thirst, they saw Zhifu Mountain in Yantai and felt like they were returning to the embrace of their loving mother.

### Zhang Qun Attends Symposium in Taiwan, Answers Twelve Important Political and Economic Questions

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] Premier Zhang attended a symposium held jointly by Taiwan provincial senators, councilors, and National Assembly representatives at 5:00 p.m. on the 25th. Senator Liu Mingzhao and two others suggested that the government pursue compensation from Japan for the 1.1 billion Taiwan dollars in national debt and 90 million Taiwan dollars in stock debt owed by the Japanese in the past, request Japan to allocate two whaling ships, and propose developing the whaling industry in Kaohsiung County, and request Japan to compensate for a sulfuric acid plant to be dismantled and relocated to Taiwan to develop the fertilizer industry. Premier Zhang agreed to consider these three suggestions. In particular, he believed that Taiwan's only whaling industry must be expanded. Regarding the fertilizer problem, which Taiwan needs the most every year, he said, "If the Japanese compensation factories include a sulfuric acid plant, it must be dismantled and transported to Taiwan first. If there is no such factory, we can also plan to purchase one from a foreign country." A total of twelve important political and economic issues related to Taiwan Province were discussed by local Taiwanese people today, and Premier Zhang answered them all. Zhang said, "Taiwanese people have requested that the election of county and city mayors be implemented in advance. The central government believes that there is no problem with implementing it early. However, since Taiwan was only recently restored, many people believe that all measures in Taiwan should not be too special. Now that the national constitution is about to be implemented, the whole country will be under a constitutional government at the same time. If Taiwan implements it first, it seems to increase the special nature, which is what the central government is most concerned about. The central government has a plan for local administration, and the legislative procedures are currently being rushed. The issue today does not seem to be to have Taiwan advance the elections first, but rather to speed up the legislative procedures for this plan so that the whole country can implement it at the same time. Regarding the economic problems of Taiwan Province, in the past, the Japanese made Taiwan a dependent body of the Japanese economic circle, which was extremely unfavorable to Taiwan. However, if we want to make Taiwan a separate economic whole in the future, it is also an extreme view. We can only hope to promote Taiwan's specialty industries. Taiwan can rely on other provinces for the goods that Taiwan feels are insufficient. If we advocate that Taiwan be economically self-sufficient and form a regional economic system, it is not a reasonable proposition." Zhang then answered the following points separately: The Taiwan dollar policy is not being considered for change. The ratio must be determined by the Executive Yuan. The central government will definitely provide more assistance to Taiwan Province. The recent allocation of 500 billion legal tender by the Central Bank is one example, and in the future, the Bank of Taiwan will not be short of legal tender funds. The purchase price of Taiwan coal is currently being considered for adjustment. The problem of sluggish sales of Taiwan tea due to high costs will be solved. The general election will be held as scheduled and will not be postponed again. However, due to the large number of texts, it is feared that bribery will be inevitable. Zhang also said, "I heard that in the past 51 years, only more than 200 Taiwan women have married Japanese men. In the two years since the restoration, more than 2,000 Taiwan women have married compatriots from other provinces. This is truly the best example of mutual love, which is gratifying. I believe that, in addition to marriage, education and even clothing should not be divided by provincial boundaries, and we should exchange with each other. I also hope that people with financial resources in Taiwan Province will invest in the mainland." Zhang's speech today clearly received unanimous praise. After the meeting, he attended a banquet hosted by local people. During the banquet, Zhang talked about "political philosophy." In his capacity as the current President of the Executive Yuan, he talked about the political philosophy that he has always believed in, which is the four words "respect, kindness, love, and help." Weng Wenhao wrote a poem during the banquet to commemorate today's Restoration Day and gave it to Lin Xiantang, a Taiwanese gentleman: "Compatriots' joy overflows the hall, Yinghai (Taiwan) celebrates with huge goblets, the peaks all face inward, the territory of the motherland relies on support, many flags are still there, the return on this day is truly promising, from now on the rivers will become one, let us strive together for Kangqiang in the future."

### India, Turkey, Iran, and Arab Countries Plan to Form a Large Eastern Bloc to Prevent Aggression and Defend the Islamic World; Tensions Increase Over the Soviet-Iranian Oil Agreement

[Reuters, Baghdad, 24th] Political figures here have been discussing a plan to organize an Eastern bloc composed of Arab countries, Turkey, Iran, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to defend the Middle East and the Islamic world and resist future aggression. Observers say that the goodwill that the Soviet Union has earned in these countries over the past seven years has been lost due to its support for the partition of Palestine. Umari, Deputy Speaker of the Iraqi Senate, said that neither the Soviet Union nor the United States is a protector of peace, and that any country must maintain freedom and independence with its own strength. Muslims and Arabs should organize an Eastern bloc for their own interests to resist future aggression.

[Associated Press, London, 25th] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS dispatch from Tehran stating that the Iranian Parliament's refusal to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was due to "American pressure." The British Foreign Office is uneasy about the reaction to this case, pointing out that the entire situation in the Middle East is deteriorating due to the stalemate over the Palestinian issue. People fear that other problems will arise, making the situation even worse.

[Associated Press, London, 24th] Well-informed sources here say that Britain is deeply afraid that the Soviet Union will launch a political offensive against Iran as a result of the Iranian Parliament's direct refusal of the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement. They expect the Soviet Union to immediately carry out a fierce anti-Iranian reactionary propaganda campaign within Iran, and may mobilize troops along the Iranian border, and especially strive to restore the strength of the Communist Party in Azerbaijan province.

### Crises in France and Italy Extremely Urgent; Truman Urges Aid and Will Ask Congress to Grant Special Powers

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] President Truman broadcast to the nation today, urging timely and immediate action to use relief funds to relieve hunger and cold overseas, and demanding an immediate halt to domestic inflation. The President said that domestic high prices and overseas hunger and cold are enemies of the American people. The line of relief to Europe must be coordinated with suppressing domestic price increases. Inflation should be stopped to avoid being too late. The current need is too urgent. If the regular session of Congress in January next year is waited for, the discussion will be delayed for too long, and the results will be too serious.

Truman also said that the foreign countries are facing a critical stage, and the disaster of hunger and cold in Europe makes this winter a decisive period in history. The most urgent crises are in France and Italy. If the economies of these countries collapse and their people succumb to dictatorial oppression, then they will have no chance of revival, and we cannot hope that they will have this opportunity, and the revival of these countries is essential for world peace. If we do nothing, and allow economic decline, resulting in lower living standards, and our country is filled with unemployed people in the streets, this is the path of defeatism and weakness, which will cause other democratic countries to disappear and easily become victims of totalitarian aggression. We have the power to lead to world peace and prosperity, and with determination and united efforts, we will surely achieve our goal.

[Reuters, New York, 25th] The New York Times' Washington correspondent said that President Truman will ask the special session of Congress, which will convene on November 17, to grant special powers to control scarce and valuable goods, and to extend some other special powers to deal with wartime inflation. His suggestions will call for legislation to supplement current voluntary restraints on lower prices, etc.

### US to Implement Rationing System to Stop Price Increases

To restore consumer credit controls that expired on November 1 for installment payment methods and restrictions on automobiles, etc. Farmers' grains may be directly purchased by the federal government, rather than sold on the exchange, so that the impact of government purchases on price increases is minimized. To extend the import restrictions that expire at the end of February next year, including hundreds of items, and including many types of steel. To increase the power of the Federal Reserve Board to limit bank credit expansion.

### US President Calls Special Congressional Session; Republican Party Remains Reserved; Positive Reactions from Both House and Senate Committees

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 25th (Broadcast): Washington dispatch. Since Truman decided to call a special session of Congress to seek emergency aid to Europe, most Republican members feel disappointed that the President has not put forward concrete suggestions to serve as a guideline for discussion. It is predicted that Congress will cooperate with the President in all aspects to aid the people of Europe facing hunger and cold, but only on the condition that Europe strengthens self-help.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] House Republican Leader Halleck and Bank Committee Chairman Wolcott today criticized President Truman's proclamation convening a special session of Congress, believing that it combined the situation of high domestic prices with foreign aid matters, approaching "political maneuvering." Republican National Committee Chairman Reece also made similar accusations.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Republican leaders still maintain a reserved attitude toward Truman's calling of a special session of Congress. Observers believe that any opposition to Truman's plan will be considered based on whether it will affect inflation.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] Following President Truman's decision to call a special session of Congress, the congressional response has been positive. House Speaker Martin stated: "I am happy to return here to consider any plan proposed by the President. We are willing to consider anything that must be done for the benefit of our country and the world." Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft stated: "We will certainly give priority consideration to the emergency measures proposed by the President." House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton stated: "Congress must take swift action to relieve the countries that the President calls for urgent aid, namely France and Italy." Democratic Senator O'Mahoney stated: "I am very pleased that Congress is holding a special session." Former Minnesota Governor Stassen advocated that the special session first consider the need for foreign relief and suggested establishing a non-partisan federal agency to handle aid to Europe.

### Satisfaction from Britain and France

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 25th (Broadcast): A British Foreign Office spokesperson expressed sincere satisfaction with President Truman's calling of a special session of Congress to seek immediate emergency aid to Europe.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] Premier Ramadier's spokesperson announced today that President Truman's convening of Congress on November 17th for a special session to discuss aid to Europe would strengthen the French government's position, making it easier to gain a vote of confidence in the National Assembly next week.

### British House of Commons Committee Drafts Plan for Economic Recovery of Germany; Advocates Establishing Representative Government in British Zone

[Reuters, London, 24th] The British House of Commons Committee has submitted a report containing a four-point plan for the economic recovery of Germany. The report points out that the burden of supporting Germany in peacetime is no less than the burden of a defeated Germany. To enable Germany to recover, four extremely important points must be noted: Steps must be taken to immediately restore the economic integrity of the occupied zones. If this is impossible, a representative German government should be established in the British zone and other zones that can participate in a unified German economy, giving it full responsibility with clearly defined regulations. The British government should clearly declare the duration of the occupation of Germany as soon as possible. Germans should be given the responsibility to balance their economy as quickly as possible. Food is the entire key to Germany's economic problem, and food imports should be given the highest priority. The report also suggests formulating a plan in conjunction with the International Refugee Organization to deal with the problem of displaced persons. The factory dismantling plan should be thoroughly implemented so that Germans recognize the price of aggression.

Dalton also warned the House of Commons, stating that other emergency measures may need to be taken. He also said: To cope with the inflationary pressure caused by increased exports and reduced imports, it may be necessary to submit an autumn budget. Dalton also stated that Britain's ability to cope with its difficult situation has improved significantly compared to before the war, and the current number of unemployed people is only a very small fraction compared to the number of unemployed people when the Conservative Party was in power.

### Opposes Any Form of War-Mongering; Wellington Koo Issues Statement; But Difficult to Agree with Soviet Suggestions

[United Press, Lake Success, 25th] The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee, consisting of 57 nations, still needs to hear speeches from representatives of 13 nations regarding the Soviet proposal on the US, Greece, and Turkey as "war-mongers," and cannot vote today. According to sources from the US delegation, it is firmly believed that the Soviet proposal will ultimately be rejected, and the US opposes any amendments.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 24th] Although the Chinese delegation regrets any form of war-mongering in any country and eagerly hopes for rapid progress in the disarmament movement, it is difficult to support the suggestions proposed and explained by the Soviet Union to the General Assembly. This is the statement issued by Ambassador Wellington Koo today during the third day of debate in the Political Committee regarding China's attitude towards the Soviet proposal opposing war-mongering.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 24th] Chinese representative Wellington Koo today vehemently opposed the statements of the Soviet representative in the UN Political Committee, as Vyshinsky attacked Willkie's recent article in "Life Magazine" earlier this week, and said that the large-scale US aid to China was "militaristic" and tantamount to interfering in China's internal affairs.

Defending Willkie, Koo stated that he had no preconceived notions about Willkie's article, "neither endorsing nor opposing it." But he said that in the article, he could not find the "certain plot" that Vyshinsky claimed. He said that the article was a contribution to freedom of expression, which is a characteristic of freedom of the press in democratic countries. Koo said that China certainly does not want war, but also does not believe that condemnation is an effective way to solve the problem. He also denounced the so-called propaganda of a new war, believing that there is actually no organized movement to promote a new war.

### Turkish Representative Scathingly Criticizes Soviet Union

Soviet representative Gromyko remained silent and sat in a corner, while Ukrainian representative Manuilsky showed embarrassment. Sarper said, "I firmly oppose the Soviet Union's resolution accusing the US, Greece, and Turkey of engaging in 'war-mongering' activities. I, representing the Turkish people, formally accuse the Soviet Union to the United Nations of attempting to incite internal strife in Turkey through newspapers and radio stations, encouraging the Turkish army to betray the country, interfering in Turkish internal affairs, inciting Turkey's neighbors to take action against Turkey, and encouraging the Soviet people to oppose Turkey."

### UN General Assembly May Establish Middle East Economic Committee

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 24th] The United Nations, by a vote of 31 to 7, rejected the Soviet Union's suggestion that Middle Eastern countries should participate in today's Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

### Labor Strikes in Japan Gradually Becoming Serious; May Lead to "November Coup"; Nishio Expresses Preparedness for Layoffs and Wage Increases

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The situation of labor strikes in Japan is no longer optimistic. The Central Labor Relations Commission has convened a conference, attended by as many as 800 representatives from various labor unions. The government has also dispatched all three cabinet ministers related to labor issues, including Yonekubo, Kurisu, and Wada. The crux of the problem lies in the government's insistence on a basic wage of 1,800 yen, while the labor unions demand that the government meet the minimum of 2,400 calories (heat quantity). The development of this issue, due to its widespread impact, may lead to the so-called "November Coup."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session on the 25th, where the Liberal, Democratic, and Communist parties questioned the government's handling policy regarding the group absenteeism of postal workers.

### Public Utilities Still Difficult to Maintain; Electricity and Telephone Seek Further Price Increases; Suburban Long-Distance Buses Request Double Fare

[Report from this Newspaper] Shanghai Electric Power, West Shanghai Electric Power, French Water and Electricity, China Merchants Electric, Pudong Electric Power, Zhabei Water and Electricity, and other six major companies jointly submitted a document to the Bureau of Public Utilities yesterday, stating that the import tax on fuel oil should be levied according to the company's contract price, which has not been approved by customs, and they still want to levy it according to the market price. If this is the case, Shanghai Electric Power Company will have to increase its monthly expenditure by 20 billion national currency. The increase amount calculated in this price adjustment did not include the increased portion levied according to the market price, so Shanghai Electric Power Company needs to increase the price per kilowatt hour by another 360 yuan. After receiving the document, the Bureau of Public Utilities has submitted it to the central government for approval. In addition, the bureau's consultant, Li Kaidi, and the head of the second section, Chen Zuojun, previously went to Beijing to request instructions regarding the import tax on fuel oil and are expected to return to Shanghai today.

[Another report] Shanghai Telephone Company had just adjusted its charging prices this month, with an average increase of 160 percent. Yesterday, they submitted another document to the Bureau of Public Utilities, stating that they lost 167 million yuan from January to August of this year. After August, prices rose significantly, and the amount of losses has not yet been calculated. Even after this adjustment, they still cannot maintain operations, and they request a reasonable monthly adjustment in the future. After receiving the document, the Bureau of Public Utilities will review the company's books to understand its actual situation.

The suburban long-distance bus companies in this city also submitted a document to the Bureau of Public Utilities yesterday, stating that after the last adjustment of military expenses, gasoline has risen from 13,000 yuan to 25,500 yuan per gallon in the past few months. The US exchange rate has been adjusted from 12,000 yuan to 56,000 yuan, and the cost of living index has also doubled. All expenses have increased. Currently, the fare is 550 yuan per kilometer, which is insufficient to cover expenses and cannot be maintained. They request a doubling of the fare, adjusting it to 1,100 yuan per kilometer. This request is currently under review by the Bureau of Public Utilities.

### Electricity, Telephone, and Gas Companies Retroactively Charging New Prices; Senator Expresses Unfairness in Letter

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the price increases for public utilities in this city, the electricity, telephone, and gas companies were allowed to retroactively charge users for this month's bills, starting from the first of this month. Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, believes that adjusting prices due to rising fuel costs and increased costs is reasonable, but retroactively charging these new prices is unfair. In addition to sending a letter to Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, to reconsider, he also submitted two reasons as a senator to the Secretary-General of the Senate, Xiang Changquan, why the retroactive charging should not be done: For electricity, military expenses, ferries, and trains, because passengers are transient, it is impossible to retroactively collect fees, so they are let go. For electricity, power, telephone, and gas, because users are fixed, they can be tracked down, so they are retroactively charged. The method is different for two public utilities due to the same reason to adjust the price, which seems unfair. All agencies have fixed budgets. Now, after the fact, expenses suddenly increase. It is very difficult to add additional budgets. Based on the above two reasons, Xu requested that the additional date for electricity, telephone, and gas should be calculated from the date of promulgation. If there are technical difficulties in calculation, the price may be calculated in the proportion of two-thirds at the old price and one-third at the new price to be fair and reasonable. It is reported that Xu's suggestion has been sent by Chairman Pan to the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Senate for research and may be publicly discussed at the fourth session of the Municipal Senate to be held on the 31st of this month.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, the Municipal Government, upon the order of the Executive Yuan, promulgated regulations restricting the use of automobiles by private individuals. The main points of the restrictions are as follows: Registered doctors according to law are limited to one small car. Registered banks, factories, mines, and large-scale private enterprises according to law are limited to two small cars and four large cars. Newspaper agencies are limited to three small cars and two large cars. Legally approved and registered automobile transport businesses are limited to those that have already been registered and licensed or have paid for and ordered vehicles that are already en route with proof before August 31 of this year. The Municipal Government has instructed the Public Utilities Bureau to announce that from October 14 of this year, except for private individuals or private legal entities and their vehicle quotas that comply with the above regulations, all other applications from private individuals or private legal entities for automobile registration and licensing will be suspended. To ensure the implementation of the above regulations and to adapt to the city's gasoline quota without exceeding it, the Municipal Government has formulated standards for the registration and transfer review of public and private automobiles in this city, which were submitted and passed at the 99th Municipal Conference, and instructed the Public Utilities Bureau to implement them.

The revised regulations are largely the same as the draft published in yesterday's newspaper. The following are the supplementary points: (A) Regarding private automobiles: Regarding the restriction on the use of automobiles by private individuals, it was previously requested that the central government order all levels of local governments not to issue additional licenses within one year (starting from October 1 of this year). Before the Executive Yuan approves the matter, all private automobiles should be temporarily suspended from new vehicle registration and licensing, starting from the Public Utilities Bureau's announcement on October 14. All private automobile transfers should be temporarily suspended until the Executive Yuan approves the matter. Automobile registration applications filed before October 14, but with incomplete documents or complete documents that have not been inspected and licensed, should wait for the Executive Yuan to approve the above two items before proceeding with the matter, even if the documents are later completed or the inspection is passed. Private automobiles owned by diplomatic personnel from various countries stationed in Shanghai and members of the British and American military missions will still be approved for licensing upon proof, in accordance with international practice. (B) Regarding official vehicles: It is suggested that the Executive Yuan should limit the number of automobiles used by state-owned enterprises in this city by analogy with the number of automobiles used by private factories. Various bureaus and departments under the city's jurisdiction may not add small passenger cars without the approval of the Executive Yuan, but they may exchange old cars that have already been registered and licensed for new cars. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Public Transportation Company may add public buses, and various municipal bureaus and departments may add special vehicles such as fire engines, police cars, ambulances, elevated road lighting vehicles, engineering material trucks, water trucks, garbage trucks, and transportation vehicles, all of which must be approved by the mayor before licenses can be issued.

### Dancer Miss Eight's Reunion with Her Flesh and Blood; Maid's Dishonest Abduction of Young Master Solved with the Help of a Mute Teacher

[Our Newspaper's Report] Lu Yanru, 24 years old, of No. 11, Lane 44, Xiangyang North Road, is a dancer. She used to be married to Lu Shaoqing. Not long after, Shaoqing was detained in the capital for a case. Yanru remarried and changed her name to Miss Eight. She currently dances at the Paramount Ballroom, so all household affairs are managed by the maid Li Chen Zhaodi. Lu has a son named Lu Yusheng, who is only three years old, and is also cared for by Zhaodi. At 6:30 PM on the 13th of this month, Lu went to the ballroom to dance. Zhaodi suddenly had a wicked idea. She took a knife and led [the child] behind the redwood trees, stealing a gray back coat, a coffee herringbone coat, purple leather shoes, a glass leather bag, a glass powder puff, and other items. She placed them in a suitcase, held Yusheng in one arm, and took a rickshaw to Minguo Road. She pawned a herringbone coat at Tongcheng Pawnshop for 600,000 legal tender. Then she went to the North Station and took the night express train to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing in the morning, she stayed at the Xin'an Hotel on Zhongshan Road for two nights. In Beijing, she met Lu Guanquan, a Shanghai opera actor, while watching Shanghai opera performances at the Dahonglou Shenqu Opera Theater. On the third day of arriving in Beijing, she pawned the gray back coat for 500,000 legal tender and spent it all.

Attempted Suicide

Having no other options, she bought Sal's potion intending to commit suicide, but failed. On the 17th, she took a rickshaw around Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area. When she arrived at the entrance of Kyoto Theater at No. 100 Zhongshan Road, Zhaodi told the rickshaw puller Zhong Chengpeng that she was willing to give Yusheng to someone to raise, without any conditions, only asking to be considered relatives. Zhong remembered that his rickshaw shop son-in-law Du Yuannian had no children, so he happily took her to No. 33 Laohuqiao (Tiger Bridge). After discussions between the three parties, they were satisfied. That night, they treated her grandly, as if she were an honored guest. On the 18th, Du's father, Du Yifu, arrived and, after learning about the matter, thought it was inappropriate and suggested sending someone to Shanghai to investigate the details.

Stole Money and Abandoned Child

Upon hearing this, Zhaodi knew things were not good, so she pretended to be unwell, lay down on the bed, and took the opportunity to steal 2,750,000 legal tender from beside the pillow, using the excuse of going out before running away back to Shanghai. She left the young child and a handbag at Du's place. When Du discovered the deception, he examined the bag and found a piece of paper with Lu Guanquan's address on it. He reported it to the Zhujiang Police Station, which sent officers to question Lu. Lu was detained for several days and released after it was determined that he was not involved.

Investigation Begins

In Shanghai, Lu Yanru returned home that evening and discovered that her beloved son had been abducted and her clothes had been stolen. She reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Deputy Director Du Wang and Director Du Wang immediately ordered Criminal Section Chief Yu Ding to instruct police officers Meng Ruisheng and Zheng Jiwen, along with Wang Sui, to investigate. It was learned that Zhaodi had a lover, Wang Zhengfa, who was a barber registered at the Nanxiang Powder Lane Barber Shop. Lao Gu Xie Chichang was brought to the station for questioning and learned that Wang lived at his relative's home at No. 631 Xuchang Road. After Wang was arrested, he only admitted to adultery and denied conspiring in the theft. Later, intelligence was obtained that Zhaodi often frequented various Shanghai opera theaters. On the 20th, a tip was received stating that she had gone to the Qingniao Road Mingxing Grand Theater with a female friend to see Yue Opera on the 19th and then went to the Xinling Paper Offering Shop at No. 106 Wenzhou Road.

Disguised Surveillance

[Police] went to the shop to investigate. It was learned that both Lao Gu and the owner were mute and could not be questioned. Therefore, a teacher from the Mute School was asked to accompany them again. The teacher reported that she and the hostess had indeed gone to the Mingxing Theater to see the show and had been to the shop, but had not stayed overnight, and had left a pair of red leather shoes there. After assigning personnel to stay on guard in disguise, Zhaodi arrived at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. She was immediately taken to the station for questioning. She confessed to the above situation. Inspector Meng and others prepared a document and escorted her to Beijing. Yesterday, the young child Lu Yusheng was retrieved and brought back to Shanghai. The child was handed over to his family, and Zhaodi applied for detention pending investigation. After the investigation is completed, she will be transferred to the judicial authorities for trial.

### Four Elements Are Empty, Why Litigate? Nuns of Yinxiu Convent Tried; Court Orders Attempt at Out-of-Court Settlement

[Our Newspaper's Report] A group of nuns from the Yinxiu Convent on Liyuan Road, Xieqiao, in the Southern City were tried at the High Court yesterday. The plaintiff was Fayu, and the defendants were Rongzhou, Fawu, and Lin Qing. After the death of Rongliang, the former abbess of Yinxiu Convent, on March 10 of this year, Fayu, Fawu, and others disputed the temple property. Fayu accused Fawu and others of beating and injuring her to the judicial authorities. The District Court's first instance verdict acquitted Rongzhou, sentenced Fawu to four months, and sentenced Lin Qing to three months. The defendants appealed. The High Court held a hearing yesterday. The two sides debated fiercely. The defendants said they did not beat anyone, and the plaintiff said she was beaten. Liu Shizheng, a police officer of the Songshan Police Precinct No. 4748, was summoned to testify. According to him, at around 1 PM on July 28 of this year, the nun Fayu came to the branch station to report that hooligans were beating people. The witness immediately went to investigate and did not see any hooligans. There were only many nuns arguing inside the convent, so he did not intervene. The court reprimanded both the plaintiff and the defendant for being monks and nuns and should focus on the four elements being empty. Why litigate? The court instructed both parties to attempt an out-of-court settlement.

At that time, the retail price of matches is estimated to fall by one-third. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted a plan and will submit it to the National Economic Committee for approval.

### Successful Bidders for Former German Houses on Linsen Middle Road Notify Tenants to Move Out; Residents Will Seek Relief According to Law

### Mayor Wu in Beiping: Enjoying Duck, Feels Sad That Zhengyanglou is Closed

[Our Newspaper's Beiping, 25th Report] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen revisited the old capital today. He, his wife, and Xiao Yishan planned to go to Zhengyanglou for duck at noon, but unexpectedly Zhengyanglou had been closed for many years. They changed to Quanjude instead. Wu was quite emotional.

[Our Newspaper's Beiping, 25th Report] Wu Guozhen met with reporters at the Municipal Government's reception center in Xilahutong today, talking freely about the reasons for his trip to the north and his feelings. Wu said: Since I took office in Shanghai, my personal health has deteriorated greatly. Last year, I lost 10 pounds compared to when I was in Chongqing, and recently I weigh less than 140 pounds, which is 25 pounds less than when I was in Chongqing. Chairman Jiang passed through Shanghai and granted me two weeks of leave. I originally planned to come north for vacation immediately, but it was delayed until now due to handling labor unrest. Wu then elaborated on the high administrative efficiency of foreign countries, citing three reasons: (1) High salaries, sufficient to maintain a livelihood. (2) Regular vacations, allowing the body and mind to be adjusted, resulting in doubled efficiency when returning to work. (3) Retirement pensions, eliminating worries about the future. Therefore, Wu strongly advocated that China should also implement a regular vacation system. Wu said that this trip has no itinerary, no plan, to travel when he wants to travel, to read when he wants to read, and to rest when he wants to rest. Whether he will go to Qingdao is undecided. If there are important matters in Shanghai, he will return at any time. But according to his estimation, there are probably no important matters at this time.

### Yu Jingcheng's Appeal Retried; Two Defendants Summoned to Testify

### Youth Corps Officials Detained for Carrying Weapons to Qidong for Work

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Baichuan, director of the Sixth Division of the Jiangsu Provincial Headquarters of the Three Principles of the People Youth Corps, sent 50 team members with 25 rifles to Qidong for work on August 19. The Garrison Headquarters learned about this and, because the division was not a military organization and because Zhu intercepted orders from superiors, and because Zhu intercepted the division's notice that carrying weapons in a group was illegal, ordered the Wusong Fortress Headquarters to detain them. Officers Zheng Zhong, Zhang Muqing, Zhou Yongxiang, and Jin Ruming were taken to the Garrison Headquarters for questioning.

### Li Guangzhi Declared Not Guilty in the Meiqi Wheel Smuggling Case

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Meiqi Wheel smuggling case, where Customs inspector Li Guangzhi was accused of corruption, was concluded by the District Court. Yesterday, the judgment was announced: "Li Guangzhi is not guilty." The reasoning was that Li's accusation of corruption was based solely on the words of Sun Kequan and Feng Lianke, who said: "I have already discussed it with Li Guangzhi," but this statement could not be confirmed by a second person. There was no active evidence, so it was difficult to hold him responsible for the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the Statute on Punishment of Corruption.

### Unprecedented Feat by Our Scientist: Observing the Aurora Borealis in the Arctic; Dr. Feng Jian Returns to Shanghai, Discusses His Experiences

Dr. Feng Jian, the first Chinese to conduct scientific observations in the Arctic, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Hong Kong on the evening of the 24th. Dr. Feng is the President of the National Major Institute of Technology and the Director of the Chongqing International Radio Station. In July of this year, he went to Paris to attend the International Radio Expert Conference and the meeting on the need for radio and film materials in war-torn countries convened by the UNESCO. Afterwards, he went to the Arctic via Norway. The area he reached was Spitsbergen Island, at latitude 79 degrees, which is now the main base of the Soviet Arctic.

Yesterday, Dr. Feng met with a reporter from Shenzhou News Agency and said that he went to the Arctic in a private capacity, mainly to observe the Aurora Borealis, which has an important relationship with radio. Because there is electricity around the earth, and when electrons from the sun fly towards the earth, the north and south poles, where the electricity is the weakest, are the easiest places to enter. When these

Solar Electrons

shoot towards the earth, the light emitted due to the vibration of the air density is called the Aurora Borealis. At the same time, because the sunlight shines obliquely, the area near Bear Island is where the Aurora Borealis is strongest. The journey of this observation, from Oslo, Norway to Bodo, crossed the sea to the Arctic Circle, passed through Bear Island, and arrived at Spitsbergen, going from the area with the least Aurora Borealis to the area with gradually increasing Aurora Borealis, through Bear Island, where the Aurora Borealis is strongest, and finally back to the area with the least Aurora Borealis. Therefore, in Norway, one must observe northward to see the Aurora Borealis, while in the Arctic, one must observe southward. Dr. Feng's trip to the Arctic was not only arduous, but the transportation was also difficult. There is an air route from Oslo to Tromsø, the departure point for the sea. After arriving there on September 10, Dr. Feng worked hard to find a coal ship that allowed him to hitch a ride. He stayed in Spitsbergen for 90 days.

On Spitsbergen Island, except for some coal mines where people live and the Longyearbyen has three cows, there is nothing else. Food and other necessities for the mines are all supplied by Norway and the Soviet Union. It only took Dr. Feng four days to go, but seven days and seven nights to return, due to violent winds and waves.

Dr. Feng's trip yielded abundant materials for observing the Aurora Borealis, and he also had many feelings. He said that if large-scale scientific expeditions are to be carried out, one must bring one's own ships and instruments. He was fortunate to be able to reach his destination by hitchhiking on a coal ship, but in the end he had to use two sticks as instruments and hats instead of cameras. Listening to Chongqing broadcasts in the Arctic mines was very clear, while Nanjing was quite blurry. It was joyful to hear the sounds of home in the far north of the Earth's axial world. Dr. Feng also felt that the Arctic is extremely important today and has become a shortcut for Eurasian aviation. However, we hope that the development of aviation by various countries in the Arctic can become a way to exchange cultural goods, rather than moving the tragedy played out in the Pacific to the bottom of this planet.

### Zhang Chunfan Looks Depressed, Hands Cuffed Behind His Back, Escorted to Court; Police Bureau Granted Three-Day Extension of Detention

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the suicide of Yue Opera star Xiao Dangui, Zhang Chunfan, the manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, was suspected of involvement and was detained by the police bureau for investigation. At around 11 AM yesterday, officers from the Criminal Investigation Section of the Police Bureau dispatched three police officers to escort Zhang to the District Prosecutor's Office in a jeep. Zhang wore a coffee-colored jacket, looked depressed, and had his hands cuffed behind his back. At 2:30 PM, Prosecutor Chen Shoutao briefly questioned him. The police bureau stated that the case was complex and it would take a long time to prepare an investigation report, and requested an extension of detention for one week to allow for a thorough investigation. Prosecutor Chen believed that the case was quite simple and a week was unnecessary, so he granted an extension of detention for three days. At around 3 PM, the bailiffs escorted Zhang back to the police bureau for continued questioning.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to Zhang Chunfan's detention and Qian Boquan, Xiao Ling's brother, having taken a portion of the inheritance back to his hometown of Sheng County, no one is taking care of Xiao Dangui's funeral arrangements.

### Chahar is Leaping Forward: Stable Order Encourages Construction Enthusiasm, Smooth Transportation Brings Economic Prosperity

[Our Newspaper, Chahar, 18th] The wind is rustling, the rain is drizzling, and Zhangjiakou has entered the late autumn season. People need cotton clothes in the evening, and sometimes old sheepskin coats are seen on the streets.

Chahar is leaping forward: Stable order encourages construction enthusiasm, smooth transportation brings economic prosperity

The buildings destroyed by the Communist army last year and turned into broken walls and ruins are now decorated magnificently. At street corners, Mongolian-style yurts have been replaced by urban-style police watchtowers. Electric lights are no longer exclusively for government agencies; business houses and residents are also brightly lit, and street lights shine brightly at night, with very few power outages. Post-war relief has left significant results. Through the "work-for-relief" method, the roads in Zhangjiakou are no longer as bumpy as they used to be. Stable order encourages construction enthusiasm, and smooth transportation brings economic prosperity.

Factory Resumption

The factories here have ended the "rectification" phase and are on the path to resuming work. Under the active leadership of the Chahar Provincial Enterprise Co., Ltd., oil mills, soy sauce factories, lumber mills, and comprehensive machine repair shops have all started operations. More than ten factories, including match factories, cigarette factories, paper mills, and alcohol factories, will also resume production soon. Originally, factories that had suffered severe damage under conditions of a complete lack of funds and materials have undergone a difficult process from "crippled state" to revival. For half a year, the authorities have put in a lot of effort to reorganize these dilapidated factories, and it can be said that not a single unit of manpower or time has been wasted, and work efficiency has been raised to the greatest extent. Although the power plant and coal and iron mines in Xiahuayuan, which are heavy industries related to national defense, have no hope of recovery in the short term.

People's Armed Forces

Military achievements provide a strong guarantee for political and economic development. The Chahar people's self-defense armed forces are strong and powerful, and have had many heroic deeds. In the deployment of forces, "small forces help large forces, and large forces support small forces." The police and self-defense teams can easily resolve the harassment of one or two dozen Communist bandits. Small groups of thirty or fifty Communist bandits are the target of the security forces' search and suppression. Only when there are more than a hundred bandits are regular troops dispatched. The flexible and strict communication network, the unobstructed roads and bridges, and the maneuverability of the powerful troops have strengthened the connection between the local armed forces and the regular army. At present, the security situation in Chahar Province has gradually achieved surface control from point and line control. Organized people are the basic team for pacification, and the effective use of "people's politics" is the main factor in leveraging people's power. At present, people's organizations in Chahar Province are developing like mushrooms after rain. The Provincial Assembly was established through popular election, and the Chamber of Commerce Federation, Journalists' Association, Farmers' Association, and Women's Association have also been established one after another.

Commercial Expansion

The PingSui Railway is the only complete and smooth railway in the north. The number of trains has increased, and the speed has increased. In the past six months, passenger and freight transport and road administration have made considerable progress. The direct train to Pingbao has been successful, and the line is peaceful, with little or no interference. Therefore, merchants from Peiping and Tientsin are developing trade towards the northwest. Under the guiding policy of "protecting local merchants and encouraging traveling merchants," Zhangjiakou's commercial development has been very rapid in the past six months, and one-fifth of new businesses have been expanded in all industries. The authorities are doing their best to support small businesses and have planned to establish two markets that can accommodate more than 700 small shops. Among the 54 guilds, the stall industry guild has also been established, and representatives serve as directors of the Chamber of Commerce. The current Chamber of Commerce can represent the interests of small businesses by two-fifths.

Price Fluctuations

Zhangjiakou's main exports are food, fur, and livestock, and its main imports are cloth and daily necessities. It is close to Peiping, and price fluctuations are directly stimulated by Peiping and Tientsin. Under the fluctuations of overall prices, it is difficult to expect local price management to be effective.

Chahar, which is on the road to revival, has become an important town for northern national defense. When other provinces in the north are disturbed and uneasy, this remote Mongolian place has received attention from all sides. (Reporter Jie Zhong)

### The Chinese Science Society's 33rd Anniversary: Shanghai Members Hold a Celebration Meeting; Over 300 Attendees, Including Mao Yisheng, Showed Great Enthusiasm

(Our Correspondent) Yesterday was the 33rd anniversary of the Chinese Science Society. The Shanghai members of the society held a celebration meeting at the society's location on Shaanxi South Road at 4 PM. Over 300 members and their families attended, including Mao Yisheng, Lu Yudao, Qiu Weiyu, Zhang Mengwen, Cao Liangzhi, He Shangping, Yang Xiaoshu, Zhang Changshao, and Fang Yuyan. The atmosphere was warm and enthusiastic. He Shangping presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, stating: Although the Chinese Science Society has been established for 33 years among Chinese science organizations, it is still young in the world of scientific and academic groups. Fortunately, with the efforts of colleagues, it is full of vigor, which is gratifying. Then, Mr. Yang Xiaoshu reported on the establishment process of the society in its early years. He said: When the society was initiated and organized at Cornell University in New York City 32 years ago, the only activity was to solicit shares for the publication of the "Science" magazine, at six US dollars per share. When the "Science" magazine was officially printed in Shanghai, it was on the eve of the outbreak of World War I. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the society was planned and established, named "Science Society," and later changed to its current name. The plan at that time was to establish three research institutes: biology, physics and chemistry, and engineering; and to establish a science translation institute. Later, due to lack of funds and the establishment of the Academia Sinica, only the biology research institute was established. As a result of the institute's efforts, it has achieved remarkable results to this day, which is known both at home and abroad. As for the science translation institute, it was changed to an editorial department before the war, publishing the "Science" magazine and various science series, and established the China Science Book and Instrument Company, making significant contributions to the scientific community in our country. During the war, when Shanghai fell, the enemy puppets, seeing that the Science Society was registered in the United States and received US subsidies (Boxer Indemnity), and was founded by anti-Japanese elements, planned to take it over. Fortunately, the members in Shanghai came forward to negotiate, feigning a reception room, and the society's location was preserved. Subsequently, entertainment programs began, with students from Yucai School performing youth dance music, Luo Du's love songs, dances, and other programs. Finally, a science film "Jing Lun Yi Bei" was shown, and the meeting adjourned at around 7 PM.

### Hu Shi Gave a Speech at Chengzhong, Quoting the Story of Pasteur to Prove the Importance of Education

(Our Correspondent) Hu Shi, president of Peking University, came to Shanghai from Beijing, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Mr. Hu, accompanied by his old classmates Chen Shouchang and Zhang Zuxun, visited his alma mater, Chengzhong Middle School, at 9 AM on the 24th. All the teachers and students of Chengzhong Middle School held a meeting in the school's Cheng Hall to welcome him. Mr. Hu gave a speech on the spot, mainly as follows: "Over the past forty years, I have felt very emotional. Just now, the last sentence of your school song, 'Let us not forget this bitterness,' deeply moved me. When Chengzhong was founded, it was still during the Guangxu era. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and entered Dong San Zhai, as the fifth class. Because the dormitory was full, I lived in Huai De Tang, with only two classmates and one teacher from Dong San Zhai. Recalling that time, now it is all a flat land, how can I not feel sad? In the west, there used to be a kitchen, dining hall, and bathroom along the wall. At that time, the biggest classmate, Chen Zhongying, led the meal arrangements, which we enjoyed. Now, it is all leveled. That was in the ninth year of the Republic of China, the golden age of Chengzhong. During the War of Resistance, Principal Wang just said, 'This is the most painful era.' I, an old alumnus, would like the younger students to know that during the eight years of the national crisis and occupation, under the leadership of Principal Wang, they did not yield to the enemy's power, but suffered the destruction of the school buildings, endured hardship, and waited patiently for the light, operating in rented houses outside. I hope the younger brothers know that that was the most difficult time for our Chengzhong, and also the most glorious time for Chengzhong. Ye Gong spent his hard-earned money to set up a 'Meng Xue Tang' (elementary school), this great wish is truly admirable. There is still a plaque of 'Meng Xue Tang' in front of our school buildings, which is a glorious thing. In the future, I hope that the school board will work hard to run the best middle school. But in this national crisis, do not be discouraged, first restore the school buildings, focus on equipment and lessons, etc., with the efforts of the school board, it will definitely be successful.

Secondly, I want to talk about education saving the country. Now everyone seems not to pay attention to it. This is not because they don't pay attention, but because they think it is a cliché, perhaps they are tired of hearing it. Now I am fifty-seven years old, but I still want to talk about it. The complete destruction of the school symbolizes the destruction of the country and society. But what can we use to rebuild? 'Education' is still a key element in saving the country. Although China is already one of the four major powers, China is in a very dangerous time. Construction is difficult, destruction is easy. It only takes a few seconds to destroy a house or a railway bridge, but it is difficult to rebuild after destruction, requiring blood, sweat, and hard work. But education is still the first priority. When we rebuild the destroyed school buildings, we should keep a few places to commemorate the pain we suffered before, never forgetting it. I will tell another story to prove the importance of education: In 1870, seventy-seven years ago, there was the Franco-Prussian War. Prussia was the strongest in Germany, a militaristic country, and also an aggressive country. In two weeks, it defeated the French army and captured the French king. Later, France and Prussia made peace, France ceded two important territories to Prussia and paid a indemnity of 500 million francs, which was the largest indemnity in the world. Twenty years later, a British scholar said in a public meeting: 'France was defeated by Prussia, but there was one person who paid off the 500 million debt for France, but who is he? He is a scientist, Pasteur. He wrote to a friend that France's defeat was deserved, it was the result of not promoting science. So he hated the country and continued to work hard. He was originally a chemist, but later became a famous medical scientist, studying bacteria. He studied that decay is due to bacteria. A piece of meat will not rot if no microorganisms enter it. Our ancestors also said: 'Things must rot before insects grow.' France is an agricultural country, and livestock, cattle and sheep often suffered from plague and spread widely. Later, he was asked to study it, saying that cattle and sheep ate a microorganism when eating grass. Pasteur injected the virulent bacteria into healthy cattle and sheep, and they eventually died, showing the harm of microorganisms. Later, he experimented with injecting insurance serum into fifty cattle and injecting virulent bacteria into another fifty. All the cattle that had been injected with the insurance needle did not die, and the other fifty all died. Prevention of diseases was also invented by Pasteur. In this way, the country could avoid the loss of tens of millions of cattle and sheep dying, which is also a way to save the country. Also, because farmers raised silkworms poorly, production decreased. He was asked to study it, and as a result, he invented the 'breeding' method, which saved the country countless francs of loss. Also, French wine could not reach distant places. If it was taken too far, the wine would turn sour. Pasteur was asked to study it, and as a result, the wine was heated to 45 degrees and then bottled. The French king had fifty barrels of cooked and uncooked wine each, and sent them around the world on a warship for about a year. When he looked at the barrels, the uncooked wine had spoiled, and the cooked wine not only did not spoil, but was even more fragrant. So this experiment was successful, which saved the country tens of millions of francs of nameless losses. Animal husbandry, silkworm breeding, and winemaking all relied on him alone, and were able to save the country tens of millions of losses. So a British scientist said, 'Pasteur's ten years of work in the laboratory can pay off the 500 million franc indemnity.' Before this world war, France conducted a public opinion survey, and as a result, the greatest person was not Napoleon, nor the heroine Dak, but Pasteur was selected as the greatest person. From this, we can know the importance of saving the country and education. I hope that the younger students will study hard in school, establish a model for primary and secondary schools for the country and for society, and I should also work hard for the revival of my alma mater."

### Father-Son Tennis Tournament: Raising Large Sums of Money to Donate to Children's Police Uniform Fund

### Minister of Economic Affairs Invites Heads of Textile Associations to Exchange Views on the Implementation of Joint Allocation, Distribution Is Imperative, Hoping for Cooperation Between Officials and Merchants

(Our Correspondent) Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. He told reporters that the main task of this trip was to preside over the establishment of a Joint Allocation and Distribution Committee for Cotton Yarn. The implementation of the joint allocation and distribution system will start with cotton yarn first. The candidates for the members of the Joint Allocation and Distribution Committee are currently being discussed and will be established within the next week (i.e., this week). Regarding the opposition of the Cotton Textile Associations of the six districts to the joint allocation and distribution system, he believes that the implementation of the joint allocation and distribution system may be temporarily inconvenient for private factories, but the result will be satisfactory, and the study of the joint allocation and distribution system is not fundamentally unfavorable to private factories. Tomorrow (26th) afternoon, he will meet with Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Cotton Textile Associations of the six districts, to exchange views on the implementation of the joint allocation and distribution system, and ultimately hope that officials and merchants will cooperate to the end. Regarding cotton, it has been decided to set up joint institutions in each production area to jointly negotiate prices. The promotion of the cotton cloth price negotiation system is still under consideration.

### Since the Measures Have Been Agreed Upon, They Must Be Implemented According to Law: Chairman Liu of the Textile Adjustment Commission Issues a Statement

(Our Correspondent) Liu Siying, chairman of the Textile Adjustment Commission, recently issued a statement regarding the refusal of the Cotton Textile Associations of the six districts to implement joint allocation and distribution. The statement is as follows: The joint allocation and distribution plan was originally proposed by the textile industry to the government. After repeated discussions at the Textile Adjustment Commission, a concrete plan was drawn up, submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, then to the Executive Yuan, and then to the National Economic Commission for review. During the review, the Cotton Textile Associations of the six districts also sent representatives, including Mr. Tang Xinghai, to Beijing to attend the meeting and state their views. As a result, it was approved by the Executive Yuan and announced for implementation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The outline of the joint allocation and distribution was passed by the committee of the Textile Adjustment Commission, and then discussed by the Cotton Textile Associations of the six districts, and representatives were appointed to review it before it was submitted to the National Economic Commission for decision, and then transferred to the Textile Adjustment Commission by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for execution. The Finished Product Distribution Subcommittee of the Textile Adjustment Commission was reorganized into the Joint Allocation and Distribution Committee to study the detailed methods of implementation in order to ensure smooth execution. Most of the members of the Joint Allocation and Distribution Committee are representatives of private yarn factories, and everything can be discussed in detail. Unexpectedly, the Cotton Textile Associations of the six districts fundamentally opposed the joint allocation and distribution measures, which is quite puzzling. In the past four months, the work of the Textile Adjustment Commission has been based on cooperation between officials and merchants, which has been harmonious and satisfactory. Since the joint allocation and distribution measures have been agreed upon, and the flexible and reasonable price negotiation has also been restored, the commission can only implement it in accordance with the resolutions.

### Cotton Price Negotiation in Production Areas Will Be Implemented on the First of Next Month

(Our Correspondent) The Raw Cotton Supply Subcommittee of the Textile Adjustment Commission was held yesterday afternoon starting at 4 PM. More than a dozen members attended, chaired by Hu Jingliang, to discuss matters related to cotton price negotiation. It was resolved: 1. Starting from November 1st, cotton price negotiation will be implemented simultaneously in cotton production areas such as Hankou, Shashi, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Nantong, and Tianjin. 2. In the above six locations, personnel from national and private yarn factories, the Central Bank, the Textile Adjustment Commission, cotton merchants, and other relevant institutions will form a price negotiation subcommittee to determine the purchase price. 3. In order to improve the quality of cotton, the purchased domestic cotton must be inspected by the cotton improvement offices in each region.

### Cotton Yarn Replication Industry Supports the Principle of Joint Allocation

Joint allocation and distribution of cotton yarn is part of the implementation plan to regulate the supply and demand of yarn and cloth. The Textile Adjustment Commission is executing it under orders. Pan Shihao, a representative of the replication industry, met with the person in charge of the commission yesterday to provide suggestions. He pointed out that the regulation should take into account both supply and demand, and that almost all of the yarn is used for replication processing. Industries such as weaving, knitting, towels, blankets, underwear, handkerchiefs, camel wool, sails, and weaving bands are all turning cotton yarn into clothing for supply to society. It is hoped that the Textile Adjustment Commission will adopt the opinions of the replication industry in the technology of joint allocation and distribution and provide an opportunity for participation and assistance. Pan told the reporter that the failure of cotton yarn production to meet consumption is an indisputable fact. Managing its distribution to implement regulation is a last resort. Examining the price index, the index of textiles is below the total index, which proves that the work of the Textile Management Commission and the Textile Adjustment Commission has achieved considerable results. The joint allocation and distribution measures being implemented will be able to take into account the reproduction cost of yarn factories and the direct users of cotton yarn. Then the business community may feel a slight restraint, but on the whole, it is worthy of support.

### National Bonds Soar; Foreign Stocks Also See New High Prices

Government bonds continued to advance yesterday, with securities brokers, money changers, and foreign firms all buying, and the rising trend expanded.

A and B bonds rose from 12,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan before slightly retracing, and E bonds also reached the 20,000 yuan mark before consolidating. Da Cheng Xing's rooms 503, 360, 505, and 502 all advanced, while rooms 644 and 555 exited. As a result, each bond rose by 4,300 to 4,700 yuan compared to the previous closing, with a turnover of about 13 million yuan.

Due to the participation of securities brokers, the rising trend of foreign stocks expanded again yesterday. The Hong Kong exchange rate declined, and Wheelock Marden and China Emporium rose a lot and created new high prices, and hot stocks appeared to be inferior. Banks, money changers, and retail investors sold, while foreign firms and Guang Bang absorbed. Ewo Cotton rose from 100,000 yuan to 190,000 yuan at the close, an increase of more than 20% compared to the previous closing for Wheelock Marden, HKR, and China Emporium.

The oil market shops were still refreshing, soybean oil rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, rapeseed oil also rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and sesame oil rebounded by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan accordingly.

### Tea Market Transactions are Scarce; It is Not Easy for Buyers and Sellers to Reach a Price Agreement

Yesterday, in the tea market, although there were negotiations between exporters and cargo owners for export varieties and designs, due to the large disparity in asking prices, there were only sporadic transactions. As for tea for domestic sale, the buying interest from shops and stores on this street and various customer groups was still strong, especially for green tea such as stir-fried green and baked green tea this year.

### Buyers and Sellers Both Remain Cautious; Chinese Stock Market Conditions are Flat and Weary

Yesterday, because the multilateral sentiment in the Chinese stock market was even weaker, continuous liquidation occurred. The attention of some major players turned to United Front activities, so although the money market was flooded, there were many buyers, but it was ultimately difficult to support it, and it was still easy to fall and difficult to rise. Guangdong gangs absorbed from time to time, with quite a struggle in the middle. The morning opening, because it was reported that US aid to the war was promising, the Yongsha stock opened from 301 yuan and 304 yuan and then dropped to 293 yuan and 297 yuan. There were many buyers outside the market, and the interest rate was expected to be much cheaper, so it was still easy to pull it up. However, the intensified dismantling of telephones and other facilities outside the market made people still uneasy. Although the off-market interest rate opened low to 16.5% and 21% in the middle, and the Guangdong gang bought in, it still forced the price down to a low price of 289 yuan for immediate delivery and 292 yuan for deferred delivery near noon.

Only 16 Guangming coarse yarn fell by 400,000 yuan.

The cotton cloth market continued to be firm and rising at the opening. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth once rose to 900,000 yuan. Later, due to the arrival of economic supervision personnel, the transaction turned dull, retail investors sold high, and the market softened. Near the close, it was heard that the yarn price was still firm, and people's hearts returned to stability. As a result, Longtou fine cloth recovered slightly by 8,000 yuan compared with the previous day, and Wufu Blue Chicken Caiqiu fine cloth improved by 35,000 yuan. Other grades of fine cloth and bleached cloth, serge, etc. each had their own ups and downs.

### Mother-in-law Stirs Up Trouble, Husband and Wife Turn Against Each Other and Part Ways, Wife Elopes, Husband Takes a New Concubine

Dear Editor, A friend of mine, A, married Miss B more than nine years ago and had a daughter.

— Zhang Daofan

The reason why the Chinese nation has been able to stand tall through any calamity is because it has a broad and brilliant cultural foundation; Chinese art is the vanguard for the understanding and attention of Chinese culture by countries in the East and West. Painting is even more of a common language for mankind, and the style and temperament it contains are the embodiment of the national spirit. For example, the simplicity of Han Dynasty stone carvings and the beauty of Tang and Song Dynasty paintings all reflect the spirit of the times and become the glory of the nation. Since the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, although there have been outstanding figures, the artistic movement seems to have declined due to the political influence at that time. In modern times, our country's contact with Western culture has been frequent. Although the surface seems chaotic, it is actually a sign of revival. I have always said that the art world should be like a large garden, which must have exotic flowers and plants, giant trees and forests to be considered lush. Now that our country's national fortune is flourishing and cultural revival is in sight, most of the contemporary artists are friends of Daofan. Seeing that they have their own achievements and are full of vigor, my belief is even stronger.

Professor Fu Baoshi of Central University has recently collected hundreds of his works and will hold a public exhibition. Landscapes account for about three-fifths of the content, and figures account for two-fifths. There are many fine works. Especially the large "Beauty Walk", which is graceful and bright, reveals a piece of Hua Cai in the green Yang bushes, but it is not vulgar, exquisite and not flowing into portrayal; the surface seems static, but it is full of dynamic meaning, worthy of being a masterpiece. "Lady Xiang" depicts the side shadow of Ling Bo, with her clothes fluttering, her demeanor is transcendent, and the fallen leaves are dotted with ink, which is unexpectedly limitless. Reading the sentence "The wooden leaves are falling in Dongting, the autumn wind is swaying" on the painting makes people's spirits soar. "Pipa Xing" has a novel structure and profound character expressions. Not only is the protagonist like this, but all the supporting characters are also listening, as if moved by the middle; and the technique of maple trees is strange and unrestrained, which increases the power of the picture. Furthermore, the nobility of "Dongshan Sizhu" and the beauty of "Playing Orioles" are more transcendent, beautiful, and vivid in the small-scale works. In short, Baoshi never sticks to the superficial appearance and clothing of the characters, but aims to portray their emotions and life. His success lies in this, and his difference from ordinary people also lies in this.

Landscape paintings are even richer in changes, each with a special situation, and the method is also adapted to the circumstances, emerging endlessly, never bothering about the wrinkles of the ancients. The large-scale ones are mostly majestic, like Lao Du's poems, vast, dignified, and inspiring; the small-scale ones are mostly ethereal and ethereal, each of which is extremely detailed. I deeply love the "Ten Thousand Canes of Smoke and Rain". Many painters use this as a theme, but they only write about the rustling wind and rain in the courtyard. This work, however, depicts a small building in the depths of the mountains, hidden in the thick strips, each branch trembling in the wind, and there is the echo of the valleys, the murmur of the flowing springs to compose it. This is the symphony of nature, so it shakes our heartstrings! How easy is it to see in hundreds of years?

Judging from the screen this time, it is an exhibition of landscapes and figures. In fact, it should be seen as the expression of the author's rich mind and the crystallization of high art. It is hoped that the good readers will get the meaning and forget the words. Mr. Baoshi is an outstanding genius, but he is also one of the pioneers of the times, there is no doubt about it. The curtain opens one day, so I express my feelings like this.

### Two

— Gu Yiqiao

When Baoshi held an art exhibition in Chongqing, I was saturated with reading many works and wrote poems for them. This spring, I met Baoshi in Beijing and was given a recent landscape and figure painting. Seeing it, it seemed to have progressed a thousand miles in a day. Only then did I know that Baoshi had been diligently studying painting and writing since we parted, so he made even greater progress. A few days ago, I had the opportunity to reunite with Baoshi and brother Zhang Shuqi. When the two of them were in high spirits, they wielded their pens to collaborate on "Picking Chrysanthemums on the East Fence". Baoshi's figure painting is very transcendent, and Shuqi's flower painting is extremely unrestrained. This time, I personally saw Baoshi holding a pen, which proved his deep cultivation and exquisite talent, which is not a false rumor.

Baoshi's works have the artistic conception of literati paintings and the skills of artists. The former is full of detached interest, and the latter has skilled six methods. Therefore, it is neither vulgar nor rigid. Whether it is a mountain, a water, a person, or a tree, it can make you savor it endlessly.

I love Baoshi's paintings because they are not poor, just like reading the poems of Han Yu and Du Fu! I especially introduce it to my fellow enthusiasts.

### Three

— Zhao Qingge

I have read almost all of Mr. Fu Baoshi's works in the past few years, and I often feel that I never tire of reading them.

Baoshi's painting is like his person, unrestrained and not constrained by etiquette; transcendent and not involved in customs; natural and not excessively decorated. After a few glasses of old wine, he let go of his vigor and used large brushes and splashed thick ink to create his outstanding works. No matter how rough and dirty it looks to your naked eyes, it has a different artistic conception in it. I would like to use a paragraph from Zhuangzi to discuss his painting, namely:

"When the King Yuan of Song was drawing a picture, all the historians came, bowed and stood, licked their pens and mixed ink. There was a historian who arrived late, leisurely and did not rush, accepted the bow and did not stand, and went to his own house. The public sent someone to see him, and he undressed and was squatting, winning. The king said: Good."

People have inner beauty, and paintings also have spiritual beauty. Baoshi only relies on his skilled brush and thick ink to create a vivid rhythm. It cannot be compared with today's painters who get the form but have no rhythm; and who are colorful but lose the brushwork.

What I still hope for from Baoshi is that he can read more books by sages; (by books by sages, I do not specifically refer to ancient Chinese texts.) read more good articles, and visit more famous scenic spots, so as to further expand his subject matter and higher transcend his interests and realm, so that he can achieve great success in the future.

What should be further recognized is that Chinese painting is not a specialized decorative product that is subordinate to elegance. It also has a living life. If you can pay more attention when writing with a brush and ink, it can also enlighten life and promote society. Therefore, I hope Baoshi can understand this point and develop this point, so that Chinese painting has a chance to be re-evaluated.

### Four

— Xu Shiqi

Professor Fu Baoshi, with his outstanding talent and artistic spirit, almost forgets to sleep and eat. The landscapes he paints are full of smoke and clouds, with a grand atmosphere, like a heavenly horse flying in the sky, and cannot be measured. The figures he paints are free and unrestrained, almost taking the seat of the people of the Song Dynasty. The wonderful thing is that it is between having method and not having method, which cannot be glimpsed by mediocrity. Reading his paintings is like tasting olives, like smelling orchids and artemisia, the taste is long and lasting, and it becomes more obvious over time, and you can only get something if you play with it.

Baoshi avoided the bandits and entered Sichuan, and lived in Chongqing for eight years. He and I were in charge of the lectures at Central University, and lived alone in the poor mountains, content with loneliness, and entertained himself with writing, calligraphy and painting. The painting history and theory he wrote are hundreds of thousands of words, exploring and collecting extensively, and forming a great view. This exhibition includes more than one hundred and eighty fine works, including landscapes, figures, plain drawings, and colored drawings, all of which are wonderful realms. "Orchid Pavilion Preface" and "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove" use vivid brushstrokes to describe historical subjects, making people leisurely and fascinated. "Standing Alone in the Vastness," "Old Friends in Wind and Rain," and "High Residence in Forests and Springs" are all smoky and varied, with abundant vitality. Among the small works, the most refined are often "Drunk Monk," "White Miao Dongshan Gang," and "Later Red Cliff." A few strokes write out infinite melancholy. Wang Wei's poems have paintings, and paintings have poems, and I have obtained this from Baoshi's works.

### Five

— Zhang Qiqu

In the years before the approach of victory, the calligraphy and painting exhibitions in Chongqing were really at their peak. No matter when, as long as you walked through Fuzichi, you could always see someone holding a "solo exhibition" or a "joint exhibition". And the price of each painting was much higher than the fee for an article at that time, so many non-professional painters also engaged in painting and calligraphy and held exhibitions to cope with the difficult life during the war. Therefore, a group of more pure artists were not very willing to hold exhibitions later. Like Mr. Fu Baoshi and others, it was not until after the victory that he exhibited his eight years of carefully crafted masterpieces at the Jiangsu Fellow Association in Qixinggang. I read Mr. Chuan's paintings, and I read them the most happily that time.

Mr. Chuan's paintings are superior in their vigor. After looking at his paintings, it is like reading an article by Han Yu, majestic, deep, and the more you read it, the more flavorful it becomes. Because his paintings are mainly about vigor, it is easier for large-scale paintings to give full play to his talent.

Recently, someone from the Beijing Art Association criticized Xu Beihong's paintings, saying that he has completely lost the spirit of national painting. I don't want to comment on Xu's paintings. I just say that I don't think it is necessary to have a sect to meet the standards of national painting. For example, Mr. Baoshi's paintings, of course, he also transformed from the laws of the ancients, but if it is clear that a certain painting is in the style of the Song Dynasty, or that a certain painting has the style of the Tang Dynasty, I think it is unnecessary. Because they really have their own brushstroke division, it is because they have their own brushstroke style that they are more valuable. If you want to stick to the ancients or the law, it is just a tomb craftsman, what is so valuable?

"An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood" sequel has not arrived, temporarily suspended for one day.

### A New Path for National Painting

— Shi Chongpeng

Impressions After Reading Mr. Chen Shuren's Paintings

The creation of painting lies in expressing the author's personal inspiration, joy, and sweetness, so that the audience can have the same resonance. This includes the author's personal character, knowledge, cultivation, and other inner strengths, as well as external reactions from the environment, era, and fashion. Only then can painting have life, power, and value.

If we carefully examine this "Centennial Painting Exhibition," we can see that there are very few artists who can express the author's personality, have creative meaning, be rich in the spirit of the times, or be directly influenced by Western painting and show new trends on the screen. Among the two hundred painters of the past one hundred years, only Ren Bonian, Xu Gu, Wu Changshuo, Wu Shixian, Cheng Yaosheng, and Gao Qifeng can be considered. Taking Ren Bonian as an example, he started with Lao Lian and became unrestrained, revealing his own face. His works after middle age gradually became hasty and frivolous, reflecting the gradual chaos of social order and the increasing difficulty of life. Zhao Wu entered painting with epigraphy, with a majestic atmosphere, unifying poetry, painting, and epigraphy, which is a creative painting style. Wu Shixian's landscape paintings, with their depiction of sunny and rainy weather, are quite in line with the principles of perspective, which is the result of the initial influence of Western painting. Gao Qifeng's depiction of birds and feathers is vivid, delicate, and beautiful, sweeping away the traditional imitation. Commentators believe that he was influenced by Japanese painting. I believe that whether it is Western or Eastern, in the new era of advanced transportation and cultural exchange, Chinese painting should have a new trend and open up a new path. This is an undeniable fact.

Gao was from Lingnan, and many people were influenced by him for a time, resulting in the name of the Lingnan Ling School. Undoubtedly, this school of painting has an important position in the history of Chinese painting. Chen Shuren was a senior member of the Kuomintang, and in his spare time from politics, he loved to paint. His paintings are novel, innocent, and do not fall into the stereotypes of the ancients. Combined with his spirit of political revolution, they are full of the beauty of the "new era," inspiring people to work hard and giving people an exciting spirit.

Recently, Mr. Chen moved to Shanghai and leisurely shut himself up at home to write and paint. He likes the kapok flowers of his hometown the most. The large six-foot-wide paintings are full of flowers. This kind of painting with the spirit of the times can no longer be complimented with the old sayings of "entering the Song and entering the Yuan, Xu Xi and Huang Quan." He inspires us on the screen that the times are advancing, and art should not only keep up with the times but also lead the times and stand at the forefront of the times! At the same time, we can learn from Mr. Chen's paintings that painters in turbulent times should contribute our art to move people. Let us put down our butcher knives and engage in creating human culture and appreciating art that cultivates emotions. Mr. Chen recently held a price exhibition at the Dasin Company Gallery. I was fortunate enough to see it first, so I wrote my thoughts like this.

### Mr. Chen Shu Is at the Individual Exhibition Venue (Sketch)

— Sun Fuxi

### Colored Verses

— Wang Mengou

Red and Green

Shi Lin's "Poetry Talks" says that Wang Jinggong's poems use strict rules, especially in antithesis. Indeed, there are many ingenious antithetical sentences in Wang Jinggong's poems. Sometimes, he also likes to use the method of "contrast," such as in the poem "Sending Zanshan Zhang Jun Back to the West": "A hundred sorrows arise in old age, a smile separates the vast waves"; in the poem "Meeting Old Friends at Huazang Temple": "A hundred hardships block the way, a smile brings lingering"; in the poem "Sending Yan Zhen": "Shaking hands relieves a hundred sorrows of the past, returning home with a smile is a beautiful time." These all use a hundred sorrows and a smile to contrast, strengthening the hundred sorrows with a smile, achieving a strong emotional contrast.

In addition, he also likes to find contrasting writing from visual effects, such as using red and green as contrasts.

"Green gradually returns to secluded grass, red should move the old forest." ("Returning")

"Green stirs cold weeds out, red fights for warm trees to return." ("Evening Rain")

"Red sinks on the mountain's setting sun, blue rises in the hazel forest's mist." ("Climbing Yecheng in September of the Year Yi Si")

"Green shade quietly leads the way deep, red writes clear slopes to look at carefully." ("Willow")

"Green is delicate and vaguely swept lightly, red is tender and charming, face lightly made up." ("Seashore Flower")

"Blue joins evening clouds rising, red competes with the morning sun flowing by the snow." ("Alternating Gold Sand Flowers")

These put red and green in the first character, and then in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh characters, such as

"Bank red returns dense, green islets join still late." ("Following Up on My Younger Brother on the River")

"Green lush clouds rise together, drunken red stirs snow, competing to be heard." ("Gold Sand Flowers on the Pond")

"Rain flowers red half gone, smoky trees green rely on each other." ("Late Spring")

"Water flowers red emerge from all sides, mountain bamboo green supports each other." ("Yixian Pavilion")

"There should be green wine with yellow chrysanthemums, why need red skirts and purple flutes?" ("Climbing the Mountain on the Ninth Day")

"North city red emerges from tall branches, south bank green returns to old trees round." ("To Cao Langzhong")

"Red flags flutter far away, rainbow beard shouts black wind." ("Sending Peng Geishi")

"Willow leaves sing cicadas green and dark, lotus flowers fall as the sun sets red and drunk." ("Inscription on the West Taiyi Palace")

"Trees contain ancient rain, red first enters, grass leans on the morning sun, green grows more." ("Rhyming with the Small Garden")

"The land is remote because of the shallow shore, people are old for whom red." ("Cattail Leaf")

"Imperial water is fresh like duck head green, palace flowers have crane feather red." ("Thoughts in the Back Garden")

"Hair has long turned green outside the wheels, aging face soaked red by wine." ("Harmonizing and Passing by the Jixi Temple in the Evening")

"Long accompanied by the green of palace locust trees, now seeing the red of Chu sails in parting." ("Sending Wu Chongqing")...

These are all clear color contrasts, used to construct visual images. Red and green are common colors in painting, but expressed in writing, these colors are also symbols of objects. Therefore, green may be grass, forest, water waves, the spring wilderness, etc.; red may be flowers, sunset, colored clouds, etc. However, the red and green written in the poems are just general terms for two color systems. Between their shades, there are many different special names, such as blue, turquoise, emerald, and even black can be called green. The same is true for red, such as crimson, scarlet, vermilion, red, and even ocher can be called red. Therefore, black hair can be called green temples, and ocher-colored soil can be called red mud. The colors included in red and green are so complex, so the objects represented by them are also very numerous, making people think that the poet's coloring is just like the painter's, following the color of the object and making its color appear. Wang Jinggong's red and green verses are just one example of this.

### Discovering New Talent

— Zhu Mei

Everyone knows that the lack of progress in various aspects of China is due to many reasons. The most important reason among many is the issue of people. Everyone also says that there is a shortage of talent in China, but those with power are mostly unwilling to cultivate talent. In other words, it is not that there are no people in China who can be cultivated, but that no one is cultivating them. One of the strangest phenomena is that every day when you open the newspaper, there is some kind of meeting, and after all the fuss, it is just those art committee members... the titles printed can fill several dozen. Just a few people's names. Those few people have become omnipotent. Let's assume that they are omnipotent, but will their time allow them to be economic committee members, science committee members, etc.? Will their energy allow them to think carefully and work hard? Don't say that everyone started as a newcomer.

### The Language of Animals

— Broken Wheel

If a person can accomplish two major things in their life, it would be glorious enough if they could accomplish just one thing. How can someone do well if many things are piled on their head? If there is someone who is truly responsible, they should cultivate talent on the one hand, and discover talent on the other. How many people are not using what they have learned? Whose responsibility is this? Not using what you have learned is wasting a person, which is also wasting the country's money and people. Every minute of a Chinese person's life should be dedicated to the Chinese nation. There is no need to be afraid or selfish. New people will replace the old one day. My intention is not to ask the old to give way, but to ask the old to lead the new forward. Life is only a hundred years. Don't plan for one person, and don't hate or envy new people, because you also started as newcomers.

In ancient times, people believed that birds and beasts had their own languages. In many folk tales, animals speak, think, and act like humans. Some scientists even now believe that animals must have something similar to language. The only thing that is undeniable is that animals have the ability to express their feelings and desires.

Darwin pointed out that dogs have learned to use various barks, growls, and yelps to express their emotions in human society, and pointed out that in Paraguay, a lower-level ape will make at least six different cries when angry, causing other apes to have the same emotions.

The American amateur naturalist Hannah believes that one type of ape call means "food," another means "drink," and another means "danger"; the shaking of the ape's head is a negative sign.

Another American, Nissen, discovered that anthropoid apes have five different calls: a fragmented call expressing excitement; a call of terror and panic; a threatening call expressing anger; a howling expressing loss; and a satisfied, vague call.

When a worker bee finds a flower with honey, she immediately flies back to the hive and performs a special flight dance in the sky to convey this urgent message. This signal is immediately transmitted to the entire bee colony.

Rabbits jump, using their hind feet to transmit signals of urgency or danger. A type of white-footed mouse can also use the same method. A bird called a blue jay, when it first discovers danger, immediately emits a sharp cry, and other birds and squirrels immediately spread the news to the entire forest. A male wild duck can use a rough cry or a sudden high flight to transmit danger signals. A mother bear can knock on a tree trunk to call her cubs down from the treetop. When a male wolf buries food that he cannot finish, other wolves know it completely because of the scent left in his mouth.

Not only can higher animals talk, but even a crab uses a language to convey her love, which is very surprising. A female firefly crawls on the grass leaves at dusk and also uses the three sections of her abdomen to emit continuous flashing light to indicate her marriage proposal signal.

In the tropics, there is a type of tree ant that can knock on tree bark and leaves, making a sound like a sudden rain, to indicate conversation. Elephant herds talk using their ears and noses. A beetle called a deathwatch beetle can knock on its hard mouth in a dark hole in the wood to make a sound to transmit meaning.

The most difficult thing to understand is that the language of all animals does not seem to require sound, smell, gestures, or other physical intentions. Most biologists believe that this is a kind of telepathy, while another part of biologists believe that the senses of nature are much more wonderful than human's slow understanding. To this day, these two views are still debated endlessly.

### Rectifying the Name of Revolution Grass

— Yuesheng

The "Revolution Grass" has appeared twice in the newspaper. Its shape and nature have been described in detail by Messrs. Yun Yao and Bo Yun, so there is no need to repeat them. However, its name is derived from association, so I hereby supplement and rectify it. In fact, its name is Peng, and what is called "floating weed" is this thing. As for the reason for its name, it is because herbaceous plants, if not diligently removed, will spread quickly. Peng is not the only one like this. At first, it was ignored because it was small. By the early Republic of China, either because of favorable weather or location, or because of timely opportunities, its growth was stimulated. Then, children gave birth to grandchildren, and grandchildren spread seeds again. The melons and vines succeeded each other, and the trend filled the rivers. People were shocked, but they did not know its name. At that time, revolutionary slogans were popular in both urban and rural areas. The ignorant villagers used "revolution" to describe anything unusual. Since this grass had not been seen before, it was named "Revolution Grass."

The author's family has lived in the Wuxiang Township of Dongxiang in Ningbo for generations, which is adjacent to Dongqian Lake and has many rivers and ports, making it a breeding ground for Peng. It is often seen there. However, in 1926, when I was working in Dongyang and returned to Yongkang from Pingyang, I passed a place where the river surface was vast, no less than Shanghai Pudong, and the Peng grass had accumulated for more than a mile, which was the most I had ever seen in my life.

My hometown has another kind of so-called "Revolution Grass," which is very different from Peng. It is also an aquatic plant with red stems and green leaves, hollow and segmented in the middle. It is more than ten feet long and as thick as Hangzhou Tianzhu chopsticks. Its branches and leaves grow luxuriantly, very similar to Guazi grass. Its leaves are larger and plumper, often intertwined with Peng. Its harm is equally great. The farmers in my hometown are troubled by its obstruction of navigation, but some are also envious of its abundance and can use it as firewood. They compete to fish it out and stack it on the shore. After a few days, it seems to wither, but once it rains, it flourishes again. It must wait until the winter is deep before it dries out completely and is used as firewood in the kitchen. The seeds are scattered where it is stacked, and they sprout from the soil in the warm spring of the following year, turning into a terrestrial plant. When I was a child, the banks, fields, and corners of houses in my hometown were full of it, but now, the territory of Peng has been completely taken over by it. If you see one or two plants, it is like a phoenix feather or a unicorn horn, seen only once. My hometown enjoys the water conservancy of Qian Lake and uses the Yong River as the tail, so there are no disasters of drought or flood, and the crops are abundant every year. However, the villages are scattered like chess pieces, and the population is as dense as stars, but there is still a shortage of food. Therefore, there is a saying, "Ningbo is ripe, a pot of porridge." After the fall, the enemy and puppets imposed levies and openly went abroad. Treacherous merchants sought profit and secretly leaked to the sea. The poor families were completely empty, and many picked these leaves to make soup to fill their stomachs. When asked about the taste, they said it was palatable. Now, I have been away from my hometown for a long time. I wonder if there are still Yi and Qi in my hometown after the victory?

### On Manners

— Liu Meng

When British and American people meet, if it is in the morning, they will definitely shout "Good morning" to each other, and when they say goodbye in the evening, they will say "Good night". They are used to it and do not feel forced at all. When French people meet, they say "Bonjour" in the morning and "Bonsoir" in the afternoon. They are also used to it. It is no different from us shouting "Old Zhang, Old Wang". The French also have a saying. For example, in the military camp, they ask "Ça va?" in the morning and answer "Ça va?", so the barracks are full of "Ça va" sounds, which means "How are you?" (question) and "Good" (answer). China is a land of etiquette. What do Chinese people say when they meet? Some shout "Good morning, Mr. So-and-so?" or simply blurt out "Morning", and some shout "Morning". There are also some French, Japanese, and German greetings that mean "Good morning". Besides, there are "Have you had breakfast yet?" "Have you eaten?" or even "The weather today is hahaha." I can't remember who said it: "China is a country of eating, sleeping, and playing." It is somewhat accurate. Otherwise, why would they ask about "eating" when they meet? As for "sleeping" and "playing", there are also some signs. Don't you hear people asking, "Did you sleep well last night?" "What have you been doing for fun these days?"

At this point, I am a little doubtful about the title of this country as a land of etiquette. But then I think that times are constantly changing, and customs naturally rise and fall with them. Etiquette is a thing of the past. Just treat it as an antique. However, has politeness also entered the tomb with it?

Elementary school students read sentences like "Good morning, Dad" and "Good morning, Mom" in books, but they don't use them much in practice. Although shop owners have instructed their staff to treat customers kindly, the staff's attitude towards customers is always indifferent. It is not okay to look at things casually, and returns are even more unacceptable. The so-called "loyal service" is just a phrase in advertisements. Compared to the foreigners saying thank you when they exchange money and goods, what do we think?

Politeness is hypocritical etiquette, but it can show some friendship and give people a kind of mental pleasure. If you want to replace politeness with rude voices, it is undoubtedly to create a division between conquest and being conquered. If one party is unwilling to be conquered, they will inevitably raise their fists and face each other, using action to determine the winner.

"Politeness is lost!" From foreigners looking at Chinese people, from ancient times to the present, I have reached this conclusion.

"Remembering Jiangnan" This Week

### Strange Vehicles

— Liangzai

A public bus crashed into a store, a ten-ton truck cut off the head of a female tram passenger, and traffic trucks and cars collided with each other. Car accidents in Shanghai can be said to be all kinds of strange things. But the strangest car accident happened on Long Island, USA.

That day happened to be the New Year's holiday, a cold winter day with heavy snow. Seven miles east of Mineola, two cars drove down a steep slope together. The mountain was steep and the road was slippery. The car in front was naturally cautious and driving very slowly. The driver of the car behind saw that the distance between the two cars was getting closer and closer, so he began to brake. However, the car's brakes suddenly broke, and it rushed forward like a wild horse out of control, crashing into the car in front with a loud crash. The ice and snow flew, the mountain shook, and the valley echoed. Many people were out celebrating the New Year, and a third car was driving behind these two cars. The tragedy happened in an instant. The third car didn't even see clearly what had happened before it hit the two cars. With its heavy impact, all three cars rushed down the mountain together. Then, six more cars, although they realized that something had happened, lost control due to emergency braking and crashed into the pile of broken cars.

The first ambulance to arrive at the scene saw five cars that were severely damaged and beyond repair. And the number of people injured? - Only three, and no one was killed.

This was the strangest car accident in the world. The unlucky passengers cursed and couldn't help but laugh at each other.

### Applying What You Learn

— Shazhou

FL. Thomasson, a famous psychology professor at the University of Los Angeles, was walking alone on a dark path late one night. He had five hundred dollars in cash in his pocket. Soon, he noticed a ferocious man following him and getting closer and closer. He knew what was going to happen.

He walked up to the man and said sadly and pitifully, "Hey, friend, can you spare a dime to buy me a beer?"

The robber exclaimed in surprise, "I was going to rob you!" He slapped himself on the head and said.

Thomasson took a dime and walked away. The five hundred dollars in his pocket was still his.

### Film World This Week

— Li Zhen

Recommending "Remembering Jiangnan" War is the most rigorous test for us. Under this test, many people have fallen, especially intellectuals. Li Yun, the poet in "Remembering Jiangnan", had ambition. He had passion, and he also had the courage to fight for freedom for his motherland. At the same time, he also had the roots of the petty bourgeoisie, who are prone to wavering. Therefore, in this war for national survival, he finally failed the test and fell into the water. Under the temptation and coercion of the enemy, he agreed to betray his comrades in the anti-Japanese war. In the surging tide of passion, he could go to the front line to work regardless of death. These are all the same person, but this is the changeable nature of an intellectual. The playwright Tian Han's criticism of the characters is profound and powerful. How many cultural workers with anti-Japanese slogans on their heads today know that their souls have not fallen into the water or surrendered to the enemy? Such a fresh and realistic work is indeed a masterpiece among today's domestic films.

If we say that the director of this film has achieved excellent results, then we must recommend the female lead, Zhou Xuan, even more. She gave Xie E and Huang Er different personalities and different types, creating two characters with such a clear distinction, which is indeed rare. Feng Zhe is the poet Li Yun. His appearance is excellent, but he is still not rich enough. Zhou Feng's Xianxianmin and Su Hui's Liu Yifu are solid gains.

We are willing to sincerely recommend this rare masterpiece "Remembering Jiangnan" from Cathay Company to the audience.

"Desire" is more pleasing to the eye. The theme of "Desire" is more vague, but in terms of performance, this film is still passable. Among the films directed by Wang Yin, this is already a relatively progressive one.

Worth Watching

"They Were Expendable" This is a film with a different style among Hollywood films. The characters here are dock workers and wandering female drivers. The lives of these lower classes constitute this film. Although the story is simple, the portrayal of the characters is clear and vivid.

Comedy

"The Bride Comes Home" The plot is smooth, the performance is relaxed, and Claudette Colbert's acting as a female writer is enjoyable and pleasant. Melvin LeRoy's achievements as a director are also not weak.
