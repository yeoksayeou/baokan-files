[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Voting for the general election began on the 21st. From early morning, national flags were flying everywhere in the capital. The polling stations were more lively than usual. Today is the voting day for women's organizations.

In the end, she voted for Ms. Wang Yongde and left after personally placing the ballot in the box. Chinese and foreign reporters took many photos. It is noted that Wang Yongde is a member of the People's Socialist Party and a candidate from women's organizations. Those present were very impressed by Madame Chiang's spirit of transcending party affiliations.

The 22nd is the voting day for professional organizations, and the 23rd is for regional elections.

At 8 a.m., a whistle sounded from Jingshan, and radio stations and broadcasting vehicles were also deployed. This morning, the weather was cold and gloomy, and citizens' voting was not very enthusiastic. At 9 a.m., He Siyuan and his wife went to the Xishiku polling station with their citizen identification cards from the 14th Bao.

### List of Legislative Yuan Candidates from Political Parties Still Under Negotiation, Youth Party Supervising Committee List Returned

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The list of Legislative Yuan candidates nominated by political parties has not yet been submitted to the Election Headquarters. The Election Headquarters sent letters to the three parties on the 21st urging them to nominate candidates. It is reported that as of the evening of the 21st, the lists of the People's Socialist Party and the Youth Party were still under negotiation. The current deadlock lies in the People's Socialist Party's insistence on an equal number of nominations as the Youth Party, while the Youth Party is demanding 20 more nominations than the People's Socialist Party, hence the delay in the final decision.

[Another dispatch] The Youth Party had previously submitted a list of candidates for the Supervising Committee nominated by political parties, and the People's Socialist Party had also agreed on a list in Shanghai, but it had not yet been submitted.

### Zeng Qi Discusses His Impressions of Universal Suffrage: Madame Chiang Demonstrates True Democratic Spirit

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The 21st was the first day of national universal suffrage voting. Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party, concerned about the election administration, personally went to various voting districts at 10 a.m. to observe the voting situation of the voters. He distributed the ten reasons for implementing constitutionalism, which he had written, to the election workers. Zeng said of his impressions of voting: It is rare to have this situation in the initial trial of universal suffrage. He believes that the enthusiasm will be even greater in the second universal suffrage six years later. Because today is the voting day for women's organizations, Zeng said that women are voting so enthusiastically, and the future of Chinese women's participation in politics is very promising. When Zeng was at the Wangjiang Road Elementary School polling station, he learned that Madame Chiang voted for Ms. Wang Yongde of the People's Socialist Party, and believed that Madame Chiang's non-partisan approach was a true democratic spirit.

### U.S. House Military Subcommittee Urges Prompt Assistance to China and Advocates Early Peace Treaty with Japan

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 21st Broadcast: Washington News, the U.S. House Military Subcommittee submitted a report today advocating an early peace treaty with Japan and hoping to retain three naval bases in Japan. The subcommittee was led by Republican Congressman Cole on a tour of the world. The report put forward the following points: Provide more and faster assistance to the Chinese government. Send a U.S. military delegation to train Greek troops. Develop Truk Island as a large naval base in the Pacific. Strengthen military facilities on Guam. Retain the Ryukyu Islands as a U.S. strategic base. Increase oil storage in Pearl Harbor so that it can be used for one year in the event of war. The report strongly urges a peace treaty with Japan, and the U.S. military can withdraw from Japan after the treaty is signed. Although the report does not directly name the Soviet Union, it says that if any country expresses opposition, the United States may take unilateral action, but the United Nations must take over Japan when the U.S. military withdraws. The subcommittee believes that Japan is the most satisfactory region for them, and they praise the actions of the U.S. occupation authorities and the cooperative attitude of the Japanese. They believe that it is a "tragic mistake" for the United States to focus its attention on Europe and ignore China. They also urge President Truman to pay attention to this point, advocating giving the Chinese government more military supplies and training personnel. The report acknowledges that the Chinese government has corruption, but it is better than establishing a government in China that is hostile to the United States. If China falls into the hands of communism, it will inevitably affect the United States, and ultimately, the entire Far East and Pacific will be swallowed up by communism.

### American Newspaper Advocates Military Aid to China

[Associated Press, New York, 21st] The New York Daily Mirror editorial on the 21st condemned "the Soviet Union's support for the Chinese civil war since 1924" and supported the Communist troops who even fought against the Chinese government during the war against Japan. The editorial pointed out that Roosevelt had tried to permanently unite Chairman Chiang with the CCP, and Truman and Marshall "are still in the shadows of Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam," also trying to create cooperation. "Chairman Chiang refused, because he knew that the CCP's collusion with the Soviet Union was a traitor to the motherland, and it has been so since 1920. Marshall's mediation almost destroyed China, because the mediation created the image of the United States encouraging communism, and strengthened the CCP's power. We stopped shipping all military supplies to China, while the Soviet Union continued to fund the CCP. At the same time, a large amount of military equipment in the Pacific region is increasingly decaying. If Chairman Chiang had this military equipment, he could do a lot - this is reasonable and practical assistance. However, the United States provides tens of millions of dollars to Europe, and does not mention this at all, perhaps because this kind of assistance does not cost much, or perhaps because the U.S. government's idea of foreign aid is to make the American people suffer heavy sacrifices."

### Peixian and Zaozhuang Recovered, Xuzhou Shortens Curfew Hours From Yesterday, No More Communist Bandits on the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou Section of the Longhai Railway

### Chairman Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters in Writing: The Work of World Peace is Arduous, Our Preparation for Implementing Constitutionalism is Nearing Completion

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang answered questions from United Press reporters in writing on the 21st: Seeking world peace is truly the most arduous task. I firmly believe that the establishment of the United Nations can gradually achieve the highest ideal of mankind, a global family. This is the most important progress of the 20th century. Any undertaking to improve the human condition must naturally undergo many difficult trials. It is not surprising that the United Nations encountered various difficulties in its early efforts to achieve world peace. But I deeply believe that if all member states can aim at the happiness of the entire world and place their national interests below it, then they will be able to mutually understand and work together to achieve a final solution to all current difficulties. Regarding the preparation for the general election and the implementation of constitutionalism, the Chairman declared: Our preparation for this major event is nearing completion, and the entire country must work hard to accelerate progress in all aspects. Our task today is no less than during wartime, and the difficulty of the environment has not diminished, but I sincerely hope that all the people will increase their determination to remove all obstacles that hinder the country from completing its reconstruction plan as soon as possible. The basic condition of democracy is the rule of law. Of course, all actions of government officials should be based on law, but the people should also learn to abide by the law. Only in this way can the democratic system have a sound and lasting foundation. The United Press reporter asked a total of five questions, and the Chairman answered two of them, and was unwilling to express opinions on the others.

### Far Eastern Commission Discusses Allied Reparations Claims, Our Proposal to Convene a Peace Conference Has Not Yet Been Discussed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission did not discuss China's proposal to "request the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission to promptly hold a preliminary meeting for a peace conference with Japan" at its regular meeting on the 20th. According to authoritative sources, it is not appropriate for the Far Eastern Commission to discuss China's proposal at this time. What was discussed at today's meeting were more specialized issues such as the Allied reparations claims against Japan and Japanese industrial standards. According to a U.S. State Department official who told reporters, the Chinese government's note to the U.S. side reiterating its proposal to convene a preliminary peace conference with Japan is still under "active consideration" by the State Department. The State Department has not yet responded to the Chinese government.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] It was learned today that the misconception among people in various countries here that the Allied powers in the Pacific were deadlocked on the issue of reparations from Japan was partially clarified last night due to the United States' new proposal on the proportion of reparations to the Commission. The United States also urged members of the Far Eastern Commission to request their governments to accept the proposal for the common happiness of the Allied powers, so as to remove the main obstacles to the recovery of Japanese industry and commerce. Authoritative sources claim that some countries have expressed their willingness to accept the new U.S. proposal so that the occupying authorities in Japan can immediately begin to implement the reparations work. However, the content of the new proposal is still kept strictly confidential. It is only known that China's share has always been the highest, and it will be significantly reduced in the future. As for the Philippines, its original share of 15% of the total reparations may remain unchanged, which the Philippine government is expected to accept. In addition, the original total percentage was about 200% of the value of Japanese reparations, which is said to be revised to 100%. The Far Eastern Commission also hopes to receive responses from the governments of the countries concerned in one or two weeks, so that a decision can be made at that time.

### Councillors of the Participating Political Council Suggest the Government Should Quickly Win Back Hearts and Minds: Property Tax Should First Be Levied on Senior Officials and the Wealthy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Councilor Wu Dunwu and others proposed at the meeting of the Resident Committee of the Political Council on the 21st that the government should quickly find ways to win back the hearts and minds of the people in order to quell the rebellion and build the country.

In addition, the case proposed by Yao Tingfang and others to request the central government to publicly commend the local teams of Zhenping, Neixiang, Zhechuan, Dengxian, and Nanyang counties in Henan to encourage morale and benefit the suppression of bandits was resolved to be submitted to the government for prompt handling.

[Central News Agency, Yulin, 18th] (Delayed) Since the county seat of Yulin was besieged again on the 26th of last month, it has been more than 20 days.

### Where is France Going?

While the US Congress is holding a special session to consider emergency aid plans for Europe, the situation in Europe, particularly in Germany, is becoming increasingly unstable. Strikes and disturbances are occurring in various parts of both France and Italy. In France, the Ramadier government finally succumbed and was overthrown, and Blum, a veteran of the Socialist Party, resumed the task of forming a cabinet. Simultaneously with this news, there came the order from the French president to recall 140,000 new soldiers. Amidst the turbulent situation in France, the fact that the French president entrusted Blum with forming a cabinet while also recalling new soldiers as a necessary military measure, is sufficient to show that the current situation in France seems indeed very critical. Blum's willingness to shoulder the burden of reorganizing a new cabinet at the age of seventy-five is admirable, but whether his efforts will achieve the desired stability for the future of France is a matter of concern for the world.

The reason why the situation in France has become increasingly turbulent, eventually leading to the collapse of the Ramadier cabinet, is not a simple one. From the direct and immediate perspective, France has been swept by a surging wave of labor unrest. Strikes resulting in bloodshed have occurred in places like Marseille, and the Ramadier cabinet, overwhelmed in dealing with the situation, had no choice but to announce its resignation. However, the labor unrest in France is less a dispute between employers and employees, and more accurately described as a political struggle. Its purpose is not merely to obtain higher wages and better treatment, but to deliberately create difficulties for the government. This is clearly a political action of struggle. The occurrence of this movement is, to some extent, a reaction to the unprecedented victory of the "Rally of the French People" in the recent French municipal elections. Its purpose is to incite unrest in various places, plunging general order into chaos, in an attempt to achieve the goal of seizing power. Even if this goal cannot be achieved, it can at least create temporary terror to facilitate future development. This is clearly a planned action, and undoubtedly, the Communist Party of France is behind it.

The emergence of this movement is certainly related to the victory of the "Rally of the French People" led by de Gaulle in the municipal elections. And the victory of the "Rally of the French People" is also related to the Communist Party of France. After the war, the influence of the Communist Party of France grew, and it seemed to regard itself as the number one political party in France. However, the "Popular Republican Movement" led by Foreign Minister Bidault also emerged in France as a new political party, enjoying popular support, and forming the left and right wings of French politics. The reason why the French political situation was able to be maintained in the past was because middle-ground parties, such as the Socialist Party, were able to seize opportunities, leaning left or right, to mediate. The Ramadier cabinet was centered on middle-ground parties, supplemented by the right-wing "Popular Republican Movement." However, with the "Popular Republican Movement" having lost the vast support of the masses it once had to the victory of the "Rally of the French People", it was expected that the Ramadier cabinet would inevitably encounter difficulties. If we consider the reason why the "Rally of the French People" led by de Gaulle was able to achieve a great victory in the municipal elections, the direct cause was that the French Communist Party had betrayed its country by joining the new Communist International, appearing in the guise of the "Communist Information Bureau," and willingly becoming a tool of Moscow. Since the declaration of the "Communist Information Bureau," the vigilance of the French people has been raised, and ultimately this vigilance has allowed the political group led by de Gaulle to achieve victory in the municipal elections. The French people, for the sake of their country, have placed their hopes on de Gaulle.

The unprecedented victory of the political group led by de Gaulle in the municipal elections immediately changed the French political landscape. The vast supporters of the "Popular Republican Movement" led by Foreign Minister Bidault have mostly shifted further to the right, joining the "Rally of the French People." Even the General Confederation of Labor of France, which has been controlled by the Communist Party of France and has six million members, has experienced a split, turning towards the "Rally of the French People." Today, this political group is undoubtedly supported by the majority of the French people. De Gaulle's stubbornness and self-will has been known to the French people, but the "Rally of the French People" represents a newly emerging force. Although de Gaulle is the leader, the core members are mostly former Communist Party members who are dissatisfied with the Communist Party, such as the famous writer Malraux. The victory of the "Rally of the French People" indicates that the trend of French politics shifting to the right is becoming increasingly clear. In this situation, we see Blum emerge and take on the heavy responsibility of forming a cabinet.

If Blum succeeds in forming a cabinet, it will undoubtedly be a transitional government. The question is, a transition to where? The fact that the right-wing "Rally of the French People" has great support is a fact, and it is expected that it may win the parliamentary elections next year. But whether the Blum cabinet will transition to de Gaulle remains to be seen. We should not forget that when the Communist International decided to organize the "Popular Front," Blum was the former leader of the "Popular Front" government; he had close ties with the Communist Party. The current political situation in France is different from the past, and the position of the Communist Party is also different. We have no way of knowing whether Blum can change his past attitude. But according to news reports, Blum's coming out to form a government seems to be a blow to the "Rally of the French People," which has great potential power. It is said that there are two factions within the so-called middle parties, one led by Blum, which advocates establishing a government that would make it impossible for de Gaulle to regain power; the other advocates establishing a transitional government, as a transitional mechanism between the current government and the de Gaulle government in early next year. Reynaud, who was once rumored to be forming a cabinet but failed, and is now rumored to be the deputy prime minister of the Blum cabinet, is the leader of this faction. Now that Blum has come out to form a government, it seems that it cannot be said that this is not a blow to the "Rally of the French People."

In short, since the de Gaulle faction won in the municipal elections, the left-right struggle within the French political situation has become increasingly acute, bordering on civil war. Blum, from the middle party, emerged to form a cabinet in order to avoid civil war. Whether civil war has been avoided, or whether it has instead intensified the struggle between the left and right factions, promoting civil war, depends on how the middle parties, especially a figure like Blum, conduct themselves. We hope that the middle parties can truly play a role in mediating between the left and right.

(Continued from page 1) Mr. Chu first stated that student unrest in various places is gradually subsiding. He analyzed that the causes of the student unrest were due to the youth's unease and also due to the pressure of life, which led to their frustration with the phenomena. He then stated that after the restoration, the primary task of education is to restore the pre-war state, but due to the heavy losses of the eight-year war of resistance, educational restoration is extremely difficult. For example, the lack of school buildings makes it difficult to restore them in the short term. In addition, the number of students has doubled, making the capacity of each school even more insufficient. Mr. Chu also stated that the salaries of faculty and staff and the public expenses of students have been gradually increased. However, due to the impact of fluctuating prices, life is still difficult. The research funding has increased from the initial five hundred yuan to one million yuan. The highest amount for college and university professors has also been increased to six hundred yuan. The student public expense was originally a temporary wartime measure, and the Executive Yuan has decided to cancel it and replace it with scholarships, but the original public expense students will still be retained. In order to take care of poor students, the government has also established a relief fund to assist young students in bandit areas. Mr. Chu believes that the lack of books and instruments is also one of the causes of educational unrest. He stated that the equipment in each school is indeed too poor. Although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly requested foreign exchange to add equipment to each school, the number is still limited. During the war, the United States allocated part of its loan to our country for schools to purchase equipment. The purchased goods have been delivered one after another. In addition, the Ministry of Education has also raised two or three hundred thousand volumes of books in England and the United States. Although the content is not very good, it is better than nothing. Furthermore, the United Nations Educational Organization has distributed hundreds of boxes of books to our country, including several sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which will be shipped soon. The books that were taken away by the Japanese during the war have now been found and transported back. Mr. Chu then gave a general report on international cultural cooperation, relief for refugee students, and textbooks. He finally stated that since the beginning of this semester, the situation in each school has been unexpectedly stable. Recently, there has been slight unrest at Zhejiang University, which is still caused by the Communists. The Yu Zisan case has now been sentenced by the court and should be coming to an end. Mr. Chu emphasized that education must take a stable path, because education is a century-long plan. Educational unrest affects politics, and political unrest can also affect education.

### Northeastern Factories and Mines Will Be Armed for Protection

Sun Yuez-chi Flies to Comfort Employees

(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch on the 21st) Factories and mines of the National Resources Commission in the Northeast and North China will not be moved elsewhere. The National Resources Commission will also consult with the military headquarters to arm strategic resource outposts to maintain production. Sun Yuez-chi, the deputy director of the National Resources Commission, told reporters that the suppression of the rebellion is different from the period of the War of Resistance. Today, there is no clear and absolute front and rear. The government also does not have the financial resources to dismantle and relocate these factories and mines elsewhere. Moreover, with the scarcity of resources in Jiangnan, it is not suitable to use large-scale industrial and mining machinery from the Northeast and North China. Mr. Sun continued that the National Resources Commission has implemented a policy of stubborn production. For example, after the fall of the Zibo Coal Mine in Shandong, employees were transferred to Qingdao and Jinan to await orders. When the mine was recovered, the employees returned on foot. Although the Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei has been lost, there are no plans to dissolve the Jingxing organization and will remain on standby. In order to emphasize North China, the Central Committee has decided to allocate a batch of 1,400 tool parts from the Japanese reparations to the North. The Peiping office of the National Resources Commission has been ordered to prepare warehouses. Mr. Sun was very saddened that the Bolihe Cement Plant could not obtain limestone raw materials from Zhoukoudian, which is very close, due to security reasons. He emphasized that military economics should cooperate in combat. Before the employees of the Northeast factories and mines sent their families to Peiping during the fifth offensive of the Communist bandits, which caused them to worry about both places. Mr. Sun specially flew to Shenyang with Qian Changzhao on the 21st to comfort them.

If power and materials are not restricted, it is still hoped that it can produce 3,000 tons per day. After the sixth offensive of the bandits stopped, the Northeast's industrial and mining problems were serious, such as low coal production, inconvenient transportation, and reduced electricity, which were fatal injuries, which need to be resolved by Sun Yueqi and Qian Changzhao after they arrive in Shenyang. All units of the National Resources Commission in the Northeast have prepared the next batch of materials for research.

### Relief for Northeastern Farmers, Workers and Youths: Various Departments Have Organized Programs

(Central News Agency, Nanking, 21st) The Northeast Relief Association, headed by Madame Chiang, requested the Four Joint Offices, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education to organize agricultural loans, industrial loans, and distribute fertilizers, seeds, agricultural and industrial equipment, and establish university preparatory classes and temporary primary schools in order to provide relief for Northeastern farmers, workers and youths who have lost their schooling. It is reported that after receiving the association's request, the various agencies have organized programs within their respective jurisdictions. Regarding agricultural loans, the northeastern provinces have obtained agricultural loans of 6.4 billion yuan, 2 billion Northeast circulating notes, and 4.4 billion cotton loans, which are being loaned by the Cooperative Gold Standard and the Chinese Farmers Bank. Regarding industrial loans, the northeastern provinces have loaned out more than 40 billion circulating notes. The labor-for-relief portion is being reviewed by the Ministry of Social Affairs. Regarding seeds and fertilizers, they will be transported and released after the ban on the transportation of materials in North China is lifted. Regarding agricultural and industrial machinery, many sewing machines have been allocated to the Northeast, 268 tractors have been allocated, and fishing vessels and fishing gear will be allocated after negotiating the North China quota with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Regarding relief for out-of-school youths, the Ministry of Education is drafting the "Measures for the Reception of Refugee Youths in Bandit-Occupied Areas of Provinces and Cities in the Pacification Zone" and submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The portion concerning the Northeast will list public-funded student places, which will be handled by the Northeast Headquarters. The Northeast Relief Association has informed the Northeast Headquarters of the above items for consultation and implementation.

### Difficulties in Transporting Shaanxi Cotton Remain Numerous

Transportation Issues Difficult to Resolve

(Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 21st) The transportation of Shaanxi cotton is still facing numerous difficulties. The main problem is transportation. Air transport is not practically possible, and the Yu-Xi Highway cannot be repaired in the short term. The route from Xi'an via Hanzhong and down the Han River to the east has recently been blocked due to the Communist bandits disturbing the mountains. As for the route via the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway to Chongqing and then shipped out, not only is the route too long, but there are also limited vehicles. According to the person in charge of the Xi'an office of the China Textile Corporation, the office does not plan to purchase a large amount of Shaanxi cotton in the short term due to a lack of cash. More than 100,000 dan of cotton remain here waiting to be transported. Of the cotton that was transported out via the Longhai Railway three months ago, in addition to a portion lost in western Henan, most of it is still stranded in Xuzhou and has not yet been transported.

### Philippine Supreme Court Rules That Foreigners Cannot Own Land

Overseas Chinese Are Most Affected

(Central News Agency, Manila, 21st) The Philippine Supreme Court recently ruled by a vote of six to four that foreigners may not purchase land for residential use in the Philippines. According to the original provisions of the Philippine Constitution, foreigners may not purchase farmland or forests, but there is no explicit provision regarding ordinary land. However, the Ministry of Justice previously announced that foreigners who purchase ordinary land may register with the Land Registry, which is tantamount to acknowledging that foreigners have the right to purchase land. Today's ruling has made the Ministry of Justice's notification invalid. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court stated that the farmland and forests (public farmland) mentioned in the Constitution should also include "ordinary land for residential use." Foreigners have no right to purchase land at all. Foreigners in the Philippines are only residing temporarily. If they wish to reside permanently in the Philippines, they can obtain Philippine citizenship according to law and do not need to maintain their foreign status. The Supreme Court's ruling has greatly affected overseas Chinese. However, American nationals can still freely purchase all types of land in the Philippines and have the right to develop it due to the protection of the "Equal Rights" clause.

### In the Legal and Political Arena, A Matter of Life and Death, Blum Criticizes Party for Endangering Democracy, Demands Adoption of Centrist Path

[Report by this Newspaper] London, [Day] Broadcast: Paris Dispatch, French Socialist [Name] Blum attended the National Assembly at 3:00 PM today, in high spirits and with great confidence. He will demand a vote of confidence from the National Assembly. Blum immediately delivered a speech stating: International Communism has openly declared war on French democratic politics. He hopes to organize a new centrist government, unite all people in the country who love the republican system, prevent dictatorship from either the left or right wing, and form an "international third force" to stop the increasing division between Western countries and the Soviet Union around the world. Like some European countries, we do not want to join any camp, but only seek stability. France's task is to form this kind of international centrist force to reduce international misunderstandings and suspicions.

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st Dispatch] With more than 700,000 workers on strike nationwide, the situation in France is extremely tense. The world is now watching how 75-year-old Blum will lead France through this serious crisis. Blum began negotiations with key political leaders on the 21st, attempting to form a strong and acceptable government. Observers believe that Blum's chances of success and failure are equal. The government's call-up of 150,000 reservists on the 20th is seen as an expression of the government's determination to maintain law and order by force, and to strike at strikers by force if necessary. According to various reports, the government has learned that the Communist Party has mobilized party members across the country in preparation for possible actions on the weekend. This report has not been officially confirmed. However, the Communist Party has indeed distributed a number of inflammatory manuals to the public, calling for "unity and action" to bring the Communist Party to rule France, and calling for the "establishment of committees to defend the Republic, defend industry, agriculture, and national independence" in various places. The Communist Party referred to Blum as a "tool" of de Gaulle and "American imperialists."

According to evening newspapers, most members of the anti-communist faction of the Socialist Party are in favor of joining the cabinet, and the position of Deputy Prime Minister may be held by the faction's leader, Saragat. Communist leader Togliatti attacked the Prime Minister in the party's newspaper, treating him as Mussolini. According to him, although Gasperi is not leading Italy back to fascism, he is leading the country back to reactionism.

### Soviet Foreign Policy Reaches Decisive Stage Next Summer

Stettinius Calls on US to Maintain Strength

[United Press, St. Petersburg, Florida, 20th Dispatch] Republican presidential candidate Stettinius declared last night that after the Communist Party suffered setbacks in France and Italy, Soviet foreign policy will reach a decisive stage next summer. Whether the Kremlin attempts to rule by force or abandons war and aggression remains to be decided, but the prospect of peace is greater if the United States can ensure its military strength.

### Under the Communist Iron Heel, People Will Eventually Break Free from Chains, Hoover Discusses "Two Worlds"

[United Press, New York, 20th Dispatch] Former US President Hoover delivered a speech at the annual banquet of the Netherlands Society here tonight, stating that he cannot help but believe that the people under the communist iron heel will eventually break free from their chains. Repeated purges are sufficient proof of the unrest in the communist-controlled areas. The fifth column is active all over the world and must be constantly dealt with. The Soviet Union and communism are a huge shadow over the future of the world. We are now divided into two worlds, one maintaining atheism and wanting to enslave humanity, the other maintaining religious faith and advocating human freedom. The countries of the Western Hemisphere are showing that free enterprise is the only way to increase production. Today, only countries with free enterprise can avoid hunger and cold. Of all the materials shipped overseas to relieve Europe and Asia, 95% comes from the massive production of free enterprise countries. If the Western Hemisphere also followed the economic utopia of Eastern and Western Europe, I dare say that not a ton of wheat or a lump of coal would be shipped abroad.

### Soviet Union Encourages People to Migrate to the Arctic Circle

[United Press, Seattle, 20th Dispatch] Famous explorer and scientist Stevens declared today that the number of people colonized by the Soviet Union near the Arctic Ocean is many times greater than the white population of Alaska. The Soviet authorities plan to design and build several industrial cities there. One was completed during the war and now has 40,000 residents. The Soviet Union's expansion to the Arctic Circle is not kept secret, and is recorded in scientific journals. This colonization aims to build a self-sufficient society in order to absorb more people for migration, but it is also the best preparation for wartime.

### Ceylon Independence Bill Debated in British House of Commons Second Reading

[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] The House of Commons debated the second reading of the Ceylon Independence Bill today. Colonial Secretary Jones said that this bill is an important milestone in colonial history, allowing the people of Ceylon to enter the status of self-governing dominion and obtain full autonomy. This case also expresses the mutual trust and goodwill between Britain and the people of Ceylon. Jones also said that Britain has been trying to establish a sound economic foundation in various colonies for a hundred years, as the basis for the political system. In recent years, national ideas have flourished, and Britain has been guiding these ideas into constructive paths, helping them to take on greater responsibility for their own affairs.

### International Trade Conference Opens in Havana

Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia Do Not Send Representatives

[United Press, Cuban Capital, 21st Dispatch] The International Trade and Employment Conference opened here today to discuss the details of the charter of the International Trade Organization. To date, a total of about 600 representatives from 40 countries have registered, and there are many obstacles ahead. The US delegation, led by former Undersecretary of State Clayton, is expected to support the charter of the International Trade Organization drafted over the past year at meetings in London, New York, and Geneva, which is bound to be opposed by Argentina, Australia, India, and Switzerland. But according to Clayton's prediction, the conference is expected to succeed. Although the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have refused to participate, the 62 countries in attendance represent 90% to 95% of the world's trade.

### Bradley to Succeed as US Army Chief of Staff

### Marshall Arrives in London, Emphasizes Reiteration of Demand for Merger of Saar Region

[United Press, London, 21st Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall arrived here in London from Washington today to prepare for next week's Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Marshall reiterated that his position was not pessimistic, but did not make any other comments.

[United Press, Washington, 20th Dispatch] Marshall visited former Secretary of State Byrnes before his departure today, talking for about an hour and a half, which aroused speculation. This is because Byrnes had advocated that if the Soviet Union continued to obstruct the Foreign Ministers Conference from reaching an agreement, the Western countries should conclude a separate peace treaty with Germany. But whether Marshall agreed with this view was not made clear by himself or other officials. President Truman personally went to the airport to see him off, wishing him all the best on his trip.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that when Foreign Minister Bidault leaves for London next Monday to attend the Foreign Ministers Conference that begins on Tuesday, he will bring a four-point plan regarding Germany, namely: 1. Reorganize Germany on a federal basis; 2. Economic unification of Germany; 3. Genuine control of the Ruhr area; 4. The merger of Saar into the French economic system. The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the outside world is too pessimistic about this Foreign Ministers Conference, as the failure of this conference is not inevitable. France does not intend to sacrifice the absolute need for European security, and will therefore insist on the aforementioned four points. France will also propose the establishment of an expert committee to investigate how, after the completion of the reconstruction of Germany's economic unification, the extraction of reparations and the balancing of Germany's international balance of payments can be prevented from conflicting. France is firmly opposed to raising Germany's industrial level for the purpose of extracting reparations. In other words, France will never prioritize reparations over the security of Europe.

### Soviet Union Rejects US and British Protests Against Confiscation of Austrian Oil Factory

[United Press, London, 20th Dispatch] The Foreign Office announced today that the Soviet government has rejected protests from the United States and Britain against the Soviet Union's confiscation of the Lobau oil refinery and its equipment in Austria as reparations. The matter may be submitted to the Foreign Ministers Conference next week for discussion. The Lobau refinery is the largest in Austria and was jointly invested in by Britain and the United States. It was occupied by the German side after the German-Austrian merger in 1938, and was subsequently confiscated by the Soviet Union, which considered the oil field to be German-owned and treated it as German property.

### Sweden Does Not Intend to Request Any Assistance from the United States

Former Prime Minister Sandler Says

[Reuters, Los Angeles, 20th Dispatch] Former Swedish Prime Minister Sandler told more than 400 members of the Swedish General Association here that Sweden will not ask the United States for any special assistance. Although Sweden is suffering from a lack of US dollars, it should rely on its own efforts to solve its financial problems. According to Sandler, he is one of Sweden's representatives to the UN General Assembly.

### Soviet Union Sends Note to Iran Protesting Destruction of Oil Agreement

[United Press, Moscow, 21st Dispatch] The Soviet government has notified Iran that the cancellation of the 1946 oil agreement with the Soviet Union is an anti-Soviet action, and the Iranian government bears full responsibility for it. The note was presented to the Iranian government by Soviet Ambassador to Tehran Sakikov. Diplomatic circles in London believe that this matter "has a serious impact on the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which has little hope of success," and said that this is one of the Soviet Union's diplomatic pressures.

Truman said that he will submit Marshall's long-term aid plan for Europe to Congress within ten days. Regarding the criticism from Republicans that the President has not made full use of his power to control exports, the President said that he does not intend to be too harsh in that area, and does not feel there is reason to stop machinery from being shipped to the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet procurement committee is buying machinery in the United States to rebuild destroyed munitions factories and increase agricultural production.

### Egypt Demands Annexation of Former Italian Colonies in Africa

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Democratic Senator Magnuson told reporters today that while he supports President Truman's aid-to-Europe plan, measures should also be taken to prevent the spread of communism in the Far East.

[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] Republican Representative Wolcott told the New York Economic Club tonight that only one-third of the funds requested by the Paris Economic Conference and President Truman from the United States would be sufficient to complete the long-term recovery plan for Europe. Wolcott is the chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, which must approve any domestic economic controls recommended by the president as necessary adjuncts to foreign aid and American welfare. He stated that Congress would not allocate huge sums for temporary relief or long-term European recovery unless the funds are used according to "sound policies."

### Next Year's UN General Assembly to Be Held in Europe

[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] The United Nations General Assembly recently approved the UN budget by a vote of 37 to 0, including $1,047,875 to support holding the General Assembly outside the United States, thus ensuring a meeting in Europe. Ten countries abstained, including China, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Syria, and six Slavic nations. British Foreign Office Minister McNeil declared that he would no longer insist on a two-thirds majority vote but still opposed the excessive size of the budget; China also adopted the same position. Due to the change in attitude of China and the United Kingdom, the budget was passed. After consultation with Secretary-General Lie, the nine-nation committee will select a venue for the conference in Europe, possibly Paris or Geneva.  The joint proposal by Brazil, Belgium, Cuba, and Denmark was rejected as it failed to secure a majority vote with 31 in favor, 19 against, and six abstentions.

### Austrian Currency Reform

[Reuters, Vienna, 21st] The Austrian government's anti-inflation law, which stipulates that three schilling banknotes (old currency) be exchanged for one schilling banknote (new currency), has sparked protests from trade unions across the country, especially in the southern provinces. The Communist Central Committee has ordered its members to unite and resist this act of robbing the people. Strikes and protest rallies have been occurring in various places, especially in factories controlled by the Russians. It is said that the Soviet authorities allow personnel in the enterprises they control to fully redeem their old schilling banknotes for new ones. The Ministry of Interior today ordered that shops which close down to avoid selling goods will never be allowed to reopen or will be fined 50,000 schillings, and people who refuse to accept schillings will be sentenced to five years in prison or fined 500,000 schillings.

### New Partition Plan for Palestine: British Statement Refuses to Accept, Opposes Gradual Transfer of Power

[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] The British government today rejected the proposal by the United Nations General Assembly's Palestine Committee's subcommittee on partition to entrust the administration of Palestine to a United Nations committee during the transition period. British representative Cadogan told the Palestine Committee that since Britain still holds the mandate during the transition period, the British government would not allow a dual authority in Palestine. Even under normal, stable political conditions, the duplication of political mechanisms would be a dangerous phenomenon, and in Palestine, it would obviously have serious consequences.

Therefore, the British government must solemnly declare that for as long as Britain continues to hold the mandate, the British government will insist on exercising indivisible control in Palestine. Cadogan further stated that the British government could not wait for the Security Council to revoke its mandate in Palestine. The British government could not accept the subcommittee's recommendation for a gradual transfer of power from the mandatory authority to a provisional government committee, and the Palestinian authorities would not allow any activities within their control areas that could incite unrest. Cadogan also stated the extent to which Britain is prepared to participate in the implementation of a settlement acceptable to both Jewish and Arab parties, which had been detailed by British Colonial Secretary Jones. After Cadogan finished speaking, the members of the partition subcommittee on the committee were shocked because Cadogan's statement had clearly overturned several important plans proposed by the partition subcommittee. The chairman of the partition subcommittee, Poland's Pruszyński, immediately suggested adjourning the meeting so that each representative could consult their respective governments, and it was decided to resume the meeting next Monday afternoon.

### South Africa and India Dispute: UN General Assembly Rejects Indian Proposal

### Japanese Military Intelligence Chief Defends Anti-Comintern Pact

Wakamatsu denied that the Anti-Comintern Pact was intended to launch wars against China or any other country.

### All-Out Brawl in Japanese House of Representatives; Coal Mine Nationalization Bill Passed Despite Unresolved Disputes Within Industry and Mining Committee

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st]  The plenary session of the Japanese House of Representatives today was extremely tense due to the vote on the coal mine nationalization bill, with all members of both the ruling party and the opposition party in attendance. The opposition party suddenly disregarded the rules of the Diet's opening time, rushing to enter the venue in order to control advantageous seats and pre-emptively set up positions, causing great disorder. As a result, the Liberal Party was not allowed to vote. The vote tally was 170 in favor and 72 against. The Liberal Party protested against the unfair treatment.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 21st]  Members of the Japanese House of Representatives engaged in a fistfight on the floor for forty minutes yesterday, with members of the government party, the Communist Party, the opposition, and parliamentary guards joining in, but no injuries were reported. Initially, some members claimed that there was not a sufficient quorum and refused to start the meeting. Speaker Komakichi Matsuoka checked the number of attendees, announced that there was a quorum, and ordered the full text of the coal mining bill to be read, which caused the commotion, followed by fistfights. After forty minutes, leaders of each party ordered those involved to retreat to the sidelines.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st]  After the adjournment of the House Industry and Mining Committee on the 21st, the 16 opposition committee members convened again and proposed a motion of no confidence against Committee Chairman Ushiro Ito, which was passed. Those who supported the motion based their arguments on the Diet Law, which stipulates that the committee chairman has the right to convene and adjourn meetings, and did not recognize the committee resolution after Ito announced the adjournment. The Cabinet Secretariat has not yet issued any opinion.

### National Assembly Election Day One: Approximately 5-600,000 Votes Cast, Voting Order Mostly Good Throughout the City

### Mayor Votes to Elect Speaker

[Reported by this newspaper] At 8:20 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu personally went to the fourth polling station in Changshu District (Zhaoguang Middle School) to vote for Speaker Pan Gongzhan as a National Assembly representative.

[Reported by this newspaper] At 8 AM yesterday morning, whistles blared from factories throughout the city, marking the start of the first National Assembly representative election in our nation's history. Voting took place in 260 polling stations. Citizens were able to maintain calm and vote in accordance with the law, without affecting their daily lives. The candidates continued to work hard to win votes at this critical time, with campaign vehicles speeding along the streets and elaborately printed materials being distributed in large quantities, forming a prominent sight during the election. The starting times varied at the various polling stations. Areas with high population density had people voting continuously from 8 AM onwards, while locations that were more secluded remained deserted until after 9 AM. By 7 PM last night, the election office had received reports from various locations, indicating that voter participation was more enthusiastic in the suburbs, with the Longhua District having over 20,000 voters. Voter turnout in the city was not as high as expected. The likely reason is that yesterday was not a holiday, and most citizens were at the office and did not have time to vote. Voter numbers may increase significantly in the next two days. According to relevant personnel who inspected the voting areas at around 4 PM yesterday, the highest number of votes cast at a polling station was 4,000, and the lowest was 1,000. It is estimated that voters accounted for about 20% of the total electorate, which is about 5-600,000 people. There was considerable security at each polling station, and the order was generally well maintained throughout the day, except for minor disputes in a few areas.

At 10:20 AM yesterday morning, Speaker Pan and his wife, Ms. Guang Guanyu, went to the seventh polling station in Jing'an District at the Central Photographic Factory on Haige Road to vote. After presenting his electoral right certificate, the administrator verified that he should vote at the sixth polling station on Guba Road. Mr. Pan then went to the sixth polling station with his wife, stamped and obtained ballots, and completed the voting process at 10:35 AM. On the ballots, Mr. Pan and his wife personally wrote "Jin Zhenyu".

### District Residents Request Supplementary Election Certificates; Teacher Found with Blank Ballots

During yesterday's election, order problems occurred in the following locations: Around 9:30 AM, over 300 voters who had not received their electoral right certificates surrounded the district office in the 17th District of North Sichuan Road, requesting supplementary certificates. The district office staff then came forward to negotiate, and representatives from the voters, Fu Changqing and Sun Wenbing, explained the reasons, stating that the 20th Bao, 8th Bao, 14th Bao, and 16th Bao of the district had not fully issued the certificates. The Baojia heads had not notified residents to pick up their certificates in advance, and when residents went to pick up the certificates, those with lower levels of education often could not get them. They requested clarification on the actual situation of the certificate issuance and the reissue of electoral right certificates. Around 11 AM, Deputy District Head Qiu Xisheng came to the district office and explained the various difficulties caused by the lack of enthusiasm among voters in picking up their certificates, and promised to forward the voters' representatives' opinions to the Civil Affairs Bureau. This matter was resolved in the afternoon, with voters bringing their national ID cards to obtain supplementary electoral right certificates. At the fifth polling station in North Station, at 11 AM, a child of only 12 or 13 years old suddenly broke in, loudly supporting Gu Jinzao as a National Assembly representative. The police ordered him to leave for disrupting order. At this time, a teacher surnamed Lou from Tianwen Elementary School in Hongkou intervened in the police's actions. The police, suspicious of his behavior, questioned and searched him, and found as many as 72 blank ballots on him, which he had obtained from the students' families. Because he violated the election regulations, he has been sent to the police station for investigation. At the fourth polling station in Xin Jing, at 3:30 PM, voting was temporarily suspended for half an hour due to poor order, and resumed at 4 PM.

### Civil Affairs Bureau Explains Electoral Right Certificate Issues

In other polling stations, there were also instances of voters disputing with Bao secretaries because they could not obtain their electoral right certificates. Voters accused the Bao of deliberately not issuing electoral right certificates, while Bao secretaries said that voters often did not bring their personal seals to the Bao office to pick up the certificates, and the Bao office only had one secretary, who could not deliver electoral right certificates to hundreds of households in the Bao. However, according to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the election is divided into regional and occupational categories. If the household registration of a regional Bao belongs to people in the industrial, commercial, educational, and freelance professions, their electoral right certificates should be obtained from the respective organizations. The district Bao should first exclude these to avoid the malpractice of double voting. As for households that have moved in for less than six months, have not registered with the Baojia, or have not obtained ID cards, they will naturally not be able to fill out and issue electoral right certificates. This is also one of the reasons why the number of electoral right certificates issued by each Baojia is relatively small.

### Speaker Pan Hopes City Government Will Issue a Proclamation: Agencies, Factories, and Schools to Have Half-Day Holiday Today, Several Reasons for Citizen Apathy Towards Elections

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday's voting situation was generally in good order, but both Chinese and foreign observers felt that citizens seemed somewhat indifferent to the election. One reason may be that this is the first nationwide general election in China's history, and people are not yet accustomed to it. Another reason may be that life is difficult after the war, and prices are high, so people are busy dealing with daily necessities and have little political interest. Moreover, the election period originally lasted three days. Yesterday was the first day, and there was no holiday, so most citizens with jobs found it difficult to find time to vote. It is expected that today, Saturday afternoon, and tomorrow morning, Sunday, may see more enthusiastic participation. It is rumored that Speaker Pan will suggest to Mayor Wu that a proclamation be issued this afternoon, Saturday, to grant a half-day holiday to all agencies, schools, and factories to facilitate voters casting their ballots (as democratic advanced countries usually have holidays during elections), and that the voting deadline for tomorrow (23rd), Sunday, be extended to 6 PM. It is unknown whether the mayor will approve this.

### Voting Through Open and Legal Procedures Is the Glory of Shanghai Citizens: Speaker's Broadcast Speech at the City Council Radio Station

[Reported by this newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan rushed back to the city from Beijing yesterday morning to participate in the vote. At 10:30 AM, Mr. Pan and his wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, went to the polling station at the Fumin Road Guba Apartment to vote. He then went to the City Council Radio Station to broadcast a speech, stating: "Fellow citizens: Today is the day when the Chinese people exercise their electoral rights as masters of the country. Not only is Shanghai holding the election today, but it is also being held enthusiastically throughout the country. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country, attracting international attention. I hope that Shanghai citizens will make a wonderful showing in this election. I would like to explain three points to all fellow citizens:

I hope everyone will vote in person. All citizens of this city who are 20 years of age or older, who have resided in this city for more than six months, and who have obtained household registration have the right to vote. Everyone should use their electoral right certificates to go to the designated polling stations at any time during these three days, from today to noon on the 23rd. Do not give up or avoid it. Because voting is the right of the master of the country, but it is also our responsibility. Assuming that there are two million voters in Shanghai, except for those who cannot vote due to illness or other unavoidable circumstances, I hope that everyone can personally cast the vote to which they are entitled.

The method should be absolutely free. During these three days, the method by which voters vote should be absolutely free, open, and legal. In other words, voting under free, open, and legal procedures is the glory of Shanghai citizens. We do not want to see anything happen that exceeds the scope of the law, and we do not want to hear of anyone using threatening means to hold our voters hostage or deprive voters of their right to vote. We want to encourage all candidates to use open, aboveboard methods and legal means to campaign and win the trust of citizens. If a voter cannot write, as long as you report the name of the person you want to elect, you can ask someone to write it for you; If the scribe refuses to write it for you, or persuades you to give up, or does not write it according to your wishes, this is not allowed.

Never Give Up Your Rights. For the election, I hope that Shanghai can reap good results under the open competition of various parties and social elites, with excellent National Assembly representatives that include all aspects, who can speak for the people, supervise the government on behalf of the people, protect the constitution, and elect an ideal president, so that all future measures of the government can truly embark on the road of democracy. The country must embark on the road of democracy in this new trend, starting from the local grassroots, to become a modern country and permanently maintain its honor. We hope that politics will be clear, the people will be happy, and the country will be prosperous and peaceful. Everyone must pay attention to this election and never give up their rights! I rushed back to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning for the purpose of casting my own vote. Because this is a very serious matter, if everyone thinks that missing his/her vote does not matter, then the polling stations will be deserted, the results of the election will certainly not be satisfactory, and it will also indicate that citizens are not enthusiastic about national affairs and are not qualified to be masters of the country. Isn't this a very shameful thing? So everyone must understand that the right to vote is as precious as one's life and property."

Brief Speech at the Hukwang Theater. After Mr. Pan's speech, he received a phone call from a citizen in Songshan District asking about the situation of not receiving the electoral right certificate, and he explained it on the radio station.

It is also learned that Mr. Pan gave a five-minute public speech to the audience at the Hukwang Theater at 4:30 PM yesterday to encourage citizens to vote enthusiastically. It was originally scheduled for him to give a speech at the Golden Grand Theater at 9 PM yesterday evening, but it was canceled due to other important business.

### Unified Allocation of Gasoline, Decision to Form a Review Committee

[Reported by this newspaper] In this city, in addition to the rational allocation of gasoline for automobile use being the responsibility of the Public Utilities Bureau, there has been no competent authority to rationally allocate gasoline for industrial use or other purposes. In view of the need for gasoline among citizens and the difficulty in applying for it, Mayor Wu has decided to establish the Shanghai Gasoline Review Committee in the shortest possible time, with representatives from relevant agencies serving as committee members. In addition to overseeing gasoline for heavy use, agencies in need can submit applications to the committee, which will be handled fairly after review by the committee. It is learned that Mayor Wu has telephoned Zhang Jiaao, the president of the Central Bank, to discuss everything. In the future, the city's gasoline will be handled by the committee in a unified manner.

### New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone to Be Implemented Today

[Reported by this newspaper] The price adjustments for the four major public utilities in this city, namely tap water, electricity, gas, and telephone, have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be implemented from today. The new prices are listed below:

Tap Water: 5,200 yuan per cubic meter for the British and French companies. 6,280 yuan per cubic meter for the Mainland, Zhabei, and Pudong companies.

Electricity: 4,650 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the Shanghai and Huxi power companies. 5,725 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the French Electricity Company. 5,980 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. 5,975 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the Chinese and Pudong power companies.

Gas: 13,725 yuan per 100 cubic feet.

Telephone: 1,400 yuan per call for up to 200 calls. 2,400 yuan per call for 201 to 400 calls. 3,400 yuan per call for over 400 calls. 3,000 yuan per call for public telephones.

The above rates will be implemented from meter readings on November 22nd. The City Government hopes that this rate adjustment will be maintained until the end of this year. The impact on trams, buses, ferries, etc. is small and will not be adjusted.

### Lighting Candles, Writing Ballots; Professional Groups Enthusiastic About Electing National Assembly Representatives

[Reported by this newspaper] The election of National Assembly representatives from professional groups proceeded very enthusiastically yesterday. Due to the sound organization of the various groups, the atmosphere during the voting was enthusiastic and the order was well-maintained. Except for a portion of the workers in the labor unions, the rest were able to write their own ballots. The situation at the various polling stations varied slightly due to the different number of voters. Among the various freelance professions, the Chinese Physicians Association only had over 1,800 eligible voters, so the third polling station at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association was particularly deserted yesterday. The pharmacists' (students') association only had three candidates, Shi Zhifu, Chen Pu, and others, so the voting situation was very calm. As the lawyers' association had a more uniform level of education, the order at the second polling station on Gongbo South Road was excellent. As for the women's group elections, at the first polling station for national women's groups at the Yuyuan Road Yuyuan Cafe, a total of four groups participated in the election, including the Chinese Women's Political Research Association, the Women's Welfare Mutual Aid Society, the Women's Gongming Society, and the Women's Home Economics Research Association. By last night, over 10,000 voters had completed their voting. Local women's groups such as the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association and the Shanghai Women's Association had over 4,000 people participating in the voting at the Changshu District Office on Baojian Road yesterday.

### Half an Hour of Gunfire in Western Shanghai – Major Melee – One Thief Killed – Mr. 馬伯樂 Fortunately Suffers No Loss – Family Greatly Frightened

[Report from this Newspaper] At approximately 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon, at the garden villa located at 150 Fanyu Road in Western Shanghai, the home of Mr. 馬伯樂, manager of the Palm Olive Soap Factory, eight or nine bandits suddenly arrived. Several bandits stood guard outside the gate, while the rest entered the house, first closing the iron gate, then binding the masters and servants with ropes, forbidding them from making any noise. At that moment, a patrol team from the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau passed by and noticed several individuals standing outside the gate who clearly were not of good character. They went forward to investigate, but the individuals immediately opened fire, resisting arrest. The patrol police also drew their weapons and returned fire, while simultaneously telephoning the sub-bureau to report the situation. Sub-Bureau Chief Shao Yuanbin personally led Section Chief Shi Jieren, officers Wei Jinquan, Gu Kunqi, and a large number of uniformed police and volunteer police in police vehicles, rushing to surround and capture the bandits. The bandits, positioned inside, fired downwards from a high vantage point using both automatic and semi-automatic rifles, spraying bullets like beads. Chief Shao immediately ordered his officers to scatter and return fire from a distance. The two sides fought for about half an hour, exchanging more than fifty shots. As a result, one bandit, approximately thirty years old and dressed in work clothes, was struck twice in the back of the head and fell dead on the ground. A semi-automatic rifle and one bullet were found next to him. The remaining bandits all escaped through the back door. The corpse of the dead bandit was later transported to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, then transferred to the coroner's office for examination. Afterwards, police officers recovered six or seven 8-inch Mauser bullets in the vicinity, which were taken back to the bureau and filed. As for the 馬伯樂 residence, they were fortunate to not have any property stolen, but the fright they experienced was beyond description.

He had been sentenced to ten years imprisonment for corruption. When asked why he was requesting a retrial after having twice previously petitioned for appeal and been rejected by the High Court, Yu replied, "Because new evidence has now been discovered." Attorney Lu, Yu's defense lawyer, stood up and stated that the High Court's previous rejection was due to the prison's delay in delivering the notification, so when the notification was delivered, the petition for retrial had already been submitted to the High Court.

### "Black Goods" in Guizhou: 158 Drug Traffickers Apprehended in Two Months

[Report from Our Correspondent in Guiyang, 12th] When I was in Sichuan, I heard of Guizhou's "Sour Smoke." After arriving in Guiyang for two months, I still haven't figured out what "Sour Smoke" is, as there are conflicting accounts. During the War of Resistance, "Ding Goods" were quite famous in Guiyang. I know what "Ding Goods" are, but I'm afraid I can't speak about them. In short, during the War of Resistance, when the nation and its people suffered so much, drug prohibition cases were handed over to military tribunals, and people were routinely imprisoned, shot, or beheaded. Yet, people in Guizhou still dared to bet their lives on smoking, transporting, selling, and growing opium. Now that victory has been achieved and drug prohibition cases are being transferred to the courts, which the gentlemen praise as "release ponds," in this glorious age, if people don't indulge in smoking, transporting, selling, and growing opium, then those so-called gentlemen under that "B" will laugh at them as the biggest fools!

### Purchasing Rotten Soil for Medicine

Don't tell me that Guizhou isn't implementing drug prohibition? That's not true. Our Republic of China started implementing drug prohibition as early as 1840, when it was still the "Great Qing Empire." One hundred and six years of drug prohibition history is certainly not short, and the immense losses suffered due to drug prohibition are certainly not small. Unfortunately, those who prohibited did so while those who smoked continued to smoke. The prohibitions didn't apply to officials, only to the common people. The aim was to make money, and prohibition was just a means. Otherwise, why was there talk of "Ding Goods" during the War of Resistance? Why did a provincial assemblyman question the government in March about why it was purchasing five or six hundred taels of opium-containing soil at the official price and selling it to private individuals to make medicine!

Let's rely on official reports. At the provincial assembly meeting held in March, the provincial chairman's policy report discussed the eradication of drug use, stating: "Our province has strictly investigated and suppressed opium seedlings in recent years. The area of clandestine cultivation by rogue elements has decreased year by year. Last year, to advance the eradication of drug use, we drafted the 'Plan for Eradicating Drug Use' and issued a notice for its implementation. In September of last year, we strictly ordered all commissioners and county chiefs to thoroughly investigate, and in November we sent drug prohibition supervisors to various districts and counties to jointly conduct on-site inspections." What were the results? "Except for a very small number of remote areas in Anlong, Yanhe, Changshun, Ceheng, and Bijie counties, where clandestine cultivation existed, which were immediately destroyed, no opium seedlings were found in any other counties." This is Guizhou Province's plan for prohibiting cultivation and its implementation.

### Overview of Drug Transport and Opium Dens

The report went on to discuss the transport and sale of drugs and the establishment of opium dens: "The transport and sale of drugs and the establishment of opium dens are still being strictly investigated and suppressed by county and municipal governments and police agencies in conjunction with military police." What were the results? "From January to December of the 35th year of the Republic, a total of 5,481 taels of raw opium, 6 taels and 1 qian of opium paste, 137 taels and 1 qian of opium ash, and 1,378 taels and 5 qian of fake opium were seized (excluding the 424 catties of opium seized from Yu Zixun and others by the Guiyang Municipal Police Bureau). Also, on the '63' Drug Prohibition Day in the 35th year, various agencies burned a total of 291 opium pipes, 317 opium lamps, and 2,708 other items." Chairman Yang is a believer who "doesn't smoke or drink." He is a straightforward person with a military style. During his three years in Guizhou, he often used the phrase, "This matter is worth fighting for, I must do it!" for any policy that he considered essential to implement. He has hated opium since he was a child. Whether in the military or in politics, he has always been an enemy of opium. However, today's Guizhou is still awash in a black tide, showing that drug prohibition is not easy to thoroughly implement.

### Main Causes of the Black Tide

According to the reporter's investigation and inquiries, the main reasons are as follows:

The profits from drugs are greater than any other business except kidnapping. Lawless profiteers are willing to risk their lives and refuse to sever ties with opium. Since the victory, drug cases have been transferred from military tribunals to the courts. The courts require evidence and legal provisions for everything, and those involved with opium generally believe that they now have a way out.

Although the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Use" promulgated by the government during the War of Resistance were vigorously enforced, after the victory, the government may have felt that the penalties in the original regulations were too lenient, and therefore explicitly abolished them. However, the newly drafted regulations were not promulgated at the same time as the abolition, leading the ignorant people and veteran drug users to mistakenly believe that the government had abandoned drug prohibition. Otherwise, why would the "Punishment" regulations be abolished!

The subsequent "Regulations for Punishing Drug Use" set the maximum fine at 10,000 yuan, leading the ignorant people and veteran drug users who were unaware that violating drug prohibition could result in both imprisonment and fines to mistakenly believe that as long as they paid the maximum fine of 10,000 yuan, they could continue to smoke and forget their worries.

Guizhou has a long history with opium. In addition, neighboring provinces such as Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan are also very interested in opium. Not only is the supply endless, but they also compete with each other to grow opium in areas where their borders intersect, never showing weakness. Years of tradition have fostered the belief that "it's not illegal." In every area, there are always some people with special power who see themselves as being above the law and can smoke, transport, sell, and grow opium at will. The government is hesitant to be too thorough for fear of causing a greater disturbance, so drug use flourishes and there are more and more imitators. Is the difficulty of prohibiting, eliminating, and promoting drug prohibition unique to Guizhou?

### The Vast Opium Gang

The main route for transporting opium into Guizhou is from Yunnan. Opium from Yunnan is generally called "Southern Soil." It is said that its potency is second only to India's "Old Man's Head." The second source is southwestern Guizhou, the eight counties of Panjiang, including Xingren and Xingyi, as well as Anlong, Xingshi, and Wangmo. It is said that Xingyi County was formerly known as "Huangcaoba." The opium produced in that area is generally called "Ba Soil," which is of course far inferior to "Southern Soil" in color, aroma, and taste. Whether it is "Southern Soil" or "Ba Soil," it generally comes to Guiyang along the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway and then is distributed from Guiyang to Xiangxi in the east and eastern Sichuan in the north. Along this route, people traveling by car or on foot, passing through checkpoints, are truly numerous and the business is booming. To be honest, in the Yunnan and western Guizhou areas, it is said that it is not uncommon for households to secretly store several dan of opium.

### More Than Double the Profit

The current market price of "Southern Soil" in Kunming is "only" around 300,000 yuan per tael, and the goods are genuine and the weight is accurate. For large customers, the seller can even arrange for it to be smuggled out of the country. As soon as it arrives in Guiyang, "Southern Soil" can more than double in price (the market price in Guiyang is around 700,000 yuan per tael). It is small in size, has no odor, and is very convenient to carry. Therefore, the "Joint Inspection Station for Suppressing Drug Use" at the Sanqiao Station outside Guiyang's southern suburbs has been strictly investigating since it began operating on August 23rd. In just two months, from August 23rd to October 23rd, they have continuously apprehended 158 male and female drug traffickers and seized 317 catties and 258 taels and 5 qian of opium. It is said that Zhijiang in Hunan recently seized a batch of opium coming from Guiyang that weighed over 800 catties! What an astonishingly large number!

These male and female drug traffickers are becoming increasingly inventive in their smuggling techniques. The common method of openly and boldly walking through the checkpoint with drugs in their pockets is mostly done by men who appear to be soldiers but aren't.

### Women Smuggle on Horseback

As for the women, they often use the method of "smuggling on horseback," concealing drugs in their menstrual belts and trying to pass through the checkpoint. Some wrap the opium in oilskin and place it in seemingly unimportant baskets or in children's clothes or diapers. For large-scale smuggling, they inevitably hide it in tires, seats, roofs, oil drums, or double-layered suitcases. Some take advantage of not being inspected and safely transport large quantities of opium to their destination. There are also many female drug traffickers who dress luxuriously and elegantly, as if they were noble ladies or daughters of wealthy families. They use this attire as camouflage and use various clever tricks and agile skills to carry large quantities of opium past the inspection net. They are so elusive and unpredictable that inspectors are deceived or feel overwhelmed and let them pass.

Sacrificing husbands for wealth is a classic warning. In recent years, Guizhou Province authorities have executed many drug traffickers, and there are countless drug traffickers currently imprisoned throughout the province. However, where there is profit, people will flock to it. These days, life is difficult, and too many people have a gambler's mentality. Unless the problem is solved by fundamentally improving politics, promoting economic prosperity, and ensuring equitable distribution, the "Drug Prohibition Year" will be seen as just another stage in the drug prohibition campaign!

### Unemployed Soldier Suffering from Mental Illness Unauthorizedly Started a Train at the Meichi Station; Shou Honghan Transferred to the Hangzhou District Procuratorate for Interrogation

[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 20th] On the afternoon of the 17th, when a Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway passenger train arrived from Shangrao to Hangzhou and the driver got off to rest at Meichi Station, a man named Shou Honghan suddenly broke into the engine room and started the machine, driving the train directly north. There were more than five hundred passengers in each carriage, and the order was in chaos for a while. The personnel in the station were also very frightened. They urgently notified the police department to raise the red warning flag light at Xingshan Station, but it was also ineffective. Fortunately, there was no branching or oncoming traffic on that section of the railway, so a major disaster was avoided. Later, the passenger train stopped half a kilometer away from Linpu Station. The police department then pursued, captured, and detained Shou, and transferred him to the Hangzhou District Procuratorate for interrogation on the 19th. According to his confession, he is an unemployed soldier and seems to be suffering from mental illness. Whether Shou's actions have any other purpose is still under investigation by the relevant authorities.

### Tiger-Fighting Hero Delves Deep into the Tiger's Lair; Eradicates Tiger Plague Single-Handedly in the Mountains of Shunchang for Fifty Days

[Report from our Fuzhou Office, 15th] Tigers in Shunchang, Fujian, devour people, causing great suffering, as reported earlier by Yang Yangyi, a technician from the Provincial Research Institute who went to eliminate them. Now, Mr. Yang has returned to Rong from Chang, talking freely about his tiger-fighting experience, which is extremely terrifying and dangerous, just like a newly compiled "Tiger-Fighting Biography." The details are described truthfully as follows. In the past half year, the entire county of Shunchang has been in the terror of the tiger plague. Not only are the four rural villages alarmed, but even the county seat may be attacked at any time. Villagers who go up the mountain to cut trees have become innocent souls under the tiger's paws. The tigers can cross mountains and ridges, moving from here to there, and tiger tracks can be found in all the villages, leading to frequent bad news, and the whole county is in panic all day long. Therefore, a large sum of money was offered to recruit a tiger-fighting hero from Rong. Mr. Yang bravely responded to the recruitment, carrying a hunting gun and a dog, and a hunting lamp, which can be described as

### Single-Handed and with a Dog

delving deep into the tiger's lair. Mr. Yang arrived in the county on June 19th and was led by a county man to Yuankeng Township, the central area of the tiger plague. The next morning, he set off to look for tigers. He found traces of tigers eating people in the deep mountains and forests, with a fishy smell that was overwhelming. After careful inspection, there were scattered human bones and remaining muscles and intestines scattered among the grass, the state was extremely tragic. Relying on the dog's sense of smell and alertness, he scouted the tracks of the evil beast along the mountain, but without results. After that, he went deep into the high mountains and ridges every day, crawling forward among the rugged rocks and thorny bushes. The thrilling scenes are no less than the scenes in "Tarzan." In order to urgently eliminate the scourge, he often waited until dawn. For fifty days, because of the

### Constant Exposure to the Elements

he was rained on day and night, and suffered from the attacks of wild mosquitoes at night, lacking sleep and having difficulty eating. Mr. Yang suffered from malaria, but he still struggled to persevere, hoping to meet the tiger day and night, as if he had put his own life and death out of his mind. Until August 8th, on a hot day, Mr. Yang was feeling weak and tired due to the recent recovery from malaria, and was feeling depressed and annoyed when he suddenly received a notice from the Zhengfang Township Office near Yuankeng Township, saying that a woodcutter had been devoured on Daming Mountain in that township, urging him to go immediately. Mr. Yang was overjoyed and immediately took his gun and dog, and led by eight woodcutters, set off towards the destination. The mountains were steep and dangerous along the way, and the forest was deep and lush. The woodcutters dared not go with him. Mr. Yang pressed his gun and urged the dog to move forward quickly. Before he had gone a hundred meters, he found bright red bloodstains on the ground, and immediately

### Followed the Bloodstains

for no more than sixty meters, and indeed found a corpse mixed with limbs under a fir tree. The skin and flesh from the legs to the knees and from the neck to the head had all been eaten away, and the clothes were torn to pieces. The eyes of the dead still revealed a look of extreme shock. Wild flies were greedily sucking the fishy blood. Against the backdrop of this deep forest and dim light, it was an indescribable scene of terror in the world. At this time, Mr. Yang thought that the tiger must not have gone far, so he ordered his dog to return to Yuankeng Township quickly. He immediately climbed to the top of a tree, held his breath and waited quietly. Before long, the setting sun was sinking in the west, but he still did not see any trace of the evil beast. At this time, Mr. Yang's stomach

### Growled on the High Ridge

and he took out the dry food he had brought to fill his stomach. As soon as he finished eating, he suddenly heard the sound of a

### Roaring Tiger on the High Ridge.

The sound was sharp and loud, like a horse neighing, and the valleys trembled. Mr. Yang quickly gripped his gun, ready to fire. In a moment, this fierce tiger, whose sins against humanity were obvious, came staggering through the gaps in the trees. There was a loud bang, and a bullet left the muzzle and went straight into the tiger's chest. He fired two more shots, and the tiger finally lay stiff in a pool of blood, its evil life ended. Mr. Yang then fired a shot into the air to signal for help. Unfortunately, none of the villagers nearby understood the hunter's signal, so he had to hurry down the mountain and call six villagers to come and carry the tiger. As soon as this news came out, it spread throughout the county, and the people were encouraged.

### The Families of the Deceased

were greatly relieved that their great revenge had been avenged. The next day, the tiger's corpse was carried to the county seat, and civil servants and the public from all agencies rushed to see it. The local Shangyang newspaper issued an extra, and the heads of the various agencies raised their glasses in celebration, and the public performed plays to celebrate. The enthusiasm was unprecedented in a century. In order to commemorate Mr. Yang's great achievements, people in the county cast gold medals, planned to build a monument, and reported his deeds in the county chronicles.

Five bullets were found in the team leader's body, all flowing through vital points, and he died of excessive bleeding at one o'clock.

### More than Three Thousand Teachers and Students of Fudan University Pay Their Respects to the Remains of Li Denghui; Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi Both Gave Speeches; Announcement of the Funeral Arrangements, Extremely Solemn

[Report from our Office] The remains of Dr. Li Denghui, former president of Fudan University, were placed in a coffin yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Wanguo Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road, according to Christian rites. The coffin is scheduled to be buried at 3:00 PM this afternoon at the Presbyterian Cemetery on Bazibridge. Yesterday, the hall was filled with wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by people from all walks of life. The remains of the doctor were covered with the Fudan school badge made of silk with a blue background and yellow characters, and the remains were exposed. Celebrities and educators from all walks of life at home and abroad, Shao Lizi, Wang Xianhui, Yan Huiqing, Li Zhaohuan, Qian Xinzhi, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Duanmu Shi, Cheng Zhongxing, Hu Jianzhong, Ou Yuanhuai, Situ Bo, Xu Yuqing, Lin Zhuoran, and more than three thousand teachers, students, and alumni from Fudan University, the affiliated high school, and the experimental middle school, paid their respects to the remains from morning to night, extremely solemn. The current president of Fudan, Zhang Yi, the former president, Wu Suixuan, the dean of the Faculty of Arts, Wu, the director of the Journalism Department, Chen Wangdao, and others were on hand all day to greet them. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the pastors, including Xie Songgao, presided over prayers and blessings for Li. Then, Dr. Yan Huiqing reported a brief history of Li. Dr. Yan, in his capacity as someone who "knew Li early and had a deep friendship," said sadly, "I believe that a grand memorial service will be held soon, and a report will be made on the life and deeds of Mr. Tengfei. Today, I will briefly mention a few points." Li was born as an overseas Chinese. China was subjected to foreign aggression, and Li was deeply saddened. In his childhood, he made up his mind to return to the motherland and engage in education, in order to awaken his compatriots and strive for self-improvement. He then went to study in the United States. After returning to China, he discussed with Zeng (Guofan) and Li (Hongzhang) and decided to establish a university in the country, in order to train a large number of talents. Later, Li and others joined the Chinese Christian Youth Association. Li later founded the Chinese Global Student Association, in order to awaken the patriotic thoughts of young people. These two points alone show Li's determination to establish a university in China." Dr. Yan praised Li as one of the few students who have returned from studying abroad in the past few decades with the highest moral and academic achievements. Yan also said, "Among the university presidents in China, Cai Jiemin, the president of Peking University, Shang Fangji, the president of St. John's University, Stuart Leiden, the dean of Yanjing University, Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, and Li Denghui, the late president of Fudan, all dedicated their lives to education. In particular, Stuart and Bu Fangji, who devoted their lives to education in our country, are all worthy of our respect and remembrance." Yan concluded, "Some people say that Li was introduced to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the founder of Fudan, by me to be the president of Fudan. If so, I am deeply grateful to Fudan for having such a 'good president', and I am honored." Then, Shao Lizi, the representative of the Nanjing Fudan Alumni Association, who came to Shanghai from Beijing the night before, delivered a speech. Shao was deeply saddened by the sudden death of his teacher, Li. He expanded on a few words, saying, "My life has benefited greatly from Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Cai Jiemin, and Li Denghui. Mr. Xiangbo was a Catholic, Mr. Denghui was a Christian, and the two came from the same source, while Mr. Min deeply believed in aesthetics. All three shared the same goal of loving the country and the people. The purpose of educators is to serve the country and the people, but because of different understandings, they may not fully meet the spirit of the times and the current needs. However, the leadership of the three of us is extremely correct. Li first advocated reform, and during the 'September 18th' incident, he advocated unity. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, even while ill, he was still concerned about national affairs. This kind of enthusiasm for the country and the people should be a model for us, no matter what profession we are in." After the speech, the condolences from all sides were read out, and finally the Li family expressed their thanks until the order was given to place the remains in the coffin at five o'clock.

Also: Mr. Shao Lizi was busy with public affairs and could not attend the funeral. He took a military plane back to Beijing last night.

### In Thorough Coordination with National Policy to Control Finance, Four-Bank Branch to be Reorganized Soon, Combining Nine Units to Form a National Bank with Concurrent Chairman

Shanghai is the national financial center. After the victory, market disturbances have occurred repeatedly. Although the government has tried to stop it, it has not been able to do so due to various relationships, such as interest rates that are overdue. Recently, the Four-Bank Joint Office, in order to thoroughly coordinate with national policy and control Shanghai's finance, has decided to reorganize the Shanghai branch, expand its internal structure, and strengthen its scope of authority. The office was originally composed of representatives from the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, One Treasury, and the Four-Bank Joint Office, with one representative from each institution serving as a committee member. The representative from the Bank of China served concurrently as the chairman, and the representative from the Four-Bank Joint Office served concurrently as the vice-chairman. After this reorganization, the Ministry of Finance will also participate as a representative, for a total of nine units and nine committee members. The position of chairman will be changed to be held concurrently by a representative from the Central Bank, while the vice-chairman will still be responsible to the representative from the Four-Bank Joint Office. Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, the president of the National Bank, will be responsible for command and supervision in his capacity as a director. Internally, there are three groups handling affairs. The first group is in charge of party affairs, the second group is in charge of lending, and the third group is in charge of investigation and inspection. These three groups are roughly the original business, but they will be particularly strengthened after the reorganization. The third group is a new function, and all deposits, remittances, mortgages, re-mortgages, re-discounts, and various loans will be carefully examined to comply with financial controls. The organization and measures are being actively drafted by the Four-Bank Joint Office and will be implemented in the near future.

### An Outcry to Buy: China Stocks are All Red

Except for Lianhua and Xinyi, all China stocks were up yesterday. Yongsha and Xinhe both opened below price. After the National Economic Council passed the reduction of margin requirements, the cold stocks that had been dormant for a long time emerged, and the gains even exceeded those of the hot stocks.

The rise was caused by reports that the National Economic Council had passed the reduction of margin requirements. Yongsha started from 375 yuan and then 388 yuan. After No. 36 and others entered to 379 yuan and 390 yuan, No. 32 and others sold, and No. 213 immediately delivered. Some Guang merchants sold outside the market, forcing the price down to 372 yuan for immediate delivery and 383 yuan for deferred delivery. No. 130 and others bought enthusiastically. Domestic goods such as Zhongfang, Xinhe, Wuhe, Yonggong, Jinglun all hit their limit up. Meiya's spot and deferred stocks were eagerly absorbed by the public and also hit their limit up.

Zhongxing Shipping also hit its limit up. No. 105 and others sold, still struggling, but under the vigorous entry of No. 152 and others, the buying sentiment remained strong. Qinxin and Xinguang deferred Jingfu also hit their limit up. At the close, Yongsha rose to a high of 393 yuan for immediate delivery and 408 yuan for deferred delivery, and then closed at 390 yuan and 404 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price of spot stocks, Xinyi rose slightly, Yongsha rose by half, Huaxin, Zhabei, Datong, Zhongsihua, and Huafeng matches rose by 10%, Jingfu, Zhongfa, Xinhua, Yonggong, Jinglun, Tongyi, and Rongfeng rose by 15%, and Meiya, Zhongfang, Xinguang, National Goods, Wuhe, Zhongni, Qinxing, and domestic clothing hit their limit up. Deferred stocks Yongsha rose by half, Xinguang rose by 20%, Huafeng rose by half, and Meiya had a good 10%, all hitting their limit up.

Market Outlook

Due to the weekend effect, the buying sentiment was even stronger. Except for No. 105 and others slightly selling high at the beginning of the session, the price fell back to 405 yuan and 410 yuan. No. 54 and others entered, rising to the limit of 414 yuan for immediate delivery and 422 yuan for deferred delivery. No. 76 and others sold high, No. 89 and others sold immediate delivery. The National Bank's exchange rate improved, and the price fell back to 408 yuan and 416 yuan. At this time, there was a buying frenzy throughout the market. Meiya, Jingfu, Yonggong, Xinhe, domestic clothing, Xinguang, Dongxing, Zhongfang, China, National Goods, Zhongni, enamel, Zhongsi, matches, Rongfeng, Zhabei, Datong, Wuhe, Tongyi, Xinya, Huaxin, Zhongxing, Xinhua rose in succession. The black market outside the circle was also expensive, and the buying sentiment was easily stirred up. No. 169 and others scrambled to buy. After 3:00 PM, Yongsha for immediate delivery was first at No. 190, hitting the limit up, and then Yongsha for deferred delivery also announced limit up. Near the close, both spot and deferred were traded at a discount of 23 yuan. As a result, except for Xinyi and Lianhua, all spot and deferred stocks hit their limit up. Old stocks, cultural stocks, and bank stocks outside the exchange jumped another 10%, and the remaining stocks had few sellers.

### United Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Increase

Government bonds rose yesterday, with Room 503 selling and Room 500 et al. buying, and the transaction volume increased to 10 million. United Bond C opened at 23,100 yuan, rising from a low of 21,200 yuan to a high of 25,500 yuan. Finally, it hovered around 24,600 yuan, which was 2,000 yuan higher than the previous closing for A and B, 2,100 yuan higher for C, 1,300 yuan higher for D, and 1,500 yuan higher for E.

Foreign stocks were slightly weak at first due to the return of securities brokers to their old nest. The black market abroad rose again, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate narrowed to 4 yuan. Securities brokers and money changers sold, while foreign firms and Guang merchants bought. Yisha opened at 310,000 yuan, rising from a low of 298,000 yuan to a high of 345,000 yuan at the close. As a result, the popular stocks generally rose by 10% to 15% compared to the previous closing, and there was a buying frenzy for the cold stocks and rubber stocks.

### Gold Smuggling: Macau as Distribution Center

According to Macau sources, gold merchants who buy gold in Manila at public prices and seek good prices have made Macau an important station. They consider the Far East market to be the most promising market for gold brought to the Far East market. On average, two planes transport gold to Macau twice a week. Gold is routed through Hong Kong to Macau. This is because the Hong Kong government, at the request of the International Monetary Fund, banned gold imports in July of this year. These merchants said that the final destination of this gold is China, and it is smuggled into the country by smugglers.

### Small Fluctuations in Rice Prices

Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the north and south markets was more than 19,170 shi. The market first rose and then fell, advancing quickly and then retreating quickly. As a result, there was little fluctuation in both japonica and indica rice. White shade yuan also had little movement. The market for flour and miscellaneous brands of flour was stable due to continuous arrivals, and Wuxi fell slightly, subsequently decreasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Soybeans fell by 30,000 yuan because both oil cake and bean cake fell, and the factory's acceptance became slack. The same was true for merchant gangs, which were rare. Community beans fell sharply by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

The supply and demand of green beans were both low. Holders were firm, raising the price by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Red beans were not traded much, and rose slightly by 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas were priced flat, broad beans were separately priced, up 10,000 yuan.

Sorghum northern gangs stopped operating, and the price fell sharply by more than 20,000 yuan. Corn continued to move in the north, remaining strong. Sesame seeds were being acquired by Tianjin, and inquiries were being made in the Nanyang region. The market was active, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were strongly re-absorbed by the Guang gangs, soaring by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Bean cake was low by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

In a market with a chorus of selling, all oils fell sharply. Raw oil fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil, sesame oil, and light oil fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Soybean oil fell sharply by 100,000 yuan.

### Domestic Tea Outlook Good

The domestic sales of tea are strong, and the situation has not cooled down. The future is unanimously optimistic. As for export patterns, supply has been dwindling in recent days, and yesterday the market was again disturbed by the rumors of the opening of the African Chinese tea market, so the intention of holders to defend the price became even more strong. Exporters tried to buy at a low price, but it was even more of a pipe dream, so trading declined again.

### Excess Liquidity, Loose Credit

[Our Newspaper's Report] With excess liquidity and soaring prices, the authorities are working hard to tighten credit and stabilize the price increase, but credit remains loose. Yesterday, the difference between the Four Banks and Two Bureaus was 41.8 billion, the difference at the National Bank was 70.7 billion, the difference at the Big Exchange was 59.4 billion, the difference at the foreign bank was 41.8 billion, and the difference at the Small Exchange was 24.2 billion. The difference at the Bank of China was 5.1 billion, the difference at the Transportation Bank was 28.3 billion, the difference at the Agricultural Bank was 5.0 billion, the difference at the China Trust Bureau was 15.4 billion, the difference at the Postal Remittance Bureau was 2.1 billion, and the difference at the Cooperative Treasury was 3.5 billion.

### Quarterly Quota Has Been Approved, President Zhang to Return to Shanghai to Announce

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to reliable sources: Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Import and Export Control Commission, will return to Shanghai today or tomorrow after attending the National Economic Council meeting, carrying the quarterly quota numbers approved by the National Economic Council for announcement. It is also learned that the quarterly quota is US$53,393,000, and the US$20 million for cotton is not included. The total amount of the previous quarter's quota was US$67,873,000, which seems to be more than the fourth quarter. However, it included US$20 million for cotton, and the fourth quarter's quota is separate from the cotton funds, so it is actually an increase of US$5,520,000 compared to the previous quarter.

Yesterday, leaders of the city's industrial circles met with reporters and expressed their views on the fourth quarter's quota, saying that the government has repeatedly reduced the import quota due to the meager foreign exchange reserves. However, judging from the situation in the third quarter, the distance between the import of raw materials and the needs of industry is still far away. Now that the government has once again reduced the fourth quarter's import quota, the distance is even more remote. However, the government also has its own difficulties.

### Banks and Firms Charge Too Much Handling Fee for Discount Loans

According to the Secretariat of the Central Bank, since the implementation of discount loans, it has been discovered that the banks and firms acting as guarantors charge too much in handling fees. In theory, industrial and commercial enterprises apply to commercial banks for mortgage loans, and the commercial banks then re-mortgage the collateral to the National Bank. The National Bank provides 70% or 80% of the loan, and the commercial banks then add another 20%, so that industrial and commercial enterprises can use the full 100%. However, today's commercial banks, in order to control deposits in large quantities, not only have no funds to lend themselves, but also stipulate that some of the funds borrowed from commercial banks for re-mortgaging must be deposited in the bank. In reality, industrial and commercial enterprises obtain very little. In today's inflationary environment, it is hoped that commercial banks will think more about the country's industrial and commercial enterprises and try to guide floating capital into production channels as much as possible. Situations like this really need to be improved.

### It is Estimated That the Floating Capital Escaping to Hong Kong Reaches 200 Million Yuan

Regarding the amount of floating capital fleeing to Hong Kong, financial circles estimate that it has reached 200 million Hong Kong dollars. These wealthy people are mostly from the Central and North China regions. The deposits in Hong Kong banks have reached more than 70 million Hong Kong dollars, but in reality the number is higher. Because the methods of escaping floating capital to Hong Kong are very clever, it is very difficult to get an official statistic. Some of the escaped capital accumulated in Hong Kong is used to purchase goods, preparing to transport them to the mainland at the appropriate time to seek profits. This type of investment accounts for a large proportion, about tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars. Others who speculate in land or set up factories to manufacture products are also numerous, but they account for a very small number. As for financial speculation, it is also one of the outlets for floating capital.

### The Negotiation Price is Increased Again, the Price of Yarn Rises Madly, 20-Count Yarn Surpasses the 30 Million Mark

[Our Newspaper's Report] The negotiated price of cotton yarn has risen sharply again. The negotiation team of the Textile Adjustment Conference yesterday decided to increase the price of 20-count standard yarn to 35.5 million yuan, an increase of 2.4 million yuan compared to the previous price. The prices of other grades of yarn have also increased proportionally. In addition to the usual allocation of Grade A yarn, the conference has also resumed the allocation of Grade B (yarn count) yarn, which had been suspended for a long time. The total amount of cotton yarn sold yesterday was extremely large.

Another report: The yarn and cloth market was extremely chaotic yesterday, with prices rising madly. The market was filled with calls for price increases. The price of 20-count standard yarn has already surpassed the 30 million yuan mark, exceeding the new negotiated price by more than 5 million yuan. The price of Longtou fine cloth has also exceeded the 1.3 million yuan mark. The authorities are paying close attention to this situation. Economic police are stationed throughout the market, closely monitoring it, and will intensify their investigation today.

Another report: Yesterday, 42-count blue Phoenix fine yarn ended at a high price of 47.5 million yuan, continuing to rise by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn also rose by 570,000 yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn generally increased rather than decreased.

Fine Cloth Rises Rapidly: The cotton cloth market opened in the morning due to the unified allocation of textiles by the Textile Construction Company the day before. Each household was allocated 40 pieces of Longtou fine cloth. There were ample chips on the market, and sellers were lax, resulting in clear transactions and a temporary weakening of the market. However, powerful buyers outside the market saw that prices were low and actively bought up the cloth. Furthermore, as the price of Textile Construction yarn increased, the cloth market followed suit. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose sharply by 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day, with each piece costing 1.32 million yuan. The prices of other grades of fine cloth also increased by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also increased by varying amounts, ranging from 10,000 to 45,000 yuan.

Spot Cotton Continues to Rise: Yesterday's spot cotton market remained firm, with high market sentiment. Yarn factories frequently purchased cotton, and retail buyers actively bought up cotton. Market prices soared again, with demand exceeding supply. Prices rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions amounted to 1,800 bales, or 250 dan. Prices for factory delivery were: Lingbao, 5.373 million to 5.58 million yuan; Han fine cotton, 4.795 million to 4.836 million yuan; Shashi, 4.96 million yuan; Dezi cotton, 5.54 million yuan; and improved American cotton, 5.54 million yuan. Transactions amounted to 930 bales, or 250 dan. Prices for wharf delivery were: Han fine cotton, 4.67 million to 4.877 million yuan; Chongsha, 4.96 million yuan; Jingyang new goods, 5.46 million yuan; and Huoji, 3.265 million yuan. Transactions amounted to 870 bales. Bureau Pu seed cotton, 800,000 yuan.

### Importers and Exporters Oppose Export Visa Measures

The Non-Quota Allocation Office of the Export and Import Management Committee recently planned to implement export visa measures. Importers and exporters in this city strongly oppose this plan. Their reasons are as follows: The prices of various domestic products for export are kept secret by all merchants. Therefore, the implementation of export visas will inevitably reveal all export secrets. Currently, some goods that cannot be exported can be sold on the black market by concealing a small amount of foreign exchange to make up for losses. Therefore, there are still some sporadic goods that can be exported. If export visas are implemented, foreign exchange cannot be concealed. It is estimated that exports may decrease by 40%. The situation of export stagnation will become even more severe. Implementing export visas is a disguised preliminary implementation of export controls. Adding controls to exports while encouraging exports will not only fail to achieve good results but will also stimulate domestic exporters to become exhausted. Looking at the current situation, the implementation of export visas must be postponed.

### The News That Coal Prices Will Rise Again Is Incorrect

It is learned that manufacturers in Beijing and Shanghai, in order to ensure the supply of coal for the winter, have been stepping up purchases and transportation from non-controlled areas. More than 20,000 tons of bituminous coal from Zaozhuang have already been transported to Beijing and Shanghai via the Jinzhuang Railway. The Railway Bureau is currently dispatching more vehicles to assist. The previous rumor that coal prices would rise again is now incorrect because of the abundant supply. The Fuel Management Committee has decided to maintain the original price to stabilize public sentiment.

### The Decision to Establish a Preparatory Office for Participation in the Milan Exhibition

Italy has invited our country to participate in the Milan International Exhibition to be held on April 13th next year. After our envoy to Italy, Mr. Xue Guangqian, returned to the country and contacted government officials and industrial and commercial leaders, it was generally agreed that this is the first international exhibition held in Europe after the war. It is a good opportunity for our manufacturers to promote their goods and compete for the European market, and we should participate. Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened the China National Import and Export Trade Association, the Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association, and the China National Goods United Company to initially exchange opinions and decided to establish a preparatory committee. Concrete measures will be discussed separately at a later date with government agencies, industrial and commercial organizations, financial institutions, and enthusiastic manufacturers. Those in the industrial and commercial sectors who are interested in this matter can contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for details.

### China Trust Purchases All Autumn Silk for Export

[Our Newspaper's Report] China Trust has purchased more than 6,500 dan of autumn silk this year, which is far from the original plan of 14,600 dan. All of the purchased autumn silk will be used for export. Among them, 3,000 dan have been transported to India, Burma, and other places, and the remaining quantity is also being transported successively.

### Upstream for Woolen Fabrics

The standard market for woolen fabrics is tending upward due to the lively sales caused by the cold weather. Melton overcoating, uniform fabric, long-haired camel cashmere, cavalry twill, fancy suiting, medium-thick serge, and thick plain fabric are all selling well, with obvious and hidden increases in prices. Lining materials such as French serge, black charcoal serge, mercerized feather yarn, sleeve twill, yarn-backed flower cloth, etc., are also selling well. Wholesale and retail prices have all increased due to the cost of raw materials and finishing. Mercerized feather yarn is the most popular, with the top grade priced at 75,000 yuan per yard, the second grade at 67,000 to 68,000 yuan, and the third grade at 60,000 yuan. Yarn-backed flower cloth is priced at 85,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, sleeve twill is priced at 75,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan, and flower cloth is around 50,000 yuan.

### Rayon Lingers in a Weak State, Market Price Drops by One Million Yuan Compared to the Previous Day

The China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon silk fabrics is still being applied for. Therefore, despite the stimulus of soaring prices of other commodities, rayon remains weak. 1200-count 1A Asahi bright rayon once fell to 99 million yuan in the morning and then rose to between 103 and 3 million yuan. It then fell again in the afternoon, with transactions at 1 million yuan. Finally, it recovered slightly, with a selling price of 2 million yuan, which was 1 million yuan lower than the previous day.

Filature Silk

The market was stable yesterday. Because the market price has increased, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions are extremely rare. The asking prices for five-phase individual lot goods remained unchanged, and transactions for high-grade individual lots were slightly active, with the price still at 7 million to 8 million yuan. The market for Qianjing silk was bullish yesterday, with special top-grade individual ancestors reaching about 60 million yuan, and ordinary individual ancestors also asking for 55 million yuan.

Silk Fabrics

Except for quilt covers and checkered crepe, which were traded speculatively and soaring in price, other goods in the market rose very little yesterday due to weak actual sales. Dacheng and Huaqiang genuine silk quilt covers opened at 8.9 million yuan, with more buyers than sellers, and prices rose steadily. Some people sold at high prices, causing a slight correction. Due to the good opening of the stock market, the closing price rose to 9.25 million yuan for spot prices. In the afternoon, due to the increase in yarn and cloth, market sentiment was boosted. The final price rose to 30.25 million yuan, an increase of 1.7 million yuan compared to the day before yesterday. Dacheng checkered crepe was priced at 115,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Tobacco Tax Will Be Adjusted Again

### Tobacco Tax Will Be Adjusted Again, New Tax Will Increase by About One Time

The market for cigarettes in this city has been fluctuating again recently. It is reported that the Goods Tax Bureau will adjust the fourth phase of the first cigarette tax amount starting next week. The Tax Bureau follows the principle of ad valorem taxation and uses the period from the 16th of last month to the 15th of this month as the calculation standard. Any amount exceeding one-fourth of the market price will be taxed according to grade. It is reported that the minimum increase this time is 25%, such as (Four O'Clock Brand), and the maximum increase is 400%, (such as Big Red Luck) brand. Those with an increase of 50% are less, (such as Kletensky), and those with an increase of about 100% are more, such as Big Cannon Tower, White Gate, and Big Bank. The average adjusted new tax amount is about 100.6% higher (October was 83%).

### Kerosene Price Increases by 400,000 Yuan per Barrel

Mobil, Asia, Texaco, and other kerosene companies in this city recently stated that the foreign exchange rate and the cost of living index for workers have both risen sharply, affecting the cost of kerosene imports and transportation expenses. They plan to increase the selling price proportionally, with the estimated price per barrel being 3.2 million yuan, an increase of 400,000 yuan compared to the previous price.

Random Thoughts

### The Dullness of the Art World

— Wang Pingling

The dull atmosphere of the art world after the war, the decline and desolation of the literary world, most people are unwilling to think too much about it because it is not their business. They seem to only offer a lazy reason: high prices and difficult living conditions. For those engaged in literary and artistic work, it is not that simple. They seem to have a belly full of frustration, eager to vent; but struggling to do so.

If we are unwilling to let this dull situation drag on forever; that is to say, we must dispel the sorrow shrouding the hearts of artists, so that they can restore the excited and enthusiastic emotions of wartime and strive to write for the construction of a prosperous, strong, and happy new China, and even the reconstruction of a new world, then we should calmly and thoroughly examine the causes of the dullness of the art world.

The war-torn and dilapidated world is like a broken ship that has weathered a great storm, with a ship full of lives waiting to be saved. At this time, it is still thrown into the stormy waves, helplessly watching another great storm brewing under a dull low pressure. If it unfortunately erupts, it will only be destroyed together. The shadow of despair has submerged the sun of hope, and the foolishness, selfishness, and ambition of a few... are stepping up the reproduction of a tragic catastrophe for mankind, and asking them to return to clear reason will waste thousands of lives and countless living resources. This is already foreseen in the imagination of artists, and they can use skillful techniques to depict this tragic picture without exaggeration, but everyone has not done so. Although the Second World War reduced the total proportion of the entire population, the ambition of mankind will not die. When someone is trying to develop their own ambition at this moment, and the pitiful human beings are confused by the novel and moving slogans issued by the ambitious, it seems that they are willing to regard death as home. This is the great tragedy of human nature—a catastrophe caused by human beings willing to exploit their weaknesses! A very small number of artists only have a low voice of self-pity, self-shame, and self-knowledge that cannot wake up the dream of mankind, and become even more silent!

In all fairness, artists should never remain silent at this juncture when the fate of all mankind is about to be decided in an instant! We should not think that actively unfolding today's literary and artistic work cannot save mankind's doom. We should first lose heart and put down our weapons and fall into the abyss of sorrow. The most important factor in winning victory in the Second World War was the atomic bomb invented by scientists, and striving for the peace of victory, and the construction of peace, should be the joint efforts of educators, thinkers, and scientists, especially artists who grasp the theme of "seeking survival and loving peace" of all mankind, and try to shout and strive to write great works. If we can observe coldly and quietly, and constantly expose the traps of the ambitious and uncover the smoke screen they spread, in order to be able to stand firm and stand firm, they can seize the blind obedience of "Chi Chi Zhe Min" under a certain name, and only constantly change the nice slogans; but it is always in vain and extremely difficult to achieve their wishes. This can delay the arrival of the great storm in both tangible and intangible ways, and at least can effectively resist for a while at the moment of the great storm's invasion, allowing them to have a gap for reflection. After weighing the pros and cons and thoroughly reviewing the gains and losses, maybe they can reduce their ambition immediately and stop in time? Because the one-time turn of those ambitious people—whether it is a right turn or a smooth turn—is the thermometer that determines the fate of mankind, and as of today, the vast people do not seem to have much power to determine the temperature of the thermometer's rise and fall. To be honest, the work of artists is always an important factor. In this way, when the ship of peace has dropped anchor and run aground halfway today, how can our art workers not wake up and remain silent for a long time! Everything in reality is not enough to satisfy the artists who are thirsting for this. But there is no need to be pessimistic or disappointed. It is enough to prove that our work needs to be intensified, which is indeed a certain fact. Based on this meaning, instead of being dissatisfied with reality together with us, it is better to be dissatisfied with ourselves first, then conduct an objective self-examination, find the correct direction, and move forward bravely. That is to resolutely and clearly accept the requirements of all mankind to "seek survival and love peace," work hard to promote their own work, and strive to promote the journey of peace, and strive to send the ship full of lives waiting to be saved to the peaceful and happy shore!

### Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry

— Zhu Wen

Scholars who write poetry often follow stereotypes, while those who do not know books often come up with their own ideas. Liu Bang's "Song of the Great Wind," Xiang Yu's "Song of Gaixia," and Hulu Jin's "Song of Chichin" can all express the subtlety of nature. Emperor Wu of Han's "Song of the Autumn Wind" and Han Yu's "Qin Cao," although the lyrics are more elaborate, are all involved in imitation and are not as expressive of temperament as the first three.

Wang Ji's poem: "Seeing people all drunk, how can I bear to be sober alone!" This comes from Chu Ci. Qu Yuan said: "Everyone is drunk, but I am sober alone." Ruan Zhuo's poem: "Forgetting each other is naturally happy, how can Zhuang and Hui know?" This comes from Nanhua Jing. "Huizi said: You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of fish? Said: You are not me, how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?" Wang and Ruan's two poems are good at overturning the case. Zimei said: "Next year, who will be healthy at this meeting, drunk, I will carefully look at the dogwood." Liu Jun's poem: "No need to look at the dogwood carefully, I will take it next year to be strong." The ancient poem says: "The Hu horse relies on the north wind, and the Yue bird nests on the south branch." Fan Yun's poem: "Yue Island hates the north tree, and the Hu horse fears the wind." Although this overturns the case, it seems clumsy and tasteless.

The rhythm should be in thousands of branches, and the nobility lies in the virtual use. For example, Wen Tingyun's poem: "The wind rolls the roots of the artemisia, and it stores itself in the E and Ji, and the moon moves the shadows of the pine trees to guard the Geng and Shen;" Xie Zhen's poem: "Half-mountain meals extend the Jiazi, and the lonely lamp illuminates the night to guard the Gengshen," are extremely stable. If Xu Hun's poem: "Every year is long and laborious to push the Jiazi, and the cold night first shares the Gengshen," then the actual pair is in thousands of branches, and it is particularly lacking in thickness. According to the "Ai Ri Zhai Cong Chao," Xu Mao's poem: "The year of abundance of Jiazi, the spring is without rain, and the good night of Gengyou, the summer is enough to sleep;" Jiannan's poem: "Everywhere is happy to see a clear spring Jiazi, and every family builds a room to cross Gengshen; there is a fear of heavy rain in the spring Jiazi, and the dim light is ashamed to guard the night Gengshen." "Tiaoxi Yuyin" said: "Meet Jiazi on a rainy day and sit at night to guard Gengshen." All use the millennium tree to enter the pair.

"Turtle" is not avoided in poetry. Su Jiaohe's "Peach Blossom Spring Poem": "The heavy turtle is also the most sucking, and the Qi dog also barks at night;" Bao Shu's "Autumn Garden Forest Poem": "The bird pecked at the new gap in the chestnut, and the turtle half lay on the building," are all in the upper class. And Dongpo also likes to use it as a rhyme, such as "There are swimming turtles in the depths of the green lotus," "Shrinking its neck to sleep at night like a frozen turtle," "Wanting to fight the snakes and turtles with its teeth and hair," and "The fathers all carry turtles" and so on. Yu Xin's poem on lotus flowers: "If there is a thousand-year-old Cai, I must nest but see it with me," Liang Jianwen's poem on cooling: "Swimming fish blow water foam, and the gods in the heart of the lotus;" Yuan Zhen's poem on fragrant trees: "Clear pond raises the god turtle." Although Cai is a big turtle, it is not as clear and refreshing as the turtle character to enter poetry with the Cai character.

"People's smoke is quiet across the water, and the ghost fire shines on the sand plug," This is the poem of the Four Ming Mountain people remembering Yanmen. It is rare to say that the fire is cold in poetry. Yu Xin's poem: "The silkworm has no machine weaving, and the flowing fire brings coldness;" Wu Ji's poem: "Vast Zhu Tian is ripe, and the green fire is cold," the following sentence is strange, but it is a pity that the poem is not as good as the Four Ming Mountain people's poem, which seems to be more industrial than Wu.

### Frost Maple

— Ji Ke

You took off your green coat, child, you reddened your cheeks, beautiful girl sleeping in the autumn forest, you really make me intoxicated, how can I tell you my mood!

Do you still remember your mother, she gave you jewels all over your ears, white semicircular jewels, in the warm season, she prepared this dowry for you. Dao still remembers, at that time, I often sat beside you, talking about a lovely chapter of poetry; your green coat sheltered me from the strong light of the sun, and when I often raised my head to steal a look at your beauty, you would also look at me once to make me shy. Occasionally on holidays, you would also be willing to tell me ancient myths, and I would want to never leave you and listen to your voice.

But, on a night when I was quietly gazing at you in the cold moon, I couldn't hear those excellent musicians singing for your joy. The night hawk was wailing, he told me that you were suffering from an acute illness, but there was no doctor's hand that could know your symptoms. Your moans can no longer make me cross the stream that night. The cold wind teased you, and the cunning laughter made my jealous heart unbearable. I want to wear a moonlight to see you, and use my steel arms to block their way. But my heart is full of sorrow and desolation.

You are like a dying virgin, destined to endure gently, without a word of complaint, not angry, with a smile on your pale lips. Don't you see the deep tomb, the purple-red brilliance on your posture flashes, today you live here, but tomorrow you will no longer exist. Sweet and tragic days; enchanting eyes dreaming; talking about your eternal beauty and my kindness. I love you, but the extravagant decay of your life makes me sad.

When the east calls me to the fiery light of a clear day, I pick up your remaining red with a heart full of sorrow. The west wind picks you up from the ground, but drops you weakly. You really look like you carry too much sorrow. I snatched you from their arms and put you in my beloved chapter of poetry

### Insomnia Concert

— Xu Weinan

Bo Bo Bo! Du Du Du! Bo!…

The newly born eight-cylinder Buick is really naughty, always yelling and shouting randomly. On the road at night, it still goes over time with a wave and shouts in the past with a burst. The night shift patrolman who was ordered to prohibit it from barking could only: "Humph!" Give a cold laugh to tease, and send it away. …Bo Bo Bo! Du!…

The dry cough of a lung patient, wantonly, recklessly, violently rushes out of the suffocating chest and the dry mouth, sweeps across the dimly lit, deserted street center, jumps to your window, and knocks heavily on the glass.

In the pure sky before dawn in early winter, a clear and good throat, a voice:

"White sugar rice cake!… Heavy sugar rice cake!…"

A string of crystal balls is poured from this street to that street.

The rice cake packed in such a sonorous tenor has been enough to make people drool three feet, let alone it is a heavy sugar, white sugar, sweet!

### Words from the Forest

— Kai Gong

"Words from the Forest" was compiled by Fei Qi, a hermit from Hezhong Hedong in Jin Dynasty, which is worthy of mentioning in the words and answers of the scholars since the Han and Wei Dynasties. However, because the record of Xie An's words was untrue, it was criticized by An, and the book was dismissed. "Shi Shuo Xin Yu" briefly mentioned this matter in the derogatory article. Its writing style is also slightly similar to "Shi Shuo". "Taiping Yulan" 389 recorded a relic of it, saying that "Wang Ziyou once temporarily lived in an empty house of someone else and ordered them to plant bamboo. Or asked why bother to live temporarily? Yong pointed to the bamboo and said: "How can I live without this gentleman for a day?"" Later generations called "You can't live without bamboo," which came out of this. There will only understand you, so that your sorrow will be transformed into a new force. Farmers collect your legacy on your sick body, and white fruits fall with bursts of laughter and the sound of hooks. They are happy, they thank you for your kindness; they thank you for sacrificing for them. However, they have never sung for your beauty! Only I, this infatuated child, am still looking forward to your glory.

### Spring Light Hall Recent Poems

— Chen Shuren

A Small Trip to Lin Sen Park with Nature

Preferring the autumn light in the city park, frost-touched leaves painted red, chrysanthemums blooming yellow; if not for the painter accommodating nature, who else would share my "criticism"?

An Occasional Feeling While Strolling in the City Park with Ruo Wen

Majestic travels to lofty peaks, ascending new lands (twenty years ago, we climbed Mount Los Angeles together), rushing to difficult outskirts, entrusting ourselves to ancient Yu; now living in seclusion amidst the bustling city, our happy land spreads throughout the world.

Evening Stroll on the Thoroughfare

In the evening, temporarily stretching this body, carriages and hundreds of whirlwinds of street dust return; don't know if the rapidly speeding travelers are like those who stroll slowly and peacefully?

Joyfully Eating Crabs

Autumn arrives in Jiangnan, holding crabs again, wine green, flowers yellow, spirits even higher; poems and paintings for thirty years, wandering with healthy feet, today rewarded with full labor!

Casual Thoughts While Sitting in the Garden

Everywhere prompts distant thoughts, can life have a small forest time? After the setting sun disappears, the autumn light withdraws, sparse willows and remaining locusts still tease.

Revisiting Hongkou Park with Ruo Wen

The pond pavilion and bridge kiosk are not completely desolate, also able to come again to sit in the setting sun; happily, the white-haired people are still healthy, a few cups of clear tea talking about vicissitudes.

Elegant Gathering on Double Ninth at Guanshengyuan

Though there are three-story pavilions in the city, there are no hills even a foot high in sight; such a high climb is ridiculous, only this grand gathering belongs to famous people; not mundane dust, poetry and books meet with elegance and seclusion. Able to plan a drunken spree in difficult times, already fully rewarding the fine festival.

Deep Autumn

Living in the city, why close the heavy doors, the small courtyard is quiet and not noisy in deep autumn; don't say there are no new moods, the setting sun and yellow leaves are good for dissolving the soul.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"What's your opinion?" After hearing Little Tiger's report, I wanted to sound out Yaoqun's opinion.

"To get a car, I really need to say something." Yaoqun at this time wrinkled her brow, head bowed in contemplation, as if she had stirred up a bellyful of thoughts.

"It's not about getting a car," I added, "I can still manage to get a few cars... I'm asking you, how should we arrange things here; who goes and who doesn't? What about the people imprisoned by the dwarfs? We certainly can't abandon them... Also, regarding buying supplies, we need to have a response, right?"

"All of this is easy to handle, if I speak, it can also be put aside for the moment; this matter of buying supplies, you also don't need to bother thinking about... it's just that I'm thinking..." Yaoqun said to this point, suddenly stopped. Her complexion gradually paled, as if she suddenly felt a great pain in her spirit or body.

"What are you thinking?" I heard her words have a meaning, couldn't help but panic, a little uncertain about Yaoqun's thoughts.

"Get a few comrades, leave them all to me, I still have a little way." Dingyuan, who had just woken up, suddenly interjected at this time.

"That's of course good, but I hope you also go to Beiping with us all the way." I responded to Dingyuan, but at this time, all my thoughts were focused on Yaoqun's strange attitude, so I asked Yaoqun again; "You definitely have to go to Tianjin, because Tsurumi suddenly mobilizing on such a large scale, the matter must be extremely important. You..."

"Me?" Yaoqun only got out these two words, suddenly shedding a string of large tears. I didn't know what to say, only saw Yaoqun cover her face with her hands, suddenly getting up and going to the back room.

In the evening, when the agreed time arrived, we were all getting ready to get into the car, everyone was present, but couldn't see Yaoqun and Little Tiger's shadows. Bearing endless trouble and danger, we waited for about a quarter of an hour, Yaoqun and Little Tiger still hadn't appeared. Although I somewhat understood in my heart why they had inexplicably disappeared, there was nothing I could do, so I could only give the order to depart. (End of Chapter Nine)

### Guanyin (Copy of Huang Binhong's Painting)

— Li Dinglong

### Sour and Clever Tunes

— Wang Baili

I previously introduced to readers the wonderful words of Shuang Qing, in which each sentence had a "spring" character. Now I also recall that Suan Qi also has a tune in which each sentence uses a "spring" character. Although the tune is very short, the style is particularly good, so I will record it again below:

Suan Qi once went to a feast of relatives, and a guest asked him to compose a "Qingjiang Yin," and limited the use of the five elements "gold, wood, water, fire, earth" as the first character of each sentence, and since it was the beginning of spring, it was also necessary to use the character "spring" in each sentence. Suan Qi immediately said on the spot: "Gold and silver shadows shake spring swallows slant, wood shoots and spring leaves grow, water pond spring begins to ripple, fire heat spring is initially ripe, earth ox carries spring away." All the guests burst into laughter.

According to Suan Qi's personal name, he was a grandson of Ke Haiya, his father's name was Zhenzhike, so he took Shi as his surname, named himself Xiao Shishihai, and was also known as Suanhua Daoren. Ming Ning Shouwang Quan Taihe Zheng also commented that his words were like a heavenly horse breaking free from its reins, so the beauty of his words can be known. Suan Zhai was born with a divine and outstanding appearance, and his strength surpassed others. At the age of seventy-two or three, he loved Yongmen. When he made strong men ride three evil horses at full speed, he held a waiting there, and when the horse arrived, he jumped on it, crossed one and rode three, operating the wind, and the spectators were moved. When he grew up, he devoted himself to reading and exhausted them. In the reign of Renzong, he was appointed Hanlin Academician, and suddenly sighed: "A word of resignation is humble, which is what Puxian advocates," so he claimed illness and resigned to live in Jiangnan, in the Qiantang market, his name was , his clothes were changed, and no one knew him. Seeing this, Suan Tong was not only proficient in both civil and military affairs, but also a foreign person.

### Election Anecdotes

— Wei Fengjiang

Elections must have skills, and the most important thing is of course to brag. Either by mouth, or by pen, either self-bragging, or people bragging. The Chinese are stable, so during elections, they mainly rely on writing or people bragging, while Europeans and Americans like to take risks, so candidates mostly rely on self-bragging and speaking.

Adventurers are easy to succeed and easy to fail, because when you are talking enthusiastically, the lurking opponents may suddenly give you a stab, and if you can't calmly respond and strike the attacker, then your audience will disperse in your panicked expression, and from then on you will never be able to summon them again, and there will be no hope of being elected.

Once, an old man began his speech when running for Congress, frankly and emotionally: "Mr. Chairman, I have lived enough..." Before he finished speaking, someone in the audience shouted: "Stop, he has lived enough!" The whole audience roared with laughter, and the old man sat down silently, his body trembling with anger.

Another candidate used a serious and heavy tone to recount his many reform proposals:

"We need land reform Iandreform, we need housing reform Housereform, we need insurance reform Insurancereform, we need..." "Chloroform Luo Fang" a listener continued like this. This anesthetic really mesmerized the speaker, and he stood there like a wooden chicken.

A shrewd candidate will never be easily defeated. A candidate whose face had turned red due to alcoholism was just finishing a powerful speech when a listener suddenly asked loudly: "Hey, Bonar, I ask you, why has your face turned so red?" Bonar replied without慌乱: "It's because I saw your face is too thick, so I blushed."

"Can't hear, can't hear." A crowd always shouted like this. The candidate on the stage then pretended to be surprised and said:

"Could it be that with ears as long as yours, you can't hear what I'm saying?" So the whole audience turned to look at the ears of the shouter, and he stopped shouting.

A candidate running for mayor attacked the current city government slightly in his speech. An opponent shouted at him:

"It's not reliable that you say there are many unemployed people here. My sister wants to find one or two people to saw wood here, but she can't find them." The speaker quickly replied: "I don't believe what you said is true, unless I personally meet your sister."

Lloyd George, the former leader of the British Liberal Party, was an orator. Once, a woman interrupted his speech:

"George, if I were your wife, I would definitely poison you." Lloyd George replied: "Madam, if you were my wife, I would be willing to swallow your poison."

Once, he had a big joke with someone who was preventing him from speaking. That person asked loudly: "Mr. George, do you still remember that your grandfather was a carriage driver?" Lloyd George pondered for a while and said: "Gentlemen, please forgive me. I have forgotten the carriage, but I found that the carriage driver is still alive." He looked at the questioner as he spoke. What can you do with such a person?

At a women's conference, a lady asked her audience when her speech reached the most important juncture: "What is the result of our liberation?" She looked around after asking and waited for an answer. This infuriated a man standing in the corner, who had come to the meeting to wait for his wife to go home. He answered loudly: "I know." The lady on the stage said contemptuously: "Listen, that bald-headed dwarf says he can answer our question. Please tell us."

"Cold meals and children with tattered clothes" was the dwarf's answer.

Churchill's wife once canvassed for her husband. She met a worker and asked him for help. "No," the worker replied: "I don't intend to vote for someone who sleeps until noon." Mrs. Churchill said: "There is no such thing, I am his wife, you should believe me." The worker said: "Madam, you are so beautiful that I believe my words are true."

In the nineteenth century, there was a politician in England named Macaulay, who had such an incident in Edinburgh. One night, he and his candidate stood on the same stage. Suddenly, a listener threw a dead cat at him. That person immediately got up and said that it was thrown at him by mistake. Macaulay said, "Okay, I hope you were going to throw it at me but accidentally threw it at someone else.

### Wartime Groom

— Binzhi

Many American war brides have returned to their home countries with their husbands. One of them is different from the other brides in gender. He is a man. He married a U.S. Army nurse and became a U.S. citizen with his wife. He is a wartime bride who is different from the others – a wartime groom.

Lockard was a Belgian liaison officer sent to Germany. He was accidentally injured in a car accident and was lying in a U.S. Army hospital. Therefore, he met Katherine, an army nurse. After he recovered, he was dismissed from the Belgian army, so he worked as a clerical worker in the U.S. military headquarters in Nuremberg. At that time, they got engaged.

Marriage must be approved by the U.S. military headquarters, which is not as simple as a daughter asking her parents. Lockard then filled out five resumes and applied to the U.S. military headquarters for marriage. Two months later, the approval document came down. Their marriage did not violate the regulations of the U.S. military and could be allowed. Lockard wanted to obtain U.S. citizenship as soon as possible, so he went to the consulate to inquire again. Four months later, he received a reply saying that according to Article 271 of the U.S. law, he could obtain U.S. citizenship as a war bride.

Lockard took the letter from the consulate to the U.S. military headquarters to handle the necessary procedures. Difficult problems arose. There were no male war brides in the military regulations. As a result, the application was sent in the name of Katherine's spouse. Six weeks later, the U.S. military headquarters recognized Lockard as a wartime bride and attached a form to investigate his past situation. Is he pregnant now? How many months? This made the male wartime bride who was used to laughed or cried.

Later, Lockard received a notice asking him to register with the wartime bride group. It was a dormitory for military families, all of whom were women and children, and he was the only man, but his current status was only allowed to move in. The administrator assigned him to No. 11, but he couldn't get in when he got there. The military officer in charge of No. 11 said: There were no rooms or beds there, because only soldiers could live there. Although he was a quasi-soldier, he was now only the spouse of a soldier. He also went to No. 10, but there were all women there.

This special bride stumped the administrators and reluctantly slept on the bed of a lieutenant in No. 9 for one night. The next day, he gave up the lieutenant's bed to him. They ate in the restaurant, Katherine paid for her food, but Lockard didn't have to pay, because he was a wartime bride, a new guest of the government, and could eat with a wartime bride's coupon.

Lockard waited for a long time and finally returned home with many war brides. When he boarded the ship, he was stopped again, because he was neither a soldier nor a military family member. But the person in charge knew it and still sent him on the ship. At that time, the deck was empty, but it was occupied by naval and army personnel. According to the rules, he could go to the first-class cabin, because that was the war brides' cabin, but he was a male war bride. So a crew member's room was vacated to serve as the cabin for the male wartime bride.

This only wartime groom arrived in his new country among the wartime brides. Because of the difference in his gender, he suffered a lot of trouble, and there were no words to describe it. After arriving in the United States, the notices he received always had "Mrs. Lockard" written on the envelope. How did they know that he was not a bride, but a real groom.

### Choosing Your Ideal Man

— Jieyu

Taipei Mayor You Mijian said: "Electing National Assembly representatives is like choosing a good husband. You must choose the one you have in mind."

Talented men and beautiful women are a match made in heaven. It is a lifelong regret to choose a husband without talent. But talents have internal and external distinctions. On the "face," he is "outstanding in appearance," but in private, he may be "a fancy pillow." With a "bellyful" of "exquisite strategies," he may have a "dark face." If you only "judge people by their appearance" when choosing your ideal man, you will "lose Ziyu"!

Furthermore, most of the current "eligible bachelors" are quite skilled. Before he has truly captured your soul, his words are often as sweet as honey and his love as deep as the sea. He is very eager to please you, "not daring to go a little west when asked to go east." But don't really think that you can "rely on him for life." You must know that some people are tricking you into getting involved.

If electing National Assembly representatives is really like a woman choosing her ideal man, then please don't "ignore my words."

### Miss America's Religious Views

— Xu Shuyuan

People in religious countries do not necessarily completely believe in religion. On the contrary, most people use religious rituals as a means of socializing. In the United States, it is customary to go to church from 9:00 to 10:00 am every Sunday. Residents bring their children, change into new clothes, and dress neatly. Rural people who are usually barefoot also put on old-fashioned suits, tie ties, and pretend to be civilized to go to church. In the church, you can meet many relatives, friends, and neighbors who are hard to meet. From the greetings, you can talk about business. Young men and women, especially, regard going to church as a good opportunity to make friends of the opposite sex. On the surface, they are well-behaved, but in secret, men and women are greedy for love. Young lovers who don't often meet can take advantage of the church service to make an appointment and have a good time on Sunday afternoon. Most American women, except for a few who devote themselves to missionary work, do not have a deep understanding of religion. They simply cannot understand the various categories and systems in the Old Church and the New Church. If you ask her why she goes to this church instead of another church, she cannot tell you why. There are also many people who follow others. She goes to whatever church others go to. Some women have loud voices and are initially invited to sing hymns. She simply regards singing hymns as a good opportunity to show off and inevitably performs every week.

In churches, many young men and women who do not know each other fall in love with each other because they sit together or run together. Lovers eventually become married, and Jesus has his reasons.

A Chinese officer in Denver met a local only golden-haired girl in church. In less than three months, they held a wedding. The young couple often accompanied the bride's parents to eat at the officers' club, so I also knew them. This Chinese officer didn't even have a car, but the golden-haired girl could be regarded as a fairy, and she was a rare beauty among American women.

The Public Speaking Institute of the University of Denver separately came up with the topic of "Sino-American Intermarriage." The doctors argued with red faces. I strongly advocated intermarriage. American men opposed intermarriage. Young American women advocated intermarriage. Old American women opposed intermarriage. To be honest, no one wants old American women at all. Let them oppose it!

### Second Landlord Transfers for Profit

### Big Landlord Extorts Huge Sums of Money

Editor: I have several legal questions. I beg for answers. A second landlord, Mr. Tian, without the permission of the landlord, subdivided the rented house and transferred it to others. He himself then moved to another place. Can the landlord terminate the contract and take back the house? Assuming that after the contract is terminated, the three tenants currently living in the house will spend a huge amount of transfer fees and sign a transfer contract with the second landlord, is this contract valid? Or can they continue to live only by signing a contract with the landlord? The three tenants intend to directly sign a contract with the landlord and pay rent in order to obtain legitimate rental rights. However, the landlord is deliberately delaying and attempting to extort a huge transfer fee, otherwise they will not sign a contract and order them to move out immediately. Can the three tenants sue the court to confirm their legitimate rental rights and continue to live? Since the landlord has terminated the lease, the three tenants are preparing to pay the rent directly to the landlord, but the landlord refuses to accept the rent, saying that the transfer procedures have not been completed. Can the three tenants pay on behalf of the landlord using the landlord's account name? [Answer by Lawyer Ya Xia] Can terminate the lease on the grounds of completely subletting and owing rent. If you have not signed another lease contract with the owner, then you must vacate the house. There is no rental relationship between the three tenants and the landlord, so there is no way to confirm it. There is no rental relationship, so there is no rent problem. I think saving is useless.

Sincerely ask for a job One Teacher: Thank you for your instructions and hard work. I read the words "Young people can work hard and will have a future. You must not become negative due to unemployment," which made my heart suddenly surge with enthusiasm and courage. How can I keep working hard! I have received secondary education and love literature. Recently, I became unemployed and wandered in Shanghai. In today's high prices, I have no relatives and my life cannot be sustained. Looking forward to the future, it is really bleak. I am now willing to work as an apprentice in a cultural organization, regardless of salary. I hope that people in the community will sympathize and help, and I will never forget it. I respectfully send An Zhang Rongbang (Correspondence address: No. 483, Henan Middle Road)

### Famine in Germany

— Translated by Shi

A young man who is only fourteen years old, just because his father secretly ate the overnight food at home, he wanted to harm his own father. This unethical thing happened because of the pain, hunger, and hatred. The same thing is happening in Germany.

Another example is that a young woman wrote a letter to a newspaper reporter after she was heartbroken. She wanted to ask the reporter to tell her about the divorce procedures. As for the reason for her heartbreak, it was only because her husband secretly got up in the middle of the night one day and ate all the ration for the next day.

So the newspaper reporter wrote a letter to the young woman saying:

"Please forget the word divorce. Next time, just put a lock on the tree so that there will be no loss. This is a common problem. Thousands of women are troubled by similar things. At the same time, this is not what we men want to do. There is really no way to think about it! However, this is also your responsibility. Why didn't you take precautions in advance and not distribute the food equally to your family?"

This fourteen-year-old youth is now studying at a commercial school run by Christians. In general, welfare workers think so. If he is kept at home to live with his father again, it is very dangerous, because he hates his father so much. One day, (the day the incident happened), he childishly said to Hui School: "I stole a piece of bread, and exchanged that piece of bread for this package of poison. With the package of poison, I am going to kill my father." His classmates told their teacher about this, and the teacher, because he could not bear the innocent child being punished by law, asked the school workers to invite a few welfare workers. According to the results of the investigation by these welfare workers, the main reason was that his father ate the food that he should have been rationed.

### Bottled Seclusion

— Liuyun

Qi Biaojia's Yushan Note records: "In the past, Shentu Youya, who released clouds and springs, often carried a bottle and jumped into the bottle from time to time, known as 'bottled seclusion'." In today's Shanghai, where the housing shortage is serious, I hate that Shentu's art has not been passed down. Otherwise, as long as everyone has a bottle, this serious housing shortage will no longer be a housing shortage.

### Talking About Juvenile Police

— Jin

Today, the newspaper published a piece of news saying that when the juvenile police went to the restaurant to inspect the wine and dishes, they "lost their manners" due to the laughter of the guests, and it was extremely difficult to perform their duties.

We know that juvenile police were originally a group of people wandering the streets; we also know that juvenile police should not be despised by others when performing their duties, and should not be ridiculed by others because of their "background". However, judging from what has happened, we really can't imagine what kind of attitude those diners had towards the juvenile police.

Just imagine: a group of juvenile police who usually use preserved radishes as dishes (quoting a certain newspaper) walk into those prosperous banquet places to work, and are still scorned and laughed at by the diners. How should they feel?

Originally, a banquet costing four million dollars was not taken seriously by some people. "I have money, what's it to you!" They sneered at the inspection of the juvenile police, thinking it was a "novel" thing, why bother to pay attention to it?

In order to prevent some people from being too happy, and in order to make the thrift order successfully implemented, I hope that the juvenile police will not be afraid of ridicule and serve the public; and I hope that the authorities can give the juvenile police appropriate power to deal with those illegal incidents. We believe that juvenile police should have a minimum of "dignity" _ that is: personal dignity.
