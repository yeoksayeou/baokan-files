### Important Resolutions of the National Economic Council: Deadline for Declaring Foreign Deposits; Violators Will Be Sentenced to Imprisonment Upon Discovery

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Draft Regulations on the Declaration and Registration of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by Chinese Citizens has been approved by the 14th regular meeting of the National Economic Council this afternoon, the 4th. It will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and then to the National Government Committee for passage. Subsequently, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, after which it can be implemented. Regarding the issue of overseas deposits of Chinese citizens, the government is determined to enact "Measures for Requisitioning and Borrowing Foreign Exchange Assets of the People." Diplomatic channels have been pursued with relevant countries, but cooperation has not been achieved, and implementation has been difficult. Recently, in his remarks, Wedemeyer mentioned that the assets of Chinese citizens in the United States have not been utilized. Those unaware of the facts even claim that the person in charge of this matter is himself a holder of overseas deposits. The passage of this draft demonstrates the government's determination to address the issue of overseas deposits held by Chinese citizens. The implementation of this plan will also invisibly increase the foreign exchange power of the national banks. It is hoped that foreign countries can provide diplomatic cooperation to enable its realization. This plan was seriously discussed at today's meeting. The full text is as follows:

(1) All citizens of the Republic of China, except those who resided abroad before July 7, 1937, or who operated legitimate businesses abroad before the same date, shall declare and register their foreign exchange assets deposited abroad as of the date of promulgation and implementation of these regulations, within 30 days after the date of promulgation and implementation of these regulations, according to the prescribed forms, to the Central Bank. Foreign exchange acquired after the promulgation of these regulations shall be registered within 30 days from the date of acquisition.

(2) According to the provisions of the preceding article, citizens of the Republic of China who are currently residing abroad shall register all their foreign exchange assets with the local consulate.

(3) The term "citizens of the Republic of China" as used in these regulations includes natural persons and legal entities.

(4) The term "foreign exchange assets" as used in these regulations includes cash, demand and time deposits in foreign currencies, gold coins deposited abroad, raw gold, and any payment rights obtained from abroad (such as foreign currency securities, stocks, bonds, land deeds, insurance policies, annuities, etc. issued by the Chinese or foreign governments).

(5) In accordance with these regulations, foreign exchange assets that should be registered include foreign exchange assets held by foreign natural persons or foreign registered legal entities acting as agents, trustees, or brokers for Chinese citizens. Regardless of whether such assets are jointly owned or jointly managed with foreign natural persons or foreign legal entities, the portion owned or managed by citizens of the Republic of China shall be registered.

(6) From the date of promulgation and implementation of these regulations, except as provided in Articles 7 and 8, citizens of the Republic of China shall not transfer foreign exchange assets in any way to any natural person or legal entity at home or abroad.

(7) For foreign exchange assets registered in accordance with these regulations, the income from deposits and foreign assets or the proceeds from sales may be retained in addition to a certain amount permitted according to the following provisions, and all remaining amounts shall be transferred to the Central Bank account in the name of the original user or holder: 1. Living expenses for oneself or family members residing abroad; 2. Medical expenses for treatment of illnesses of oneself or family members abroad; 3. Tuition and living expenses for children studying abroad; 4. Travel expenses for oneself or family members traveling abroad and returning to the country; 5. Funds necessary for operating legitimate agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining businesses. The above provisions are limited to those who are already abroad before the promulgation of these measures, and the amount to be retained will be determined separately by the Ministry of Finance.

(8) Deposits transferred to the Central Bank account, in addition to being exchanged for legal tender according to personal wishes, may be used to purchase permissible imported goods or for other legitimate purposes, subject to the approval of the import license. If the imported materials mentioned in the preceding paragraph are production tools, the government shall provide convenience for the establishment and transportation of factories.

(9) Any citizen of the Republic of China who fails to declare and register their foreign exchange assets in accordance with the provisions of these regulations or makes false declarations shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years and have their foreign exchange assets confiscated.

(10) These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

### Streamlining Provincial Enterprises Based on Common Principles; Continued Loans and Purchases for Autumn Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 4th] In addition to discussing and passing the Draft Regulations on the Declaration and Registration of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by Chinese Citizens at the regular meeting of the National Economic Council on the 4th, the main agenda items included measures for autumn cocoon loans and silk purchases. During the discussion of this case, the opinions at the meeting were divided into two factions. Xu Baiyuan, Liu Hangchen, Chen Lifu, and others believed that the decision to stop loans and purchases was made after the new foreign exchange measures were promulgated. An abrupt cessation would have too great an impact on the livelihoods of silkworm farmers. Jian Guansan and others believed that if loans and purchases of silk were to continue, the beneficiaries might not necessarily be the real producers. At the same time, if silk could be purchased, why not soybeans from the Northeast and tobacco from Henan? The meeting resolved: In order to maintain the livelihoods of silkworm farmers, seven measures were passed, and in principle, loans and purchases would continue. In addition, a major case was the request from industrial and commercial entities in Shanghai to increase the quota for diesel fuel in the third quarter. Weng Wenhao and others advocated for an increase, and it was resolved that the Import and Export Management Committee should submit a final decision to the National Economic Council based on the actual monthly needs of steamers and factories. The general principles for streamlining provincial enterprises were also passed in principle at the meeting and are largely the same as the measures for handling state-owned enterprises, namely, that except for special circumstances where it is necessary for the provincial government to operate, other provincial enterprises should be sold in the form of stocks. However, for matters related to the interests of the people, the equity should not be controlled by a small number of people. In addition to the financial construction and other departments such as the audit office and the accounting office, provincial enterprise organizations should also participate in the handling agencies. In addition, cases such as the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Program" and "Measures for Rural Revitalization" were resolved to be deferred. The case of the price adjustment formula for public enterprises was left for discussion at the next meeting. Today's meeting was chaired by President Zhang, and Chen Qitian reported on the current price and yarn price situation. Xu Baiyuan also reported on the foreign exchange balance work and was quite satisfied with the income and expenditure situation.

Measures to Assist Silk Production and Sales

[Another Telegram] The National Economic Council passed the following measures on the 4th to assist silk production and sales in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and to maintain the livelihoods of silkworm farmers: (1) In order to assist silk production and sales in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and to maintain the livelihoods of silkworm farmers, all loans for autumn silk cocoons in 1947 will still be handled in accordance with the original plan. National banks and bureaus will provide loans to silk factories to purchase cocoons and purchase raw silk at a price determined according to actual costs. (2) Silk factories purchasing autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang shall determine cocoon prices separately according to the rural conditions and fresh cocoon quality in various places. The maximum price shall not exceed 1 million yuan per dan. (3) Regarding the spring loan portion, the Silk Coordination and Guidance Association shall be responsible for supervising the loan factories and manufacturers to complete the reeling of all purchased raw silk on schedule in accordance with the original plan and contract, limited to the end of October of this year. (4) The Silk Coordination and Guidance Association shall immediately be responsible for assessing the reeling costs of each silk factory, determining the purchase price of spring silk, and notifying the bank to handle it accordingly. The reeling labor and other expenses for autumn cocoons should be strictly assessed. (5) The Ministry of Economic Affairs should pay attention to changes in silk prices in the market. All silk manufacturers and vendors shall not arbitrarily raise silk prices during this reeling and purchase period. Violators shall be severely punished. (6) All losses incurred due to loans for the purchase of raw silk shall be borne by the national treasury in accordance with the original plan. This loss shall be directly requested by the Central Trust of China from the Ministry of Finance for allocation. (7) The measures to assist silk production and sales in 1948 shall be formulated separately in strict accordance with the newly established import and export trade measures and foreign exchange management measures to encourage manufacturers to be self-reliant.

### Youth Party National Representatives Discuss Diplomacy and Domestic Politics

[Central News Agency, This City] The National Congress of the Youth Party held a general meeting yesterday, both in the morning and afternoon, to discuss political proposals. Various issues concerning domestic and foreign affairs were thoroughly reviewed. Summarizing the views of the delegates to the Congress, it was generally advocated that unequal treaties that have not yet been revised should be completed as soon as possible. Lost territories that have not yet been recovered should also be negotiated and recovered through diplomatic channels as soon as possible. A good-neighborly and friendly foreign policy should be adopted toward all friendly nations. The policy toward Japan should aim to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggressive ideology and the reconstruction of aggressive military forces. Based on this goal, special attention should be paid to Japanese education and culture, and it was also advocated that effective control should continue after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan until Japan becomes a truly democratic country. Regarding domestic political issues, the proposals from delegates from various places focused on the opening of local political power. It was generally believed that the government had long promised to open local political power, but so far, except for one Youth Party member in each of Sichuan and Taiwan provinces serving as a provincial committee member without real power, there has been no further development trend. Therefore, proposals were made to negotiate with the government to realize the opening of local political power as soon as possible. The Congress will continue to convene today to discuss economic issues.

### List of Candidates for the Democratic Socialist Party to Be Submitted Before the 15th

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party held an interim Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Zhang Junmai, with the participation of key members such as Xu Chuanlin, to discuss issues, mainly to review the party's internal candidates. According to Zhang Junmai, "The entire list of candidates will be submitted before September 15th. The proportion of representatives among the parties is roughly 'three-one-one-one.' Currently, it has been decided to submit the list first for review. If there are any improprieties, they can be changed. The party will first propose two to three times the number of people, then conduct its own review, and finally decide on the list. This work has been going on for a long time. In order, the National Assembly candidates will be produced first, followed by the Legislative Yuan members, all of whom will be submitted before mid-month. Someone from the Kuomintang did hope that I would run for Shanghai Legislative Yuan member, but it is still under consideration."

[Another Dispatch] Feng Jinbai, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Democratic Socialist Party, will depart today to serve as an advisor to the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. The position of Deputy Minister has been resolved to be succeeded by Wang Shixian.

### Hong Kong Chinese Election Issue Awaits Final Decision from London

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] A spokesman for the Hong Kong government said: The plan for local Chinese residents to hold National Assembly representative election voting in Hong Kong is inconsistent with international law. Whether Chinese residents can hold elections is awaiting final decision from London.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 4th] Officials participating in the occupational or women's groups election in district elections should not be restricted in law or in reason. The General Election Office recently issued an interpretation explaining the reasons.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The China Merchant Marine Officers Association, the China Marine Engineers Association, and the China Maritime Pilots Federation, and other five major senior maritime groups, in order to fight for seats as National Assembly representatives and legislators, started a third petition to relevant agencies such as the Legislative Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, and the Ministry of Social Affairs on the 4th.

### Song Ziliang and Others Depart for England

### Strict Review of Foreign Exchange Continues; Restrictions or Termination of Dispatching Personnel Abroad; Measures Have Been Decided and Will Be Implemented Soon

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 4th] A responsible person in charge of foreign exchange matters told our reporter on the 4th: The purpose of the new foreign exchange policy is to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to achieve a balance of payments. After the implementation of the new measures, overseas remittances and export exchange settlements have been more enthusiastic than before, and the figures for foreign exchange income have therefore increased. However, in order to be cautious, the government still cannot but strictly review applications for foreign exchange, slowing down those that can be slowed down and rejecting those that can be rejected in order to save foreign exchange. On the revenue side, the main thing is export exchange settlement. The impact of the new measures on exports may not be fully seen until three months later. Therefore, foreign exchange review will be difficult to relax within three months, so that the government will restrict or stop sending people abroad for observation, advanced studies, and travel this year. These measures have been decided and will be implemented soon. Generally, applications will be properly approved unless there is a special need. The person in charge also pointed out that the cessation of the exchange between the pound sterling and the US dollar also has a considerable impact on our foreign exchange. Most of our exports are sold to Southeast Asia, which uses the pound sterling area, while most of our imports come from the United States. Our foreign exchange expenditure is mostly in US dollars. After the pound sterling cannot be easily converted to US dollars, the need for US dollars does not decrease, and the pound sterling cannot replace the US dollar, resulting in a relative shortage of US dollars. Therefore, the expenditure of US dollars must be more tightly controlled, and reducing expenditure is essential. However, it is hoped that this new measure can greatly improve export trade, eliminate the foreign exchange black market and stop smuggling, and then the foreign exchange income will increase, and the review of foreign exchange applications can be relaxed. In addition, since its establishment in May of this year, the Executive Yuan Foreign Exchange Review Committee has received more than 600 foreign exchange applications to date. The committee meets once a week and reviews an average of 15 cases each time. About 200 cases have been reviewed and completed, and the review is being accelerated.

[Another Telegram] After the foreign exchange control measures were passed, yarn prices and US dollars fluctuated slightly. President Zhang believes that it is necessary to review this phenomenon and has recently ordered the Financial Group of the National Economic Council and the National Foreign Exchange Balance Fund Committee to maintain close contact and study countermeasures, and to hold a meeting every Thursday, convened by Yu Hongjun.

### Minister Wang Departs for the United States via Shanghai to Attend the Second Session of the United Nations General Assembly; The United States Hopes That Japan's "Strategic Security" Can Be Guaranteed by a Peace Treaty; China and Australia Advocate Lowering Japan's Economic Level

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 4th] Wang Shijie, the chief representative of our delegation to the second session of the United Nations General Assembly, will depart for Shanghai by the Qiantang Express at 8:00 am on the 5th, and fly to the United States on a Pan American Airlines plane on the 6th. Zhou Qianchong, Feng Jinbai, Hu Qingyu, Zhang Yuanchang, Guo Changlu, and Zhu Xinmin, consultants and specialists of the delegation, will accompany him. Guo has already left for Shanghai today.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] A State Department spokesman said today that the Australian report that the United States had agreed to accept the proposal of the Canberra Conference, that the first step in Washington's future peace conference with Japan should be determined by the foreign ministers of the countries concerned, and then drafted by experts, is not yet decided. However, the foreign ministers of the Pacific Allies will come to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly on September 16, and if they wish, they can come to Washington to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. The date of the peace conference with Japan is still undetermined.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] An authoritative official here said: The United States intends to fully guarantee Japan's "strategic security" from any aggression by the victorious countries in the peace treaty with Japan. Whether the United States should be solely responsible for the security of Japan after its demilitarization, or whether it is a common task of the Allies, needs to be decided with other countries after the peace negotiations begin. If this matter becomes the responsibility of the United States, the matters required to protect Japan will be determined by the US military.

Other officials pointed out: The issue of "full protection" of Japan depends on whether Japan can be placed within the range of the US long-range air force, or whether Allied or US military bases need to be established near its coast. If it is considered necessary to establish bases, it will become a matter of negotiating a defense treaty with Japan, including the defense clauses of the main treaty. This depends on whether the United States is solely responsible or the Allies are jointly responsible. Regarding the peace conference, the Soviet Union wants the four major powers to draft the peace treaty. The United States is now likely to take action first, inviting all relevant countries to hold an eleven-nation conference, but still hopes that the Soviet Union will change its attitude. If the Soviet Union does not participate, it will not cause difficulties. Regarding the issue of compensation, if the Far Eastern Commission is still unable to break its deadlock, it will be submitted to the peace conference for discussion. On issues such as political control of Japan and Japan's economic level, it will be difficult for the peace conference to reach a consensus. Australia and China will insist that its economic level should be lower than that of other countries. Although the Far Eastern Commission has agreed that Japan can maintain its economic level in 1930-34, there are still disputes over how to achieve this level.

### Today's Siam (Read Yesterday)

— Our Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang

3. The Issue of Overseas Chinese Participating in Domestic General Elections Recently, the National Government ordered overseas Chinese to prepare to participate in the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators, which has aroused suspicion from the Siamese government. The government has not yet obstructed the election affairs responsibly prepared by Consul General Sun Binggan, but the Siamese Parliament has repeatedly raised questions at meetings, pointing out that foreigners holding elections in Siam violate international law. Due to the occurrence of the election issue, the Siamese government has also paid attention to the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese. Our embassy has not yet taken formal action on this issue, but it is generally believed that this election issue may soon become a diplomatic issue.

4. The Immigration Issue The influx of overseas Chinese is another important issue. After the signing of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty, the Siamese government insisted that immigration should be limited. Based on the average number of overseas Chinese entering during the war, when the number was the lowest, the Siamese government plans to stipulate a limit of 10,000 people per year, but our ambassador refuses to accept this limit. Although there have been several negotiations, there have been no results. It was finally decided that the quota should be set at 10,000 people for the six-month period from June to December of this year, and the restrictions for next year will be negotiated in the future.

5. The Issue of Rice Mills Being Nationalized During the short period that the reporter stayed in Bangkok, overseas Chinese were discussing that the Siamese government might nationalize all rice mills in the country. These rice mills are almost all owned by Chinese people. Rice mills are called "fire mills" in Siam. Due to operating these rice mills, Chinese merchants in Siam almost completely control the national rice market. Recently, due to the smuggling of rice out of Bangkok, there was a rice shortage and the price of rice soared. As a result, rumors of the nationalization of "fire mills" spread in Bangkok's political circles. As of now, the Siamese authorities have not taken any action on this matter, but if any action is taken, the economic interests of overseas Chinese in Siam will be fatally hit.

Foreign travelers who arrive in Siam for the first time can easily feel that Siamese nationalism is growing. Certain parts of Bangkok show modern symbols, with wide roads and various monuments deeply imprinted on the minds of foreign travelers. Their architectural styles seem deliberately contrived, making foreign travelers feel at first glance that Siam is a modern, democratic, and progressive country. Bangkok's airport is one of the best airports in Asia, and the area is much wider and more complete than Shanghai's airport. When your car drives about twenty miles and approaches the suburbs, you will see the first large monument - the Martyrs' Memorial, which commemorates the fallen soldiers in the last war, but the Siamese army did not actually participate in the war. Continuing to move towards the city, you will see the second monument - the Constitution Monument, which was erected to commemorate the promulgation of the Constitution and the realization of democracy, near the Royal Hotel where the reporter was staying. However, in fact, democracy is still an empty word in today's Siam.

However, looking at the wide and clean roads and the towering monuments, you cannot help but admire the spirit of the Siamese government and the Siamese people in building this one of the newest cities in Asia. Travelers from Shanghai and Nanjing hope that one day they can make the same efforts to build an equally beautiful city in both Beijing and Shanghai. (To be continued)

### As the International Situation Becomes More Perilous, the United Nations Should Seek Countermeasures; Wu Tiecheng's Remarks to Foreign Reporters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Yesterday was the second anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng made a statement to a foreign reporter, saying that the current international situation is becoming more perilous, and the European situation is even more serious than the eve of the Second World War. The situation in the Far East is also very tense. The Chinese Communist rebellion involves international relations. The Netherlands and Indonesia are still fighting, and the Viet Minh cannot reach a compromise with the French. Although the Japanese have expressed obedience to the Allied joint control, they are actually trying to rise again. As the Cantonese saying goes, "playing the pig to eat the tiger." The United Nations should quickly prepare a world security plan to avoid being destroyed by a more tragic war.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The Hebei military command structure will be reorganized. To strengthen its active forces and monitor the Communist bandits in the triangular area of Pingnan, Pingjin, and Bao, the military authorities have decided to move the Pacification Commissioner's Office, currently located in Baoding, to Fengtai.

Case of Substandard Military Flour; Supervisory Yuan Ascertains Responsibility; Manufacturers and Supervisors to be Impeached

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Beiping Headquarters previously telegraphed Beijing to investigate the poor quality of military flour. Li Shijun, a specially appointed supervisor from the Supervisory Yuan, conducted a thorough investigation and found that the responsibility had been ascertained. The poor quality of the flour was indeed a fact. The manufacturer was Fuxin Flour Mill, with a total of 94,000 bags. The grain was allocated by the Ministry of Food in Shanghai to the Joint Logistics Headquarters' Shanghai Port Command for acceptance and transported to North China to urgently supply military food. According to the past standard for wheat exchange between the Ministry of Food and the Joint Logistics Department, every 100 jin of wheat, after deducting 20 jin of bran and 5 jin of miscellaneous waste, should produce 75 jin of pure flour. The quality and content of the military flour transported to the north this time differed greatly from the above standard. As for the responsibilities of the military flour manufacturer and supervisors in this case, it is reported that the Supervisory Yuan will file an impeachment in accordance with the law.

Chen Cheng in Shenyang: The Focus of Bandit Suppression in the Future Will Undoubtedly Be in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] "The focus of bandit suppression in the future will undoubtedly be in the Northeast," said Chen Cheng, in his capacity as chairman, at the closing ceremony of the Liaoning Provincial Administrative and Educational Conference on the 4th, analyzing the current war situation and the situation in the Northeast. Chen stated that bandit suppression is the only way to safeguard our international status. The work of bandit suppression in Shandong and Shaanxi is about to be completed, and the focus of bandit suppression in the future will undoubtedly be in the Northeast. Some say that the government will abandon the Northeast, but this is a huge mistake because the Northeast is of utmost importance to the safety of North China and Northwest China, and even affects the safety of the whole country and the world. In the past, Communist bandits have launched five offensives in the Northeast, and of course, their sixth offensive will inevitably be difficult to avoid. However, the government has made full preparations and will never allow them to succeed. I attach great importance to the rectification of military discipline, and we should provide good guidance to the youth's academic style and ideology. Chen also stated that our country's revolution can be divided into two stages. The first stage is to strive for national survival and overthrow imperialism, and the second stage is to realize democracy, which requires overthrowing the Communist Party. In addition, corrupt officials are also the objects of our revolution.

Editorial: The Lushun-Dalian Issue and the Relationship Among the United States, China, and the Soviet Union

On the 14th of last month, the US State Department once again sent a note to Moscow, demanding that the Soviet Union return Dalian to China and open it as an international free port. The Soviet Union categorically rejected this request and stated that it would not be responsible for protecting interests there. At the same time, the Soviet merchant ship "Erich" sailed to Shanghai from the Soviet Union again, disregarding our country's government orders and arbitrarily docking in the temporarily closed port of Dalian, and transferring passengers and goods in our country's coastal ports, infringing on our country's coastal navigation rights. Although these two matters are different in nature, they are both sufficient to expose the Soviet Union's intention to renege on its promises and seize Dalian.

The Soviet Union's reasons for refusing the US request are: (1) The Sino-Soviet agreement on Dalian stipulates that Dalian belongs to the government established by the Lushun naval base "during the state of war against Japan." At present, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been established, so the "state of war against Japan" has not yet ended; (2) The Chinese government's civil administration has not yet fulfilled its tasks in Dalian, and the Soviet government sees no reason to change the current government in Dalian. The above two reasons do not contain any new factors but are merely reiterating the reasons stated in its note of February 27 this year, and there is no need for us to refute them again. However, whether the Lushun-Dalian issue can be resolved reasonably is a major test of Sino-Soviet relations, and for the sake of peace in the Far East, we still hope that the Soviet Union will listen to China's opinions.

China and the Soviet Union...

Regarding the Sino-Soviet agreement on Dalian, our country, both the government and the public, firmly hope that both parties will earnestly implement it. The US State Department also sent a note to China and the Soviet Union on January 3 this year, requesting that the Sino-Soviet agreement on Dalian be implemented so that Dalian can be managed by the Chinese government as soon as possible, normalized, and serve as an international free port. The Chinese government not only agrees with this but has also stepped up negotiations with the Soviet Union in the hope that this long-standing unresolved issue can be resolved reasonably as soon as possible. However, in addition to refusing the United States by letter, the Soviet Union has taken further practical action and formally notified the US authorities in March of this year that Dalian has been put under military management. Therefore, since March, US naval vessels have not entered the port of Dalian. The United States has always maintained a patient attitude, and it was not until August 14 that it sent another note to the Soviet Union, demanding that Dalian be returned to China so that it could be opened as a free port, but now it has been rejected by the Soviet Union again. The United States has negotiated with the Soviet Union repeatedly over the Dalian issue, but the result can be said to have been a complete failure. We do not yet understand how the United States will implement its policy of opening Dalian, which is actually a part of the open-door policy.

The Chinese government has also made great efforts to take over Lushun-Dalian. Our country's representative, General Zhao Gongwu, negotiated with the Soviet Union and was said to have reached three agreements: (1) After Dalian is taken over by the National Army, it will be a free port, open to trade and shipping from all countries; (2) The Soviet Union will enjoy the privilege of renting wharves and warehouses; (3) The administrative power of Dalian belongs to the Chinese government. Unfortunately, this rumored agreement has never become a reality and has been delayed until today without a reasonable resolution. In June of this year, our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to draw the Soviet side's attention, specially issued a public statement clarifying the process of negotiating the takeover of Lushun-Dalian, and pointed out that the Soviet Union has been trying every possible means to obstruct our country's acceptance of Lushun-Dalian and disregarding the obligations imposed on the Soviet side by the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Although the Standing Committee of the Senate once resolved to request the government to appeal to the United Nations Security Council regarding the issue of receiving Lushun-Dalian based on the facts, our diplomatic authorities have always wanted to seek a reasonable solution through diplomatic channels. The Soviet Union also issued a statement regarding our country's statement, making unreasonable arguments and showing no sincerity in fulfilling the treaty. Our country was forced to announce in late last month that the port of Dalian would be temporarily closed from that day on, and ships of any nationality would not be allowed to enter or leave the port. However, Soviet ships continued to travel between Dalian and Shanghai as before. Although our country's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao warned the Soviet Union, pointing out that this was destroying our country's coastal navigation rights and trade rights, and said that "in the future, Soviet ships from Dalian to Shanghai may not be allowed to enter Shanghai by the Shanghai Customs," the Soviet merchant ship "Erich" still sailed from Dalian to Shanghai with cargo and passengers. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's behavior not only attempts to seize our Lushun-Dalian but also openly infringes on our country's coastal navigation rights and trade rights, which makes it difficult for us to tolerate.

Regarding the issue of taking over and opening Dalian, putting aside all theories and speaking only from a legal point of view, the Soviet Union should have returned Dalian to China and opened it as a free port long ago. Although the agreement on Dalian stipulates the phrase "during the war against Japan," it cannot be considered to be still in the "war against Japan" at present. According to the provisions of international law, after Japan surrendered, the period of war against Japan became the past; and the Soviet government once sent a note to the Chinese government on May 23 last year, formally notifying our country that all Soviet troops had completely withdrawn from our country's Northeast, and the Soviet government believed that the war against Japan had ended, which can also be clearly proven in this note. Moreover, the United States also announced on New Year's Day this year that the "state of war" had ended, and the Soviet Union had no reason not to return Lushun-Dalian to China. The Soviet Union's garrison in Dalian has no basis in treaty. Only during the Great War, the commanders of the Chinese and Soviet armies concluded an agreement allowing the Soviet Union to use Dalian as a base for fighting against Japan. Now that the war against Japan has long ended, and it has been almost two years, although the peace treaty with Japan has not been signed, it cannot be considered that the state of war against Japan still exists. As for our country's negotiations with the Soviet Union on the takeover of Lushun-Dalian, we have made great efforts, and the reason for the deadlock is that the Soviet Union secretly assists the Chinese Communists and obstructs it in every possible way. As Mayor Xu Xuecui of Dalian said in Beijing in early February of this year: "I also frequently met with Soviet Ambassador Petrov in Beijing. The ambassador asked when to go to take over? Both land and sea routes can be taken, but the problem lies with the Communist army. If only a small number of people are sent, they cannot take over; if troops are sent to cooperate, a major conflict with the Communist army will inevitably occur." Our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated in a public statement: "The administration of Lushun-Dalian has not been taken over by the Chinese government to this day. One reason is that the Soviet government has repeatedly refused to allow the Chinese government's troops to enter Lushun-Dalian; the second reason is that after the Soviet side refused the Chinese government's troops to land in Dalian, the Chinese Communists established a strong military force near Lushun-Dalian to obstruct the Chinese government's takeover."

Based on this, the Soviet Union has no reason to refuse to return Dalian to China and open it as a free port. As for the Soviet merchant ships disregarding our country's government orders and blatantly infringing on our country's coastal navigation rights and trade rights, it is an unfriendly and illegal act. However, it must be known that any act that does not comply with treaty obligations and attempts to infringe on the sovereignty of other countries is sufficient to constitute a source of international chaos. For the sake of the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and for the sake of peace in the Far East, we have to shout loudly to awaken the attention of the Soviet government. Whether the Soviet Union can become an important factor in creating world peace and whether the Soviet Union abides by the Sino-Soviet Treaty are now facing a major test. At the same time, we must also awaken the US government and the public. The situation in the Far East is changing dramatically, and the root causes of this situation are planted in the Yalta Conference. The United States should bear its moral responsibility. If we want to make amends now, the United States must implement the open-door policy in the Far East, especially in China's Northeast, which cannot be achieved by a vague note. Since the US negotiations with the Soviet Union over the Dalian issue have repeatedly failed, it is self-evident how the US and China should strengthen cooperation to prevent future disasters.

Western European Economic Crisis Rapidly Growing; US Considers Temporary Assistance; Aims to Implement Before End of Year; Plans to Establish Monetary Reserve Fund to Stabilize European Finances

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett declared yesterday that the European economic situation is deteriorating even faster than expected, and the United States may need to take emergency measures before the Marshall Plan is implemented to prevent its collapse. This matter clearly needs to be done before the end of the year. Although Lovett did not directly state it, he strongly hinted that Congress may need to convene a special session this fall.

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Acting Secretary of State Lovett made an important statement at a press conference, saying that the United States is prepared to provide temporary financial assistance to Britain and Western Europe when possible, before the end of this year and before the Marshall Plan is completed, to cope with its rapidly growing economic crisis. He said that experts from the State Department and the Treasury Department are studying the possibility of establishing a monetary reserve fund to maintain European financial stability. The purpose of establishing a reserve fund is to use gold or US dollars as a reserve for the currencies of countries whose production is insufficient to maintain their value. Lovett also stated that this plan is still only in the research stage. Lovett's statement was made just hours after British Foreign Secretary Bevin advocated at the British Trades Union Congress in Southport, Lancashire, that the United States redistribute the gold stored in Fort Knox. The gold stored there is worth $21.6 billion, accounting for three-fifths of the world's total monetary gold reserves. Related parties believe that Lovett's remarks are the most important statement of US policy towards Europe since Secretary of State Marshall first proposed aid to Europe at Harvard University. Lovett did not specify what form the temporary financial assistance would take, or whether Congress would convene a special session to discuss the matter, but he frankly acknowledged that the European situation is rapidly deteriorating, and transitional temporary assistance is needed within a few months and cannot wait until next year. Lovett's statement is the first time that the US government has acknowledged that the timeline of the Marshall Plan cannot be applied due to the development of events. The original timeline of the Marshall Plan was based on next March as the earliest possible date for the plan to be approved by Congress. Although Lovett did not specify whether a special session of Congress was necessary, he said that the World Bank and the US Export-Import Bank may be able to meet some of the needs. He said: "Some temporary measures to obtain funds must be obtained, although I do not currently know where these funds will come from." Lovett also revealed that Kennan, chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Committee, met with Deputy Secretary of State Clayton and representatives of the 16-nation European economic conference in Paris and is scheduled to return to Washington tonight to report.

British Government Expresses Satisfaction with Lovett's Statement on Aid to Europe; Believes This Move Matches the Expectations of Western European Countries

[Reuters, London, 4th] British government officials and economic experts said that Britain expresses straightforward satisfaction with Deputy Secretary of State Lovett's announcement of temporary aid to Europe. Lovett's recognition that Europe should be dealt with strongly before the end of the year is in line with the estimates collectively or individually made by the 16 European countries. Recent telegrams from Paris all stated that the 16 countries discussing the aid to Europe plan are concerned that if the US Congress does not act before next spring, the Marshall Plan may be too late. Lovett's statement shows that the United States has officially recognized the urgency of the European economic situation. Before the US Congress is prepared to consider the report of the Marshall Plan, transitional action is needed to deal with the urgent situation.

Secretary of State Marshall Returns to Washington to Handle Backlogged Affairs

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Secretary of State Marshall returned to Washington today from the Brazilian capital to handle three weeks of backlogged affairs, the most important of which are the disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union over the Dalian issue and the peace treaty with Japan. According to the State Department, Marshall and Vandenberg will jointly broadcast tomorrow night, reporting on the achievements of the Pan-American Conference. It is said that in addition to the Dalian, Korean incident, and Japanese peace conference, Marshall has to deal with the resumption of the four-power negotiations on the Austrian and German peace treaties. What is particularly important is that the United Nations General Assembly will be convened in two weeks. In addition, the European recovery plan, the work undertaken by the United States, the possible changes in US policy towards China, and the general impact of the British financial crisis on the occupation policy all need to be studied by Marshall. General Wedemeyer will also submit suggestions on US policy towards China, and the criticisms of Wei by people from all walks of life in China need to be explored by Marshall.

US Supplies Shipped to Turkey

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said that genuine military supplies will be shipped from the United States to Turkey in a few weeks. He refused to comment on the rumors that aircraft, torpedo boats, weapons, and ammunition would be shipped in October. Lovett said that half of the $100 million in aid to Turkey has already been obtained. Supplies worth $3 million, mostly port roads and transportation equipment, have already been shipped or are on their way.

I fully realize that as long as extreme inequalities in education and culture exist, as they do between the countries of the world today, true security and lasting peace cannot be achieved. We must bring light to the most remote families in the less fortunate and darker countries. I believe that countries that are more advanced economically and educationally should bear a special responsibility for this. I wish your conference complete success and hope that you will be able to produce a feasible plan to provide adequate education to countries whose educational opportunities are limited due to economic and other circumstances."

Board of Directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture
Sends Five Members to the United States to Study Science

[Our Newspaper] The Board of Directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture has established a grant for overseas scientific research for many years. Before the war, it sent more than 200 scientific workers abroad for further study. During the Anti-Japanese War, this measure was temporarily suspended due to financial and transportation constraints. After the restoration, the association, recognizing the urgent need for talent in national construction, decided this spring, within the scope of the association's financial capacity, to restore the grant for overseas scientific research. This year, the designated subjects for funding are: (1) Soil Conservation, (2) Fertilizer Science, (3) Electronics, (4) Plastic Chemistry, and (5) Radiology (Medical), one person for each subject, with the research period tentatively limited to China. This year, about 50 people applied for this grant. The application documents were reviewed separately by experts, and the Board of Directors decided to select five candidates based on the review opinions. All are in the process of completing procedures for going abroad. The list of selected candidates, research topics, and research locations are as follows: (1) Soil Conservation, Yi, to the University of Missouri in the United States, to study the theory and implementation of soil conservation. (2) Fertilizer Science, Huang Dahe, to TVA in the United States, to study the production and application of superphosphate fertilizers. (3) Electronics, Wang Tianjuan, to the Illinois Institute of Technology in the United States, to study velocity modulation tubes and magnetrons for ultra-high frequency instruments and their frequency control and emission mechanisms. (4) Plastic Chemistry, Xu Chuan, to Lehigh University in the United States, to study the method of making plastics from gallnuts. (5) Radiology, Chen Renlie, to the University of California in the United States, to study the comparison of the medical efficacy of X-rays and high-energy particles.

Scholarship Application Forms
Should Be Collected by the School on Behalf of Students
Schools Should Not Refuse on Pretext

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee stipulates that students of all levels applying for scholarships must have their application forms collected from the school they are attending after the prescribed number of free or publicly funded scholarships has been met. It is reported that some schools in the city, due to insufficient free places or not having free places, refuse to issue application forms to students on the grounds of unclear application procedures, leaving poor students with no way to seek help. This phenomenon is cruel and a misfortune for the education sector. It is learned from the authorities that schools must not refuse to collect application forms on behalf of students. If such a refusal occurs again, students' parents can report the facts in writing to the committee and the Municipal Education Bureau, so that Mayor Wu and Speaker Shen can review and instruct on how to deal with the matter.

Newly Hired Teachers in National Schools
Should Fill Out Forms and Submit Them to the Education Bureau

The National Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau has issued forms for the teachers' schedules and salary verification forms for newly hired teachers in municipal national schools, which have already started. The department hopes that all schools will collect the forms immediately.

Charity Volleyball Games Are Exciting

After a Hard-Fought Five Sets, Yongsha Comes From Behind
Li Yagu Buys a Charity Ball for 10 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper] The charity volleyball game, organized by the gymnasium and the volleyball committee, featured the farewell performance of the Zhenya team from Peking. They met Yongsha at the gymnasium last night, attracting more than 2,000 spectators and creating unprecedented enthusiasm. During the game, a charity ball was auctioned off and bought by Li Yagu for 10 million yuan, demonstrating his enthusiasm. Tickets and charity balls raised a total of 24.94 million yuan, and after deducting 1.792 million yuan for necessary expenses, the net surplus of 23.148 million yuan was allocated to flood relief funds.

A Strong Team

The performance was unprecedentedly exciting. Zhenya had excellent offense and defense, especially the left and right smashes, which always hit the mark. The blocking and saving were just right, making them a truly strong volleyball team. Although Yongsha won, they exhausted all their strength. The final deciding set was particularly exciting and breathtaking. Zhenya won four out of five games, and Yongsha won once. Their southern expedition was a rewarding one. In the first women's performance, Fuhua defeated Shen Yan.

The Hard-Fought Process

In the main match, Zhenya played Yongsha, with Liu Hesheng and Zhang as referees. Zhi Qing from Zhenya did not play. From the beginning, the game was extremely tense. At the end of the first half, Yongsha led by 11 to 10. Yongsha continued to maintain a lead of two or three points. After 19 to 18, Yongsha scored three consecutive points and won the first set 21 to 18. The second set began with undiminished tension. Yongsha again gained the right to serve with 11 to 10. The visiting team scored to tie at 18. With further effort, they turned the game around 21 to 18 and won a set. In the third set, Zhenya fought with all their strength. Du Qi and his teammates frequently smashed fiercely. Zhenya led the first half 11 to 9. Yongsha tried hard to catch up, and the score was 15 to 16. However, Zhenya refused to let go and came from behind 21 to 16. In the fourth set, Zhenya relaxed, and Yongsha counterattacked. With the efforts of Dai Heng and Huang Qiqun, they led 9 to 1. Zhenya quickly caught up, but ultimately lost too many points and trailed 6 to 11 in the first half. The score was tied again at 21 to 10. In the final deciding set, Yongsha led 11 to 8 in the first half. After changing sides, Yongsha launched a full-scale attack and once led 14 to 11. Zhenya worked hard and surpassed them after the score was tied at 16, leading 19 to 18. The score was tied again at 20. Yongsha completed the great reversal with 22 to 20, winning the hard-fought battle three to two.

Over a Hundred Chinese and Foreign Men and Women Athletes
Participate in the Open Tennis Tournament
Unprecedented Event in the Local Tennis Community

Registration for the first Shanghai Open Tennis Championships closed on Wednesday, with more than a hundred participants, an unprecedented event in the Shanghai tennis community. There are 20 participants in the advanced singles, 33 in the intermediate singles, and as many as 26 in the junior singles for players under 20 years old. There are 10 women's singles players, 11 mixed doubles pairs, and 22 men's doubles pairs. All outstanding Chinese and foreign male and female tennis players in the city have joined. The youngest players in the junior group are only 14 years old, with three players aged 15, and the most players aged 16 to 18. The Tennis Committee, in order to encourage the participation of these young people, has provided all the balls for the matches. The chairman of the committee, Zhao Minheng, personally donated two dozens, and another two dozens were raised from members of the Sports Federation. All are semi-new balls that have only been hit two or three times, which are quite suitable for young people to use (because young people find new balls too heavy). The committee welcomes and appreciates other associations that are willing to donate semi-new balls. Miss Yang Weibin, the Hong Kong women's tennis champion, recently came to Shanghai and has also signed up to participate in the women's singles, and will partner with Wang Wenzheng to participate in the mixed doubles. Tao Guanqiu will team up with Miss Zhu Zhiying, the runner-up in the last women's tournament, to participate in this season's mixed doubles. The Tennis Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at noon today to discuss the order of each group and all competition arrangements. The most difficult thing this time is the lack of a basic venue, and there are so many participants, and the season is late, so it must be completed by early October at the latest. The order and other details will be announced later.

Purchasing of 1947 US Dollar Bonds
Limited to US Currency and US Exchange
Gold and Foreign Currencies Such as British Pounds Are Not Applicable

[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance recently stipulated that, starting immediately, the 1947 US Dollar Bonds can only be purchased with US currency cash or US exchange. British pounds and other foreign currencies, as well as gold, are not allowed for purchase. According to sources at the Central Bank, this matter is still under study. According to the new method of collecting gold and cash, the price of gold is 40 US dollars per tael, which conflicts with the authorities' previous regulation of purchasing US dollar bonds at 50 US dollars per tael. In fact, changes are inevitable.

In addition, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of all relevant parties in Beijing at 6 p.m. yesterday regarding the issue amount of short-term treasury bills for September. Once a decision is reached, the Central Bank will be instructed to resume sales.

According to related sources, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 76.8 billion yuan to the Bond Fund Supervision Committee in mid-August for the first payment of principal and interest on the first phase of treasury bills, which will be paid at the end of this month. This principal and interest, calculated at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, differs from the current market exchange rate by more than two times, and the Ministry of Finance will replenish the difference in full. The Ministry of Finance will allocate funds to the Fund Supervision Committee one month before each principal and interest payment. The committee will be responsible for safekeeping to maintain creditworthiness. The funds were originally intended to be deposited in commercial banks with good fundraising results, but recently, due to the government's implementation of a tight monetary policy, it has been decided that 70% will be deposited in national banks and 30% in commercial banks.

Procedures for Purchasing Foreign Cotton Completed
Deadline for Delivering Yarn to Promote Exports

[Our Newspaper] We have repeatedly published reports on the China Trust Bureau's purchase of foreign cotton arriving without import permits. It is now learned that the procedures for purchasing 36,486 bales of foreign cotton have been completed. The applicant manufacturers have signed sales contracts with the China Trust Bureau, and the China Trust Bureau has requested the Central Bank to remit the funds abroad at the original price, totaling approximately 6 million US dollars. The factories are currently clearing customs and taking delivery of the goods. Once the goods are officially weighed and inspected, the insurance fees, bank interest, and foreign exchange will be settled. Approximately 11,000 bales of the above-mentioned 36,000 bales of foreign cotton belong to applications made by the China Textile Corporation and various importers and cotton merchants, which will be spun by the Textile Construction Company on their behalf. Approximately 15,000 bales belong to applications made by various yarn factories, which will still be spun by the original applicant factories on their behalf. The processing fees and 10% profit have been determined to be 3 million yuan per 20-count yarn piece, which will be paid in advance in one lump sum when signing the processing contract. The China Trust Bureau, in order to accelerate the process and recover the foreign exchange as soon as possible, convened the Central Bank, Textile Construction Company, Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, Textile Regulation Committee, Export Management Committee, and Audit Department representatives for the fourth small group meeting on the 3rd (yesterday) at 3 p.m. Regarding the portion processed by the Textile Construction Company on their behalf, it was decided that half would be exported as cotton yarn and half would be exported as cloth, to be completed within two months. Regarding the portion processed by private yarn factories on their behalf, it was decided that each factory would immediately advance 10% of the finished yarn, approximately 2,000 pieces. The remaining 5,000 to 6,000 pieces would be delivered every half month, also to be completed within two months. Four-fifths of this amount would be exported as cotton yarn, and one-fifth would be exported as cloth. In order to expedite the process, the meeting decided to allow each processing factory to handle the export themselves. However, the sales countries and prices would still be subject to joint approval by the China Trust Bureau and the Textile Construction Company. In addition, in order to facilitate the promotion of various trademarks of yarn and cloth that are not yet popular, a very small portion is allowed to be sold on consignment. However, the full amount of foreign exchange must be delivered within one and a half months from the date of shipment. The Central Bank and the Textile Construction Company believe that the circumstances of this case are special, and they will provide various conveniences for the export procedures in order to recover the foreign exchange as soon as possible.

Rice Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday, a total of more than 6,300 piculs of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The majority of the arrivals were indica rice, while japonica rice was relatively scarce. Early thin-husked rice has almost disappeared, because the new early thin-husked rice has not yet been harvested. The earliest Southern japonica rice, such as Baige Yao and Zhonglv varieties, are being harvested, and stores are vying for purchases. The price of Southern japonica rice has risen sharply, continuing to surge 20,000 yuan, reaching the 50,000 yuan mark. The price of Northern japonica rice has also risen by more than 10,000 yuan. The rare and popular Baiyuan and Yinyuan varieties have soared by 20,000 yuan. New japonica rice has followed suit, rising by 10,000 yuan.

The price of soybean cake from Yingkou, however, fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan due to its shrunken color. The price of soybeans rose slowly and steadily, continuing to increase by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, with a solid foundation.

Mung beans from Shantou continued to arrive, and the market shape gradually tightened. Sorghum was highly sought after by wineries, thriving and rising again by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans rose steadily, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts, lacking demand, plummeted by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sesame lacked buyers and fell sharply by 10,000 yuan.

The national bond market declined again yesterday. Room 503 and others were buying, while room 538 and others were selling, with a total of about 7 million yuan. Class A and B bonds fell by 80,000 yuan. Class C bonds opened at 15,000 yuan in the morning, rising from 15,100 yuan to 14,200 yuan, and finally hovering around 14,600 yuan. As a result, Class A, B, and D bonds were 500 yuan lower than the previous closing price, Class C bonds fell slightly by 200 yuan, and Class E bonds fell by 800 yuan.

Foreign stocks were unsustainable yesterday, and small-cap stocks were even worse. Yeguang rose slightly due to the absorption by banking groups, while Jewish and foreign merchants were selling. Securities firms had mixed buying and selling. Although Wang Qi sold, Yu Mou absorbed a considerable amount of telephone, paper, and Yipi shares. Yisha opened at 87,000 yuan in the morning and closed at a low price of 83,000 yuan.

Taiwan Bank Regulations
Commercial Remittance Procedures

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] The Taiwan Bank's remittance business is still being conducted as usual. However, due to the small number of export goods, the current import and export values are not balanced, and commercial remittances must be approved after review before they can be remitted. According to the bank, its legal tender reserves are limited, and it is difficult to fully open remittances. Currently, it is estimated that monthly commercial remittances to Shanghai can reach more than 200 billion yuan in legal tender, while the bank's monthly legal tender reserves are only about 120 billion yuan, including 80 billion yuan in sugar funds, 15 billion yuan in Taiwan salt funds, 15 billion yuan in Taiwan coal funds, and 10 billion yuan in remittances from military and government agencies from Shanghai to Taiwan. Currently, the bank is approving commercial remittances to Shanghai at 2 billion to 3 billion yuan per day, based on the principle of living within its means. It is stipulated that remittances for textiles account for 60%, with a limit of 150 million yuan per household. Remittances for sugar and pastry account for 30%, with a limit of 100 million yuan per household. Other categories account for 10%, with a limit of 50 million yuan per household. Remittances from family members of civil servants are still handled as usual. In addition, the bank's current issuance amount is approximately 11.5 billion yuan in legal tender.

New Buyers Remain Cautious
The Shanghai Stock Market Is Sluggish

Yesterday, bulls in the Chinese stock market felt hopeless. Numbers 224 and 152 finally sold out in the immediate settlement. New buyers remained cautious. In a situation of desperation, the market finally closed at a low price. Commercial shares were favored by banking groups and continued to thrive. Jinglun, under deliberate suppression, first hit the limit down and then hit the limit up, which was a strange phenomenon. Arbitrage prices rose from low to high due to the small number of positions in the banking sector. Interest rates ranged from 8 to 12 cents.

Initially, the market opened higher due to the national bank's difference from the previous day. However, Shanghai Eternal Yarn listed at 252 yuan. Numbers 207 and 85 sold existing shares of Shanghai Eternal Yarn. Numbers 119 and 31 delivered, and the market declined immediately after opening. Although numbers 116 and 14 supported the market, they had no effect. Numbers 22 and 125 sold for immediate delivery, and numbers 76 and 232 sold for forward delivery, and the price fell to 240 yuan and 245 yuan. Numbers 116 and 224 maintained the market at low prices. Numbers 218 and 106 also absorbed existing shares of Shanghai Eternal Yarn, and the price rose to 251 yuan. The market then hovered, with numbers 76 and 235 selling, and numbers 223 and 224 still buying. Shanghai Eternal Yarn fluctuated between 147 yuan and 250 yuan.

After 10:30 a.m., the outside interest rate still opened at 19.5 cents and 24 cents, and people's confidence collapsed again. Number 105 and others closed out existing shares of Shanghai Eternal Yarn. In particular, the sale by numbers 152 and 224 was the most severe. Numbers 112 and others also closed out forward delivery shares. Retail buyers sold again near the closing price, and the price of Shanghai Eternal Yarn fell to a low of 235 yuan and 243 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 236 yuan and 245 yuan, and the closing call was flat and weak.

As a result, compared to the previous closing price, immediate settlement shares of Shanghai Eternal Yarn, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Zhongfa fell slightly. Xinhua fell by 10%, Meiya and Yonggong fell by half a percent, Tongyi and Lian remained flat, Commercial rose by half a percent, Xinya fell by 10%, Zhongfang fell by half a percent, Jinglun hit the limit down and then hit the limit up, rising slightly after squeezing up, and Innerwear rose slightly. The rest fell slightly. Forward delivery shares of Huafeng were flat, Meiya fell slightly, and Shanghai Eternal Yarn, Xinyi, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Yonggong rose slightly. Outside the market, old shares of Dasheng still rose, while Zhabei Huashang and Mainland Huacheng fell slightly.

The interest rate for existing and forward arbitrage transactions was slightly higher yesterday, ranging from about 8 cents to 12 cents. The discount for Shanghai Eternal Yarn was 7.2 yuan at the opening, with a high price of 7.8 yuan, a low price of 6.7 yuan, and a closing price of 6.8 yuan. The discount for Meiya was from 11.5 yuan to 13 yuan, for Xinyi from 3.5 yuan to 4 yuan, and for Xinguang from 4.5 yuan to 5.5 yuan.

Another news: Tongyi Yarn Factory has suspended trading from today to handle capital increase.

Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market Is Weak and Soft
Ample Chips on the Market, More Selling Than Buying

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was superficially cheerful because the Textile Adjustment Committee released a large amount of spot goods again the day before, and there were ample chips on the market. Moreover, local and out-of-town buyers did not absorb much, so the market was superficially cheerful. Among them, the price of fine yarn was particularly depressed after the negotiated price was reduced. As a result, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell to 17.5 million yuan, a further decrease of 600,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count special

### The Serious Situation of the Northeast's Four Major Industrial and Mining Problems Has Improved

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, came to Shenyang to inspect the industrial and mining sectors of the Northeast and resolve various industrial and mining problems. He is scheduled to hold another review meeting with various industrial and mining units and will leave Shenyang for Nanjing before the 10th. Mr. Sun stated that the greatness and importance of the Northeast lie in its industry and mining, as well as its grain production, but it suffered a major blow due to the disturbances this summer. The industrial and mining sectors are facing four major serious problems: security, capital, pit props, and food. Due to the unified understanding of the central and Northeast authorities and their best efforts, the situation has improved. The Executive Yuan has already approved the budget for the resumption and expansion of industrial and mining operations in the Northeast this year, and various emergency loans are mostly showing promise. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has obtained 1.5 billion yuan in circulating vouchers. The company plans to ship steel products to Shanghai successively before the end of the year to exchange for money to repay debts. In terms of food, more than 100,000 bags of flour have been purchased from Shanghai, and other grains have also been purchased. The central government is planning measures for pit props and other materials. Regarding the security issue, the threats to places like Beipiao and Benxi have been reduced, and the recovery of Xi'an will lead to even greater improvements. When Chief of General Staff Chen received representatives from various industrial and mining units, he expressed this determination, and the stability of the various industrial and mining areas will ensure that the staff will do their best. The work ethic of the employees in various industrial and mining areas in the Northeast is excellent. For example, various factories in Tiexi, Shenyang, have greatly expanded compared to when I came last winter. In addition, electricity may increase by a quarter before the end of November. Currently, two or three cities in southern Liaoning rely solely on the 45,000 kilowatts generated by Fushun. After Fushun uses more than 30,000 kilowatts for its own needs, 15,000 kilowatts are sent to Shenyang. Repairs to the Benxi and Chang-Shen lines are being accelerated to compensate for the inability of electricity from the Fengman Dam to come south.
