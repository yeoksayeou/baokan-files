### U.S. is Studying Aid to China Plan; Rumor Wei's Report Has Been Approved; Military Advisory Group Organization Will Be Expanded

[United Press Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] United Press had reason to believe on the 24th that U.S. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have approved Wedemeyer's report, advocating military and financial assistance to China. It is reported that they are currently studying the best way to implement this plan, namely, expanding the military advisory group stationed in China and granting loans to China. It is rumored that they are looking for a suitable American military officer to lead this plan. It is generally believed that Wedemeyer's report is largely similar to the Pulit Aid China theory published in "Life" magazine, but with slight differences in details. According to reports, Pulit advocated lending China US$1.3 billion in loans within three years, plus direct military assistance. As for the reasons why the United States has temporarily delayed the issuance of a statement based on the Wedemeyer report and the implementation of a new policy towards China, it is still unknown here. It is generally believed that the main reason is that Truman and his advisors are still considering the best strategy to implement this plan. The reasons under consideration include: How to extend the President's emergency administrative power regarding the U.S. military advisory group. The U.S. military advisory group stationed in China was established based on emergency wartime powers and has not been approved by Congress. If the military advisory group is expanded to the scope advocated by Wedemeyer, it must be approved by Congress. Before the entire plan is presented to Congress, whether economic assistance should be provided immediately based on the regulations of the Export-Import Bank, or it is better to wait for the congressional debate. Regarding the issue of publishing the aid to China plan, publishing the aid to China plan at this time will inevitably delay the implementation of Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Although the scope of the advisory group advocated by Wedemeyer has not been disclosed, it is generally believed that the advisory group will definitely be expanded. The current military group has only more than 400 people.

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] U.S. Congressman Judd arrived in Ping by plane from Korea at 1:40 p.m. on the 24th. At 3 p.m., personnel from the U.S. consulate held a meeting to listen to intelligence regarding North China. He planned to visit Li Zongren and various military and political leaders in Ping on the 24th. He will stay in Ping for five or six days. Judd said that he had been in China for many years and had a fixed Chinese name, and immediately wrote "Zhou Yide" in Chinese. According to reports, he has always advocated actively assisting the Chinese government and has repeatedly criticized the CCP. As early as 1939, he wrote an article in the Sunday Weekly criticizing that U.S. aid to China only accounted for 30% of global aid, and half of it was occupied by the CCP. He also said that the Communist Party was a secret weapon for the Japanese invasion of China.

### Issue of Minting Silver Coins; China and Mexico Have Not Yet Made Concrete Contact; Mexican Ambassador to China and Consultant Young Are Both in Shanghai

[United Press Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Foreign Deputy Minister Ye Gongchao commented on the Mexican Minister of Finance's statement that "Mexico may soon be minting silver coins for China," saying that there have been no negotiations between China and Mexico on this matter, and the Chinese government has not formally inquired with Mexico about the possibility of this agreement. When reporters asked, "Is the Chinese government interested in studying the possibility of this matter?" Ye replied: We have studied this matter before and understand the consequences of adopting silver coins. At the same time, banking circles in Shanghai stated that the Chinese government had studied this matter several months ago, and since then the Chinese government has planned to seek a loan of US$346 million in American silver. It is said that "silver coins" have become a "topic not to be mentioned" in China, because if China adopts a silver standard, it will lose its membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

[Reported by this newspaper] After the Mexican Minister of Finance announced that our government would ask Mexico to mint silver coins on its behalf, reporters inquired with financial authorities. According to the reply, since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government has found it difficult to supply auxiliary coins in the future due to the enemy dismantling the Shanghai Mint's machinery. It has repeatedly inquired with various countries about their minting capabilities and whether they can mint coins on its behalf. However, there is no need to mint coins until the time is ripe for currency reform, and there is no concrete contact at present.

[Reported by this newspaper] Mexican Ambassador to China, Yisque Dai, and his only secretary have been in Shanghai for two weeks and have not yet returned to Nanjing. Their visit to Shanghai may be related to the currency system issue. It is also learned that Consultant Young is also in Shanghai.

### Currency System Must Be Reformed Before the End of This Year; Financial Authorities Have Proposed a Plan

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] People here regard the news of China and Mexico conducting coin minting negotiations with great attention. It is generally believed that this may be a strong sign that we will resume the use of silver coins. When people familiar with finance discuss this matter, most believe that currency reform is not entirely impossible. It is reported that the financial authorities had submitted a proposed plan several months ago, and judging from the current situation, the currency seems to have to be reformed before the end of this year. Although the silver standard is not necessarily a progressive system, since foreign countries have a large supply of silver, it may not be a bad transitional measure. As for minting and other tasks, our country is not entirely unprepared.

### Opinions of People in the Financial Sector on Silver Coins; Believe That It May Create Local Stability

[Reported by this newspaper] After the Mexican Minister of Finance announced that Mexico would mint silver coins for our country, reporters specially visited people in the financial sector to summarize their opinions: They believe that if this news is indeed true, it must be linked to the Sino-U.S. loan. Because purely relying on our country's existing silver reserves is definitely not enough. It was previously rumored that the United States would provide our country with a portion of its silver reserves as part of a loan to reform the currency system, which may be the matter. It has been widely rumored in financial circles recently that the United States will lend China US$1.5 billion, which is confirmed by the remarks of senior U.S. diplomatic personnel. There must be a reason for the rumors. In the future, after the issuance of silver coins, the existing legal tender will inevitably become auxiliary coins. If there is no regulation on the ratio between the main and auxiliary coins, the phenomenon of bad money driving out good money will inevitably occur in the market. Therefore, it is inferred that a ratio will inevitably be stipulated between silver dollars and legal tender, and the government will do its best to stabilize it. As for the impact of the issuance of silver dollars on our country's economy, opinions in the financial sector vary, but most believe that it may create local stability. Because hard currency has intrinsic value and is supported by international loans, it can increase people's confidence in the government. At the same time, based on observations of our country's monetary history over the past 30 years, this move can at least localize price fluctuations.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Establishes Equipment General Depot to Handle Japanese Reparations Materials; Private Sector Portion Will Be Shipped to China Next Month

[Reported by this newspaper] The private sector portion of industrial materials Japan is compensating to our country, totaling 120,000 tons, can be shipped to China next month. The country is divided into three ports for unloading: Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, which are then transferred to North China, Central China, and South China, respectively. It is estimated that about 60,000 tons will land through the port of Shanghai. The first batch to arrive in Shanghai is about 10,000 tons, mainly tools and machinery.

### Executive Yuan Passes Revised Publication Law in Provisional Meeting; Relaxes the Scale of Publication and Distribution

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] The revised publication law, which was previously drafted internally, was passed by the Executive Yuan at its 12th provisional meeting on the 24th, and will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete legislative procedures. Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng recently spoke to reporters about the main points of the revised publication law, which lies in relaxing the scale of distribution and publication, while simplifying application registration procedures. In other words, it also encourages publication and the development of cultural undertakings. According to the original registration method, the registration application must be copied to the Central Propaganda Department for registration before it can be sent to the Ministry of Interior for issuing a registration certificate. At the same time, the time limit is also stipulated as 28 days, but now it is changed to "within ten days," the time is shortened, and it is not necessary to go through the registration of the Central Propaganda Department. It only needs to be approved by the local competent government, and then reported to the Ministry of Interior for issuing a registration certificate, so the procedures are simple and the agency is simple. (See this newspaper on the 22nd of the month) The following are divided into reports and discussion items of the provisional meeting (Continued on page two, column one)

### Cross-Party Members on National Assembly List to Have Candidacy Revoked; Review Work to Be Expedited

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu of the Kuomintang (KMT) convened a small group meeting with representatives from the Min and Qing parties on the morning of the 24th to discuss how to handle the issue of cross-party members participating in the election. It was found that some of the National Assembly candidates proposed by the Min and Qing parties were, upon KMT review, discovered to be KMT members. This clearly made them cross-party members. While the KMT expressed support for friendly parties, this did not apply to cross-party members. This point was raised during the meeting on the 24th to solicit opinions from the Min and Qing parties. Representatives from the two parties stated that if the evidence was accurate and they were indeed cross-party members, the two parties would withdraw the originally nominated candidates and nominate others. It was decided in the meeting that the KMT would list these names and send copies to the Min and Qing parties, who would then convene their respective Central Standing Committees to discuss the matter.

[Another Telegram] The Kuomintang has already sent the list of all cross-party members among the National Assembly candidates of the Min and Qing parties to the two parties. It is reported that the number of these cross-party members accounts for slightly less than two-fifths of the total list for the Democratic Socialist Party and slightly more than two-fifths of the total list for the Youth Party. The Youth Party has a total of 470 nominees, of whom about 200 are cross-party members.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to regulations, the list of National Assembly candidates should be announced nationwide fifteen days before the National Assembly election (i.e., November 6th). The lists nominated by political parties were originally scheduled to be submitted to the Election Headquarters for notification before the 25th of this month so that these lists and orders could reach the relevant units before the 6th. However, the lists nominated by political parties are still under review, and the deadline has arrived. Therefore, the KMT Central Standing Committee and the Central Election Steering Committee held a joint meeting on the 24th to discuss the issue of review time. It was decided to divide the review work into seven groups to expedite completion. Based on the current situation, even if the seven groups hold continuous meetings simultaneously, it will still take five days to complete. Therefore, the Election Headquarters is quite anxious about the notification work. A person in charge reportedly said that if it is impossible to complete the work in time, not only will the list not be announced as scheduled, but the voting will inevitably be affected. The meeting on the 24th also passed the list for Guangxi Province and the lists of professional representatives for Zhejiang Province and Tianjin. An interim Central Standing Committee meeting will be held on the morning of the 25th to approve the lists of each review group, after which the group reviews will commence immediately.

[Another Telegram] The list of National Assembly candidates from free professional organizations has not yet been submitted to the review committee for review, but a decision has already been made during the small group review. It is reported that in order to achieve the goal of selecting the virtuous and capable and ensuring equitable distribution, the Election Committee intends to convene another small group meeting to re-review the journalists' section.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Eleven legislators, including Liu Guanshiun, gathered again on the morning of the 24th to discuss the nomination of legislators and paid a visit to President Sun Fo and Vice President Ju Zheng to make some presentations. In addition, a seven-member group from the Control Yuan also held a meeting on the morning of the 24th.

### Commemorating Taiwan Retrocession Day

Today is Taiwan Retrocession Day. In the history of the Republic of China, this is a day worthy of joy and celebration. In order to attract people from other provinces and foreign countries to visit Taiwan, thereby promoting social and economic prosperity, cultural exchange, and mutual understanding, the people's organizations of Taiwan Province have launched a month-long campaign involving all sectors of Taiwan to celebrate Retrocession Day. The Taiwan Provincial Government will hold a grand celebration today, and President Zhang Qun and the British parliamentary delegation will also visit Taiwan one after another to participate. Today's Taiwan is a time of great gatherings and celebrations by all the people. We would like to express our sincere and boundless excitement, wishing the Taiwanese compatriots happiness, the success of Taiwan's construction, and predicting that Taiwan's future will be glorious with the light of retrocession!

Taiwan is a province of our country, located between the East China Sea and the South China Sea, shaped like a banana leaf, encompassing the main island, the Penghu Islands, the Nansha Islands, and other islands, and is collectively referred to as Taiwan Province. It faces the Pacific Ocean to the east, is separated from Fujian by the Taiwan Strait to the west, is adjacent to the Ryukyu Islands to the northeast, and is adjacent to the Philippines across the Bashi Channel to the south. The entire territory is strategically important, the land is fertile, and the products are abundant. The total area is approximately 35,961 square kilometers, with a population of approximately six million. The history of Taiwan is a history of struggle full of disasters and hardships for our compatriots. The hard-working and persevering Taiwanese people, after several generations of hardships, finally gained and entered the light on October 25, 1945. Recalling the painful past of the Taiwan Incident, the scene is still vivid in our minds. Considering the past struggles of the Taiwanese people, we are all the more delighted with the arrival of this festive season.

Due to the importance of Taiwan's strategic location, it unfortunately suffered foreign interference. In the 32nd year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1604 AD), the Dutch first occupied Penghu and then occupied Taiwan proper. In 1626, the Spanish invaded Taiwan. In the 21st year of the Daoguang reign (1841), the British had covetous intentions. In the 9th year of the Guangxu reign (1883), French troops also spied on Taiwan. Although these multiple invasions were crushed, they already hinted that Taiwan had been drawn into the vortex of world politics in the competition among imperialists. Japan coveted Taiwan, and there were minor intrusions in the mid-Ming Dynasty. It effectively occupied Taiwan after occupying the Ryukyu Islands (1st year of Guangxu, 1875). After the Qing government was defeated in the Sino-Japanese War, Japan occupied Taiwan after signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki on March 23 of the 21st year of Guangxu. It was exclusively ruled by Japan for 50 years. On this day two years ago, the Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, General Ando Rikichi, signed the surrender document to our government. Since then, Taiwan has regained its light, broken free from foreign shackles, and returned to the embrace of the motherland. This is the hard-won harvest of our country's eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and also the success of the Taiwanese people's long-standing struggle.

Foreigners coveted Taiwan's strategic location and its rich resources, causing many disasters in Taiwan's history. The Chinese nation never forgot Taiwan. In every era of disaster, it struggled for the freedom of Taiwan. This shows that China is unified and the Chinese nation is a whole. When the Dutch ruled Taiwan for 37 years, Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan. Zheng Jing, Chenggong's son, built and managed Taiwan, and his glory is recorded in history. After Zheng Jing's death, his son Ke Shuang ruined 23 years of glorious history, but then came the restoration movements of Taiwanese people such as Zhu Yigui and Lin Shuangwen. When the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceded Taiwan, the Taiwanese people declared independence under the leadership of patriot Qiu Fengjia. Although this independence movement was defeated by the Japanese army, the nation's righteousness illuminates the heaven and earth, penetrates the sun and moon, and is immortal, forever illuminating Taiwan. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for 50 years, filled with half a century of blood and tears. The Taiwanese people never succumbed. In his book "The Sorrow of the Taiwanese People," Nichiiri Sanchuan exposed Japan's fifty years of harsh rule and revealed the history of the Taiwanese people's tragic struggle. The revolutionary movement led by the founding father Sun Yat-sen aimed to liberate Taiwan; the anti-Japanese judgment led by President Chiang Kai-shek, and the retrocession of Taiwan on October 25, 1945, its meaning truly fulfilled the struggles of Zheng Chenggong, Qiu Fengjia, and Liu Yongfu, and achieved the goal of liberating the Taiwanese people.

From the above, we can know how great is the meaning of Taiwan's retrocession! Today's Taiwan has become a province of China, its politics are moving towards democracy, its economy is moving towards construction, and its future prospects are limitless. Today, as we commemorate Taiwan's retrocession, we deeply feel the value of retrocession. We hope that the six million people of Taiwan and the local government will cherish the historical value of retrocession, unite as one, and work together to create and build. The Taiwanese people regard Taiwan as the "garden of China." We hope that Taiwan can bloom with splendid flowers and be built into a paradise of the Three Principles of the People. The Taiwanese people's many years of suffering and the bitterness they have experienced throughout the generations should be rewarded with happiness and well-being! May the Taiwanese people and the local government work together to build a new Taiwan after today!

### Zhang Qun's Remarks in Taiwan

Government Determined to Improve the Lives of Taiwanese Compatriots

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Premier Zhang Qun met with reporters at 3 p.m. on the 24th and delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of Taiwan's economic position and the government's determination to improve the economic lives of Taiwanese compatriots. He stated: "During Chairman Wei's recent visit to Nanjing, we discussed several concrete solutions regarding stabilizing Taiwan's financial situation, securing its economic life, and encouraging exports. The Taiwan dollar system will be maintained and will not change before the overall currency reform. Although Taiwan's coal is not of particularly high quality, it can supplement the current coal shortage in Shanghai, Nanjing, and South China if it is transported inland. The price of inland coal is fixed due to government controls. I will consider the issue of exporting products from Taiwan after investigating here. Taiwan has many products available for export, such as sugar, which was said to have an annual output of 1.4 million tons during the Japanese occupation. Other products, such as salt and camphor, can also be exported to foreign countries in exchange for foreign exchange and the machinery and fertilizers that Taiwan needs." Regarding the handling of Japanese territories, Zhang emphasized that Japan should return the territories it seized from China by force, such as the Ryukyu Islands, which should be returned to China's territory. Zhang also stated when meeting with representatives of central government agencies stationed in Taiwan today: "Starting from January next year, the salaries of civil servants will be readjusted based on the cost of living index in various regions. The salary issue of the central government agencies stationed in Taiwan is a technical one that will be discussed and resolved after returning to Nanjing.

He then disappeared.

### Cash Shortage in Jinan

Check Discounting Phenomenon Occurs

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Recently, due to the fact that most of the cash has flowed into the newly recovered areas, the market lacks chips. Most banks and money houses use checks instead of cash, resulting in a check discounting phenomenon of 5% to 8%. The reporter specially visited Director Yin Wenjing of the Shandong Finance Department for this. According to him, this phenomenon is purely caused by the lack of cash at the Central Bank. The Provincial Government has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and Governor Zhang of the Central Bank to give priority to the allocation and transportation of banknotes. At the same time, it has also requested the Ministry of Finance to set up branches in Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places as soon as possible. The provincial bank has been ordered to resume operations in the places where branches have already been established as soon as possible.

### Responding to Zhang Zhizhong's Open Letter: Yining Presents Four Demands; Foreign Reporters Report Situation of Yili Preparing to Expand Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Tonghua, 24th] General Zhang Zhizhong's open letter to Ili Akhmetjan on September 1st pointed out the various facts of the Ili side undermining the peace agreement and demanded that the Ili personnel return to Dihua unconditionally for negotiations. It has just been learned that the Ili side's reply letter arrived in Dihua yesterday, putting forward four demands as preconditions for negotiations: 1. Replace the current provincial chairman, Maksud; 2. Release the arrested rioters; 3. Prohibit arrests based on political relations; 4. Thoroughly implement the peace agreement and the administrative program. At today's press conference, Liu Mengchun, chairman of the Central Propaganda Committee, refused to announce the full text of the letter, only saying, "It's still the same old story."

[United Press, Korla, Xinjiang, 24th] The Ili side is demanding complete independence and is preparing to fight for it by force. The area has a population of 750,000, with the capital Korla, also known as Ili or Yining, 60 miles from the Soviet border. Several key figures in the independence movement were born or educated in the Soviet Union. Some of the people of Ili claim to be Soviet citizens. The people of Ili rebelled against Chinese rule in 1946, after which a fragile peace agreement was established, with the Chinese central government making various concessions but not allowing their autonomy. The people of Ili largely ignored this treaty and continued to strengthen their military. The negotiations in Dihua have come to a standstill. Song Xilian, the garrison commander of Dihua, has about 10,000 troops. A United Press reporter obtained permission from the Ili leader, Akhmetjan, to visit. Akhmetjan granted me freedom to travel throughout the region. Revolutionaries declared: "After the autumn harvest, major events will happen." Most people hinted that they distrusted the Soviet Union, but generally expressed indignation towards the Chinese people, believing that "Russians are better than Chinese." The Ili leaders oppose the temporary joint government organized by Dihua. They currently claim to have 50,000 troops, including many excellent cavalry, commanded by Zhang Sak, who was born in the Soviet Union. Key figures in Ili firmly believe that once the opportunity is ripe, the revolutionary army will easily launch a decisive attack. The Chinese government can only reinforce Dihua by air or by the 1,300-mile winding desert land route. The reporter personally saw six twin-engine Soviet bombers parked at an airport near Korla. Ili soldiers said: "We have neither pilots nor ground service personnel. These planes were purchased by China from the Soviet Union in 1939 and captured during the Ili revolution." It can already satisfy the separatists. Ordinary people insist that separation from China must be completed. The reporter spoke with some battlefield nurses and female cavalry. Many of them wore short socks, lipstick, and nail polish. They wore blue-gray uniforms, red and yellow epaulets, navy blue short skirts, and eyebrow-covering hats. He Fusa Fu said: "We are fighting for independence." Korla has about 4,000 Chinese residents, who have been tricked into slums by people of other ethnic groups and appear frustrated. A Soviet woman said: "The Chinese used to think we were inferior. Now they have been put in their proper place."

[United Press, New York, 24th] The Herald Tribune commented on the Nanjing government's report on the rebellion in Xinjiang Province, saying that although the people of Xinjiang Province have become increasingly inclined towards the Soviet Union, making it more difficult for the Chinese government there, China is still allowing the province broad autonomy and conducting negotiations through the capable General Zhang Zhizhong, which is a wise and generous measure.

[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 24th Broadcasting: Washington news, President Truman drafted today a radio report to the country, explaining the "urgent reasons" for convening a special session of Congress on November 17. It is reported that the purpose of convening this special session is to provide $1 billion in emergency aid to Europe and to prevent "alarming" domestic inflation.

Government officials expect the report to provide a detailed analysis of the urgent economic situation at home and abroad.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] President Truman today requested that a special session of Congress be convened on November 17 to address the urgent need for foreign aid. In announcing this decision, the President explained that legislative action was necessary to address the crisis in Western Europe. Several European countries have exhausted their economic resources and will not be able to purchase coal and food this winter.

The President announced the convening of the special session of Congress at his press conference after meeting with eleven congressional leaders from both parties.

This figure may change in the next three weeks. Regarding this temporary relief plan from October 1 to March 31, both houses of Congress must complete all actions before Christmas.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] All members of the U.S. Cabinet, at the call of President Truman, held a plenary meeting at the White House on the 23rd and passed the President's temporary aid plan for Europe. Only Secretary of State Marshall did not attend the meeting.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Several officials who are very concerned about the European aid plan said that a special session of Congress is about to be convened, but they are deeply afraid that the price issue will overwhelm the European aid issue. The United States is approaching the eve of a general election, and politically, curbing prices is far more concerned by the people than aiding Europe. Well-informed sources pointed out that rapid aid to Europe will increase the Democratic Party's and Truman's political capital, which is disliked by the Republican-dominated Congress.

### The Japanese Peace Conference Can Only Be Held Next Year; Sino-U.S. Differences Await Negotiation; The Key Lies in the Veto Power Issue

[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt believes that there is no opportunity to convene a preliminary peace conference with Japan at present, and it is only hoped that it will be held at the beginning of next year. However, he hopes that by the beginning of next year, the differences between China, the United States, and the Soviet Union on procedures can be fully eliminated so that the conference can proceed smoothly. Evatt said that the United States is formally studying the request made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie during his visit to Washington. China believes that the draft of the Japanese peace treaty drafted by the United States has not fully restricted Japan's industrial potential and has not fully strictly regulated the control of Japan after the conclusion of the treaty. Regarding the issue of controlling Japan after the conclusion of the treaty, China insists that the U.S. civilian rule viewpoint is not sufficient to effectively prevent the reconstruction of Japan's war economy. However, it is learned that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang firmly believes that the U.S. proposal to control Japan by restricting imports will be carried out satisfactorily. All the delegations of various countries here hope that China will finally abandon its consistent position with the Soviet Union, that is, the drafting of the treaty should not use the veto power, and any of the four major powers in Asia can use the veto power to prevent clauses that they do not welcome. In addition, the main point where China and the United States have failed to reach an agreement is the number of merchant ships Japan has after the treaty is concluded. The United States' view is that Japanese merchant ships should be between 2 and 3 million tons. This view is completely rejected by China. China firmly believes that half of this number is sufficient for Japan. However, according to well-informed sources, this issue may be resolved after the peace conference is convened, because China and the United States are currently too far apart to coordinate. As for whether the Soviet Union agrees to participate in the eleven-nation conference without using the veto power, there has been no indication so far. However, authoritative sources said that if the United States can get China to comply, it will proceed with the treaty regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates.

### Cripps Emphasizes Dollar Panic; Announces New Savings Measures; Says Britain's Concessions to the U.S. Have Reached Their Limit

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Economic Minister Sir Stafford Cripps made his first speech in the House of Commons today after taking office, emphasizing that the lack of U.S. dollars is still the central problem facing Britain today. The key to Britain's entire problem lies in restoring the balance of foreign trade, especially trade with the dollar area. Cripps, when referring to the tariff negotiations in Geneva, said that the success of the negotiations is already in sight. The reduction of U.S. tariffs has permanent benefits for us, so we should reduce our tariffs and agree with the autonomous territories to limit or reduce the imperial trade preference system in exchange for U.S. concessions. We have conducted sentencing with the U.S. in accordance with the principles of fair trade, and the concessions we have made have indeed reached the edge of reasonable concessions. Cripps then announced several other emergency measures, such as the sugar ration will be reduced from ten ounces per week to eight ounces, the bacon ration will be one ounce per week, the fresh meat ration will be one shilling per week, the British order for tobacco from the U.S. will be completely stopped, the import of raw materials that must be paid in U.S. dollars will be further reduced by £20 million, and the finished products imported from the U.S., including machinery, etc., will be subject to strict licensing system. Cripps estimated that after the implementation of these austerity measures, Britain's dollar trade deficit this year should not exceed £250 million. The main spokesperson for today's conservative was former Education Minister Butler, who said: The government has obviously handled the British economic and financial situation improperly, and the government's proposal to reduce the rights of the House of Lords is just another measure to divert the attention of the people from the economic situation.

### Iranian Parliament Passes Single-Clause Bill Declaring Iranian-Soviet Oil Agreement Invalid; Opposition Party Moves to Impeach Prime Minister Sultanah

[United Press, Tehran, 24th] The oil agreement signed by Iranian Prime Minister Sultanah and the Soviet Union in April last year was declared invalid by the Parliament yesterday by a vote of 102 to 2. The Prime Minister protested that no matter what the Parliament decides, we are still a friendly country of the Soviet Union and hope to maintain good political and economic relations with the Soviet Union in the future.

[Reuters, Tehran, 23rd] Iranian Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Shafa Gao said that according to the "single-clause" bill passed by the Parliament, the concession of oil to foreign countries or the joint venture of oil companies with foreign capital will be prohibited.

The content of the single-clause bill is expected to be announced tomorrow.

### British Government Reduces Naval Strength; Churchill Sternly Questions; Alexander Responds That Adequate Strength Is Still Maintained

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Opposition leader Churchill accused the Labor government, especially Defense Minister Alexander, of seriously mishandling Britain's combat military strength in the House of Commons. He demanded that the government publish a white paper announcing the number and form of naval warships in active service. When Alexander refused, Churchill declared that the government had a tradition of providing such information in times of emergency, and he believed that the present was an emergency. Churchill, who had served as Navy Minister in both world wars, pointed out that the reduction of the domestic fleet has seriously damaged Britain's interests around the world. The Navy has 170,000 officers and soldiers and an annual budget of £180 million. Why can't it maintain an appropriate fleet? Although the status of the Air Force has been improved, the Royal Navy is still the firm guarantee of the British Isles and the British Empire in the minds of the people. Alexander explained that the reduction of the domestic fleet was due to the reduction of naval personnel from 178,000 to 147,000 by the end of February next year, and after the return of naval servicemen serving abroad, people must be sent to supplement them, so the domestic fleet had to be reduced. Churchill then asked the Defense Minister to explain the existing strength of the domestic fleet. Alexander replied that when the re-establishment order was promulgated, the domestic fleet had one battleship, five cruisers, and twelve destroyers; at present, it has one cruiser and four destroyers. He also revealed that the British Mediterranean Fleet still maintains adequate strength.

### Stabilizing Finance and Reforming Administration; The French Cabinet Plans to Launch a New Plan; Ramadier Will Request a Vote of Confidence from Parliament

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Ramadier declared yesterday that the policies adopted by Gao Le and the Communist Party would all plunge France into chaos and destruction.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The Ramadier "pocket" cabinet, which was established yesterday afternoon, will submit a plan to Parliament next Tuesday to stabilize finance and reform the administration. Ramadier said at a press conference yesterday that domestic policies will not change due to changes in the cabinet, but only intends to concentrate power during the current difficult period. It is generally expected that the new cabinet is only an "emergency" measure and will not last long. When Ramadier outlined the government's policies, he put forward the following points: The amount of raw materials is already equal to that before the war, but in order to ensure the easy import of raw materials, the output must be 140% to 150% of that before the war. Before the Marshall Plan is implemented, France must engage in a difficult economic battle at home. In terms of finance, the state's revenue and expenditure must be balanced in 1948. If inflation is avoided, the related wage-price problem must be resolved and strictly adhered to. In terms of politics, France's current political atmosphere is full of electricity. The French people are loyal to the parliamentary system based on universal elections. Anyone who attempts to destroy this system is acting against the state.

According to Dulles, he had called for the organization of moral forces "to strive for peace rather than win by war." Austin indirectly accused the Soviet Union of "possibly being the worst seller of war."

If any of the following occurs after the aforementioned factories or businesses begin distribution, the distributing agency should revoke their right to distribute, and at the same time, state the facts and notify the Social Affairs Bureau to consider the seriousness of the circumstances and suspend their business for a certain period of time or revoke their registration.

### Remaining Enemy and Puppet Properties' Auction Still Faces Many Difficulties

[Our Newspaper] According to relevant sources: The handling of enemy property is proceeding very smoothly. Taking enemy and puppet factories as an example, among the Class A factories, only the Aikou No. 1 Factory is still being auctioned. This factory specializes in manufacturing textile machinery and currently has 200 workers. As for the Class B factories that are in a state of suspension, most of them have also been sold. In the early stages of the cleanup of enemy and puppet industries, the purchasers were only people from the rear, and local people mostly lacked confidence in this type of factory. Today, due to the shortage of materials, the prices of any equipment in each factory are very high. Therefore, the situation has changed from the past, and whenever enemy and puppet factories are auctioned, the purchasers are very enthusiastic. Currently, the majority of the remaining enemy and puppet properties are real estate. Although the government has decided in principle to auction them off, there are still many difficulties due to the tenants and other reasons.

Jewish Treason Case Retried Yesterday

### Jewish Treason Case Retried Yesterday

### School Principal's "Confession": For Debt or Adultery?

Further Trial of Jiang Ruzhen's Case; Ba長 and Others Testify, Recounting the Mediation Process

[Our Newspaper News] The case of Jiang Ruzhen, the principal of Huade Elementary School, being accused of raping two 13-year-old female students of the school, Zhu Yuexian and Zhang Juying, was further tried in the Criminal Court No. 1 of the District Court yesterday morning by Judge Meng Tingke. First, Zhu Yuexian recounted the experience of being victimized. Then, the witness Zhu Changbao was summoned. Zhu testified: "I am from Changzhou, 28 years old, living at No. 4, Lane 40, Xiaotaoyuan Street. I run a funeral supplies business and am the second landlord of Zhu H茂珠. I don't know Jiang Ruzhen, nor do I know about the adultery. On May 31, I returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou. Two days later, Ba長 鄭元清 came to find me, asking my wife to take him to see Zhu H茂珠 to mediate on behalf of Jiang Ruzhen." Zheng Yuanqing, the security chief of the 25th 保, Xicang Road, testified: "Jiang and I are old friends of many years. On the 6th, Jiang came to find me and we went to the City God Temple for tea. He said he had a misunderstanding with a female student in the school because of a loan matter, and asked me to

intervene in the mediation

. I immediately invited Mrs. Zhu Changbin to discuss it with Zhu H茂珠. Zhu said that it could only be resolved if Jiang himself went to talk. I once said: turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems; let everyone forgive each other and it will be over." Mrs. Zhu said: "On June 4, I reported it to the Penglai Police Sub-bureau. On June 5, Zheng Yuanqing came. I immediately proposed three conditions that Jiang must agree to: 1) Publish an apology in the newspaper; 2) Write a letter of repentance; 3) Provide a letter of responsibility, guaranteeing that the boy's family will have nothing to say after Zhu Yuexian grows up and gets married. Zheng said the

conditions were too harsh

. After consultation, I agreed to only require Jiang to write a letter of repentance. Zheng then showed me the letter of repentance written by Jiang. In the letter, Jiang wrote, "I (Jiang referring to himself) often took Zhu Yuexian to play at the City God Temple, causing misunderstandings. I am very sorry, please forgive me." The court questioned Jiang Ruzhen about whether he admitted to the crimes he committed. Jiang testified: "On June 1, I went to find Ba長 Zheng to ask him to mediate. In the afternoon, I went to Jiangyin. The letter of repentance was written on May 29. The apology was for the

misunderstanding that occurred

because of the loan." Judge Meng immediately questioned, "You are the creditor, and Zhu H茂珠 is the debtor. Why are you apologizing to her instead?" Jiang thought for a moment and replied, "Because she hired gangsters to intimidate me." Jiang's wife, Mrs. Feng, testified that after Zheng Yuanqing brought back the letter of repentance and gave it to her, she threw it away and could not find it. The court determined that the case still needed further investigation and rescheduled the trial. As they were about to adjourn, Jiang suddenly said again, "Writing the letter of repentance was actually to explain that I often took female students to play at the City God Temple." It is heard that during the next trial, they will try to summon a long-time tailor shop acquaintance to testify.

Private individuals importing vehicles from abroad will only be approved under the following circumstances: (1) Those who are qualified to use automobiles according to the regulations on the restriction of the use of automobiles by private individuals issued by the Executive Yuan, such as doctors, banks, industrial and mining enterprises, news agencies, etc. (2) Those who have already shipped the vehicles before December 1, 36, and have proof. (3) Those who guarantee that they will not resell the vehicles in this city within one year of import. The above three items will be reviewed and approved by a review committee organized by the Transportation Management Committee, the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and other relevant agencies, and licenses will be issued. Any private individual or private legal entity that already holds an automobile license, if they exchange their old car for a new car, will be allowed to correct the original license registration and issue a new license. Business passenger cars and business freight cars, according to the regulations on the restriction of automobile transportation businesses, each business establishment that has registered and obtained a license before August 31 of this year, or has paid and ordered and already shipped the vehicles, will be allowed to use them, and must register uniformly before November 15, and licenses will be re-issued after strict investigation.

Vehicles from Other Cities

(B) Vehicles licensed in other cities entering this city will be handled according to the following regulations: (1) Those that entered this city before October 14 of this year, have registered as usual, and paid taxes, will be handled in the same way as those originally registered in this city. (2) Vehicles passing through temporarily will be issued fuel purchase certificates for the month after registering and paying taxes as usual, limited to one time. (3) Automobiles from other cities that are permanently stationed in this city should have their gasoline allocation transferred from the local competent authority to this city, and then licenses and fuel allocation certificates will be issued. (C) Private or private legal entity automobiles not subject to quota restrictions: Fire trucks and ambulances of private fire brigades, ambulances of private hospitals, commercial buses and long-distance buses, oil tankers of Standard Oil Company, engineering material vehicles of commercial public utility companies, etc., if they add new vehicles, will be issued licenses by the relevant competent authorities after review.

Government Vehicles

(D) Regulations for the issuance of licenses for government vehicles: (1) Central administrative agencies and state-owned enterprises in Shanghai must provide formal letters and telegrams from the central competent department or committee to apply for new vehicle licenses, but mail delivery vehicles and telegram delivery vehicles only need formal certification from the Shanghai postal and telecommunications authorities. (2) Branch offices or communication offices of central or local military and political agencies stationed in Shanghai applying for registration and issuance of new licenses must be approved by the Executive Yuan before they can be issued. (3) Municipal buses and municipal bureaus and offices that need to add vehicles must be approved by the mayor. (4) Vehicles specially approved for allocation, distribution, or delivery by the Executive Yuan will be licensed by the Public Works Bureau. (5) Vehicles of the UNRRA, the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, and the consulates of various countries in China will be licensed according to preferential measures. (6) Military vehicle licenses of the National Army will be handled by the Ministry of National Defense, and military vehicles of the U.S. and British armies will be licensed by the Public Works Bureau.

The Municipal Government is Ordered to Handle the Economical Use of Vehicles by Agencies

The Municipal Government has also received instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding various points on restricting the use of automobiles: (1) All agencies should reduce the number of automobiles and fuel consumption as much as possible, and should report the average monthly fuel consumption for this year, and then reduce at least 10% from the original amount. (2) Automobiles of all agencies should be centrally managed. Except for the heads and deputy heads who may use one automobile each, all other automobiles should be for the common use of the agency. (3) The allocation of automobiles of all agencies should be limited to official needs. The number of shuttle buses for transporting employees should be reduced.

Existing Vehicles

All agencies should report the types, quantities, horsepower, and number of staff members of their existing automobiles to the Executive Yuan for record. The Municipal Government is currently processing the order, but because the original order of the Executive Yuan only instructed to economize on the use of government vehicles and did not impose restrictions, it is feared that new automobiles and confiscated automobiles will appear in disguise under the name of government vehicles, and the gasoline quota will not be able to meet the demand. Therefore, it is planned to request the Executive Yuan to impose restrictions on agencies as well.

Two Points Requested by the Municipal Government

In addition, the Municipal Government is currently requesting instructions from the Executive Yuan on two points: (1) Whether the transfer of sales and purchases of automobiles by those qualified to use automobiles, government agencies, and private automobiles that do not meet the regulations should be allowed. (2) For automobiles that applied for registration before October 14, but the licenses were not issued due to incomplete documents at the time, or complete documents requiring inspection, can they be allowed to issue licenses and transfer ownership after the documents are supplemented or the inspection is passed.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Bureau of Telecommunications, in order to strengthen the management of the national broadcasting industry, stipulated that only ten frequencies are allowed for use by radio stations in this city. Among them, the frequencies used by private radio stations shall not exceed half of the prescribed number, and the nine private radio stations in this city, namely Gospel, Greater China, Mainland, Yuanchang, Oriental, America, Huamei, Heming, and Linji, were ordered to merge into five. Except for the Gospel Radio Station, which is allowed to share a frequency with the United Radio Station, the remaining eight stations share two frequencies and broadcast in rotation every other day. The eight radio stations, including Greater China, have encountered great difficulties in their business due to the limitation of frequencies, and have repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to demand the same treatment as other radio stations in this city, with two stations sharing one frequency, but this has not been approved. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications approved two new radio stations in this city, Xinyun (880 kHz) and Damei (760 kHz), each to use one frequency exclusively. The eight private radio stations deeply feel that the treatment is unfair, and yesterday they jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Council, requesting that justice be upheld so that the private radio stations can obtain equal treatment. The original petition also included a statistical table of radio stations in this city. According to the table, there are currently 47 radio stations broadcasting in this city, including Public Construction, Far East, United, Damei, China Free, Jindou, Military Friends, General Land Force, Xinyun, Shanghai, Huguang, America Linji, Greater China, Mainland, Qing Sheng, Peace, Military Voice, Expedition, Tie Feng, Oriental, Huamei, Yuanchang, Heming, Fu Qing, Municipal Police, United, Gospel, Huguo Army, Asia One, Cooperation, News, New Su, Minsheng, Ninety-nine, Victory, Zhongjian, Tiansheng, Xin Sheng, Greater China, Xin Du, Xin Hu, Datong, Shanghai, Jiancheng, Chinese Culture, and Youth, etc. The actual frequencies used range from 600 to 1400, totaling 33. Among the radio stations broadcasting, only 22 have been formally approved by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, including China Free, Jindou, America Linji, Greater China, Mainland, Oriental, Huamei, Yuanchang, Heming, United, One Gospel, Asia, Cooperation, Minsheng, Ninety-nine, Xin Sheng, Greater China, Xin Hu, Datong, Jiancheng, and Chinese Culture.

### Xiang Sheng Hotel Arrests Two Criminals; Extensive Involvement in Arms Trafficking

### Arbitration Ruling of Silk Weaving Factory Dispute Delivered

[Our Newspaper News] Three-quarters of the silk weaving factories in the Hudong district have not yet resumed production. The Labor-Capital Appraisal Committee delivered the arbitration ruling of the 14th meeting to both labor and capital of the silk weaving industry yesterday, ordering them to comply. However, it is learned that the capital side still expresses dissent to the appraisal's ruling and will request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to convene a general membership meeting, believing that the regulations of the appraisal are very unreasonable. If the silk weaving factories accept them, once a precedent is set, the future troubles of other industries will be endless. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, the appraisal of the appraisal committee is extremely fair. The wages of workers in May, June, July, and August have not been settled by the factories. The losses suffered by workers in these four months due to the decline in currency value should be compensated. Therefore, adding one yuan to the basic salary, the capital side has no reason to object.

### Taiwan Retrocession Day: A Bright Outlook

[Our Newspaper Taipei 22nd Airmail] As this article is being published, the reporter imagines that it should be the second anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession. The 6.3 million Taiwanese compatriots and the advance troops who arrived in Taiwan have all witnessed and personally experienced the moving and tearful great enthusiasm at the time of the retrocession on October 25 two years ago. However, we have the right to say that we hope that the days to come will show more brightness! Unfold greater brightness in suffering! The first impression of travelers who come to this land (Mr. Peng Xuepei is one of them) is invariably beautiful and pleasant. The wide roads dotted with betel nut trees sway with slender figures in the warm subtropical breeze. Sparse people walk leisurely, and the scenery with a South Seas and Japanese flavor makes people from Beijing and Shanghai no longer feel the fiery breath and fleshy stench. A kind of superficial stability makes one aware that this is indeed a happy land. Yes, Taiwan has a more stable environment than the mainland, has island sentiments, has a more basic construction, and has a progressive expression of balanced cultural development... However, if you stay here for a long time, anyone will feel the monotonous, dry, and oppressive weight. Taiwan is, after all, a small island, a small world. Once sea and air traffic is cut off, there is almost the possibility of suffocating the islanders.

Taking Over Enemy Property From the ruins, we took over the island and a legacy left behind by the Japanese after thirty years of hard work. Taking the Japanese assets alone, the book value is already over 55.6 billion, and this is only limited to the assets taken over in the province. The assets taken over by the central government agencies are not included. We also took over the Japanese factories, mines, enterprises, and all transportation tools. In the past two years, we have witnessed the restoration of most of the factories from the ruins, the reconstruction of difficult projects, the repair of river embankments, and the operation of the latest models of automobiles on the highways. In some places, the achievements have surpassed the heyday of Japan. Here are young people, technical workers, and researchers who are truly working hard and willing to learn. They only ask to be able to do something for Taiwan in a state of warmth and contentment, and to silently do more. Let the facts prove that we can accept this legacy. Although there are some fake "experts" among them, and even more so some corrupt people who are dreaming of making a fortune.

Perfect Policies Chairman Wei came to Taiwan, and the first step was to raise the exchange rate. The Taiwan dollar has not yet encountered a fate of decline. He accepted the opinions of the public, and in order to relieve the hardship of those who have lost their schooling and employment, he also reached out to welcome foreign investment. The Taiwan dollar has been adjusted three times in the past six months, and it is very likely to be adjusted again recently. Although the "adjustment" and "節" of materials have not been seen, it may be more effective in curbing the soaring prices. However, people expect the authorities to implement sound policies in a planned manner. Taiwan's economic breakwater is fragile. Production and marketing enterprises and institutions cannot be allowed to take care of themselves alone, nor can they be allowed to linger on their last breath. It is impossible for them to develop or destroy themselves separately. They must be closely coordinated to become a complete production system, echoing each other. Otherwise, the pace will be disordered and the methods will fail.

Optimistic Future Taiwan is not China's "granary." In terms of the large-scale supply of chemical fertilizers and the acquisition of foreign exchange, it can be understood that the central government places Shanghai first and Taiwan second. The central government attaches importance to Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan and the workers today should endure suffering and cherish Taiwan even more. There is no reason to be pessimistic about Taiwan's future. When the chairman personally supported the island province at the retrocession commemoration last year, he almost shed tears in his speech to the people after the recovery. This year, Director Zhang and Mr. Weng Wenhao will also come to attend the grand ceremony. What people sigh about is certainly the changes in personnel in the past two years, but the greater hope will be how to overcome the difficulties in financial construction and production in the face of the third year of retrocession. As long as the country has a way, Taiwan will always have a future. I hope that the people of Taiwan will recognize themselves and the world, because this was originally earned by the blood and heads of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians over eight years.

### Coroneted Dignitaries in Taiwan: Important Chinese and Foreign Figures Arrive One After Another, Making the Eve of Restoration Especially Lively

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 20th Day] Taiwan has now become the only tourist area in the entire country. With the unique scenery of the island and the relative stability, everyone wishes to come and see this happy land, which was recovered just two years ago. In the past month, after Zhang Fakui and Liang Hancao left, Lai He, Zhang Shizhao, Wu Shaoshu, Peng Xuepei, and others have arrived one after another. Recently, Zhang Bingjun and Zhang Zhizhong also came here for sightseeing after enjoying themselves in Suzhou and Wuxi.

The Provincial Government and related parties are both nervous and troubled about the arrangements for welcoming and sending off guests, as well as for food, lodging, and transportation. This is because, apart from the guest house and hostels in Taipei that can accommodate twenty or thirty people, there is no larger hotel that can accommodate the visiting dignitaries, their entourages, and their families. Furthermore, the new cars of various government agencies are all subject to requisition. In addition to paying a sum of entertainment expenses, the Provincial Government finds it difficult to cope, and the county and city mayors feel particularly overwhelmed.

### Land Dispute Between Two Clans: A Large-Scale Armed Clash Occurs in Yongtai, Rumored to Be Related to Elections

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 21st Day] Mobilizing more than 3,000 people for a dispute over ancestral land and engaging in a large-scale armed clash, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, has caused a relatively large disturbance in the usually stable Fujian province. This bloody incident occurred in Houpingping, Longmen Village, Yongtai County, eastern Fujian, a place known for its simple and kind customs. The cause was a dispute over the ownership of a piece of barren land, which has been in litigation for several years. The plaintiff, Lin Shiyong, the clan head of the Lin clan, and others claimed that the land was the site of lectures given by their ancestor, the Neo-Confucian scholar Lin Yu of the Southern Song Dynasty. Due to years of disrepair, the houses collapsed, leaving only a piece of flat land as a historical site, which was occupied by the Lin clan. The defendant, Wang Jiaxiang, the representative of the Wang clan, and others claimed that the site of Lin Yu's lectures was at the foot of Fuding Peak in Yunfeng Township, 32nd Du, of the county, where Zhu Kao-ting inscribed the words "Longmen" on a stone, as documented in the county gazette. The Lin clan's descendants are scattered throughout various counties.

False Information Spreads

The Wang clan, which has lived in Longmen Village for generations, claims the village is the site of their ancestor's lectures. The plaintiff initially sued in the county judicial office and then appealed to the Fujian High Court, but both cases were dismissed. Wang clan members believed that the land rights had been determined by the court, which ruled that the plaintiff's claim was unreasonable, as the land in question had no identifiable boundaries. Therefore, the land should remain the property of the Wang clan. With clear land rights, they began constructing an ancestral hall on the land a few months ago. The Lin and Wang clans live in close proximity, and the Lin clan harbored resentment upon seeing this. The Yongtai Lin clan is known as a prominent family, with members scattered throughout the eastern Fujian counties of Linsen, Minqing, and Gutian, numbering quite a few. As early as a few months ago, the Lin clan had been brewing plans to

Settle the Score

with the Wang clan. This matter finally erupted on the 13th of this month. On that day, the Lin clan mobilized more than 3,000 clan members, some carrying hoes and others carrying guns, and converged on Longmen Village, Yongtai County, from various townships in Minqing and Gutian, with great momentum. The Wang clan, with fewer members, was unable to resist. The village was eventually captured by the Lin clan's army. Several Wang clan members were killed or injured, and 25 people were abducted and taken to Minqing. The rest fled. The Lin army took advantage of the victory, destroying more than a dozen houses and stealing over 300 ancestral properties from the Wang clan. Later, the county government dispatched troops to

Suppress the Uprising

and arrested more than 100 Lin clan members on the spot, bringing the incident to an end. Afterwards, it was said that three former Yongtai bandits, including Lin Xianmei, participated in the armed clash. The guns carried by the Lin clan members were mostly borrowed from the township offices in various townships. This was tantamount to condoning banditry, and the fact that the township offices provided weapons was tantamount to fueling the unrest. The provincial authorities and various sectors expressed extreme concern. The security authorities also reported yesterday that the Lin clan was

Brewing a Second Clash

The provincial government has now dispatched Inspector Huang Naifei to Yongtai to coordinate with local parties and mediate to prevent the situation from escalating again. As for why the land dispute between the two clans, which has been going on for a long time, erupted at this time, there is much speculation. According to the reporter's investigation, it is not unrelated to the elections. According to reports, Lin Dong, the clan head of the Lin clan, is currently running for National Assembly representative in the county. It is said that Lin specifically orchestrated this dispute to gather clan members to support Lin's election. Others say that Lin's opposing candidate used this dispute to incriminate Lin and undermine Lin's reputation. (Reported by reporter Chen Zhengyu)

### One of Chongqing's Great Constructions: The Sewer Project

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd Day (Airmail)] Sewers are a fundamental construction of a city. Eighty years ago, Paris, France spent 35 million U.S. dollars to build 75 miles of trunk lines and support 650 miles. Boston, USA, as early as fifty years ago, spent 15 million U.S. dollars to build 125 miles of trunk lines and 1,200 miles of branch lines. However, Chongqing, the wartime capital far in the southwest, only spent 1,548,782,000 yuan in June 1947 to build the first phase of 20.906 kilometers of sewer pipe project.

Expert Morrill

In January 1945, the U.S. State Department sent a sanitary engineering expert, A.B. Morrill, to Chongqing. This 60-year-old army colonel suggested to the highest authorities that if Chongqing had a perfect sewer system, it could reduce the mortality rate by 10% each year and would never have a flood disaster again. (Morrill did not lie: Chongqing did not have cholera this summer.) Morrill is an engineer worthy of respect. All the Chongqing people know that this foreigner had been to dark sewers for reconnaissance. He did not take a penny from the Chinese government, but his assistance in the design of the sewer project reduced the cost by 1 billion yuan. He is intelligent, humble, and does not insist on his own ideas. When Director Luo Jingzhong believed that it was more appropriate to build two ditches on both sides of the street than one in the center of the road in China, Morrill nodded and said, "OK."

Growth of Luo Jingzhong

Although Chongqing had begun the construction of ditches in the Qianlong period, a large-scale and systematic sewer design based on the principles of hydraulics did not begin until October 1946. At the beginning, millions of Chongqing citizens did not understand the importance of sewers. Director Luo, with his Ph.D. from the University of Louvain in Belgium, has a special style. He trained a group of cadres to persuade the people, and the construction office did not start work until the residents automatically requested to move. A total of 80 houses were demolished, and 400,000 people were mobilized.

Estimation of Rainfall

In Chongqing, constructing a sewer project is more convenient than in other cities because of the large slope. However, the disadvantage is that the topography of the city is not accurate, and the old ditch line records are incomplete. After the establishment of the Sewer Project Office, it took only four months to draw detailed maps of the city and plan line measurements by district. The most difficult thing was the prediction of rainfall cycles. If the rainfall is estimated incorrectly: if the ditches are too large, the project is wasted; if the ditches are too small, they are easy to flood. The rainfall record table of the Beibei Central Meteorological Research Institute only has records from 1941 to 1942, which is not enough for application. Therefore, the main reliance is still on the rainfall records of the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai. [According to the book "Chinese Land Use Statistics" by J.L. Buck, an American professor of agricultural economics at the University of Jinling: the largest average monthly rainfall in Shanghai is 188 mm, and in Chongqing it is 181 mm. As for the maximum rainfall in 24 hours, it is 200 mm in Shanghai and 208 mm in Chongqing.]

Discharge of Sewage

The function of sewers is to discharge sewage and rainwater. If the sewer project is completed in sequence, but the citizens still follow the old habits and dump accumulated waste everywhere, even with a good sewer, it will not help the cleaning and hygiene of the whole city. In view of this, the project office has planned to build 40 public toilets in the second phase of the project, cancel the septic tanks in the public toilets, and directly connect the feces to the ditches with tile pipes. In addition, the project office will contract the sewage connection for private residences. It is said that 2,000 residents have requested connection, and the project

Will Come to Nanjing in the Future

Sewer projects are still an emerging business in China. Cement, river sand, and gravel are the main construction materials, which can be said to be all domestic products. Director Luo told the reporter that the Nanjing Municipal Government has also established a Sewer Project Office. Zhang Renjun, the deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Project Office, has been promoted to director of that office. The total project budget has been set at 400 billion yuan. Consultant Morrill will go to Nanjing from the United States in November to assist in the design." (Special Correspondent Ouyang Zui)

### On the Debate of the Ten-Year Education Plan, Hu Shih Expresses His Thoughts, Believing the Government Should Especially Subsidize Excellent Departments

[Report from our newspaper] Dr. Hu Shih, President of Peking University, has arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing after attending the Council of the Academia Sinica and completing official business with the Ministry of Education. He is staying at the International Hotel and plans to fly back north within a few days. Since Mr. Hu met with our newspaper's reporter in Shanghai on September 5th and first announced his suggestion to the authorities for a "Ten-Year Plan to Strive for Academic Independence," scholars, celebrities, and university presidents have successively expressed their opinions, launching the academic community's first major debate after the war. The enthusiasm has been rare in recent years, and as of now, this debate has not yet ended. Last night, our reporter visited Mr. Hu at the International Hotel to inquire about his thoughts on this matter. Mr. Hu replied that this dispute is merely due to differences in individuals' views and opinions. Mr. Hu did not deny "favoritism" regarding the five universities he proposed to develop first in his ten-year education plan. When asked by the reporter how to determine the standard for excellent schools, he did not elaborate, stating that it should be determined based on the school's talent, equipment, and past performance. He expressed agreement with the point that the government should provide special subsidies to excellent departments of various universities, but believes that it should not be regarded as an opportunity for "extortion." Next, in response to the reporter's inquiry about the current lack of equipment in various universities and whether educational funding might be increased to 15% as stipulated after the implementation of the constitution to improve the situation universally, Mr. Hu believes that it "can definitely be realized." He stated that the Council has formally suggested to the government that one-fifth of the 15% educational funding should be used for scientific research equipment, and the remaining four-fifths should be used for general cultural education. Finally, Mr. Hu told the reporter his thoughts on the recent arrest of Peking University students: Students should strive to learn during their studies, and revolution is not impossible, but since they are prepared for revolution, they must be prepared to be arrested and take responsibility for all their actions. At this point, Mr. Hu cited an example: After he previously published a piece about General Feng Yuxiang wasting foreign exchange in the United States, and the relevant parties made a correction, he immediately issued a statement admitting his mistake.

Due to the unpredictable pitches of the visiting team's Zhāng Nǎixiáng, Shítàn's attack was met with Liáng Yǒulè's sharp pitches, and the visiting team's Guō Fùsān completed first base on the first hit. However, the successors were unable to get on base, and the first inning ended without any score. In the second inning, the home team's Liáng Yǒushēng made a comeback and gained first base on the first hit. However, after Lǐ Qǐténg was killed, there was a lack of follow-up, so the effort was futile, and the visiting team also did not score. In the third inning, after the Panda team finished attacking, the visiting team would eventually hit a triple, but still did not score. In the fourth inning, the Panda team's Wáng Qìngruì stepped up and completed a double on the first hit, and then advanced to third base. Liáng Yǒuyì stole a hit, and Wáng Qìngruì completed a home run, so the Panda team took the lead with one point. The provincial army regrouped, hoping to counterattack, but in addition to the main general being injured, the morale of the army had already appeared disorganized. Until the end of the game, the Panda team narrowly defeated the visiting team with a hard-won point, and Shítàn's expedition suffered its first defeat. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:

### Two Road Netball Teams to Compete in Beijing Today

The netball teams of the Ministry of Communications and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration hold a friendly competition in Beijing and Shanghai each year during the netball season. This year's friendly competition started with the Ministry of Communications coming to Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival, and the two railway bureaus won with a score of 21 to 16. It is reported that the second friendly competition in Beijing has been scheduled to be held in the next few days. The team members of the two railway bureaus will take the express train to Beijing at 10:00 this morning. The team of ten people will be led by Méi Fúqiáng, the vice president of the staff sports association of the bureau. The complete team list is recorded as follows:

Méi Fúqiáng (Team Leader), Ōuyáng Qiān, Guō Qǐdá, Fán Zǐshān, Dài Míngfā, Zhōu Yáng, Zhān Wényào, Zhōng Shìbǎo, Róng Yǒnglè, Péng Fènggāng.

### Father-Son Netball Tournament Expanded Finals Program: Today's and Tomorrow's Order Held as Originally Scheduled

There were initial discussions about ending the father-son doubles tennis tournament early. Yesterday, the committee officially decided to hold it as originally scheduled. Committee member Gu Qianlin proposed that to increase interest in this first father-son tournament and make it more meaningful, it is planned to invite Commander Xuan Tie Wu to present the awards at the finals, and to auction off charity balls with a target of 20 million yuan. In addition, each pair of fathers and sons will promote ticket sales so that relatives and friends can come to support the event. All proceeds will be allocated to social welfare causes. If this is done, the unprecedented father-son tennis tournament will be a memorable page in the tennis world and will give the children a good impression. The committee members Zhang Zizhen, Hu Yun, Hu Xiansheng, and Hou Danian all agreed, so it was decided to maintain the scheduled order. There will be two semi-final matches each today and tomorrow, and the quarter-finals and finals will be held on Saturday and Sunday of next week. A performance program may be arranged on the final day to increase interest. The order for today and tomorrow is as follows:

Hóu Dànián and Hóu Kāidì vs. Mǎ Huìbì and Mǎ Jǐngróng - 3:30 PM today

Chóng Zhì and Xǔ Péizhī vs. Zhū Bìtáng and Zhū Xiányù - 4:30 PM today

Gù Qiánlín and Gù Jiāzhèn vs. Hú Yún and Hú Qíchāo - 3:30 PM tomorrow

Zhāng Zǐzhèn and Zhāng Róngcái vs. Zhū Kuān and Zhū Yòukuān - 4:30 PM tomorrow

Today's four groups are all very evenly matched, and the level of skill is quite high, so there will inevitably be fierce competition. However, Zhu Mintang's right arm is injured and he cannot exert force. He has been seeking medical treatment for several days. To maintain his spirit, he will still play as usual today.

In yesterday's two second-round matches, the Zhu and Zhang pairs had average skills and were well-trained, so they won quite easily. The results are as follows:

The father-son tournament is being held at the Green Light Club, which has reduced the opportunity for members to hit balls. Moreover, the club provides tea and refreshments for each pair of players every day. This kind of cordiality is rare. Tang Shuming, the president of the club, has also donated silver cups and medals for the father-son tournament, which is especially admirable.

### A Colorful Record of the Gansu Provincial Games: Lanzhou Takes All Championships, and Performances are Wonderful

[Report from our newspaper in Lanzhou] In the Gansu Provincial Games, bicycle performances were held twice. Li Shoushan and Li Weishi (the latter is only 14 years old) performed at the same time, with single turns, double wheels, and various amazing skills on the bicycle, such as taking off clothes and pants on the bicycle, drinking tea, lying on the back, lying face down, standing upright on the bicycle, riding side by side with two people, riding backwards, dragonflies, advancing with hands instead of feet... There were many tricks, and the attitude was unrestrained. Tens of thousands of people in the audience applauded in unison, making it one of the most popular programs of the Games.

Equestrian Performance

Only fifteen riders participated in the equestrian performance of the Yongdeng Military Pasture, and the colors of the horses were uneven. First, they measured the field several times, followed by performances of saddle down, lying on the back, lying sideways, jumping up and down, hiding inside, releasing and standing upright on the horse's back, riding backwards, ... There seemed to be many tricks, but the atmosphere was relaxed, which did not arouse the interest of the audience. Those who have seen the horsemanship of the Northwest Mongolian and Tibetan people feel the difference between good and bad. Finally, Mr. Xie Haitian, an old gentleman of sixty-six years old, and Ms. Shao Zuoqi, a female staff member of the Northwest Daily, had a horse race. The former wore a long robe and mandarin jacket, with silver hair fluttering, while the latter wore Western female equestrian attire, with a ruddy complexion. They lightly jumped on the road, truly "fast as the wind and lightning," and "like a startled swan," which won applause from the whole audience.

Reporter Race

Finally, the most important thing to write about is the 100-meter race of news reporters. This was a temporary program initiated by the reporters themselves on the third day of the Games, which won the approval and attention of the Games. During the preliminary round, sixteen people participated, divided into two groups. Sun Runan, the mayor of Lanzhou and vice president of the Games, bet with the reporters that if they reached 14 seconds, the mayor would treat them. On the first day of the preliminary round, a total of eight people were selected from the two groups. The first was Wu Cun from the Northwest Economic Daily, with a result of 14.5 seconds. On the second day of the final, Guo Junqing, the chief judge of the Games, issued the command. Mayor Sun timed the race, and the audience around cheered enthusiastically. The reporters put down their pens and notebooks, took off their coats and suits, and some temporarily borrowed running shoes. With the sound of the starting gun, the reporters all ran forward with the competitive "foot" method of running news. The audience shouted "Go!", and the more they cheered, the more embarrassed they became. As a result, Wu Wenhua from the Northwest Daily broke the preliminary round record with 14.4 seconds. Although they did not reach the result of 14 seconds, the mayor added a few dishes at dinner to fulfill his promise and reward everyone. The Games also temporarily decided to issue a banner to each of the top four.

Review of Results

The Games lasted for five and a half days and attracted nearly 250,000 male and female spectators. The province, counties, and cities consumed more than 4 billion yuan in expenses. The results obtained were still barely satisfactory. Chairman Guo Ji Qi reviewed the shortcomings of the Games in the closing ceremony: Some individuals participated in too many competition items, which affected their performance due to fatigue. Some people did not fully understand the competition rules, which shows that physical education is still not widespread. At the same time, he encouraged all athletes with four points: Cherish the results of the Games; Strive for a sports revolution; Strive for national honor; Enrich the knowledge of provincial construction.

In the overall results of this competition, except for the female high school track and field competition, which was won by the ninth district, all other first places were won by Lanzhou City. Therefore, the banner of "Foundation of Self-Improvement" awarded by Chairman Jiang was also won by Lanzhou City.

### South African Cloth Merchants Massively Purchase Hong Kong Cloth

Totaling 116 Million Yards, Cloth Factories Will Need Two and a Half Years to Fulfill Orders

A South African company engaged in the cloth business has placed an astonishing order for cloth from Hong Kong weaving factories, totaling 116 million yards. Based on current Hong Kong production rates, it is estimated that for at least two and a half years, all output must be exclusively allocated to fulfilling this order, with no sales to other regions. Among the orders, Sudan intends to purchase 20 million yards, with a staggered delivery schedule, supplying 20 million yards annually. According to Mr. Sum Choi-wah, Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, 76 million yards are for South Africa, with the remainder for Sudan. Considering the current production rate of approximately 300 large and small weaving factories in Hong Kong, producing 100,000 bolts of cloth per month, 116 million yards is equivalent to about 2.8 million bolts, which would take two years and six months to complete. It is reported that part of the aforementioned order, totaling 60 million yards, was communicated to the Federation of Hong Kong Industries by the Hong Kong Department of Commerce and Industry, with the remainder being handled by foreign firms. It is also reported that a certain South African company inquired about cloth prices from Japan, but the Japanese were unable to supply such a massive quantity of cloth. A reporter asked Mr. Sum whether raw materials would become a problem if such a large order were to be secured by Hong Kong factories. He replied that with the assistance of the Department of Commerce and Industry, he believed it would not be an issue. Currently, the sources of cotton yarn are Bombay, England, Canada, and Shanghai.

### Merchants Unable to Apply Due to Unreceived Registration Copies

[Reported by This Newspaper] Since the government announced the measures for handling goods brought into the country and shipped by merchants with their own foreign exchange without licenses, it has been stipulated that relevant merchants must first apply for registration with the Import and Export Management Committee within a specified period. However, no one has yet come to register. According to explanations from importers and exporters, applicants for registration and purchase must submit an application form with the affixed seal of the registration copy sent by the secretariat of the Import and Export Management Committee, classifying the goods according to the attached schedule of tariff codes. They must then submit the application with the sealed copy to the competent authority through a designated bank. However, most merchants have not yet received the registration copies and are therefore unable to apply for registration.

### Cruel Husband Dies in Suicide Pact, Selling Motorcycle to Make a Living

To the editor, Guang Sheng: I am a helpless and lonely woman. My husband, Liang Mingke, committed suicide on September 25th with a woman named Zhang Fengying in the lotus pond of Zhongzheng Park for the sake of an affair. My husband left no assets behind, leaving my family of five in dire straits. Therefore, I must make a desperate plea, asking for sympathy or reasonable relief from benevolent gentlemen of society, for which I would be eternally grateful! Although I have only been married to my late husband, Liang Mingke, for six years, we already have three sons, the eldest being only five years old, the second four years old, and the youngest three years old. I am also six months pregnant, and I have an elderly mother who needs my care. Now that the deceased is gone, the future livelihood of the living, and the education and upbringing of the children, have become serious problems! I recall that when my husband was alive, he was quite responsible for arranging the family's livelihood. Who knew that he would heartlessly abandon our entire family and commit suicide with Zhang Fengying, the woman who ruined our family? After much contemplation, I cannot believe that there is such a cruel husband and such a violent woman who would destroy a family with a wife and many children. I now plan to auction off the "ZUNDApp" motorcycle left by my husband to provide for the future education and living expenses of the children. Those interested in purchasing, please visit No. 27 Jing'an Villas, Nanjing West Road, to see the motorcycle. I would be most grateful if your esteemed newspaper could publish this. With sincere wishes for your well-being. Yours sincerely, Liang Hu Huizhen.

Spring and Autumn

### Maeterlinck's New Work

— Zhao Jingshen

Maeterlinck has been publishing his anthologies for almost ten years. He prints meditations, diaries, essays, occasional poems or fables, fragmented scenes from plays, notes taken at any time, or excerpts from readings he has always remembered. This latest book, "The Great Beyond," even includes Bible stories as recounted by Thomas Mann.

Maeterlinck believes that God and the soul are unknowable. His mysticism remains unchanged. He continues to argue about the relationship between man and the infinite. "Honestly, what is the use of all these questions? Are they living with their eyes closed?" Maeterlinck also says: "Our naked eyes cannot see everything in the universe."

It is rare to see someone like Maeterlinck, at the age of eighty-four, who is able to be not sorrowful, not thinking of death, so serious, and not bitter, except for this Belgian master. He has not lost the wisdom of "The Blue Bird." This play has been popular in Europe and America for forty years and remains so today.

The last piece in this new book is a twenty-page short play, "The Old Man Who Does Not Want to Die," which is like a song carried on the wind, almost hard to hear, but still harmonious, all the way to the end. This is a beautiful work. This short play shows that everyone lives with his "shadow" and death. When a person dies, he does not need to fear God: he will not see "Him," not even the shadow will see "Him,"—because we are already in "Him."

On Christmas Eve last year, Maeterlinck broke his leg in the garden of his villa in Florida. It is unknown if he has recovered.

During the anti-Nazi war, we thought of the words in "The Blue Bird": "They need a hero to fight against injustice." He himself described the German invasion of Belgium in 1918 in a book called "The Mayor of Stilmonde." He defended his hometown, saying in a letter: "I am too late. Tomorrow morning I will inspect the troops, I will polish my Mauser rifle, which is really rusty."

Maeterlinck was made a Count in 1932, and he is an outstanding representative of modern Belgian literature. He was born on August 29, 1862, in the village of Oostacker. He was educated at the Christian College of Saint Barbe and the University of Ghent. He developed a great interest in beekeeping in his villa in Oostacker, and in May 1901, he wrote a famous book, "The Life of the Bee." In 1930, his interests shifted, and he published "The Mystery of the Stars." He had a villa in the summer in Great Temple and a villa in Nice in the winter.

At the age of twenty-four, he was a lawyer. In 1892, he published "Pelleas and Melisande," mocking the cold-blooded people in the factories of Ghent. He felt that he was not fit to practice law and stopped his legal practice in 1889.

His family was not short of money, so he could devote himself to literary work. He began writing poetry and printed a volume in 1889. The most interesting thing is that his play "Princess Maleine" was originally a poem, and then completely rewritten as prose. He was not immediately famous. At first, people did not know him, but then Mirbeau called him "the Belgian Shakespeare" and quoted his aphorisms, and he became a household name. In 1895, he also translated Ford's "Tis Pity She's a Whore," renaming it "Annobella."

Two of his plays were printed in Brussels in 1890, and in 1891 he published "Sept Princesses," with a strong tendency to mysticism. "The Blue Bird" wrote about the fruitless search of the children in the woodcutter's home for the memory courtyard, the night palace, and the garden of happiness. They wanted to seek happiness for the sick child next door, but unexpectedly, happiness was waiting for them at home all day.

His characters are mostly like those in a dream state, "ghosts disguised as people wandering in the world." He lived in a bungalow in Paris for a period of time and met many Symbolist poets in France. His "Pelleas and Melisande" was adapted into an opera by Debussy, and his fame grew even greater. "Aglacaine and Selysette" is called a rare adventure of emotion and soul.

His Great Temple villa occupies thirty-five acres, with trees and meadows, and the scenery is very beautiful. It is a 13th-century building.

He no longer believes in fate. He feels that human will can overcome fate.

### Dream of Yangzhou

— Chen Ruheng

In the Spring and Autumn supplement of Shen Bao, I often read the "Sequel to the Dream of Yangzhou" by my old classmate Hong Weifa Shiliang, whom I haven't seen in ten years. While admiring it, it aroused my interest in the study of the "Dream of Yangzhou."

Originally, during the Tang Dynasty, Yu Ye wrote a novel, "Record of the Dream of Yangzhou," which embellished the romantic anecdotes of Du Shou, a Tang Dynasty secretary of the Central Secretariat, in Yangzhou. Du Mu once wrote a poem, "Ten years of waking from a Yangzhou dream, I win a name as a heartless man in the pleasure quarters," which aroused the yearning and longing of later literati. Therefore, some legends and novels were also written, further enhancing the story of Du Mu. As far as we know, there are six types of books named "Dream of Yangzhou" in ancient and modern times.

"Dream of Yangzhou" by Qiao Mengfu. This is a Yuan Dynasty zaju drama, which tells the story of Du Mu. It is considered the earliest drama written about the Dream of Yangzhou.

"Romance of the Dream of Yangzhou" by Ji Yongren. Ji Yongren was a native of Wuxi in the Qing Dynasty, using the pen name Baodu Shannong. Wu Mei included this legend in his Shemotoshi Qucong Yao.

"Yangzhou Dream Zaju" by Huang Shishou. Huang has a zaju drama called "Four Talents." "Yangzhou Dream" is one of the four, which tells the story of Du Mu marrying two courtesans, Ziyun and Hongyu. The other three are "Hundred Wheel Robe," "Immortal in Drink," and "Lanqiao Post."

"Romance of the Dream of Yangzhou" by an unknown author. This was written by a Qing Dynasty person and tells the story of Du Zichun. Du Zichun was a native of Chang'an and a wealthy merchant in Yangzhou. Later, he attained enlightenment through Laozi. The story is based on the Taiping Guangji. However, we only saw a brief record of this legendary story in the "Summary of the Comprehensive Catalogue of Tunes." There is a title but no book, so it is probably impossible to find an old edition.

"Notes on the Dream of Yangzhou" by Jiao Dongzhousheng. Jiao Dongzhousheng wrote his book after the Taiping Rebellion in the Qing Dynasty. Jiaomo is a township under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang. Because he traveled to and from Yangzhou, he wrote about some prosperous and charming stories of courtesans and some elegant poems. The book is divided into four volumes: "Dreaming People," "Dreaming Words," "Dreaming Affairs," and "Dreaming Emotions." The writing style is extremely elegant and worthy of a famous writer. It is now included in the "Beautification of Literary Masterpieces Series" published by the World Book Company. There is a preface by Bao Xingzi from the 22nd year of the Republic of China: "This compilation is a copy from the Jiangnan Library, written by Jiao Dongzhousheng. It narrates his life's experiences in the brothels, the harmony of his friends and companions, the prosperity of Yangzhou customs, and the superstitions of the people of Yangzhou. The lost stories and lost writings are all recorded without omission. The poems are sensual and the writing style is elegant and refined, which cannot be matched by modern novelists." These are indeed not exaggerated words. The writing style in the book is not something that the mandarin duck and butterfly writers of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China could have written.

"Yangzhou Dream Novel" by an anonymous author. This was written by a Qing Dynasty person and describes the prosperity of Yangzhou during the Qianlong era and some fragmented records of society. The book intersperses some literati, with Zheng Banqiao as the central figure. Zheng Banqiao was a genius writer of his generation, with unparalleled achievements in poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He had a seal with the twelve characters "Kangxi Xiucai Yongzheng Juren Qianlong Jinshi." Although he was born in Xinghua County in northern Jiangsu, he often came to Yangzhou. The book records Ya Yu, who served as the Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai (written as Lu Du Zhuan in the book), Yuan Zicai (written as Yuan Zicai), Zhao Yunsong, Cheng Wuqiao, Jin Zongting, and some poets and writers who are yet to be verified. The book also describes the architecture of famous gardens, such as the "Jingzhao Xuan" villa of the Xu family, which is wonderfully decorated. In the middle is the "Shuizhu Ju," which is today's fountain. The water sprayed over the house like jade beads, which is clear proof that Chinese architecture at that time had been influenced by the West. In the book, Zheng Banqiao is written as Chen Wanqiao. The most unfortunate thing is that the author of the book did not sign his name, and the old edition has not been seen. It was printed and published by the National Studies Maintenance Society in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and it is difficult to find today. I will write a longer article to introduce it separately, so there is no need to say more here.

### Autumn Lyricism

— Xiao Leng

Last night, I was awakened by the weeping of the gray sky. The night wind gently knocked on my window, saying that sadness had just returned from traveling in the West and wanted to step into my small room of memories to rest. I opened the window, and the tears of the gray sky were dripping down, and a strange sobbing sound was vibrating in the distance; a beautiful and sad face of a young girl appeared in the darkness outside the window....

In the early morning, I walked to the lakeside. The damp wind blew from the west of the lake, scattering the withered leaves of the French plane trees. Those unknown wildflowers drooped their heads wearily, and their petals were covered with sparkling tears; there were no pedestrians along the lake, and those lonely yachts were tied haphazardly to the shore.... The scene was desolate, but even more desolate was my distant longing.

For these full seven years, for your love, it will multiply in my heart on these dark and hopeless days, like wild grapes in the autumn forest. It blooms very robustly and beautifully, but no one notices it. Who knows that it has been growing and dying so lonely! I clearly know that this can only give me deeper pain, but sometimes pain is also endearing; because this pain is so pure and beautifully lovely. Even if no one appreciates this flower of love, I still cherish it, like cherishing my own young life.

There is no way for me to describe how this terrible and strange love has penetrated so deeply into the interior of my life; it has become a part of my soul, it absorbs my emotions with amazing power. It is the root of a big tree, and my soul is the soil, and my emotions are the nourishment. In theory, this tree should have large flowers and fruits, but because it is not illuminated by the sun, it finally withers....

This will always be an unspeakable sorrow in my life.

I remember those days we spent together, those long winter night conversations, and the clear tears and passionate kisses that will live forever in my memory. ...These vanished youthful days, like a string of ingenious pearls, I count them one by one; I carefully savor these warm memories.

God of love! You have cruelly abused a believer who has always been devout and faithful to you.

When I despise happiness and bear this pain, my heart is mournful, but I am still proud of my pure feelings.

The cloudy sky is inevitably sad, and I write them down casually as a melancholy record of an autumn day.

### Writers on Criticism

— Dongfang Mengwu

Criticism has never influenced me in any way. Especially modern criticism is not suitable for influencing people, because critics do not read books carefully, cannot read, and often do not understand the books they read. Of course, this is not only about my books, but a general shortcoming of critics. The harm that "new" young writers suffer from him is very light. Attention should be paid to the negligent attitude of editors towards critical articles; probably the editors do not read it carefully. At most, it's just a general reading.

——Gorky

As far as being an artist is concerned, no one has ever heard of my paying the slightest attention to the articles people can write about me.

I think like Voltaire: "A few mosquito bites are not enough to restrain a galloping horse."

Speaking of these things, just let them talk. Their babbling will certainly not make anyone immortal, nor will it take away his immortality from Apollo, who makes him immortal.

——Beethoven

A critic should be smarter than a thinker and more talented than an artist, but he is not a creator and is not active, he is ruthless. ——Tolstoy

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"There are even more shallow things behind!" Yaoqun frowned with his reshaped eyebrows; "He underestimated me a bit. You see, after presenting some boring confessions, that fellow Buyer Sharf actually acted in front of so many people—the personnel of the puppet police station and special agents, etc.—requesting that puppet official to allow him to make a phone call. After their two sides made a show of questioning, that Buyer Sharf used countless strange gestures and actually made a phone call on the spot..."

"To the Japanese Operations Headquarters?" I couldn't help but guess.

Yaoqun: "Just fooling around, who knows who he called, but he used the Japanese language."

"How did you get out later?" I asked.

"It was truly glorious! The "General Headquarters of the Japanese Island Army's Operations in Tianjin" dispatched several guards, ostensibly to protect, but actually to escort me to their headquarters. Buyer Sharf also kept comforting me along the way, talking nonsense and promoting himself a lot; saying how influential he was with the Japanese devils, and even if the Japanese military didn't help him this time, he had even greater power that he could use. Anyway, there was no danger—referring to the status of me and him..."

Yaoqun said to this point, and then shifted his gaze from me to Little Tiger. I think he had already recalled Little Tiger's experience in Tianjin at this time. Little Tiger and I only met very briefly this time. He didn't mention to me anything about his work in Tianjin, and how he passed through Peiping and sneaked here again. Several times I wanted to ask him, but he diverted the conversation. At this time, I saw Yaoqun looking at Little Tiger, with a mysterious smile on his face, and I guessed that there must be a ridiculous story in it; just as I was about to ask Yaoqun about Little Tiger, Yaoqun had already started talking:

"You know," Yaoqun raised his eyebrows; "That fellow, Buyer Sharf, after taking me to the Japanese Operations Headquarters, didn't let me do anything alone until yesterday; like a ghost, he was always stuck behind me. Although sometimes he wasn't with me, every time I wanted to take some action, he would arrange a kind of defense in advance, restricting my freedom, so to speak, whether he was with me or not, I couldn't act alone."

I didn't quite understand. How could Yaoqun, such a formidable character, be restricted by this Buyer Sharf? Was he mainly using tricks and conspiracies, or was he using force? So I specifically asked Yaoqun about this point.

"This is a bit inexplicable." Yaoqun seemed a bit dazed: "Just to give one example, you can probably understand. For example, in the Japanese Operations Headquarters, whenever he met someone, whether it was a Japanese devil or one of our own people, he would rush to introduce me; when introducing me, he repeatedly made people pay attention to my face and clothing. So although he sometimes went to handle his own affairs, if I took one more step, it seemed like someone would make some kind of ambiguous hint or sound behind me, making me feel it was a warning, forcing me to stop my current attempt. So, it can be said that I have been simply restricted by him these past few days!..."
