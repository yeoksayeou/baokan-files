Note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the US Embassy: I am writing regarding Article 2 (d) and Article 9, item (a) of the Agreement between the Republic of China and the United States of America concerning relief assistance from the United States of America to the Chinese people, signed today by representatives of the governments of China and the United States. Both parties understand that the Chinese government has the right to determine the size of its armed forces and the quantity of food and other materials used to supply those forces, and this should be fully recognized. The ratification of the above agreement does not affect this right. However, in accordance with Public Law 84 passed by the 80th Congress authorizing the provision of relief assistance, the President of the United States may terminate the supply of American relief assistance at any time if he believes that an excessive amount of relief materials supplied by the United States to the people of any country, or similar materials produced locally or imported from abroad, are being used to help maintain that country's armed forces. Due to this provision in the relief bill, the US government must reserve the right to terminate the shipment of relief supplies to China if it believes that an excessive amount of relief materials, or similar materials produced locally or imported from abroad, are being used to maintain the armed forces in China. The above is the mutual understanding between our two governments and constitutes part of the aforementioned agreement. I am writing to inform you accordingly and hope you will confirm this. The Acting Minister presents his highest respects to His Excellency John Leighton Stuart, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of China. Liu Shih-shun, October 27, 1947, Republic of China.

Note from the US Embassy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: I am writing in response to your Excellency's note of October 27 of this year, which reads: "(Full text as above, omitted)". Accordingly, I am pleased to confirm that the understanding described in the aforementioned note has now been accepted by the Government of the United States of America and constitutes a part of the agreement signed today. I am writing to inform you accordingly. The Ambassador presents his highest respects to His Excellency Liu, Acting Minister of Political Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Foreign Minister Wang Arrives in Beijing Via Shanghai - Plans to Immediately Meet with Chairman Chiang to Report on the Trip - Gained a Deep Understanding of the Current Situation in Japan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh returned to the capital on the evening of the 27th. Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Hang Liwu, Gan Naiguang, Luo Jialun, Liu Shih-shun, Ye Gongchao, Mrs. Wang, and other senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Chinese and foreign reporters, totaling more than 60 people, all went to the airport to welcome him. It was initially rumored that Wang would arrive at 5:30 PM, but after Captain Fu En of the Yi Brigade inquired by telegram to Shanghai, the news was confirmed, so many welcomers made two trips to the airport, and some waited more than three hours. Wang's special China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane, the "Skyhawk 132," landed at 8:05 PM, by which time it was already dusk. The airport lighting equipment shone directly on the aircraft door. Wang, wearing a gray pinstripe suit and a dark coat, stepped out of the cabin, his face full of travel dust, but his expression cheerful. After stepping off the stairs and accepting a group photo from reporters, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one. As he was leaving, he was surrounded by reporters. He initially said, "Slow down." He then described the situation of his trip to Japan, briefly stating: "During his four days in Japan, he had long talks with MacArthur and representatives of the Allied mission in Japan, senior members of our mission in Japan, and Japanese Prime Minister Katayama and Foreign Minister Hida. He personally gained a deep understanding of the current situation in Japan, and believes that some of the reports in the general newspapers regarding the situation in Japan, especially the reports on MacArthur's achievements, do not fully correspond to the facts." As for his discussions with the White House and his overall impressions of the trip, he declined to answer, saying: "Regarding matters in the United States, I do not wish to speak of them briefly." He said that he would talk to reporters in detail as soon as possible, so that this important matter could be made public to the people of the country. Wang said in response to reporters that he planned to immediately meet with the Chairman to report on the trip. Wang left Shanghai for the United States on September 9, leading our delegation to attend the second session of the United Nations General Assembly. During his time in the United States, he engaged in active independent diplomacy. His two proposals regarding the veto power and the Japanese peace treaty have attracted worldwide attention. The former has the potential to resolve disputes caused by the veto power and has been accepted by the General Assembly and referred to a committee for examination. The latter has a decisive impact on the convening and success of the Japanese peace conference and is already reflected in the facts. Both proposals have been strongly supported by people from all walks of life and public opinion in the country, who believe that Wang's trip was a great success.

### A Fifteen-Minute Confidential Talk with Zhang Jia'ao in Shanghai

[Report from our Newspaper] Foreign Minister Wang took a Northwest Airlines special plane from Tokyo yesterday at 11:30 AM (Tokyo time) to return to China. Due to wind conditions, he did not arrive at Longhua Airport in this city until 6:15 PM. Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials who returned to China with Foreign Minister Wang included Director Hu Qingyu and Secretary-General Guo Lu. Director Zhang Yuanzhang stayed in the United States due to illness. Many people from all walks of life went to the airport to welcome him, including Hu Shih, Zhang Jia'ao, Shen Zonglian, Chen Guolian, Gao Lingbai, and Zhuang Yuling. Foreign Minister Wang told reporters: "All the questions have been answered in detail in Tokyo. What I can say is that the current Japanese government is indeed working hard to democratize the country. What happens in the future depends on the Japanese peace treaty." Regarding the Allied supervision of Japan after the treaty is concluded, Wang said that it was not convenient to answer. "As for insisting on the veto power in the peace conference, it is our country's established policy. Our country has put forward a plan for this matter and is waiting for the final reply from the United States and the Soviet Union. As for whether there has been any recent change in the US policy towards China, this must be said by the US side itself, and I am not in a position to speak for them. However, the recent reports in American newspapers about China are clearly different from the past." Foreign Minister Wang took the special Skyhawk plane sent by the Chairman to welcome him back to Beijing at 6:35 PM that evening. Before leaving, he had a confidential talk with President Zhang Jia'ao in the center of the airport for as long as fifteen minutes.

### Zhou Yide Flies to Beijing Immediately - Advocates for Aid to China in His Speech in Beiping

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] US Congressman Zhou Yide's report is becoming an important reference for China policy in Congress. Zhou argues that aid to China is as urgent as aid to Europe, and that aid to China costs less than aid to Europe. Even if the Wedemeyer Report is not published, at least its recommendations should be published so that the American people understand why aid to China is needed. Wedemeyer also advocates for aid to China, but because he spent less time in China, he may not be clear about everything. Some people believe that the Chinese government is "undemocratic," so they oppose aid to China. In fact, no country in a civil war can maintain democracy and eliminate other ills. If we do not aid China now, it may be too late to aid China in the future. If China is unstable, the Korean problem will also be difficult to solve.

### National Assembly Members' Association Writes to the Chairman - Requests the Convening of a Provisional National Assembly - Advocates for Careful Handling of Elections and Efforts to Suppress Disorder

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The National Assembly Members' Association, dissatisfied with the current elections, previously had a proposal to ask the government to convene a provisional National Assembly. Recently, on the morning of the 27th, they presented Chairman Chiang with a letter stating their opinions. At the same time, they hosted reporters at 5:00 PM on the 27th to announce the contents of the letter to the Chairman. During the meeting, a reporter asked what preparations the association had made for convening a provisional National Assembly. They replied that convening a provisional National Assembly was the government's prerogative. According to the constitution, this request should be made with the joint signature of two-fifths of the representatives. There are now 617 people who have signed their names, asking the government to convene this meeting. Other than that, there are no preparations. Someone then asked if the government disregarded everything and continued to proceed, would the association take further action? They replied that if the authorities disregarded everything, the association would consider further measures, or convene a meeting on its own, but the government should accept this suggestion. Finally, someone shouted that this predetermined list was a rape of public opinion and that everyone should stand up to protect the law.

[Another Telegram] National Assembly Representative Kong Geng and 617 others wrote to Chairman Chiang, advocating for careful handling of elections, convening a provisional National Assembly, and making every effort to suppress disorder. The telegram was sent to the mountain on the 27th. The original text is as follows: (Continued in column 1 on page two)

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] Kuomintang Senators Da Pao-sheng, Chen Yidong, Wang Guanying, Chen Yiyun, Yin Shujun, and 30 others held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 27th to discuss election issues. Chairman Da Paosheng first reported on the results of the recent talks between their nine members and central leaders, stating briefly that the central leaders attached great importance to the election of senators and promised to support them. However, the number of Kuomintang senators who were predetermined to be elected was less than one or two out of ten of the total number, which was quite regrettable. Finally, it was decided that: 1) the Central Committee should continue to support those who have been predetermined by the local association, 2) reasonable and fair remedies should continue to be made for those who have not been supported by the local association, 3) Mo Dehui, Jiang Yong, Zou Wenshan, Da Paosheng, and Shao Lizi were appointed to meet with the Chairman to report on the situation in various places, 4) in addition to the original nine members, additional personnel were assigned to contact them separately.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) went to Beijing on the evening of the 27th with the party's list of candidates for the National Assembly.

[Report from Our Newspaper] After completing his inspection in Taiwan, Political Committee Member Peng Xuepei arrived in Shanghai by China Airlines flight at 2:45 PM yesterday and will return to Beijing shortly.

Taiwan Province was originally within the Japanese economic system, and after the retrocession, its industry often felt the shortage of raw materials and parts. The situation of this year's industry has improved, but complete recovery will still take time. My inspection did not have a fixed plan, and was entirely determined by the circumstances of time. I plan to visit Jiangxi in the near future, because Jiangxi Province is my hometown, and its mineral resources are also very important." Regarding the U.S.'s changing policy towards China, Peng believes it is natural, because the fundamental interests of China and the United States are consistent, and the two countries should cooperate closely. Taiwan Party Supervisory Commissioner Wu Shao also arrived in Shanghai on the same flight as Peng. He went to Beijing that night to report on his work.

### A New Outlook on the Situation in Xinjiang

Unfortunately, the news about Xinjiang seen in the newspapers recently has been quite contradictory. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd, the rebellion in Xinjiang has revived, and Chenghua, 250 miles north of Dihua, has been occupied by the Yining rebels. At the same time, the dispatch from Yining reported that the Yining side is demanding complete independence and is prepared to fight for it by force. At this time, Madam Bao Erhan, a government committee member from Xinjiang, happened to fly from Dihua to the capital, telling reporters that "everything in Xinjiang is peaceful and stable as always, and no chaotic events as rumored have occurred." Coincidentally, General Zhang Zhizhong's open letter of September 1 to Ahmetjan of Yining received a reply at the same time; the Yining side put forward four points as preconditions for negotiations. According to the government committee member Bao Erhan, this reply indicates that the Yining side is willing to reopen the door to negotiations, which is deeply beneficial to the peace of Xinjiang. The situation in Xinjiang is, after all, a matter of concern to the people of the country. Integrating reports from all sides, we believe that although the situation in Xinjiang may not have completely returned to stability, the rebellion may not be as serious as reported by foreign news agencies, and judging from the recent trend, the situation in Xinjiang is also likely to improve.

As Madam Bao Erhan said, the proposal of the Yining side to reply indicates that negotiations can be expected to reopen, which is indeed beneficial to the stability of the situation in Xinjiang. Originally, the situation in Xinjiang had embarked on a new path since General Zhang Zhizhong, following the central government's decision, successively established the main text and appendices of the agreement on reconciliation of the Yining dispute. However, the rebellion suddenly broke out, and the vice chairman of the provincial government, Ahmetjan, established himself in Yining, and Usman, the commissioner of the Ashan district, was expelled from Chenghua. For a time, the situation in Xinjiang, which could have been roughly stabilized, was once again fractured. Now that Usman has recovered Ashan, and the Yining side's reply has been put forward at this time, this is indeed something that makes people ponder.

Tracing back to the Yining Incident in the winter of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the area formed a semi-independent situation. General Zhang Zhizhong advocated an enlightened and tolerant approach, but failed to change the stubborn attitude of the "splittists." Although a peace agreement was signed in the interim, peace was not guaranteed, and the Tacheng and Ashan regions were eventually invaded by Yining, causing a split in half of Xinjiang's border. The Baitashan Incident on June 5 this year was the Yining side playing the trick of Wu Sangui borrowing troops from the Qi people [Manchu], preparing to ignite flames all over Xinjiang and create greater division and chaos. Looking at the facts of the past few months, the government's handling of the Xinjiang issue has determination and methods, as well as the sincerity of the Uyghur and other ethnic groups to look inward, and the rising anti-separation sentiment of the Xinjiang people. The conspiracy of the "splittists" has failed.

Usman, who recovered the Ashan region, is the leader of the Maoniqa tribe of the Kazakhs and is known as a national hero of the Kazakhs in Xinjiang. After the peace agreement, Wu took office as the commissioner of the Ashan region. Because he was dissatisfied with the activities of the "splittists," he became estranged from Yining. The entire region was occupied by the rebels, and Wu, in a helpless situation, led his troops to withdraw from Baitashan, reorganized his elite troops, and vowed to recover Chenghua and see the light of the integrity of Chinese territory again. Ashan belongs to the Gobi Altai mountain range and borders the Soviet-Mongolian border. Since being captured by the rebels, Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan have stood as a tripod, raising the flag of "East Turkestan." The intention of special status, the outbreak of the Baitashan Incident, is a blatant expression of the development of special status; the departure of Ahmetjan and others from Dihua is an expression of a "separatist" non-cooperative attitude. General Zhang Zhizhong once warned Ahmetjan, hoping that he would return to Dihua to reopen negotiations; Chairman Mesut decided to realize democratic construction and win the hearts of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In the past two months, the enthusiastic popular elections in Xinjiang and the deployment of economic construction have achieved great results. The people of Yining could not bear the autocratic rule and went to Dihua one after another. The people of Ashan were dissatisfied with the exorbitant taxes and levies and asked Usman for help one after another. At this time, Usman recovered Chenghua by unconventional means, and the Ashan area was seen again in the light. If Yining and Tacheng do not consciously return, they will be abandoned by the people and disgusted by the nation.

Under these circumstances, we saw the announcement of the Yining side's reply. Regardless of whether they have sincerity in restoring the stability of Xinjiang, since negotiations can be expected to reopen, we hope that the authorities in charge of Xinjiang, such as General Zhang Zhizhong, can return to office as soon as possible and make good deployments and rectifications for our northwestern border defense. China's treatment of Xinjiang is based on the Three Principles of the People of the revolution, with the harmony of all ethnic groups as the premise, which cannot but be said to be our enlightened policy; even foreign newspapers, such as the New York Herald Tribune, also believe that the Chinese government's granting of extensive autonomy to the province and the holding of negotiations by the experienced and capable General Zhang Zhizhong are wise and generous measures. At the same time, we hope that all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, especially the authorities on the Yining side, can also abandon their prejudices, transcend and liberate themselves from the conspiracy of certain countries, and jointly seek a new look for the situation in Xinjiang.

### National Assembly Members' Association Submits Letter to Chairman Chiang

(Continued from page one) To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: In accordance with the procedures for the preparation for the implementation of constitutional government resolved by the National Assembly, a general election must be held this year, and the National Assembly must be convened on December 25 to implement constitutional government. It should be handled as scheduled to uphold the major law. However, the implementation of constitutional government places the greatest emphasis on the general election, which must comply with the Constitution and various regulations on the implementation of constitutional government. The matter should be handled carefully, and efforts should be made to ensure accuracy, to show future generations, and it should not be completed on schedule just because the deadline is approaching, or settle for the facts, make do with what is available, ignore the regulations, and place the foundation of constitutional government on the desert, merely opening up bad precedents for elections and providing excuses for villains. According to written opinions expressed by representatives from Hunan, Guangdong, Shantou and other provinces and cities, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Henan and other provinces also have resolutions to handle the election carefully. Understanding the difficult times, there are many difficulties. Representatives from various places who have come to Beijing one after another have exchanged opinions on this many times. The main points are as follows: The Northeast and North China are now occupied and disturbed by communist bandits, totaling 22 provinces and cities. It is difficult to conduct elections during wartime. The law clearly stipulates that professional representatives are elected nationwide. If these areas adopt methods such as selection and designation due to difficulties, it will not only deprive some voters of their rights, but also invite criticism from all parties. If it is not held temporarily, it will not meet the two-thirds of the required number stipulated in Article 8 of the preparatory procedures. Moreover, the so-called two-thirds means that the whole country is proceeding at the same time. If there are some areas that cannot be elected in time during the election period due to some reason, but more than two-thirds have been elected, the meeting can be held. It does not mean that one-third is not considered. It is necessary to be cautious in advance about the lack of understanding of this kind of legal principle that a meeting can be held by electing only two-thirds, so as to avoid disputes afterwards. The flames of war are everywhere in the northern provinces, and the people are in the midst of displacement and death. The local order in the northern provinces has not yet returned to the pre-war state. This year, floods are rampant, the disaster areas are vast, and the burden of conscription and food requisition is heavy, and the lives of civilians are miserable. At this time, the cost of holding a general election by the central and local governments will amount to hundreds of billions or tens of billions in each province and city. This kind of direct and indirect heavy burden will inevitably affect finance and drag down people's livelihood, which cannot be borne by the society. Suppressing bandits and suppressing rebellion is the primary task of nation-building. At this time of mobilization, all forces should be concentrated to wipe out the communist bandits in one fell swoop, so as to establish the foundation of constitutional government. At this time of panic and potential dangers, if intense competition leads to social disputes and affects the great plan of suppressing rebellion, it will only make relatives sad and enemies happy. The area of the national pacification zone is not small. Although it is stable on the surface, hidden remnants of bandits are active everywhere. If general elections are held in these areas, they will be used by villains. If elections are held in stable provinces and districts first and bandit areas are delayed, it will be difficult to convene a conference and implement constitutional government in the short term. That is, the original intention of the government to return power to the people cannot be realized, and the coexistence of new and old representatives, new and old legislative and supervisory committee members will easily cause regional views and repeat the disputes between the new and old parliaments in the early years of the Republic, hindering the unification of politics. During the mobilization to suppress the rebellion, the soldiers all over the country are running to the front to serve the country. In the midst of this military urgency, they have no time to participate in the election, making it impossible for them to exercise their rights, which is unfair. The number of legislative committee members stipulated by the Legislative Yuan this time is based on the maximum number of households reported by various provinces and cities between the 16th and 25th years of the Republic [1927-1936], and the population numbers in various places after the war have changed greatly. It has not been investigated in detail, and it is intended to produce rough and shoddy products in a few months in a hurry. The procedures cannot be perfect. Not only is it not enough to show seriousness, but it will also arouse accusations from all parties. In a short period of time, it is difficult to be thorough in all aspects of the national election in terms of affairs and technology. It only causes difficulties for governments at all levels. Even if we want to strive for perfection, the actual difficulties cannot be overcome, and it is impossible for a piece of paper from the higher authorities to take effect. Although the date of the National Assembly this year was decided by the previous session of the Assembly, the current situation has changed, which is different from what was expected at the meeting last year that the overall situation could be clarified within six months. Looking at the examples of constitutional government in various countries, constitutional government is started after the foundation of the country is stable. There is no example of promoting elections in order to gloss over peace while internal chaos has not subsided. It is not appropriate to cling to stereotypes and invite criticism. Moreover, disputes have arisen in various places where elections are held, and people's minds are agitated, and dangers are everywhere. The impact of this over time is enough to hinder the implementation of constitutional government and shake the foundation of democracy. Looking to the future, it is very worrying. To sum up, either the number of voters is inaccurate, or it affects the progress of suppressing the rebellion, or it causes social disturbances. If we do not strive for a practical solution, the constitutional government of our country, which has long been stable and peaceful, will become the result of inviting chaos and disturbing the country, hiding the country's shortcomings and betraying the people's expectations. The representatives and others, considering the national conditions and considering the current situation, believe that the preparatory procedures for the implementation of constitutional government were decided by the Constitutional National Assembly, and no organization may change it without a re-resolution by all the representatives. However, judging from the current facts, it is necessary to discuss again and handle the election carefully. After thinking again and again, the representatives and others have no choice but to request your permission to convene a temporary meeting of the National Assembly in accordance with the law, so as to lay the foundation for constitutional government and promote the implementation of democratic politics, which will be deeply beneficial to the future of the country.

### Suggestions for Improving Election Affairs

(Continued from page one) The current party nomination and designated voting methods violate the spirit of the Constitution and request that the central government adopt a free competition method. The list of candidates submitted by the provinces and counties should be re-examined by the central government for comparison. Personnel participating in the meeting shall absolutely not run for election. Non-actual practitioners shall not participate in vocational group elections. The Association hosted reporters in Beijing on the 27th. In addition to reporting the above opinions, representatives from various units "such as Jiangxi, Anhui, and others" cited many examples of election scandals in their respective provinces.

### Foreign Military Experts View the Situation in Northeast China; US Aid Is Too Little, Too Late

(Reuters, Nanjing, 27th) Foreign military observers here almost unanimously agree that the situation of the National Army in Northeast China is difficult to help. According to a foreign observer in a very high position with fifteen years of experience in China, even if US aid becomes a reality, it will have very little immediate impact on the war situation in Northeast China. US aid can boost morale, but it cannot win battles. Even if the United States decides tomorrow to provide financial and military assistance to China, and US industry immediately resumes wartime production, the first batch of bullets will arrive in the guns of the National Army in Northeast China at least six months later. The destruction of transportation in the Northeast is a decisive factor, which is the biggest obstacle facing the National Army in the Northeast. I have seen a section of railway a hundred miles long, destroyed from beginning to end. Government officials admit that there are no more railroad ties left, and there is no possibility of replenishment for many months. On the railways that the government is rushing to repair, the distance between the railroad ties is often more than three yards, thereby reducing its carrying capacity. Now that winter is approaching, construction work will soon come to a complete standstill. As far as the military aid that the United States has given to China so far, it has all been shelved on the islands of the Pacific before being transported to China, allowing it to rot, all due to the lack of new supplies and the abnormal source of supply. Another foreign observer said: Most of the weapons used by the Communist Party are made in Japan, left by the Japanese during the war; as for training, there is no doubt that Soviet personnel are engaged in organization and training. These personnel are first trained in Russia, and then return to the Northeast. The weapons used by the Mongolian Communists and Korean Communists during the war can prove that the previous words are not wrong. Another foreign observer said when referring to the possibility of the United States providing financial and military assistance to China, believing that US assistance is inevitable? The question is whether the Chinese government can accept the terms of the loan. He expects that Foreign Minister Wang will bring these terms with him when he returns from the United States this time. Referring to the sixth offensive launched by the Communist Party in Northeast China, he expects that the Communist Army intends to launch a full-scale offensive before the arrival of winter.

### The Deeds of the People of Jilin and Changchun Fighting Against Bandits Are Laudable and Tragic; The Li Family, the First Household in Karen Northeast, Only Five of More Than Seventy People Survive

(Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th) Since the bandit atmosphere invaded the Jilin and Changchun areas, many laudable and tragic deeds of the people fighting against bandits have been left on the fertile land south of the Songhua River. With a painful mood, the reporter reports to the people of the country one of the most tragic and heroic facts: On the 17th of this month, after the bandit army infiltrated Karen Station on the Jilin-Changchun Road, another group of about 100 people attacked Xiaozizu Village, six miles northeast of Karen, attempting to steal grain and horses. More than 30 young men from the Li family compound, the first household in the village, resisted the bandits with dilapidated weapons. (According to reports, villages in Northeast China had self-defense weapons before September 18, and shortly after September 18, they also used them to resist the Japanese invaders.) They fought fiercely with the bandits for two hours, killing dozens of bandits. At that time, the bandit reinforcements brought two mortars to support them, and the village was captured. Only five of the Li family compound, consisting of more than 70 men, women, and children, survived, and the rest were brutally killed. More than 20 women and children were tied to trees in the courtyard and stabbed to death with bayonets. The tragic scene is unbearable to hear.

### It Has Snowed in Rehe Province, But Refugee Children Are Still Naked

It is recommended that the General Assembly improve and announce the import quota earlier. The third type of import license of the association will be issued within days, and the fourth type of import quota can also be announced in time in November.

### Sichuan-Kang Provincial Inspector Suggests Improving Commodity Tax Measures

(Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th) Zeng Dao, Sichuan-Kang Provincial Inspector, suggested that the Ministry of Finance change the commodity tax adjustment tax rate and tax application methods. The main points are as follows: The number of times and dates of commodity tax rate adjustments each year do not need to be fixed, and should be decided temporarily depending on price changes, so as to avoid merchants pre-reporting taxes. After the merchant fills out the commodity tax tax declaration application, it is necessary to verify the type of goods and pay the tax to issue a certificate. When necessary, personnel can be sent to verify the goods. If it is found that the merchant has pre-reported taxes or is inaccurate, bonuses can be given appropriately to encourage them. Add two columns in the commodity tax tax application form, the person who checks the goods and the person who reviews it, and the person must be stamped after verification, so that the responsibility can be pursued in case of questions.

It is reported that all public funds for the students this month have been used up by the 26th due to high prices. Principal Sun Dongsheng claimed that there was no money to help. The students said that the public funds had been received on September 15. At that time, a bag of flour was only 140,000 yuan, but now it is 280,000 yuan. Why not issue it or purchase goods for storage first? There is obvious corruption, which aroused public outrage. All the students unanimously declared a strike on the 27th.

### Full Text of the Sino-American Relief Agreement

Agreement Between the Republic of China and the United States of America Regarding Relief Assistance from the United States of America to the People of China.

Whereas the United States of America desires to provide relief assistance to the people of China, so as to alleviate their suffering and enable them to continue their earnest efforts toward recovery;

And whereas the Government of China has requested relief assistance from the Government of the United States and has provided information which has satisfied the Government of the United States that such assistance is needed to obtain essential basic necessities for the people of China;

And whereas the Congress of the United States has, by Act of August 31, 1947, 80th Congress, Public Law 84, authorized the provision of relief assistance to the people of countries determined by the President to be in need thereof upon satisfactory assurance by such countries with respect to the relief program contemplated by that Act of Congress;

And whereas the Government of China and the Government of the United States are desirous of setting forth certain terms and understandings relating to the handling and distribution of United States relief supplies and of prescribing the general manner of cooperation between the two Governments to meet the relief needs of the people of China;

The Government of the Republic of China, represented by Liu Shih-shun, and the Government of the United States of America, represented by John Leighton Stuart, have agreed as follows:

Article 1. Supply of Materials

(A) The program of assistance shall include materials of various categories and quantities and services related to the procurement, storage, transportation, and shipment of such materials as the Government of the United States may from time to time determine after consultation with the Government of China, pursuant to the Act of August 31, 1947, 80th Congress, Public Law 84, and any amendments or supplements thereto. Such materials shall be limited to essential basic necessities, namely, food, medical and pharmaceutical supplies, manufactured and unmanufactured clothing materials, fertilizer, insecticides, fuel, and seeds.

(B) Except as otherwise provided in Article III, the Government of the United States shall make no claim for reimbursement for United States relief materials and services supplied pursuant to this Agreement and shall not acquire any title to reimbursement.

(C) The procurement, storage, transportation, and shipment to China of United States relief materials shall be effected by agencies of the Government of the United States, except to the extent that the Government of the United States may arrange for such services to be performed in other ways in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Government of the United States. All United States relief materials shall be procured within the United States except as specifically authorized by the Government of the United States to be procured outside the United States.

(D) The Government of China will from time to time submit to the Government of the United States in advance of its needs for relief imports a program thereof. Such program shall be subject to review and approval by the Government of the United States. Procurement of relief materials shall be limited to items included in the approved program.

(E) The transfer of United States relief materials shall be effected in accordance with arrangements to be agreed upon between the Government of the United States and the Government of China. The Government of the United States may retain title to any United States relief materials, or recover title to such materials already transferred, whenever it determines that such action is advisable, until such materials reach the city or locality where they are to be made available to the ultimate consumer.

Article 2. Distribution of Relief Materials in China

(A) All United States relief materials shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement by the Government of China and by voluntary agencies already established in China which are mutually acceptable to the two Governments. Representatives of the United States of America shall have the right of direct observation and control over the distribution of United States relief materials supplied pursuant to this Agreement.

(B) All imports of United States relief materials shall be free from taxation of any kind, including customs duties, until such time as they shall have been sold for Chinese currency pursuant to Article III of this Agreement; provided, however, that for pricing purposes customs duties or governmental taxes may be included in the established price. In the event of such inclusion the tax collected in connection with imports of United States relief materials will be placed in the special account referred to in Article III. All imports of United States relief materials for free distribution to the poor, to groups, and to others, and distribution by voluntary agencies shall be free from taxation of any kind, including customs duties.

(C) The Government of China will designate one high official who will be responsible for liaison between the Government of China and the United States representatives in charge of the relief program.

(D) United States relief materials and indigenous supplies of China, or similar supplies imported from abroad, shall be distributed by the Government of China and by the voluntary agencies without discrimination as to race, creed, or political belief. When the need for relief purposes continues to exist, the Government of China shall not permit any such materials to be diverted to nonessential uses or to be exported from China or transferred abroad. The Government of China shall not permit United States relief materials or more than normal quantities of similar materials of indigenous origin, or imported from abroad to the same extent as United States relief materials, to be used to maintain military establishments.

(E) The Government of China will take appropriate steps to assure the fair and equitable distribution of United States relief materials and of indigenous supplies of China, and of similar supplies imported from abroad, to all classes of the people.

(F) The Government of China will establish, wherever practicable, in the principal cities of China, distribution and price control systems in order to assure that all classes of the people, irrespective of purchasing power, shall have a fair share of the relief materials imported from abroad or produced locally. It is understood that United States relief materials made available pursuant to this Agreement may be used to support Chinese efforts toward improving consumer and price controls; however, the Government of the United States assumes no responsibility for the success of such municipal programs.

Article 3. Utilization of Funds Accruing from the Sale of United States Materials

(A) The prices at which United States relief materials shall be sold in China shall be agreed upon by the Government of China and the Government of the United States.

(B) When United States relief materials are sold for Chinese currency, such Chinese currency shall be deposited by the Government of China in the name of the Government of China in a special account.

(C) Until June 30, 1948, such funds shall be used, with the approval of the duly authorized representatives of the Government of the United States, for relief and reconstruction purposes in China, including Chinese currency expenditures of the United States of America incident to the supplying of relief. Any unencumbered balances remaining in such account as of June 30, 1948, shall be used in China for purposes to be designated by the Government of the United States pursuant to Act of Congress or joint resolution of both Houses.

(D) To the extent requested by the United States representatives, the Government of China shall advance funds, to be reimbursed from the proceeds of the sale of United States relief materials, for expenditures of Chinese currency incident to the supplying of relief, including the operations of United States relief representatives in China, and for certain emergency relief programs currently being conducted by agencies of the Government of China and by voluntary agencies.

(E) Normally, the funds accruing from the sale of United States relief materials will not be used to reimburse the Government of China for local expenses, including charges for unloading and other port charges, incident to the handling, inland transportation, and distribution of United States relief materials. The United States representatives are willing, however, to consider with the Government of China the use of these funds for meeting extraordinary expenses in order to avoid imposing an undue burden on the Government of China.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] After the victory of General De Gaulle's French People's Rally in the municipal elections was further consolidated by the results of the second round of voting on Sunday, he demanded today that the National Assembly be dissolved immediately and that new elections be held. He issued a televised declaration today, demanding an amendment to the constitution. He stated that the Communist Party had lost the support of one-seventh of its voters and that the French People's Rally had received more votes in all districts than the combined votes of other parties. He argued that the municipal elections were the best opportunity to express national public opinion. His declaration stated, "The results of the second round of voting in the municipal districts have shown that out of 500 municipal districts, a total of 2,000 city councilors have been elected, half of whom are candidates from moderate or right-wing parties, while the Communist Party received only 13% of the votes. The French People's Rally has achieved considerable success. As the leader of the alliance, I hereby announce to the whole country that the reconstruction of the country requires the immediate dissolution of the parliament.

### Soviet Proposal to Condemn "War Mongers" Certain to Be Rejected; Australian-Canadian-French Jointly Propose Amendment

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Lake Success News: Today, in order to ease the deadlock, the Polish representative suddenly proposed an amendment to the "War Mongers" case, arguing that the General Assembly should condemn war mongers, but not list those in the United States, Greece, and Turkey who are suspected of inciting war.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 27th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to formally vote on the Soviet Union's proposal to punish war mongers today, which is the Soviet Union's main proposal at this General Assembly session.

### The Italian Political Situation Gradually Becomes Clear; An Anti-Communist Bloc Forms a Strong Front

[Reuters, Rome, 26th] The actual establishment of the Cominform in Belgrade has clarified the position of the Italian Communist Party and strengthened the anti-communist views of the Italian people. The dividing line between pro-communist and anti-communist parties has become increasingly clear. The Italian Communist Party can now express that "whoever is not with me is against me." The right-wing Socialist Party led by Saragat and the Italian Republican Party, although they had previously voted with the Communist Party against the post-war government, have now been listed as anti-communist. Italy has only one religion, Catholicism, but the number of political parties is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. In the 1946 Constituent Assembly elections, as many as 36 parties participated in the elections, but to date, many have died young or been absorbed by other parties. Political figures predict that the announcement of the establishment of the Cominform will promote the elimination of small parties and the formation of a strong anti-communist bloc.

### European Recovery Program Needs $20 Billion; US Government Hopes It Will Not Be Cut; Says "International Charity" Is Unlikely to Last

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] It is learned that after President Truman convenes the special session of Congress on November 17, the government believes that the main problems can be summarized into three points: The Marshall Plan will cost the United States $20 billion between 1948 and 1950, and the government believes that this amount cannot be reduced. Another simple "international charity" will have very little and unsustainable results.

Those who implement this plan must have a broad mind to plan where to purchase reconstruction materials, from wheat to steel, and how to distribute them. If Congress believes that US loans must be used to buy American goods, there will be a big dispute. Otherwise, Europe should be strengthened to resist what Truman calls "collective pressure" and to strengthen US national defense.

[Reuters, London, 26th] A Moscow Radio commentator said: The implementation of the Marshall Plan will place countries with coal and metals under the direct monopoly of German economic power. The Soviet Union will use all its strength to prevent the Marshall Plan from being implemented.

### Security Council Discusses Indonesian Issue; Indian Representative Again Accuses the Netherlands; The Three-Nation Committee Arrives in Batavia

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Lake Success News: Indian Representative Pillai today strongly urged the Security Council to take active action to resolve the Indonesian-Dutch dispute and accused the Dutch government of disregarding the Security Council's ceasefire order. Pillai said: If the ceasefire order cannot be effectively implemented, it cannot be denied that it is a sign of the Security Council's weakness and incompetence. He and the Soviet Union adopted the same position, advocating that Indonesian and Dutch troops simultaneously withdraw to their original positions at the time the ceasefire order was announced.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 27th] The United Nations Tripartite Conciliation Committee, composed of US Representative Graham, Czech Representative Kiran, and Australian Representative Gilbert, arrived here from Australia on the afternoon of the 27th. Dutch Governor Van Mook and Republic Deputy Prime Minister Gani immediately came forward to welcome them.

### Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Indonesia Was Actually Incited by the Japanese

Report Provided by Our Military Observation Group

[Associated Press, Singapore, 27th] According to the report submitted to the Nanjing government by the Chinese military observation group of the six-nation consular investigation team on the Indonesian ceasefire, thousands of overseas Chinese were brutally killed by Indonesian radical elements during the Indonesian war, and there are currently more than 30,000 overseas Chinese refugees displaced, with about 500 people unaccounted for. Property losses are incalculable. Although the Indonesian government has repeatedly stated that it will fully protect them, it has not been effective. Half of the anti-Chinese sentiment in Indonesia is due to Japanese instigation and half is due to Dutch tactics.

We will not shy away from possible obstacles and difficulties and will remain here." In a general review of Germany and related issues, Clay stated: "Next year will be a year of decisions, and the next six months are extremely important. If we can help with the recovery of Europe, the situation will definitely ease by June or July next year." Clay hopes that the London conference on November 25th will be able to reach concrete decisions regarding the German issue; he forcefully stated: "The time when we could solve this problem has passed." He frankly declared: "What we are doing is merely maintaining the status quo. Any aid to Europe is an investment in the survival of the American way of life.

### Searching and Sealing are Not Fundamental Policies to Suppress Prices; Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Municipal Government to Protect Legitimate Business Operations and Exercise Prudent Inspections to Stabilize All Industries

[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, regarding the quantity of newspapers stored by the paper industry, which is only 30% of the pre-war level and does not constitute hoarding, petitions the Municipal Government to handle the matter fairly and protect legitimate business operations. The petition states: "In recent years, whenever prices fluctuate, various parties always believe that the reason for this is that there are hoarded goods not being sold. The authorities, under the pressure of public opinion, invariably resort to searching and sealing as the only countermeasure to suppress prices. In reality, rising prices have various political and economic causes, and their composition is complex and difficult to handle. However, searching for hoarding can be accomplished with a single official document and a dozen police officers. Once the matter is announced, it can slightly appease the demands of public opinion. Therefore, without investigating the truth or the definition of hoarding, any business with a slightly larger scale and more inventory is always the first to be hit. The Chamber believes that all businesses, whether wholesale or retail, except for vendors who sell and replenish their goods daily, must purchase a batch of goods and sell them in installments. As for the quantity of goods purchased and stored, it varies depending on the amount of capital and the volume of sales. There is no fixed quantity, and the law does not specify any. In recent years, domestic and foreign transportation has not been as convenient as it was before the war, and batches of goods ordered cannot arrive on schedule. Imported goods also have different quotas, and there are gradual reductions. Therefore, leaving some leeway to avoid shortages and panic when the supply is running low is actually beneficial and harmless from the perspective of people's livelihood. The financial strength of merchants after the war is far weaker than it was before the war. Considering the inventory in their hands, on the whole, it must be far less than it was before the war. However, although there was a lot of inventory before the war, it did not violate any prohibitions. Now, people are easily blamed. Is it really that the laws are different now than they were in the past? It is nothing more than that the relationship between prices makes it easy to become the target of public criticism.

The Chamber believes that this relationship is not limited to the paper industry. It is natural that businesses must have inventory. If businesses are ordered to sell all their goods immediately after purchasing them, regardless of the quantity, it would only allow those with financial strength to buy everything up, without helping to stabilize the livelihoods of the common people. The Chamber believes that at this time of economic hardship, if we want to seek relief, we must identify the source of the illness, just like a doctor treating a patient. If the diagnosis is not accurate and medicines are administered indiscriminately, the harm will precede the benefit. Searching and sealing are definitely not the fundamental policy to suppress prices. Moreover, considering that the current inventory of newspapers in the industry is only 30% of the pre-war level, in all fairness, it cannot be said that they are hoarding. Otherwise, if this precedent is set, all industries must not have any overnight inventory to be considered legitimate business operations. Then, where will the sold-out goods be replenished? This is a very obvious matter. The Municipal Government's understanding of the difficulties of businesses must be appreciated. Therefore, this special petition is submitted, hoping that the Municipal Government will review it, handle it fairly, and quickly order the police station to unseal the inventory, return the account books, protect legitimate business operations, and implement inspections cautiously so that all industries can be stabilized and the market will not be disturbed. Would that not be the fortune of that industry alone?"

According to Chen's confession, a part of the paper belongs to Li Kunquan, the manager of the Jiukang Paper Company in this city, and most of it is stored by Li Kunlin, the manager of the Dakang Paper Company.

### Cotton Textile Workers' Ten Demands; Capitalists Agree in Principle

(This newspaper news) The industrial workers of the cotton textile industry in this city submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting the capitalists to improve ten welfare facilities: Payment of wages for power outage days.

According to the capitalists, except for the first and fourth items, which are more difficult to resolve, the rest can be agreed upon in principle, but further detailed study is required on a technical level. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a discussion meeting between labor and capital on the 30th of this month to discuss the implementation details of each welfare measure.

### There is No Difference in the Use of Radio Frequencies; Yu Bingjian's Statement

Yu Bingjian, representing the Telecommunications Bureau, issued a statement yesterday regarding the joint appeal by eight privately-owned radio stations in this city, including Huozhong Bi, to the City Council for the fair use of frequencies. The statement elaborated on the frequency allocation process for radio stations in this city, stating that as of the present time, a total of 21 radio stations have been approved, with two stations sharing one frequency. According to the regulations issued by the Ministry, there are a total of twelve frequencies. Except for the eleven frequencies that should be issued to the 21 approved radio stations, there is only one frequency of 1000 K.C. that remains unused. Among the 21 approved stations, the Xin Yun, Wen Xie, and Da Mei stations were approved only in August and September of this year. Therefore, the Xin Yun station, which was the 19th station to be approved, was given 880KC and broadcasts every other day, sharing it with the Wen Xie station, which was the 20th station to be approved. The Da Mei station, which was the 21st station to be approved, was given 760K.C. and also broadcasts every other day. It is only that the Wen Xie station declared to the bureau that it needed to delay its broadcast for a few days due to equipment arrangement, so the industry mistakenly believed that Da Mei and Xin Yun had been approved to use a single frequency exclusively. In fact, these two stations should still broadcast every other day, just like the other eighteen radio stations, with two stations sharing one frequency, with no difference.

### Zhu Boquan Makes Seven Points in Response to Retrial

### Major Corruption Case Involving Ribbed Steel; Cha Liang Suspected of Being Arrested and Sent to the District Procuratorate, Released on Bail

(This newspaper news) Cha Liangchou, the team leader of the Pinghan Railway Shanghai Office, Luoming section, who was suspected of being involved in a major corruption case involving more than one billion yuan of ribbed steel in the Pinghan Railway Shanghai Office, was arrested by the police departments of the two railway bureaus. He was transferred to the District Procuratorate the day before yesterday. Because it was a Sunday, the duty prosecutor briefly questioned him and temporarily remanded him in custody. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Lu Zhennan questioned Cha and informed him that he was released on bail pending further investigation of the evidence of Cha's corruption. It is reported that Cha is accused of taking advantage of his position this spring to exchange more than 7,000 jin of ribbed steel bars, worth more than one billion yuan, used to repair the Pinghan Railway for four motors with a merchant, with a value of over one hundred million yuan. The matter was detected by the 7th Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Command, which conducted a secret investigation and reported the situation to its superiors.

### Chen Boquan Issues Statement on Railway Bureau's Rice Purchase Incident

(This newspaper news) The rice purchase incident by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration in Nanjing at the time attracted considerable attention from all walks of life in Shanghai and Nanjing. After Director Chen Boquan of the bureau reported the detailed process to the Ministry of Transportation, the matter was put to rest. However, recently, there have been many criticisms of the case from the outside world. Chen issued a special statement yesterday, stating: "On the 16th of this month, I accompanied Deputy Director Hou or Hua to Nanjing to inspect the construction of the new Xiaguan Railway Station. When planning the third-class passenger waiting room, Guo Shaohou, the chairman of the Nanjing Transportation Industry Association, and Director Ren Bendao and two others came to strongly urge me to inspect Meitan Port. We originally wanted to go, so we told them to go ahead. When we arrived at Meitan Port, we saw that the grain was piled up on the riverbank, outside the cargo space, with more than 6,000 tons. Originally, cars could only be dispatched after the goods arrived at the cargo space, but I felt that these were the blood and sweat of the farmers, the wealth of the country, and could not be left to be exposed to the wind and rain, so I ordered the transportation department to dispatch cars immediately to transport them out in response to Director Guo's request. But at the same time, I also asked Director Guo to agree to two things: Although it is currently the autumn harvest season and grain is congested, before I have transported the grain on the shore, please do not unload ships for the time being, otherwise the limited military skins cannot cope with the endless source. Our employees are very poor, please help, ask the grain merchants to buy some cheap grain for our employees to eat, and explain that Nanjing General Station Chief Zhang Wenhuan and five senior officials and supervisors of the Railway Bureau in Nanjing, including Lu Bureau and the supervisors in Nanjing, are responsible for the negotiation between the Railway Bureau and Guo. Director Guo was very generous and readily agreed. That night I returned to Shanghai. Two days later, Mayor Wu of Shanghai called and said that the price of grain in Shanghai was soaring, please help the municipal government to quickly transport the grain waiting for shipment on the riverbank to Shanghai. So, within five days, a total of 7,280 tons were transported to Shanghai. At the same time, I called Zhang Wenhuan, the General Station Chief in Nanjing, Fan Ti伤, the chief of the locomotive section, Zhang Jinshan, the director of the locomotive depot, Ye Zuo　, the chief of the engineering section, and Zhang Qifa, the general supervisor, to solicit the opinions of all the employees of the Nanjing station on how many shi of rice they needed, and showed everyone the samples of rice and agreed on the price. After consultation, it was decided to have 2,600 shi, in order to make the numbers uniform. Later, it was decided to be 3,000 shi. On the one hand, General Station Chief Zhang proceeded to purchase it, on the other hand, the internal accounting office was afraid that Mo Jie福 would consult with Auditor Deng because, according to auditing regulations, large-scale purchases must be done by bidding, but Auditor Guo knew that it was for the welfare of the employees, it could not be delayed, and it was purchased at a low price, so he immediately agreed to pay and handed the payment voucher to Zhang, Fan, and Ye for joint safekeeping so that they could pay as they purchased. General Station Chief Zhang agreed on the price of 460,000 yuan per dan and purchased 500 shi. The Nanjing Xinmin Evening News issued incorrect news, changing 500 shi to 500 tons, and pointing the facts of purchasing rice for the employees to hoarding, connecting several days There are several newspapers published　　news, actually intentional slander, stories of slander. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications　has long called to instruct us to continue to purchase rice for the welfare of the employees. In addition to following the instructions, we have also strictly investigated the manufacturers in preparation for pursuing the decision."

### Joint Power Plant Contract; Two Subcommittees of the Council to Discuss Jointly Today

(This newspaper news) The legal and regulatory subcommittees of the City Council are scheduled to hold a joint meeting this afternoon to discuss the United Electric Power Company contract. Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, told reporters yesterday: "The generator of the United Electric Power Company was originally intended to purchase the machines compensated by Japan to our government. Now, because the United States has suggested that the Japanese power equipment should be the final allocated compensation material, and whether the compensated machine is suitable is still a problem, the two 50,000 kilowatt generators of the United Company may be purchased from abroad." Director Zhao also said: "He is studying whether the arbitration of the contract has a sovereign issue. This issue is not simple, it may be a legal issue, a technical issue, or a valuation issue, so arbitration is necessary. The arbitrator must be impartial, so we have asked the president of the International Court of Justice to introduce a person to act as an arbitrator in a private capacity, which will not harm sovereignty. As for the contract, it is because there is a foreign loan relationship, so foreigners want to use the contract as a guarantee."

### Eighty-Year-Old Grandfather Cradles Infant, Frail Brother Dies from Illness Due to Drought, Father Served as Puppet Official and Property Confiscated, Knowledgeable Young Girl Mingles in Brothels, Luo Junbi Covers Her Face and Sobingly Narrates Her Tragic Life Experience

(Our report) On the evening of the 25th of this month, the Songshan Road Police Precinct arrested a private prostitute in the Great World. The next day, she was taken to the General Bureau's Moral Guidance Section. Because of her gentle demeanor, unlike a common prostitute, the section chief, Bao Tianyi, personally interrogated her. The woman initially refused to tell the truth, but after repeated gentle inquiries, the woman began to wail, revealing a tragic life experience, which was extremely sad.

The woman is a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, 23 years old, named Luo Junbi, and lives at No. 9 Yinxiang Road, Jiangwan. Her father served as the director of the Finance Bureau and the director of the Opium Prohibition Bureau in Wuhan during the fall of Chongqing. After the victory, he was sentenced to seven years for treason, and all of his property was confiscated. Luo also has an eighty-year-old grandfather and a frail brother named Luo Ming, who has contracted tertiary tuberculosis, and whose spouse died early, leaving behind a three-year-old child. After this drastic change, the lives of the four generations were completely dependent on others, so they wandered from place to place, came to Shanghai by roundabout routes, and tried every means to work as a telegraph operator at the Ministry of National Defense's radio station, using meager income to support the family. Unexpectedly, she was recently ordered to be transferred to . At that time, Luo's grandfather was bedridden, and it was difficult for the elderly, the weak, and the infant to follow her north. After thinking it over and over again, she resigned with great pain. Although she was in Shanghai, she still had many mouths to feed, so she jumped into the fire pit and secretly worked as a prostitute, hoping to support the whole family and pay for medical expenses with her body. Unexpectedly, fate was fickle, and she was arrested after only a month.

After Miss Luo was arrested, her brother, Luo Ming, forcibly supported his illness and wrote to the police局: "My sister was originally a knowledgeable woman. Why did she go astray? It was really forced by social circumstances. Since my sister was arrested," my grandfather was so worried that he could not get up and passed away. There was nothing to bury him.承普山莊施棺成禮, and I扶病得一家庭教席, I know that I cannot bear the troubles and I will not be able to support myself. I hope that the authorities will give me the last chance to repent and give me sympathy so that my family can be reunited."

After receiving this letter, the police Moral Guidance Section was deeply moved. Because Miss Luo was not comparable to ordinary prostitutes, it specially presented a request for leniency and release, and hoped that people from the community would provide sympathy and effective assistance so that this weak woman would not repeat her past actions.

### Five "Mihun" (Bewilderment), Four "Kill" (Extermination), Three "Reward" (Inducement): A Communist Cadre's Candid Confession

[Jinan, 22nd (Air Mail)] Recently, Yue Xiuwang, a Communist cadre who once served as the head of the Culture and Education Section of the Communist Bandit Shandong Provincial Government's Fenxi Administrative Office, because of a so-called "re-examination" recently held in the bandit area: "thoroughly investigate and purge cadres, eliminate cadres from landlord backgrounds, eliminate unstable elements, and rectify the Communist Party's ranks," as a result, not only was Yue Xiuwang's ancestral property in his hometown of Shouzhang Tongzhuang fought to the point of complete destitution, but his father was also suppressed, causing his entire family of more than ten people to fall into a state of being without clothing or food, begging for a living. Furthermore, Yue Xiuwang himself, who had "revolved for six years," was also deemed to have "wavering thoughts" and was about to be arrested and killed. Yue, in light of the Communist bandits' past repeated emphasis on "struggle being reasonable and legal, and family members must be taken care of," had already become a mere formality. Now, even the families of veteran revolutionary cadres are being struggled against. Rather than waiting to be arrested and killed, it would be better to "come to Jinan and surrender," "frankly confess personal sins, and await the punishment of national law," which would be more beneficial to the country and to oneself. When Yue Xiuwang surrendered to the Pacification District here, he "frankly" revealed everything about the internal facilities of the "Liberated Area." However, the reporter believes that the following is particularly worthy of attention and should be exposed: the "Mihuntang" (bewildering potion), also known as the "youth control technique," used by the Eighth Route Army on young people, is as follows:

Five "Mihun" (Bewilderment): Officiousness – "Joining the Eighth Route Army will lead to high office," to lure young people who covet fame and fortune. Greed – "Serving in the Eighth Route Army means money to spend." In the past, there was "virtual cloth," but today there are "Anti-Japanese currency" or "North Sea banknotes." Lust – "Serving in the Eighth Route Army means beautiful wives." The Eighth Route Army specially trains a large number of women to "use their bodies as a sacrifice for the revolution" to bewilder young people. Land – "The tillers own their land," "The poor turn over a new leaf," luring the poor into a trap. Books – Reprinting Marxist-Leninist books to contaminate pure young people.

Four "Kill" (Extermination): Landlord Kill – "Landlords are evil," kill without pardon. Those who sympathize with landlords are "unstable in their stance" and must also be killed. Corruption Kill – Communist cadres who are corrupt must be killed. Betrayal Kill – "Compromise means surrender," "Not revolutionary means enemy," "Wavering means betrayal," kill without pardon. Spy Kill – Right-leaning means "Nationalist spy," left-leaning means "Trotskyist," kill without pardon.

Three "Reward" (Inducement): Honorary Reward – Printed certificates of merit, divided into first-class heroes, second-class heroes, and third-class heroes, determined by cadres' meetings. Material Reward – Items such as towels, soap, toothbrushes, and books. Promotion – Based on performance, determine promotion qualifications. According to Mr. Yue, these five "Mihun," four "Kill," and three "Reward" are, in fact, nothing more than deception, intimidation, brutality, and bribery. Young people in the rear who do not understand the actual internal situation of the bandit area are lured by Marxist-Leninist books and, like martyrs in the Middle Ages, travel long distances and brave countless mountains and rivers to the "Liberated Area."

Conclusion: In their imagination, they initially believed that the "Liberated Area" was "heaven." Who knew that after being tricked into entering the "Liberated Area," they would be innocently sent to "heaven" under groundless charges such as "compromise," "not revolutionary," "wavering," or even "Nationalist spy" and "Trotskyist"? Who knew how many young people, and even cadres with a long history and merit in the Communist Party, would be tied to the cross and truly sent to "heaven" in this "re-examination"? Yue Xiuwang concluded his "frank confession" about the internal affairs of the "Liberated Area" by saying: "The path taken by the Chinese Communist Party is one of "communism," "common poverty," and "common death," truly leading to the destruction of the entire nation and state by death."

Now, the kind people in the countryside and the village chiefs are all in fear, fleeing in droves, and the situation is extremely dangerous.

### Shen Bao and Ten Major Hospitals Jointly Organize Free Tuberculosis X-Ray Examination Statistics Table: 16.3% of Those Suffering from Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis

The free tuberculosis X-ray lung fluoroscopy jointly organized by this newspaper and ten major hospitals was held in two phases this year, and ended at the end of June. The number of applicants exceeded 10,000, and quite a few people did not go for examination after specifying the date and hospital for various reasons. The actual number of people examined was 9,573. The Lung Disease Center Clinic was entrusted to analyze the statistics, and 16.3% of them had active pulmonary tuberculosis. The high percentage is truly unexpected. The reason is that a small number of applicants already knew that they had suspected tuberculosis and wanted to use the examination to determine it, so the percentage of tuberculosis increased. The analysis and statistics are recorded as follows:

(A) Degree of Tuberculosis

(B) Gender Classification (C) Age Classification

(D) Occupational Classification

Looking at the above statistics, the 20-30 year old stage is the most infected with tuberculosis, and the crisis is less after 40 years old. The examination results showed that 93 people suffered from heart disease and other diseases, accounting for 1%. 7,920 people had normal cardiopulmonary function, accounting for 82.7%.

### Contemplation

— F.M.P.

Excessive tension in emotional life is often harmful to body and mind. If we want to enjoy a real, deep, and peaceful perfect life, we must use an art of balancing emotions - contemplation.

Contemplation brings a pleasant and peaceful state of mind, just like a person who listens to beautiful music, views the pleasant sunset, or rests on the verdant high mountains, and encounters a state of mind unintentionally. It is an attitude of surprise without being hasty, consideration without being demanding. Nirvana, as the Buddhists call it, Ataraxia, as Epicurus called it, "No worries" (Apathesia), as the Stoics called it, and Sitting in Oblivion, as Zhuangzi called it, are originally realms in life that can be hoped for but not reached. But in contemplation, we can vaguely approach them. "Wandering in the realm of emptiness and stillness, standing alone beyond all things," is not this a portrayal of contemplation? The disappearance of all thoughts, the extinction of self-view, is not this the deep interest of contemplation? Spinoza once said: "When the mind knows things in an eternal state, it also participates in eternity"! The feeling of eternity is the supreme experience of the soul. Zhuangzi's so-called "Heaven and earth and I were born together, and all things and I are one"; Sun Chuo's line in his "Ode to Tiantai Mountain," "Mixing all phenomena for a dark view, being unified with nature," is just the wonderful use of contemplation, allowing the soul to float and sink in the eternal and vast space.

Treating contemplation as an art of life can not only give us rest, but also give us new life. Focused and in-depth contemplation is the arming of the soul, preparing for future work, nourishing energy, and making mental strength strong and vitality overflowing. For all things, in the chemical liquid of contemplation, we can breed new values and sharp perspectives. Confused memories are cleansed, and rough ideas are polished. The inner intellect can also thrive and grow in the fertile soil of contemplation!

However, contemplation does not mean isolating oneself from others, detaching oneself from the world, breaking away from cruel reality, and parting ways with genuine experience. On the contrary, it is a further deepening of reality, a further grasping of experience - seeing through the appearance of things to their essence, and seeing their organic connections in the chaotic status quo. It allows us to pan out the golden grains of truth in the mud and sand of ordinary life; to pick the honey juice of interest in the diverse wonders of life; and to hold steady the rudder of action in the turbulent waves of the human sea. The pragmatist philosopher William James once said: "Going to a quiet place often can induce insightful thinking and always maintain the correct point of view. A period of contemplation is like a person who is squeezed in the human sea and cannot find a way out, climbing to the South Gate to overlook the trend of the entire crowd, and then coming down to walk in the correct direction." This is the practical value of contemplation in life.

Literature, art, science, and philosophy are all created from contemplation and completed in contemplation. Liu Xie's "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" has the saying: "The mind of writing, its spirit is lost. Therefore, in silent contemplation, the mind connects to thousands of years, quietly moved, the sight penetrates thousands of miles? Between chanting, the sound of pearls and jade is uttered; before the ..., the color of wind and clouds is unfolded. Is its thinking profound? Therefore, thinking is wonderful, traveling with things." The little bird of imagination, spreading its wings, in the clear sky of contemplation, takes such a transcendent, colorful journey. And ultimately expressed as a brilliant work of art. Whether it is a novel or a poem, it must be cultivated through contemplation before it can bloom into a brilliant flower of art! The great Soviet novelist M. Sholokhov (author of "And Quiet Flows the Don") loved contemplation the most. Once he went fishing, and after casting his hook, he suddenly stared at the surface of the water, as still as a wooden chicken. He was so immersed in thought that he did not move for more than an hour, and then he hurried home and wrote all night long. This shows the need for novelists to think deeply. Poetry, some people may think, is about enthusiasm and does not value deep thought. But the great English poet Wordsworth once defined poetry as "emotion recollected in tranquility." Milton, the author of the magnificent poem "Paradise Lost," also completed his poem in contemplation. After graduating from Cambridge University, he lived in his father's manor for five years. His first few famous poems were the crystallization of his wandering in the fields, wandering his eyes and mind, letting his imagination fly, and letting his thoughts dance wildly. One of them, a poem titled Contemplation (Il Perserso), expresses the wonderful interest of contemplation and deeply understands its essence. Later, he became blind, and his great poems were all filtered through his mind's contemplation and dictated to his daughter for recording.

Nietzsche, in "The Birth of Tragedy," said that the artistic realm is composed of two spirits: one is dream (symbolized by the sun god Apollo), and the other is intoxication (symbolized by the wine god Dionysus). The former is an endless image, and all plastic arts and sculpture belong to it; the latter is incomparable heroism, and all dynamic and rigid arts belong to it, such as dancing and music. Nietzsche believed that these two spirits were combined in one furnace - the deep inner pain and the vivid image - and thus produced Greek tragedy. What Nietzsche called the art of dream is precisely the art of contemplation. In the vast dreamland, the mind displays a colorful, clear, magnificent image, which constitutes a profound and broad art; it displays a beautiful, elegant, gentle, and graceful image, which constitutes an art like a secluded forest, like pearls and jade. Deep thought is the best dreamland for expressing art and creating art. In fact, there is also a realm of contemplation in the art of intoxication. In music, such as Beethoven's Third and Fifth Symphonies, it is indeed like "lightning and thunder, hills and mountains shaking," making people "soul tremble and spirit move, startled and awake all night"; but his Sixth Symphony is "happy, thoughtful, sad, and sorrowful," extremely gentle and subtle, precisely a dreamlike realm of contemplation like "a day of brocade clouds, ten thousand stars rushing."

Great painters who create images cannot help but indulge in contemplation. In contemplation, they can fully observe, fully perceive, and fully imagine. Su Dongpo said that when painting bamboo, one should have bamboo in one's chest. That is to say, one must have an image in one's contemplation that is "full of vitality, smooth blood, itching and breathing, and responsive to touch," and then pick up a brush and paper and complete it in one stroke. Huang Zijiu, a great painter of the Yuan Dynasty, spent all day sitting in desolate mountains and rocks, in deep forests, with a trance-like expression, and people could not guess what he was writing. He also often went to the sea where the tides flowed through, where the rapids roared and surged; even if the wind and rain were sudden, the water monsters would not care. He embodied and chanted nature in contemplation, and integrated images, so his paintings were deep and changed, creating the same magic as nature. Zong Bing of the Six Dynasties said in his "Preface to Painting": "All interests are integrated into the divine thought." The divine thought that is uniquely connected to the ingenious mind is like a wonderful melting furnace, which tempers and changes the myriad phenomena of the universe, and transforms them into the wonderful scenery of a goddess scattering flowers. Similarly, in the West, contemplation is also the key to art. Michelangelo once said: "The painter does not use his hands but his brain." Leonardo da Vinci also wrote: "The mind of genius is most likely to create when it is least doing external work"! Therefore, when he created his masterpiece "The Last Supper," he sat in front of the blank canvas, dazed and motionless for several days. This greatly annoyed the abbot of the temple who ordered him to paint, and he asked endlessly: "When are you going to work"? In order to retaliate against this incessant annoyance, he unconsciously modeled Judas's image after this nobleman. The essence of beautiful activity lies in the artist's conceiving a complete image in such quiet consideration that can express the main purpose in his heart.

The need for science and philosophy to contemplate is self-evident. Newton's discovery of the law of universal gravitation was caused by seeing an apple fall, which led to contemplation; Watt's invention of the steam engine was caused by seeing steam boiling in a pot, which led to conception; Freud's theory of the subconscious was also the harvest of watching algae and contemplating in the heart; the great modern scientist Einstein was also constantly contemplating and thinking silently. Before he became famous, he worked as a patent examiner in the Swiss Federal Patent Office. Although he was not allowed to do private work during office hours, he often fell into extreme deep thought! Edison - this unprecedented great inventor - was also often contemplating! Once, he was in line to receive something, because he was contemplating a problem. When it was his turn and he was asked his name, he was stunned and did not know what to say! It can be imagined how deep his contemplation was that he even forgot his own name. Kant, the great philosopher who carried on the past and opened up the future, never left his birthplace of Königsberg in his life. He devoted himself to contemplation in a life of regularity for fifteen years before completing his masterpiece "Critique of Pure Reason"... There are too many examples of scientists and philosophers contemplating, and we need not give many more. In fact, without contemplation, science and philosophy can never have discovery and invention. The migration of the universe's phenomena, the unpredictable changes of life, the complexity and randomness of society - without returning to the source, without detailed and comprehensive thinking, how can we analyze them, peek into their secrets, and see their depth and breadth? And then condense them into solutions, develop them into theories, and respond to all things without error?

Contemplation is an art that is different from daydreaming. Contemplation is the pursuit of objective truth, goodness, and beauty while temporarily forgetting the clinging little self. It has a bright light and no entangled emotions. It is "all things are quietly observed and are naturally obtained," and it has the aura of Cheng Zi's so-called "Phoenix flying in the sky," with the atmosphere of "the moon is in the center of the sky, the wind comes to the surface of the water," and "pearls nourish themselves, and jade conceives cicadas in the mountains." At the same time, the summary of experience also flashes a light that illuminates action - as Leigh Hunt said: "The world is a comedy to those who think, a tragedy to those who feel." Let us recognize this comedic world in contemplation!

### Sinclair Continues to Write His Great Work

— Zhao Jingshen

Sinclair is already sixty-eight years old this year. He said, "I have been trying to change the world." The first goal was the alcohol business his father was running when he was studying at a school in New York. At the age of fourteen, he entered the City College of New York and made a living by writing. At the age of twenty-one, he married and was very poor. From 1901 to 1906, he wrote five novels. "Love's Pilgrimage" is a fable he wrote, which has his own views on gender issues. He is famous for his masterpiece "The Jungle." He has published more than sixty books, and now he has published eight adventure stories of Lanny Budd. The third book, "Dragon's Teeth," won the Pulitzer Prize in 1943. His most recent eighth book is called "Presidential Mission." He types in the rose garden of Monrovia in the morning, typing one thousand to fifteen hundred words in three hours. In the afternoon, he revises the manuscript. In the evening, when he takes a walk, he thinks about the later chapters. He said, "Now I am thinking about the material for the ninth book." He is finishing a book called "A Giant's Strength," which is a drama about the future of the atomic bomb. He said, "I believe that socialized industry developing along the TVA line is completely in line with free and democratic organizations. Along this line, I hope to see social problems solved." His body is neither tall nor short, meeting the average height. His eyes are gray-blue, and his hair is gray. His voice is very gentle. Charlie Chaplin likes to imitate him because he "always smiles when he speaks."

Sinclair is a genius. If he weren't a genius, people wouldn't pay attention to him. One of him can be worth ten ordinary writers. His Lanny Budd series of novels naturally have his readers, and selling 100,000 copies is the minimum. This latest one has sold 750,000 copies. The protagonist, Lanning Prescoff Budd, is the heir to a large industry, and he does a lot of business, with marketing offices in Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin. He becomes friends with Roosevelt. The president wants someone to do a particularly dangerous job, and he finds Lanny. Lanny goes to the Nazis, gets many military secrets, and also makes a good deal. Characters in the book also include Churchill, Hess, Eisenhower, etc. The scenes change very quickly, from Hyde Park to Downing Street.

The author's writing of both fictional characters and real historical figures in the novel can be said to be a bold attempt.

But the "Lanny Budd Novels" also have their failures. The author does not have the mysterious power to make his novels believable. This may be due to Sinclair's lack of creativity, or it may be because he writes too quickly. Sinclair is a genius, but unfortunately, he does not have the time to properly train his talents. He wants to write a book every year, so he often seems not profound. This is the difference between Dumas and Stendhal. Fortunately, Sinclair does not focus on art, and he pays more attention to content than to form.

### Conditions for Writing Poetry

— Dongfang Mengwu

The Soviet writer Mayakovsky, in his article "How I Write," talked about the four necessary conditions for us to write poetry, which can indeed be used as a reference for general poets, so I have copied them as follows:

The existence of a social task that can only be achieved by poetry. Therefore, poetry must have a social "mission." Here is an interesting thing that is often overlooked and worth studying: that is, there is not much connection between the social mission that the poet undertakes and the mission that is actually given.

For the society you represent, you must have correct knowledge, or at least a passionate feeling; in other words, you must have a firm attitude and a clear goal.

You must have materials, a vocabulary storage room. The storage room in your heart should store the words you need - all kinds of clear, rare, fresh, concise, and original words.

Poets must develop the habit of polishing words and sentences. This habit is entirely personal and can only be developed through years of continuous work. It includes prose, rhythm, rhyme, imagery, arrangement, style, plot, poetry tail, title, layout, etc.

### One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Isn't that right! Such a young age, overnight..."

"What?... Young age"? When Baisaifu heard me interject and ask, a sinister smile appeared on his face, but the smile disappeared immediately, as if he didn't want me to see it. He continued:

"I just heard people say it. I heard that this murderous 'fairy' is very young, so young that people dare not believe it, only fifteen or sixteen years old; do you think it's possible? What I mean is that such a young child, only fifteen or sixteen years old, has an incredible special ability to kill people with his bare hands. I heard that everyone he killed had the same wound, this action seems to be leaving a secret message for his accomplices - that is to say, the 'identity' of the wound is a code, and when it is published in the newspaper, everyone will spread the message, and his accomplices - two partners - will be able to understand that it is his work, and they can track down his location." - Baisaifu analyzed it this way.

"This is really a bit mysterious and incredible"! I always maintained a consistent attitude - pretending to be stunned: "Has anyone really seen clearly that he is just a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child"? I'm only twelve or thirteen years old, I'm afraid he's also changed, so I asked this question to find out clearly.

"It's hard to say, but some Japanese do admit that the 'fairy' they saw was of an 'uncertain' age; that means that he seems young, but also seems very old". Baisaifu also seemed a bit恍惚

Using two different tones, she and Baisaifu said this dialogue with expressions, and just asked Little Tiger: "Tiger, did you really kill seven or eight of them?" Before this sentence was finished, a series of footsteps came from outside the door. We all knew it was Wu Dingyuan coming back, so we unconsciously cut off what we were going to say.

Because Dingyuan had not recovered his health, he walked as if his legs were tied with lead bars, dragging one step after another. But as soon as he entered the door, we all noticed the very nervous look on his face.

"The news is not good!" Dingyuan took off the incongruous monk's robe and pulled off some trivial and mysterious ornaments on his head, and told us in a very nervous tone.

Before Dingyuan's gold store was robbed, he had always maintained a British gentleman's attitude; his actions were regular, and his words were measured; although he was not very energetic, he was not very decadent either. But if you compare his appearance at that time with his current appearance, they are simply two different people. Now Dingyuan is not only decadent, but simply can be said to be very颓废.

### The Reenactment of History

Former British Prime Minister McDonald had a famous saying: "If you want to establish a political system, you should use the past of your own country as a measure." The so-called past of your own country refers to history. Counselor Xun said that politics is the transformation of history, and that to do politics, one must understand the traces of governance, chaos, prosperity, and decline from history, and know the present from the past.

China has been established for 5,000 years. The clan, culture, and customs have their own traditions, so although history does not repeat itself, there are many similar and inherited places. Among the countless examples, I will give the most recent example.

In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Japan announced its surrender. Our government issued an order appointing Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and others as commanders. For a time, public opinion was surprised and suspicious. At that time, I believed that the government officials had read the history of the Song Dynasty and imitated the story of Zhang Bangchang being crowned king. According to the Song Gaozong's enthronement in Tokyo, Zhang Bangjing led the government. Gaozong initially did not blame him and made him the King of Tongan County. Five days later, he went to the Dudu Hall. Then Li Gang presented a memorial with ten accusations, the first of which was accusing traitors. Zhang Bangchang finally surrendered to the law. All those who had rebelled confessed their crimes one after another. In order to prevent the puppet organization from splitting and rebelling, the government wanted to take and give it, which was definitely a virtuous measure. Although Zhang Bangchang was accepted by the Jin Dynasty, he still did not abolish the title of the Song Dynasty and called himself the "provisional government." Wang Zhaoming imitated his predecessors and boldly called himself the "Acting Chairman of the National Government."

It's better not to mention the history of the Song Dynasty. Mentioning the history of the Song Dynasty is really shocking. The disaster of the Song Dynasty originated in the Northeast. In the first phase, the Liao people invaded. In the second phase, the Jin people overwhelmed the Liao people, and the Song Dynasty lost half of its territory. In the third phase, the Yuan people rose in the north of the desert, and the great mountains and rivers fell for nearly a hundred years. I advise my compatriots to read history and raise their vigilance! Lu Shi

### On Crabs (A Paper Discussion)

— Sun Yuehan

Su Dongpo's poem: "It's a vain bother holding the new crab in my left hand, idly smelling the fallen blossoms." Wang Anshi's poem: "Overseas pearls often enter the market, human fish and crabs are not worth money." Tang Yin's poem: "The earth stove overflows with pine flower wine, just returning from picking crabs by the stream." A year passes easily, and again it's almost the Double Ninth Festival, chrysanthemums bloom with yellow brilliance, the atmosphere becomes desolate. In this clear and bright autumn weather, climbing high and looking far, drinking heartily with dogwood, holding wine and crabs, composing poetry and appreciating the scenery, is truly a pleasure of three lifetimes. At present, dark green large crabs are already crowding the market, but their high prices, often costing a fortune, make people astonished. A group of friends who rely on fixed salaries to maintain their families can only sigh with longing for crabs, lamenting their misfortune. I remember Fan Shi-hu, after returning to his old age in the countryside, had a poem: "Unable to afford fields, I just plant water." Befriending people in the marketplace often leads to such extreme boredom. Seeing new crabs scuttling about, how can one not drool? Since "buying crabs" is said to be "without money," why not discuss them on paper? Dreaming of plums and drawing cakes is better than nothing, so today I will write about the lore of crabs.

According to those skilled at eating crabs: those who know how to eat them, before eating, it is a complete crab, and after eating the crab meat, they can still assemble it into a complete crab shape without difficulty. This skill requires decades of crab-eating experience and training. Ordinary people who eat crabs often chew the crab shell and meat into a mess.

Crabs can be said to be a type of pest, and the situation is even worse at certain times. The Pingjiang Chronicle states: "In the Dingwei year of the Dade era, crabs in Wu were as dangerous as locusts. The fields were full, and they were all killed and swept away." These types of crabs are also called field crabs, and are very harmful to crops.

Regarding books describing crabs, Song Dynasty Chuan Gong once wrote "Crab Spectrum." Gao Si-sun compiled "Crab Treatise," describing the appearance of crabs in great detail.

Generally, people eat crabs in various ways: boiled crabs, marinated crabs, stewed crabs, fried crabs, steamed crabs, honey crabs, etc. Some more special methods include: people in Luoyang like to eat stir-fried crabs, people in Anhui like to eat vinegar crabs, people in Jiangxi like to eat pickled crabs, and previously Lu Zhu-gao loved to eat wine-drenched crabs, and Emperor Tang Minghuang liked to eat seasoned crabs.

Xunzi said: "Crabs have six knees and two claws," which is actually a mistake. We have never seen crabs with eight legs. Only during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the kingdom of Shanyuan presented a crab that was nine feet long and had a hundred legs and four pincers. It was named the hundred-legged crab (see "Dongming Ji"), but this was an exception and special case. Ordinary crabs have eight knees and two claws.

The smallest crab is called "peng," and is the size of a coin (see "Guang Zhi"). Also, "bright Yue Stream hidden stone caves, also produce small crabs. Their color is red and hard, and are commonly called stone crabs." Su Shi's poem: "Stone crabs by the stream are as small as coins, glad to see the round, red jade plate," refers to this.

Crab meat is indeed fresh, and crab roe is particularly fatty and delicious. According to crab physiology, male crabs contain crab fat, equivalent to mammalian essence, and female crabs contain crab roe, equivalent to mammalian ovaries.

Crabs are most afraid of swimming weakly. "Wulei Xianggan Zhi" says: "Dead crabs fear fog," and "Shuo Yuan" also says: "Today, many crabs are covered in fog."

The wooden crab is also called the tree crab (see "Ben Cao"). In fact, there is no true wooden crab.

Crabs can also fly. The Yue Chronicle says: "Flying crabs are as small as coins, and larger ones are twice the size. They fly across the sea surface several feet, using their claws as wings."

The proverb says: "Shrimp arch, crab crawl." Although this is a prediction, the arched back of a shrimp symbolizes neglect of work, and the crab's sideways movement symbolizes war and chaos, which is not without reason.

### Three Female Generals of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

— Xiang Ruo

"Female soldiers" are not a recent phenomenon in China, but the term "female soldiers" was indeed coined during the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic by Xie Bingying, the author of "Diary of a Soldier." Here, I will introduce three female generals of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to the female soldiers in the military camp:

Hong Xuanjiao: "During the Jintian Uprising, all those who believed in the God Worshipping Society followed with their families. The women in the army were managed by Hong Xuanjiao, organized into armies, and she called herself a marshal. Whenever the aristocratic leaders faced battle, Hong Xuanjiao rode on horseback, leading the large-footed women, wearing five-colored clothes to form a protective screen, and she was skilled in using firearms. During the battle of Changsha, the aristocratic leaders were killed in battle, and Hong Xuanjiao took command of their troops, preventing them from collapsing" (See "Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," Volume 18).

Xiao Sanniang: "Among the Taiping army was Xiao Sanniang, known as the female marshal, or perhaps the sister of Chao Gui. She was over twenty years old, tall and with long arms, able to command her troops on horseback, and capable of shooting with both hands. When the Taiping army conquered Zhenjiang in the second year, she led hundreds of female soldiers to climb the city walls, more brave than the male soldiers, and none could withstand them" (Ibid., Volume 20).

Yang Ergu: "Yang Ergu was the sister of Prince Yang Fuqing, brave and decisive, surpassing men. ... Whenever encountering battles, Ergu would tie a yellow scarf around her head, wear a bright red battle skirt, and go out with her husband, charging into battle, and no one could match her. She could also throw knives to stab people on horseback, with perfect accuracy. Those hit would fall instantly. ... She called herself the 'Flying Knife Divine Hand'" (Ibid., page 39).

Moreover, from the Heavenly King's edict (see "Edict of the Mandate of Heaven") on the 30th day of the second month (during the time in Yong'an): "Male generals and female generals all hold knives, only changing clothes when appearing. Together with one heart, boldly kill the demons, and the gold and treasure are secondary. ... Men wear dragon robes and women wear flowers, all are loyal ministers and meritorious servants." It can be seen that these female generals and men stood equally in battle merit and status.

### Yin Wengong

— Ji Ming

One of the Biographies of Qing People

In Yuan Zicai's poetry and prose collection, he often mentions Minister Yin, namely Wengong. Zicai loved to criticize people throughout his life, but he had no harsh words for Wengong, partly because he valued the relationship between teacher and student, and partly because Yin Gong's morals were impeccable. Now, I will excerpt from the official history to convey his important virtues:

Gong's name was Zhishan, with the courtesy name Yuanzhang, originally from the Zhangjia clan, a Manchu of the Bordered Yellow Banner. His father, Yin Tai, asked Emperor Shizong, "Will my son serve in office?" He replied, "My fifth son, Yin Zhishan, passed the Shuntian provincial examination." The Emperor said, "He should be made to see me." Later, Gong became a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) and was presented to the Emperor, who was pleased and said, "Are you Yin Tai's son? Truly a great talent!" From then on, he was known to Emperor Shizong (Yongzheng) and Emperor Gaozong (Qianlong). He served as governor-general of Yun-Gui once, Sichuan-Shaanxi three times, and Liangjiang four times, holding high office for over thirty years. In his later years, he was summoned into the cabinet, concurrently managing the affairs of the Ministry of War and serving as the chief instructor of the Imperial Study. He died in the thirty-sixth year of Qianlong's reign.

Gong had a fair complexion, was introverted in his youth, had a large mouth, a clear and loud voice, and his entire body was covered with red spots, as bright as cinnabar. At the age of thirty, after five years in mourning garb, he was appointed governor-general. Once, in a single month, he concurrently held nine seals, including the general, lieutenant general, governor, river transport, surveillance commissioner, and academic director of the upper and lower Liangjiang provinces. Yet Gong's judgments were swiftly made without backlog. During his spare time, he would discuss essays and poems with the students, which astonished and impressed those who heard it.

Gong had a generous and magnanimous demeanor, and was eager to promote young talents. At that time, Yuan Zicai was living in Suiyuan, which happened to be within Gong's jurisdiction as governor-general of Liangjiang. Therefore, they exchanged poems and wines almost every day. Zicai's ability to enjoy the pleasures of mountain forests and gain widespread fame was largely due to Gong's promotion. In the Qing Dynasty, only a handful of Manchu officials were as distinguished in talent and literary ability as Gong.

### The Blessing of the Sun

— Qiyuan

In the spring of 1933, George Bernard Shaw visited Shanghai, just as the spring rain had stopped and the sun was peeking out from the black clouds. So someone, trying to please him, said:

"Mr. Shaw, you are truly blessed to be able to see the sun in Shanghai."

But without hesitation, he replied, "No, it is the sun's blessing to be able to see George Bernard Shaw in Shanghai."

### Old Age and Leisure

— Zhu Mei

In the past, Chinese family education promoted and encouraged pretending to be old. A child of only three or five years old had to pretend to be refined and courteous, sometimes solemn and dignified, even prematurely aged, otherwise they wouldn't appear to be well-educated children from scholarly families. When they got a little older, they took pride in doing nothing – being idle – and considered it shameful to work, because only those who could afford to be idle showed that their ancestors were virtuous. The tea houses in Beijing and Suzhou are typical examples of this. However, it must be said that being an official was an exception. People with high noses and green eyes have slightly different views on these situations. I remember when Anthony Eden was appointed Foreign Secretary, he was about forty-three years old, and reporters called him a young diplomat. In the eyes of us Chinese, a forty-three-year-old person is old enough, and many feel that they are in the twilight years of their life. If someone is still working at sixty, people will laugh at them for having bad luck in their old age, and they will feel like they have a hard life, because we Chinese should be idle. Although Americans manufacture 1937 models of cars in 1936, we are lucky, we can buy them if we have money, why bother using our brains, we always get the advantage. People with high noses and green eyes take pride in being busy with work and consider it shameful to be idle. They are really fools. In London or Paris, there are very few men strolling on the streets during work hours, and most of the people on the roads are women. Men are all working, unless they are unemployed or have a special reason to be on the streets. In our Chinese cities, you can always see men strolling on the streets at any time, or they are sleeping in bed, only getting up at noon. The better ones raise fish, grow flowers, or play mahjong, and their level of leisure is truly admirable. It seems that someone once said that if everyone in the world worked four hours a day in production, everyone would have enough food and clothing. This makes sense. Take Shanghai as an example, with nearly five million people. What percentage of these five million people are actually involved in production? It can be said that it is very limited. If these idle people were engaged in production, how much could they produce? Extrapolating this to the whole country, it would not be difficult to provide enough food and clothing for every Chinese person. To make people happy, everyone must love to work. Once people have work, they will not be idle. When people are not idle, they will feel young and useful.

### Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

Miss America's Education

Undoubtedly, American education is the most developed in the world, and American women's education is even more developed. During World War II, American education was dominated by women. In co-educational universities, it was hard to find male students. Men had all gone to war, so male students were very popular in universities. I lived in San Marcos, Texas, where there is a Texas State Teachers College with about 2,000 students, of which less than twenty were male. Therefore, these swarms of females all desired to obtain these twenty-odd men and were willing to do anything, causing quite a stir. This phenomenon is enough to reflect the development of women's education. American women have equal status with men in the family, so they also have equal opportunities for education. From elementary school to high school, tuition fees are paid by parents. Some women start working during their school years to earn pocket money, working as babysitters, typists, waitresses, theater ticket takers, receptionists, and magazine salespersons in their spare time. Once they enter university, most are working part-time while studying. They work as elementary school teachers or waitresses, while attending classes at the university. Their lives are quite diligent, and there are definitely none who can sit down and study full-time. Therefore, the economic responsibility of American women's parents is not unlimited. Some women even contribute part of their income to supplement the family. University students rarely ask their parents for money. The tuition fee for a state university for the entire period is only twenty-odd dollars. A modern woman who is unable to earn back even this twenty-odd dollar tuition fee is simply not fit to be an American. Many of my female classmates use summer vacations to work, which can maintain half a year to a year of living expenses. They do not expect economic help from their boyfriends. The economic limits of a boyfriend are, at most, treating them to dinner. Only with a special relationship can they give gifts of clothing. Therefore, American women do not easily ask their boyfriends to buy clothes unless they are engaged or cohabiting. American women regard education as a part of life and do not see it as a tool for making a living. Because there are many old ladies in their seventies and eighties in the university, they do not work outside and have no intention of further study to improve their livelihood skills, but they are keen to study. Their grades are not as good as those of young people. They don't value academic credits at all, nor are they intoxicated with degrees. Even if they get a doctorate at such an old age, they cannot bring it into the coffin. They take the school as a place to cultivate personality. They believe that education has the effect of prolonging life, and at the same time, they feel that as they get older, their knowledge inevitably becomes outdated. They listen to the high-level discussions of young professors and exchange opinions with the younger generation. Only in this way can they keep up with the progress of the times. Therefore, American old ladies know who the Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is, while Chinese old ladies don't know who Truman is. To develop Chinese women's education, we must also open the doors of schools. Many young Chinese women are excluded from schools because they lack the economic means, and old ladies in their seventies and eighties are even more unable to enter. If an old lady with a cane walked into any university classroom to study, I'm afraid she would be driven out of the school by the president, professors, and students, who would say, "At your age, shouldn't you be at home taking care of your grandchildren? Why come here to suffer?"
