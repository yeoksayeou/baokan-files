### The National Government's Proposal to Add a Vice Chairman Submitted for Discussion at Today's Plenary Session; Closing Declaration Largely Drafted

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 23rd] The Third Plenary Session, originally scheduled for seven days, is now set to hold its tenth general meeting in the morning and afternoon of the 24th, followed by a closing ceremony, as several important cases have not yet been fully discussed. At the ninth general meeting on the 23rd, a total of five important proposals were passed. Cases originally planned for discussion, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 4, were postponed to the tenth general meeting on the morning of the 24th due to time constraints. Among these, the more important one is the proposal submitted by the President to add a Vice Chairman to the National Government. It is reported that Chairman Chiang had previously requested the Central Standing Committee through the National Government's Civil Affairs Office to amend the National Government's organization, revising relevant articles. After being submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion, the decision was to "defer discussion." Today, the President resubmitted the proposal to the general meeting for discussion and will personally attend to explain. In addition, the tenth general meeting on the 24th will also present for discussion the "Review Report of the Economic Review Committee" and the "Political Reform Proposal" submitted by the Political Review Committee, requesting a public decision from the general meeting. Furthermore, the draft of the declaration for the plenary session has been largely completed by the Drafting Committee and will be submitted to the general meeting for discussion on the 24th. As for the temporary motion on the attitude towards the Communist Party proposed by Zhang Ji and 59 others on the 23rd, the general meeting has summarized seven key points and forwarded them to the Drafting Committee for reference and inclusion, to clarify the Kuomintang's future attitude towards the Northern Party.

### Punishment of Those Responsible for the Gold Rush Submitted to the Central Standing Committee for Effective Handling; Preparation Plan for Constitutional Implementation Mostly Passed

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, 23rd] The Third Plenary Session's ninth general meeting was held at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, with 2440 people present. After Chairman Ju Zheng reported on matters from the Secretariat, temporary motions were discussed: (1) Proposed by Huang Yu-ren and 100 other committee members, requesting the punishment of senior officials responsible for the "Gold Rush" and a thorough investigation of the accounts of "Government-Operated Commercial Firms," confiscating the property of corrupt officials to purify the officialdom and appease public anger, a resolution was passed, submitting it to the Central Standing Committee for prompt and effective handling. (2) Proposed by Committee Member Zhang Ji and 59 others, stating that the Communist Party is in full rebellion, destroying unity and endangering people's livelihood, and that the attitude towards the Communist Party issue should be re-decided to maintain unity, protect people's livelihood, and facilitate the implementation of constitutional government, a resolution was passed. (3) Proposed by Committee Member Chen Ce and 48 others, requesting that Qiongya be promptly reorganized into Hainan Province to eliminate banditry, stabilize the Southwest, facilitate the development of resources, and strengthen national defense, a resolution was passed. (4) Proposed by Committee Member Yu Junxian and 31 others, requesting that Hankou City be changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, a resolution was passed. Subsequently, the discussion on the preparation plan for constitutional implementation continued. Committee members Liang Han-cao, Sun Ke, Cheng Zhong-xing, and Miao Pei-cheng spoke successively. After a ten-minute break at 11:00 AM, Committee members Gu Zheng-gang, Ren Zhuo-xuan, Lin Zhong-xiang, and Zhang Jiu-ru expressed their opinions. A resolution was passed in principle, submitting it to the original review committee for text refinement. Subsequently, the draft resolution on the military report was discussed and passed with amendments. Then, the handling method for the opinions of the Political Review Committee on relevant political proposals was discussed, totaling 26 proposals. Each proposal was either passed with amendments or passed according to the review opinions. Finally, the Secretariat reported that the general meeting would continue at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 12:00 PM.

[Another Dispatch] During the ninth general meeting of the Third Plenary Session on the morning of the 23rd, a temporary motion proposed by Huang Yu-ren and 100 others, requesting the punishment of senior officials responsible for the "Gold Rush" and a thorough investigation of the accounts of "Government-Operated Commercial Firms," confiscating the property of corrupt officials to purify the officialdom and appease public anger, was submitted for public decision and has been passed, submitting it to the Central Standing Committee for prompt and effective handling. The full text of the proposal is recorded as follows: It is found that the Gold Rush of December of this year spread from a corner of Shanghai to the entire country, and wherever it spread, prices soared and the people resented it. Tracing the origin of the disaster, it is impossible not to investigate where the responsibility lies. The Economic Supervision Team had already investigated it before, and the four supervisory committee members of the Supervisory Yuan thoroughly investigated it after, and their investigation reports were published in detail in the press as early as the beginning of this month. The Supervisory Yuan has also formally filed an impeachment case against Comrade Song Zi-wen, the former President of the Executive Yuan, and Comrade Bei Zu-yi, the former Governor of the Central Bank. Therefore, the responsible senior officials cannot just resign or be dismissed as a way to end the matter. The original intention of the policy of selling gold was to recover legal tender, but those responsible for presiding over it not only mismanaged it, but also had suspected collusion with merchants to manipulate and seek profits. It is urgent to urge the government again to file a disciplinary action in accordance with the law, and to transfer it to the Central Supervisory Committee to quickly investigate and discuss it, in order to purify party discipline. Furthermore, this newspaper reported that "Government-Operated Commercial Firms" such as Yitong Company, Fuzhong Company, China Construction Bank Company, and Yangtze Construction Company, etc., all used "special privileges" to settle large amounts of foreign exchange to import large quantities of luxury goods, making it difficult for ordinary merchants to compete, and foreign merchants have repeatedly protested because of this. This is not only ridiculing friendly countries, but also contrary to the principle of opposing monopoly in the People's Livelihood. Moreover, these "Government-Operated Commercial Firms" are mostly corporate institutions of bureaucratic capital, and there are many properties of corrupt officials among them, all of which are obtained by plundering people's fat and ointment. Our party is a revolutionary political party, and it should be our mission to create a clean government. It is appropriate to separately send senior officials from the Supervisory Yuan and the Central Supervisory Committee to break through all personal considerations and thoroughly investigate the accounts of these "Government-Operated Commercial Firms." Those who have solid evidence of collusion with corrupt officials should immediately close their companies and confiscate their property to purify the officialdom and appease the people.

### Resolution on Military Report; Briefly Points Out Seven Points of Attention, Hoping That the Competent Authorities Will Plan and Implement Them

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, 23rd] At the ninth general meeting of the Third Plenary Session on the morning of the 23rd, the "Resolution on the Military Report" was passed. The original text is as follows:

After hearing the military report of Chief of General Staff Chen, the meeting is fully aware of the various military measures taken in the past year. Under the leadership of the supreme commander, they have been carefully managed, striving for excellence and achieving great results. For example, the military rehabilitation work such as disarming the Japanese army and sending Japanese prisoners back to their country has been completed according to plan, which is commendable. As for the various plans for reorganizing and building the army, they have been accurately implemented and gradually carried out. Significant gains have been made in reducing the number of troops and enriching the quality, reforming the national defense system and unifying the institutions. In particular, our loyal and patriotic officers and soldiers have sacrificed their lives in bloody battles and endured hardships to support the long-term war of resistance and achieve the final victory. They should have been released from their armor and returned to their hometowns to recuperate. The government understands the difficulties of the times and sympathizes with the people's difficulties, and has repeatedly tolerated the Communist Party and repeatedly negotiated with them. Its sincerity and difficulties should be understood by people at home and abroad. However, the Communist Party unreasonably refuses to close the door to peace and is willing to be the enemy of the people, destroying national unity and disturbing local peace. As a result, the plan for reorganizing the army has not been completed quickly, and the work of building the army has been difficult to advance smoothly. Therefore, the officers and soldiers who resisted aggression for the sake of saving the country have to quell the military rebellion for the sake of saving the people. This is indeed a necessary measure to protect the country and the people, but it has a great impact on the national construction work after the war. It is hoped that local order will be restored as soon as possible so that our compatriots across the country can enjoy the happiness of peace and stability. At a time when the pacification mission has not yet been completed and the work of building the army needs to be promoted urgently, the matters that should be paid attention to in the military are briefly pointed out as follows:

(1) Improve the treatment of officers and soldiers, and pay attention to the welfare of officers and soldiers to ensure the livelihood of themselves and their families.

(2) Boost morale and restore the inherent traditional spirit of our army, so that they can realize that their actions are for the sake of the country's foundation and saving the people's livelihood.

(3) Rectify military discipline so that the military and the people can be as close as fish and water to achieve the effect of cooperation.

(4) Settle unemployed soldiers and effectively handle the reemployment of officers so that soldiers will not lose their jobs. In particular, honorable soldiers must be settled to maintain military morale.

(5) Rewards must be credible and punishments must be just. All statistics of troops, reports of military intelligence, and the issuance of supplies must be accurate. If there is any false report or concealment, they should be severely punished.

(6) Effectively implement the conscription law and improve the lives of new recruits. Request that the training of new recruits be prolonged to avoid relying on foreign assistance.

The above points are urgent matters to be carried out in the military at present. It is hoped that the competent authorities will further study, plan and implement them. As for the party, government, military, and people in the pacification area, they must work together as one to make the people the outer periphery of military affairs, military affairs the vanguard of politics, politics the expression of party affairs, and the Three Principles of the People the leading center of the people. It is hoped that all relevant departments will pay close attention to this.

### US $500 Million Loan to China Will First Grant a Portion

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 23rd] The policy programs agreed upon by the People's Social Party, the Youth Party, and government officials on the 22nd were reviewed again at 4:00 PM on the 23rd at Lei Zhen's private residence after being edited. The meeting was still chaired by Mo De-hui. After discussion, the principles were generally unchanged. Members of the People's Social Party and the Youth Party took the night train to Shanghai on the 23rd. The plan will be passed by internal meetings of the two parties and then brought to Beijing for signing and promulgation jointly by the government and social elites. In addition, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for all members of the two parties at his official residence on the evening of the 23rd.

### The Plenary Session Passed a Resolution on Foreign Affairs; Reaffirming Our Firm Position; Maintaining World Peace and Welcoming Cooperation

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, 23rd] At the general meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, the Third Plenary Session passed the Foreign Affairs Review Committee's resolution on foreign affairs. The full text is as follows:

It has been a year since the Second Plenary Session. During this year, the important measures in foreign affairs have generally been in line with the decisions of the Second Plenary Session. Our country's position in repeatedly participating in international conferences is considered appropriate. In consultation with the allied nations, we have sent approximately 3 million Japanese prisoners and Japanese expatriates in one year, eliminating a major remnant for peace in our country and East Asia. The plenary session expresses its deep appreciation for the assistance and efforts of the United States. Recently, our country has repeatedly declared its solemn position, opposing and refusing to participate in any international conference to discuss issues involving China's internal affairs, which is especially the unanimous proposition of the plenary session. At this time when the international situation is complex, China should uphold its original intention of cherishing world peace and strive for cooperation with allied nations. However, China's independent and autonomous position and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty will continue to be vigorously defended and must not be harmed in the slightest. The plenary session believes that the party's established foreign policy is extremely correct. For the sake of clarity and specificity, the following eight points are listed for compliance: (1) Reaffirm China's determination to maintain and cherish world peace. China's post-war construction depends on international peace and cooperation. China should consistently strive for mutual trust and mutual assistance among friendly nations. (2) The ties between the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council should be effectively strengthened. (3) China should strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with a friendly attitude and a firm position, so that the treaty truly becomes the foundation for peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. (4) The principles of "sovereign equality of member states" and "non-interference in internal affairs" stipulated in the United Nations Charter are the cornerstone of world peace and must be implemented. (5) The integrity of territorial sovereignty is the lifeline of national survival. The party will continue the efforts of the national revolution for more than 50 years and defend it. (6) The party expresses its warm sympathy and respect for the movements for national independence and freedom around the world, but it must do its best to protect the lives and property interests of overseas Chinese everywhere. (7) No retaliatory policy will be taken against Japan, but the resurgence of its military aggression will be prevented in cooperation with the allied nations and its political democratization will be promoted. As for the heavy losses of life and property suffered by China in the Japanese war of aggression, the legitimate demands for justice and fairness will be entrusted to it for practical compensation. (8) International capital and technology cooperation are welcome under the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

In the future, when implementing foreign policy, special attention must be paid to the flexibility of its application and the firmness of its attitude in order to implement the advocacy of guaranteeing national rights. In order to achieve the task of protecting overseas Chinese, treaty negotiations should be stepped up on the one hand, and capable personnel should be carefully selected to enrich the embassies and consulates in various places on the other hand. Other areas that need to be improved should be closely monitored by the competent authorities at any time.

In short, China fought side by side with the Allied nations, sparing no unprecedented sacrifices, to exchange for common victory. China must do its best to maintain this hard-won international status. It is the consistent and firm proposition of the party and compatriots across the country that an independent, autonomous, strong China is an indispensable condition for ensuring world peace. The party has led the heroic eight-year war of resistance against aggression and militarism, and will continue to work closely with the Allied nations with the same spirit and effort to jointly lay the foundation for world peace under the banner of international justice.

### Communist Troops in Northern Shaanxi Scramble in Disarray, Still Trying to Muster Remnants to Counterattack Yan'an. Important Agencies Relocate Without Fixed Addresses.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd] After the national army captured Yan'an, the old nest of the Chinese Communists, the communist troops suffered heavy losses and were in extreme disarray. According to sources concerned: A remnant of the communist army has now fled to Suide, and its leadership has issued an emergency order to mobilize seventeen brigades from Hebei, Shandong, and northwestern Shanxi, attempting to counterattack Yan'an.

[Another Dispatch] The CCP Politburo has moved to Nan Ershilipu in Qingjian, the Border Region Government has moved to Wayao Fort, and the Communist Party's Yan'an Broadcasting Station has been renamed the Shaanxi North Xinhua News Agency Broadcasting Station and has also moved to the area. Other important agencies have moved to Wayao Fort and Hao Gou to the east, while family members in Yangjiayuanzi have all moved to northwestern Shanxi and Suide. However, with the national army advancing north in recent days, there are signs of further relocation.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 23rd] On the highway from Suide to Wubao, remnants of the Communists have been moving eastward along with livestock and vehicles in recent days, intending to cross the river and flee to western Shanxi. Furthermore, the CCP broadcasting station in Anding Wayao Fort, in view of the approaching front lines, was only set up for three days before being moved again to Xujiaping, northeast of Suide. Also, a brigade, a second brigade, and the New Eighth Brigade of the communist army are still gathered on the north bank of the upper and middle reaches of the Hulu River in northwestern Zhidan County, awaiting suppression.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The national army advancing towards Yanchang in northern Shaanxi briefly broke into Yanchang City at noon on the 22nd. After fierce street fighting, they withdrew and continued to engage in fierce fighting in the southern suburbs. Furthermore, the national army in the Yulin area has made new deployments, and part of it has advanced to the Huanghe (Yellow River) ferry crossing in Fugu in the northwest, moving south along the river to cut off the communist army's retreat into Shanxi.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] According to a dispatch from Taiyuan: The CCP headquarters has crossed the Yellow River and infiltrated Xing County and Kelan County in its Shanxi-Suiyuan Military Region. The Shanxi-Suiyuan National Army and the Shanxi-Shaanxi-Suiyuan Border Region Commander Deng Xihou's troops are on high alert. A major battle in northwestern Shanxi is unavoidable. Furthermore, the communist army in southern Shanxi is becoming active, with more than 10,000 people gathering near Yicheng, forming an encirclement. More than 3,000 people have also fled from the Zhongtiao Mountains to the vicinity of Jiang County. It is reported that the communist army is actively forming an underground military command in Xing County, and its Taiyue Military Region is mobilizing each village to send ten soldiers, with criminals who join the army being exempted from punishment.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 22nd] Rumor has it that Mao Zedong fled to Fangshan in western Shanxi, but this has not been confirmed. After the recovery of Yan'an, the situation in northern Shanxi has become tense. Last year, the joint defense of Datong by the Second and Twelfth War Zones laid the foundation for joint defense, and it is said that the commander is an old subordinate of the commander, so there are many conveniences in the joint defense. On the eve of the national army's recovery of Yan'an, the joint defense measures in the Datong area by the two war zones had been strengthened.

Yan Xishan told reporters that the communist army's intrusion into Shanxi would be met with a severe blow.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd] After the recovery of Yan'an, the communist army will flee east to Shanxi, but the military authorities here are very confident in giving them a head-on blow. This was what Governor Yan Xishan said in response to reporters' inquiries. Yan believes that the recovery of Yan'an has broken their nerve center, but the communist army has been plotting for Shanxi for a long time. This time, losing Yan'an will naturally increase the pressure on Shanxi and take an offensive. He believes that even if the communist army invades, its strength will not exceed the strength of the Yijiao campaign at the end of January. In that campaign, the communist army had a total of seventeen brigades, eight regiments, and nine detachments, totaling 200,000 people, and they were still defeated. This time, it will be even more difficult to succeed. When reporters asked about the comparison of the communist army's strength in Shanxi with that of the national army, Mr. Yan replied: The communist army adopts a tactical method of facing, concentrating its use, and mobilizing quickly. A border region often includes several provincial areas, and its numbers are difficult to count. Although it is more numerous than the national army in Shanxi, its combat power is low. As for the progress of the pacification work in Shanxi, he said that there are currently four areas that are actively developing. Regarding the reorganization of the Commander's Office, Yan said: The Pacification Office has been approved to be established on April 1, and the personnel in the Gu Office are being selected.

Editorial

### The Crux of the Indian Situation

Lord Mountbatten, the new Governor-General of India, has arrived in Delhi and will soon be sworn into office. The arrival of this new Governor-General coincides with Britain's announcement of its withdrawal from India. His coming to India is undoubtedly to clear up the British Empire's rule in India. Lord Mountbatten, with his identity as a member of the British Royal Family, coupled with his excellence as a military and political talent, having previously been stationed in Ceylon, India, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Southeast Asian Theater, is naturally the most suitable candidate to revisit his old stomping grounds as the Governor-General of India after the war. However, this time Lord Mountbatten's return to India is not in the capacity of a military commander, but as the Governor-General of India, perhaps the last Governor-General of India, coming to Delhi with shared emotions, though not necessarily the same as when he was the commander in charge of the Southeast Asian war effort. The fate that India will encounter hereafter undoubtedly has a share in Lord Mountbatten.

What greets Lord Mountbatten upon his arrival in India as Governor-General? It is India's unrest. In Bengal, the leading province of India, the local Muslim League is planning a "Pakistan Day" to welcome the arrival of the Governor-General; in Travancore in southern India, there are claims for independence; and in Punjab, Peshewar, and other regions, the disturbances have not ceased. Today in India, the animosity between Muslims and Hindus is steadily worsening. Among them, there is mutual fear, suspicion, and resentment. This is a turbulent India, and Britain's announcement of its withdrawal from India and the arrival of the new Governor-General Mountbatten not only do not seem to calm the turmoil, but instead exacerbate it. We worry about India's future and believe that this turbulent situation must be stabilized.

Of course, the reason for this turbulent situation is the incompatibility between Hindus and Muslims. The Hindu-Muslim conflict is not just a religious issue, but a historical problem in India. If it is a "country," then India is a vast and complex country, the complexity of which is beyond our imagination. In the past, British rule in India took advantage of this complexity. Exploiting these contradictions to rule India was a consistent policy of the British Empire. When the Indian National Congress was rampant, the rulers of the British Empire used the Muslim League to resist the Indian National Congress, and arrested their leaders, such as Nehru and Gandhi, and imprisoned them. The slogan "Pakistan," although having its historical background, was to some extent a result of the support of the imperial rulers. The policy of New Delhi, perhaps including London, seemed to use the Muslim League to resist the National Congress, and the National Congress to resist the Muslim League. The proposal of the "Pakistan" slogan was the victory won by the Muslim League at its first meeting. After winning this victory, the imperial rulers then turned to support Nehru and the Congress Party. Therefore, the British rulers should be held responsible for the turmoil in India.

Now that Governor-General Mountbatten has taken office, and Britain has announced its withdrawal from India in June 1948, what is urgently needed now is how to enable Hindu-Muslim cooperation. The deeper the rift between Hindus and Muslims, the less favorable it will be for India's future. The Prime Minister of Australia has already expressed concern for India's future in his parliamentary debates. What we want to say from the perspective of a neighboring country is that before withdrawing from India, Britain must reach an agreement between Hindus and Muslims, so that India can have a future. Since Marshal Wavell was somewhat dismissed for this reason, we hope that Lord Mountbatten can see the crux of the chaotic situation in India and achieve a proper solution.

Public Utility Subsidy Policy

The price increase of public utilities has been formally rejected by the National Price Commission. The losses incurred will be subsidized by the government. This matter is of great significance and should not be regarded merely as the resolution of a pending issue for public utilities.

It is recalled that when the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was passed on February 16, the chairman stated, "If the government continues to subsidize various public utilities, the budget cannot be maintained, so reasonable increases should be made in the future." It can be seen that the price increase proposal was decisively rejected, and the government shouldered the subsidy instead, which has profound significance and great concern.

One of the meanings is of course to seek price stability and to avoid repeating the mistake of leading price increases. From the perspective of suppressing prices, the steps are consistent and the stance is firm, which can be seen by everyone in the world. And correcting the past practice of state-owned enterprises taking the lead in raising prices, and using facts to demonstrate the determination to stabilize prices, is sufficient to be a clear indicator for the implementation of economic emergency measures.

As of the time of writing, we have not yet seen how the amount of the subsidy, the scope, the period, and even the method will be. But the public utilities referred to are certainly not limited to one place, and the amount of the subsidy must be sufficient for each business to maintain at a minimum level. Therefore, the magnitude of the amount and the burden can also be glimpsed. In these times of a thousand holes and hundreds of wounds, and extreme financial difficulties, the government is still willing to shoulder this heavy burden. If it were not for truly suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, no one would believe that it would actually be realized.

There are many ways to subsidize, not necessarily limited to taking out cash for subsidies. For example, for state-owned transportation businesses, such as railways and postal services, even when they are clearly losing money, they do not increase prices to make up for it, but instead sit and subsidize expenses. This is also a type of subsidy and is no different from taking out cash to subsidize. The scope of the price freeze this time is not limited to state-owned enterprises, and there are many that are local public or privately operated. In that case, without cash or material subsidies, it is impossible to achieve the purpose of the subsidy. The large-scale implementation of this method is very common in foreign countries, but it is still an innovation in our country. An ancient saying goes, "The beginning is simple, but the end is great." This budding flower is also worthy of cherishing.

Regarding the control of prices, there have been many attempts during and after the war, but the results have not been very good. There are naturally many reasons for this, but an overemphasis on control without seeking reasonable adjustments and remedies is a major cause. Merchants have an old saying, "Do a thousand things, do ten thousand things, but don't do anything that loses money." If they are forced to lose money, the result will either be superficial compliance and a mere formality, or private gain and corruption with endless tricks. Those who advocate control often overlook this point, thinking that since other countries have adopted this policy, why can't we imitate it? They do not know that in handling control, other countries do not aim for income except for specific commodities and businesses, and even disburse huge sums from the treasury to subsidize them clearly. Therefore, prices are reduced, and merchants and people are happy to comply. The reason is that they only seek to reduce their profits, not to seek exorbitant profits, but not to swallow them whole, forcing them to close down, lose money, and sit and subsidize expenses.

Therefore, if this public utility subsidy method can be implemented, it will not only be a powerful measure in suppressing prices, but also a major step forward in price control. If this principle can be applied at any time and any place, we believe that all economic emergency measures will be able to spread like wildfire. This is not to say that everything needs to be subsidized, nor is it to say that all industries need to be subsidized. As long as we are guided by this principle of not seeking profits and striving for a reasonable approach, we can win the trust and cooperation of both the upper and lower levels, and eliminate countless barriers and entanglements.

### Truman Suddenly Orders the Purging of Disloyal Elements, Including Communists and Fascists, All Those Employed in Administrative Agencies Must Be Investigated

[United Press Washington, 22nd] President Truman today issued an order to purge public servants who are not loyal to their duties and stipulated various new standards for testing loyalty. The order stipulates that anyone applying for a position in an administrative agency must be investigated for loyalty without exception. The current application method does not have this provision. Each agency shall submit the list of its current employees to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for review. The Prosecutor General should regularly submit the latest list of all destructive groups. Anyone who joins such a group as a member can be regarded as disloyal. The blacklist includes all autocratic, fascist, communist, or destructive groups, as well as those who propose or support the deprivation of the people's constitutional rights by force, and those who attempt to change the current form of government by unconstitutional means. At the same time, a summary table will be created for all those who have been investigated since September 1939. The new method can be adopted by various government agencies. However, it is not suitable for the judicial or legislative branches of the government, nor does it include the meaning of changing the existing military security regulations. The government may request additional funds for the Civil Service Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the former will be $15 million and the latter will be $20 million. The President said that the above two agencies must be responsible for purging internal elements.

[United Press Washington, 22nd] President Truman today signed and approved the order to terminate the Price Administration Bureau on June 30, but requested Congress to allow other agencies to continue to control rent and sugar. However, the Senate Republican leader's meeting resulted in divergent opinions on whether rent and sugar should continue to be controlled and how, and no agreement was reached.

### After the Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill Is Passed, the United States Will Loan to South Korea, This Plan Will Not Be Announced for the Time Being

[United Press Washington, 23rd] The US Congress discussed last week whether to pass President Truman's $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey to resist the threat of communism in recent times. It will take a long time to debate before this proposal is passed into law, but it will eventually be passed and start a new trend in US foreign policy. Some members concerned about the Far East believe that before the end of the debate, the United States should also engage in an economic war against communism in the Far East. On the one hand, the State Department hopes so, and on the other hand, the development of the already started plan has been drafted to aid Korea with 500 million to 600 million US dollars in three years, of which more than 200 million will be used to rebuild Korea's railways, yarn mills, and other industries in the coming year. This plan will not be announced, and officials will deny this statement before Congress approves aid to Greece, but will submit the aid to Korea bill to Congress at a favorable time.

### The Political Situation in South Korea Is About to Change

Dr. Seo Jae-pil Returns to Korea from the United States

[This Newspaper Beiping, 23rd] According to sources from Korean people here: Marshall will try to negotiate with the Soviet Union in Moscow to establish a unified government in North and South Korea. If the negotiation fails, the United States will temporarily abandon its plan to establish a unified government in Korea and allow the establishment of a government south of the 38th parallel to satisfy the wishes of the people in South Korea. Dr. Seo Jae-pil, a veteran of the Korean revolution, returned to Seoul from the United States on the 15th of this month. He will serve as a bridge between the United States and the Korean people in the name of the Director of the South Korean Civil Administration and the Supreme Advisor of General Hodge. He may even be a strong preparer for the future South Korean government. Xu was the pioneer of Korean nationalism. He participated in the Gapsin Coup. After the failure, he hid in an American warship. After arriving in the New World, he obtained American citizenship and studied medicine, earning a doctorate. In the year of Eulmi, he returned to Korea as an American and served as a Korean advisor stationed in Seoul. Within one or two years, he was blamed by the Korean King and sent back to the United States. At that time, Xu sat on Namsan Mountain in Seoul and cried bitterly that Korea was about to perish. Forty years later, Xu returned to Korea again and served as an advisor to the newly emerging country. The Korean people placed infinite hope on him (Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee are also advisors).

### The Trade Agreement Between Greece and Turkey Is Temporarily Extended

[United Press London, 22nd] The Ankara Radio Station announced on the 22nd that the trade agreement between Greece and Turkey, which expired on the 21st, has been extended and a new agreement is still under negotiation. Turkey suggested that the agreement be temporarily extended for three months, while Greece suggested an extension of 45 days.

Greek Guerrillas Retreat into Bulgarian Territory

[United Press Athens, 22nd] Greek Prime Minister Maximos convened an emergency cabinet meeting today and ordered the Minister of Public Security, who was inspecting the country, to fly back to the capital immediately. At the same time, according to a report from the Thessaloniki government army, the guerrillas are retreating towards the Bulgarian border under the bombing of the Greek air force and the artillery bombardment of the army. The government army is launching a fierce counterattack near Kercini and has been fighting fiercely with the guerrillas for two days. It is claimed that the number of guerrilla casualties and prisoners is over 350, and more than 300 others have fled into Bulgaria.

[Agence France-Presse Sofia, 22nd] The subcommittee of the United Nations Investigation Commission departed from Greece to Bulgaria. Originally planned to go to the city of Nevrokop for inspection, the plan has now been temporarily changed to come directly here. It is expected to arrive at the Bulgarian-Greek border on the morning of the 24th.

A Province in Greece Declares Martial Law

[United Press Athens, 23rd] The Greek government convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 23rd and then announced the implementation of martial law in the active guerrilla areas of the Laconia province. Greek President Maximos announced that the government would take various steps to restore order. According to a government announcement, the Minister of the Army and the Minister of Public Security will fly to Laconia province to inspect the implementation of martial law. The military and civil authorities of Laconia province will be punished by a special military court. The left and right-wing elements in the area have recently been killing each other in groups. In the last 36 hours, two right-wing leaders, 52 left-wing elements, and one communist have been assassinated. At the same time, right-wing elements in the provincial capital of Kos province, Cesira, assassinated 39 people on the 21st, and 13 left-wing elements in the city of Maria in southwestern Kos province were also brutally killed.

### Greek Guerrilla Leader Expresses Political Views

[Agence France-Presse Thessaloniki, 22nd] All representatives of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Commission went to the border between Greece and the South to conduct on-the-spot investigations and met with General Markos Vafiadis, the leader of the Greek guerrillas. Mr. Markos failed to arrive on time, so some representatives returned here on the 16th of this month. Representatives from the Soviet Union and Poland remained there. After meeting with General Markos, they also returned here today with liaison officers from Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. It is said that General Markos said, "Once the United Kingdom and the United States stop interfering, peace in Greece can be restored."

### Austin Hurries Back to Washington to Review the Impact of the New US Policy on the United Nations

[United Press Washington, 22nd] US Representative to the United Nations Austin hurriedly returned to Washington today, which shows the close relationship between the US aid to Greece and Turkey to prevent communism in the Near East and the United Nations question. The preamble to the aid to Greece and Turkey bill submitted by Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Connally, a Democrat, also directly involved the United Nations. It is said that the United Nations Security Council recognizes the seriousness of the situation on the Greek border. At the same time, the State Department has been preparing an official letter, waiting for the President's approval, to be delivered by Austin to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, clarifying the US position and the necessity of this action. Austin is said to be very uneasy about the impact of this unilateral US action on UN member states. Vandenberg and Connally urged the public to pay attention to the fact that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization also recognized that Greece must obtain financial and economic assistance, and suggested that Greece should request such assistance from the UN and the US and UK.

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 23rd] The rumor that President Truman had sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie explaining the US attitude towards Greece and Turkey was once again denied by White House Press Secretary Ross.

### US Aid to Greece and Turkey Will Be Difficult to Achieve by the End of the Month

[United Press Washington, 22nd] Senate Democratic Leader Barkley said to reporters today that the bill to allocate 400 million US dollars to aid Greece and Turkey is expected to be unable to pass before the UK stops economic aid to the two countries on March 31. President Truman's aid bill will not be submitted to the Senate for discussion by the deadline. If the United States must aid Greece and Turkey before the end of March, the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation may grant emergency loans. Barkley also announced that he plans to go to Greece, Turkey, and Palestine in early April to inspect the local situation.

### The Arab League Holds a Regular Meeting, Eagerly Hoping to Obtain Active US Aid

[Central News Agency Ankara, 22nd] As the world is paying attention to the Moscow Conference and the US relationship with Turkey and Greece, the regular meeting of the Arab League held in Cairo by senior officials of the seven Arab countries since March 17 has been almost ignored. Arab League Secretary-General Azzam broke the silence today and announced that all Arab countries support the completion of the unification of the Nile River Basin, namely "Egyptian Sudan", and are eagerly awaiting the withdrawal of British troops from the entire Nile River Basin. The Arab League actually represents 35 million Arabs in the Middle East. The League discussed the Palestine issue and unanimously insisted on opposing the entry of Jews, and announced that the League supports Egypt in the British-Egyptian deadlock. As far as reporters know, the Arab countries are paying close attention to the US aid to Turkey and Greece and hope for similar aid. The Young Party of Egypt, nicknamed the Green Shirt Party, is known for its extreme nationalism. The leader of the party telegraphed Truman, saying that Egypt should also be included in the anti-communist defense line, and the telegram also requested US support to submit the British-Egyptian case to the Security Council. Saudi Arabia has been embraced by the United States due to military, industrial, and economic concessions to the United States. Today, the entire Near East and Middle East are hoping for US aid. So far, they have been fully suppressing communism with arrests and attacks. Only the Communist Parties of Syria and Lebanon have obtained legal status. The Lebanese Foreign Minister has specifically pointed out that Middle Eastern countries need assistance from the United States similar to that of Greece and Turkey.

### US Occupation Forces Suddenly Order the Arrest of Korean Leftist Leaders

[Reuters Seoul, 22nd] The US military authorities suddenly ordered the arrest of 30 leftist leaders tonight. Most of the key left-wing figures have been arrested, but no members of the Legislative Assembly have been arrested. It is widely believed that this search and arrest operation is related to the hardening of Washington's policies.

### The United States Will Notify Relevant Countries to Draft and Review the Treaty of Peace with Japan; The United States Will Draft the Blueprint for the Treaty of Peace with Japan

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] State Department officials announced today that the United States will suggest in its notifications to relevant governments that China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Soviet Union, the five major powers, draft the peace treaty with Japan, and that the remaining eleven members of the Far Eastern Commission form a review department. At the same time, the State and War Departments of the United States have nearly completed the blueprint for the Japanese peace treaty. However, the official denied that the start of this blueprint was due to General MacArthur's urging. According to the official's opinion, reaching a satisfactory peace will take at least nine months to a year. Countries demanding reparations from Japan, such as China, the Philippines, and the United States, may be satisfied soon. However, in light of the situation in Korea, that country's demands obviously still need to be reviewed due to U.S. aid to that country. The official also stated that the most intense dispute in the reparations issue may be between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union regarding the losses they suffered. The Soviet Union will demand compensation, claiming that Japan's restraint of Soviet forces in Siberia during the war prevented them from fighting Hitler, resulting in losses. The United Kingdom, supported by the United States, will deny this point.

### The United States Has Released a Portion of Secret Documents Regarding the Greek-Turkish Aid Case

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Acting Secretary of State Acheson released to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today the secret documents clarifying the background of President Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey. It was found that this historical background did not have the value of being labeled "confidential." It includes numerous lengthy chronologies dating back to the 1911 revision of the Greek constitution and the disintegration of the Ottoman army in Turkish history, when Tallaat and Enver fled into exile. One document briefly described the situation in Greece, providing information on Greece's struggle in the civil war. However, only about half of the entire archive was released today, with the remainder to be published tomorrow. Some observers expect it to be more important.

After President Truman announced the new foreign policy of aiding Greece and Turkey on March 12, key officials from the State Department and the Army and Navy Departments met the next day to discuss it. Seated in the picture (from left to right) are Assistant Secretary of State Acheson, Senate Speaker Vandenberg, and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Connally; standing are Army Secretary Patterson and Navy Secretary Forrestal.

### The Pan-Asian Conference Opened Yesterday in India with Representatives from Thirty-Two Countries

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 23rd] The Pan-Asian Conference opened today in the ancient fort of Old Delhi, presided over by Nehru, leader of the interim government of India. Two hundred and fifty representatives from thirty-two Asian countries attended, and a crowd of 5,000 people watched the ceremony, making it a grand occasion. The conference chairman is Mrs. Naidu, and the session will last for ten days. Discussions will be limited to economic, cultural, and social issues, and will not involve politics. Among the major Far Eastern countries, only Japan did not participate in the conference. Seventeen representatives from the Asian part of the Soviet Union attended as observers, and the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Australia also sent observers.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 23rd Special Dispatch] Zheng Yanqi, head of the Chinese delegation to the Pan-Asian Conference, and two other representatives attended the guiding committee this morning. Nehru delivered a speech at the meeting.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 22nd Special Dispatch] The Chinese delegation to the Pan-Asian Conference arrived here tonight. After getting off the plane, the delegation issued a statement saying, "India is China's neighbor and friend. Nehru's visit to Chongqing during China's life-and-death struggle with Japan left a deep impression on the Chinese people. They also cannot forget the warm welcome the Indian people gave to President Chiang and Madame Chiang in 1942. Mahatma Gandhi, the great leader of the Indian people, is a brilliant model of perfection and goodwill for all mankind. We firmly believe that the long-standing friendship and respect between the two countries will continue to grow. To ensure this, our two countries have now exchanged ambassadors. On the eve of the Pan-Asian Conference being held in this historic city, representatives from Asian countries have gathered to discuss issues of common interest. Our hearts are filled with hope, and we wish this conference will bring the dawn of better times for Asia and all Asian people."

### The Dutch-Indonesian Agreement: Indonesia Has Expressed Its Agreement

[Associated Press, Batavia, 23rd] According to a dispatch, the Indonesian Republican Cabinet decided today to accept the Dutch government's invitation to immediately sign the Cheribon Agreement, without delaying it due to the recent Dutch occupation of Mojokerto in eastern Java. However, President Sjahrir has been ordered to continue to urge the Dutch side to resolve the Mojokerto incident after the signing.

### The Debate on the German Political System Concludes for the Time Being; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Adjourns for Two Days; The Special Committee Will Draft a Comprehensive Report on the Proposals

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] The Foreign Ministers' Conference will adjourn for two days starting on Sunday (the 23rd) to allow all parties to prepare concrete proposals. A special committee has been established, with Vyshinsky representing the Soviet Union, General Clay representing the United States, Hubert representing the United Kingdom, and Alphand representing France. The task of the special committee is to consolidate the different proposals and submit a report to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 25th. The Foreign Ministers' Conference will reconvene at 4 p.m. on the 25th.

[United Press International, Moscow, 22nd] The four major powers' foreign ministers held their twelfth meeting today and decided to adjourn for two days. The first stage of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the past two days of debate on the future German political system have come to an end.

At today's meeting, Molotov firmly opposed any federalization plan. The plan proposed by Molotov was similar to the "Weimar Constitution" after World War I. The Soviet Union advocates that the future political system of Germany should be the political system before Hitler came to power, just like the Weimar Republic system. Molotov asked the representatives to study the Weimar Constitution and said that it had many advantages.

### The Four Powers Have Different Stances on Germany's Future Political System

During the two-day adjournment, the foreign ministers of the four powers need to study many proposals. Here is a brief description of the stances of the four countries:

France

Opposes the hasty establishment of an interim government. It advocates that Germany's future political system should be a decentralized federal system, and the weaker the power of the central government, the better.

United Kingdom

Advocates immediately organizing an interim government, and then organizing a federal government with limited power, with important powers belonging to local governments.

United States

Advocates quickly organizing an interim government, and finally allowing the German people to formulate a constitution with popular sovereignty, restricting the power of the government, with the focus on decentralization of power.

Soviet Union

Also demands the immediate organization of an interim government, and then the organization of a democratic republic with a bicameral parliament and government, guaranteeing the constitutional rights of each state. The Soviet plan is similar to the federal government system, but there are differences in restricting the power of the central government and stipulating the rights of each state.

### The United Kingdom Proposes New Suggestions for Unifying the German Economy

[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Foreign Secretary Bevin put forward new proposals on the unification of the German economy at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today, stating that the recovery of German industry should be carried out gradually, and proper attention should be paid to supplying coal to the liberated countries. The increase in production rate should be related to the need for coal exports. What should be noted here is that the expenses of the occupying countries should not be increased because of this. Judging from this suggestion, the intention seems to be to enable France to obtain more coal, in order to balance the British proposal to increase German steel production to 10 million tons per year. Bevin also stated that Chapter XIV of the Potsdam Agreement, which is the chapter on the unification of the German economy, should be fully implemented, and the occupation expenses of Germany, in the past, present, and future, should be shared equally by the four powers. The occupation expenditure should first be repaid with German production. He further advocated that materials should be freely exchanged between the four zones, import and export plans should be formulated, the financial reform plan should be implemented as soon as possible, the trusts should be dissolved, and the Allied Control Council should revise the factories and equipment for reparations before July 1 of this year.

### The French Cabinet Decides to Continue its Political Affairs; The Members of the Four Major Parties Decide to Remain in Office

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The Ramadier government has been preserved due to the compromise of the Communist Party and the temporary change of opinion of the Radical Party. The Communist Party has expressed its willingness to retain the five Communist Party members in the cabinet, but decided to abstain from voting when the parliament votes on the Vietnam military expenditure. Ramadier has expressed his acceptance of this position. The Radical Party had previously passed a resolution ordering the five Radical Party members in the cabinet to withdraw to show their dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Communist Party, but suddenly decided to cancel the resolution to withdraw from the cabinet. Political observers do not regard this as a good phenomenon, and they expect that the reaction of the Radical Party will deepen the scars within the government. Because it is currently during the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the country is facing financial and economic difficulties, no political party is willing to take the responsibility of causing a government crisis.

Communist Party member Duclos said in the National Assembly today that although the Communist Party opposes the appropriation of funds for fighting the Viet Minh, in order to maintain the unity of the cabinet, it has ordered Communist Party members to continue to hold office. France must maintain the unity of the coalition government at the present time to avoid hindering France's efforts in the Moscow Conference. We deeply know that our Foreign Minister has encountered serious difficulties in the Moscow Conference to make the conference accept France's views, especially on the coal issue.

It is also learned that the remaining two major parties in the French coalition government have also decided to support the continuation of participation in the government.

### A New Governor Arrives; Accidents Occur Again in India

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 23rd] Muslims held a "Partition of India-Pakistan Day" demonstration today, which clashed with Hindu followers. The police were forced to fire to suppress the riot and imposed martial law.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The outgoing Governor of India, Wavell, left here for London with his wife today. Governor Mountbatten and others greeted him at the airport.

### The Seventh Largest Continent in the World: The Virgin Land of Antarctica; United Press Correspondence; Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper

Antarctica, this adventure destination of the twentieth century, has attracted more attention than any unexplored place since Livingstone explored Africa and Perry discovered the Arctic.

The seventh largest continent in the world, Antarctica, is the last continent to be discovered and the only continent that has never had a permanent colony. There are more than a dozen countries that formally or informally claim a part of the continent. The only two countries that have formally declared an interest in Antarctica are in the Western Hemisphere, namely Argentina and Chile. The third country, the United States, has stated that it does not recognize the territorial claims of other countries, and it is still considering whether it will make its own territorial claims.

All the claimed territories in Antarctica are wedge-shaped, with their vertices at the South Pole, and in most places, the flags of certain countries have been erected. The distribution of countries in this new world is roughly as follows:

Argentina Claims the Falkland Islands

Argentina has declared that it holds sovereignty over the so-called Falkland Islands dependencies, while the United Kingdom also claims to have sovereignty over the area. The area is located between 20 degrees west longitude and 80 degrees west longitude, including the Graham Land Peninsula and most of the Weddell Sea. Argentina has maintained a meteorological station on the South Orkney Islands since 1902. In addition, Argentine naval officer Sobral accompanied Swedish explorer Nordenskjöld on an expedition to Graham Land from 1901 to 1904, and was finally discovered by the Argentine cruiser "Uruguay" in 1904. Argentina claims that the area should belong to Argentina based on this reason. Although Argentina has put forward other reasons, they lack strong evidence.

Rosa, chairman of the newly established Argentine Antarctica Committee, said that Argentina is close to Antarctica, so it has the right to make territorial claims. In an order issued by President Perón on October 9, 1946, he claimed a part of Antarctica based on the reason that the sandbanks of Antarctica border Argentina. Except for Chile, no government has recognized Argentina's claim.

Argentina sent an expedition to Antarctica for the first time in early January of this year, with Chilean observers accompanying them.

Chile Has Always Been Very Happy About Antarctica

The territory claimed by Chile overlaps with the territory claimed by Argentina and the United Kingdom, but there is also a part of the territory that has not been claimed by any country. The area is located between 53 degrees west longitude and 90 degrees west longitude, and also includes most of Graham Land and unexplored land.

According to a statement issued by the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 14, 1946, based on (1) Chilean whaling ships and seal hunting ships often frequent the seas near the area in the past 100 years, (2) the area is close to the Chilean border, and historical, geographical, legal, diplomatic, and administrative reasons, Chile has the right to own the area.

The Chilean expedition departed for Antarctica on January 15 of this year, with three Argentine observers accompanying them. The general public in Chile is now very concerned about the Antarctic issue.

The United States Has a Long History of Risky Activities

In addition, the third country in the Western Hemisphere that cares about Antarctica is the United States. Although American explorers have been active in Antarctica for 107 years, they have not yet formally made any territorial claims.

Although many British navigators had sailed the Southern Ocean and knew of the existence of Antarctica, it was not until 1840 that U.S. Navy Lieutenant Wilkes discovered Antarctica near 135 degrees east longitude.

In the following years, the United States maintained its dominant position as a major whaling country. American ships have repeatedly broken through the large ice floes in the Southern Ocean. Most Americans have participated in foreign Antarctic expeditions, but the real exploration work did not begin until 1920, when Australian Wilkins and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Byrd made several famous flights, including Byrd's flight across Antarctica in 1929.

American Explorer Rear Admiral Byrd

After Byrd discovered Marie Byrd Land, he advocated that the area should belong to the United States, but Congress did not approve it. Later, Ellsworth made the first flight across the Southern Ocean from Graham Land to Little America, but his territorial claim was also shelved.

If the United States claims any land in Antarctica, it will probably be between 90 degrees west longitude and 150 degrees west longitude. No country has claimed this section of land so far.

The ice-free area (40 miles long) recently discovered by the Byrd Expedition in the Australian part near Knox Land at 101 degrees longitude may become increasingly important and may become a base for long-term exploration.

Three Ice-Free Zones are Most Noteworthy

It is worth noting that this is the third ice-free area that has been discovered in Antarctica, apparently formed by the heat of intermittent hot springs. In 1941, German pilots discovered two ice-free areas, one in Princess Martha Coast on the east coast of the Weddell Sea and one in Princess Astrid Coast further east, both on the other side of Antarctica opposite Byrd's discovery. At that time, the Germans only took a few photos, but did not actually explore them, because their purpose there was to plunder the whaling ships of the United Nations. As a result, eleven ships were captured.

### The Scottish Independence Movement Gains Support from Many Celebrities

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] It is learned that the Scottish National Party held a meeting in Glasgow last night, demanding Scottish autonomy. Many nobles and three Conservative members of Parliament attended the meeting, which was very important. The demand for Scotland to become an independent state, or at least to establish an independent Scottish parliament, is not a recent event. It has been repeatedly proposed by a small number of National Party members, but it has not been noticed by most Scottish people, because they all believed that uniting with the United Kingdom was more beneficial than independence at that time. This is the first time that the movement has been supported by influential people.

### A Large Uranium Mine Discovered in Mexico

[Agence France-Presse, Mexico City, 23rd] It is reported that a uranium mine (atomic bomb material) worth US$175 million has been discovered in the northern Mexican province of Chihuahua (near the US border). Initially, workers in the area became ill one after another. After expert testing, it was determined that it was due to radio wave radiation. An investigation was conducted and a large batch of high-grade uranium ore was discovered. The exact location has not been announced.

### The Paraguayan Government Begs for Peace; The Rebel Commander Expresses His Determination Not to Accept

[Agence France-Presse, Asunción, 23rd] According to people responsible here, the Paraguayan government has asked the rebels for peace today, because President Morinigo fears that the war will expand and that the southern provinces will also rebel. The peace conditions were put forward by the three generals who are loyal to the government, advocating the formation of a three-headed interim government, chaired by President Morinigo, and also including rebel cavalry commander Colonel Raimas, to save the crisis. The rebel side may accept this condition.

[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd] Paraguayan rebel commander Villalba told a reporter in Concepción today that we will never accept any request, nor will we meet with any representative of President Morinigo. We will advance into the capital, Asunción, to restore the legitimate rights of the people. The purpose of the revolutionary movement is to overthrow the dictatorship established by Morinigo seven years ago, reinstate the commander-in-chief who was dismissed by Morinigo, restore the freedom of the people, and guarantee the activities of all parties. Former Paraguayan interim president Colonel Franco, who has been exiled in Uruguay, has also arrived in Concepción and delivered a speech saying that I am a party leader and do not intend to lead the revolutionary movement.

### The Rebel's Ultimatum Requires the President to Resign

[Associated Press, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd] According to people who have fled from Paraguay to here, Paraguayan rebel leader Galeano has issued an ultimatum with eleven points, demanding that President Morinigo resign immediately. They also said that the president has sent two representatives, General Ondino and Colonel Fancetti, to the rebel headquarters to negotiate peace. It is also heard that Galeano told the two representatives that he will limit the president to reply to his conditions before noon today. If he does not reply after the deadline, all negotiations will be cancelled.

### A U.S. Diplomatic Delegation Will Travel to Nepal at the End of the Month

To Sign a Friendship and Commerce Agreement

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The U.S. State Department announced today that a U.S. special diplomatic delegation will leave Washington for Nepal at the end of this month to sign a U.S.-Nepal Friendship and Commerce Agreement. The head of the delegation is Sadwiddy, President Truman's personal representative.

### The Civil Aviation Industry Calls on the Government to Fulfill Compensation for Wartime Ship Losses; The Compensation Claims Committee Hosted a Reporter Briefing Yesterday; It is Scheduled to Go to the Capital Again This Week to Request Action

[This newspaper's report] During the War of Resistance, the losses of private ships in our country were huge, either because they were requisitioned and ports were closed, or because they were damaged during military and public transportation, or because they were captured by the Japanese, or because they were bombed and destroyed by the enemy. After the victory, the civil aviation industry organized a Wartime Loss Compensation Claims Committee for Private Ships, requesting compensation from the government. After much negotiation, the government has approved the compensation principles and amounts at executive meetings, but the implementation measures have been delayed until now for more than a year and three months, and there is still no news. Shipping companies are extremely anxious. Zhong Shandao, the standing committee member and chief executive of the Compensation Claims Committee, is scheduled to go to the capital this week to request action from the government again.

He especially hosted a press conference yesterday to make an appeal. According to the discussion, the losses of private ships during the war are as follows: (1) 63 ships requisitioned and ports closed, totaling 119,906 tons. (2) 33 ships damaged during military and public transportation, totaling 15,981 tons. (3) 67 ships captured by the Japanese, totaling 111,006 tons. (4) 43 ships sunk by enemy bombing, totaling 49,357 tons. The Compensation Claims Committee submitted the above-mentioned loss figures to the government on December 12, 1945, and suggested methods to restore tonnage: (1) Compensate ton for ton. (2) Compensate based on assessed value per ton. (3) Guarantee overseas orders or shipbuilding.

The Executive Yuan Approved the Principles

The Executive Yuan approved the principles at its executive meeting on February 26, 1946: (1) Ships that were requisitioned for military purposes, used as blocking projects, and damaged by the enemy while performing military and public duties, and that comply with the provisions of the Military Requisition Law, should be compensated. (2) How to convert the tonnage and depreciation of ships, as well as the index of currency value and steel and wood before the war, should be quickly drafted by the Ministry of Transportation and submitted for approval. (3) The government should facilitate shipping companies to order ships from abroad. (4) Shipping companies can directly apply to the Four Joint Offices for loans. The committee immediately calculated according to the two indexes of metal building materials published by the Shanghai Municipal Government in March 1946, with an exchange rate of 1,200 yuan at that time, and the total amount was converted to US$10 million. It also repeatedly consulted with the Ministry of Transportation and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which was approved at the 758th executive meeting on September 10, 1946, to compensate US$3.6 million, and ordered the Ministry of Transportation to consult with shipping companies to determine the payment methods for the compensation.

Discuss Compensation Methods

The committee formulated the methods on October 30 of that year. The main points are: (1) Restore 120,000 tons of requisitioned lost ships, averaging US$100 per ton, totaling US$12 million. In addition to the government's compensation of US$3.6 million, the remaining amount should be provided by government loans or guarantees to order or renovate from abroad. (2) The amount of the government guarantee or loan will be guaranteed by ships obtained from Japan's reparations in the future. However, this submission was submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry on October 30 of last year, and it has not been approved yet. Therefore, more than 30 shipping companies before the war have not been able to resume business. At a time when governments of all countries attach importance to marine shipping and the civil aviation industry in our country urgently needs to be developed, it is hoped that the government can specifically implement it as soon as possible in the near future, so that the ship compensation case that has been settled and has been worrying the damaged shipping companies day and night can be properly concluded as soon as possible.

### The Rear Area Factories Rehabilitation Association Invited Guests to Visit Four Factories, Production Greatly Affected by Coal and Electricity Restrictions

[This Newspaper's Report] The Rear Area Factories Rehabilitation Association, consisting of various small and medium-sized factories in the rear areas, provided significant services to the military and civilian populations during the war. After the victory, they returned to Shanghai and, after repeated requests, obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to purchase or lease enemy and puppet factories that had failed to sell after two auctions. The first batch of purchasing and leasing procedures was completed in mid-September of the previous year. However, only a dozen or so were able to resume operations. Most had been shut down for more than a year after being taken over and were in a state of disarray and rust. Furthermore, due to restrictions on fuel, electricity, capital, and factory personnel, not all were able to formally resume production. The second batch was held as late as February of this year, but has not yet been approved and implemented. In order to allow all sectors to understand the current situation of each factory, the association invited the Shanghai press yesterday afternoon to visit the factories. More than thirty teachers and students from the Shanghai Jiaocheng Elementary School also accompanied the visit, guided by Xie Tiansheng, the association's general secretary. Due to time constraints, only four factories were visited: the Shanghai Paper Mill, the Shanghai Dahe Industrial Factory, the Yong'an Electromagnetic Factory, and the Shanghai Qiwen Machinery Factory. Among them, the Shanghai Paper Mill has not yet resumed production. According to Xie, all twelve felt strips, twenty-one copper wire cloths, and more than sixty tons of pulp at the factory have been transferred to the state-run Jiangnan Paper Mill. The issues of factory personnel and electricity connection have not been resolved, leading to the factory's failure to resume production to this day. At a time when paper shortages are severe, it is a great pity that the machinery remains rusted and idle. The factory has a complete set of pulping digesters and papermaking machines, all of which are currently exposed to rust and damage in the factory building. After resuming production, it could produce 300 tons of paper per month. The other three factories that have resumed production include the Dahe Industrial Factory, which is the only factory in Shanghai specializing in the production of asbestos tiles. It covers an area of more than forty mu and is very large in scale. It currently produces 600 asbestos tiles per month, each three feet seven inches long and two fen thick. The Yong'an Electromagnetic Factory, along with the Central Electromagnetic Factory, were the only two electromagnetic factories in the Southwest during the war. After the victory, it returned to Shanghai. Due to restrictions on coal and electricity supply, it could not produce on a large scale, so it opened a branch factory in Fuliang, Jiangxi. Its products are sold in the Southeast, but the high transportation costs have resulted in significant deficits. The Shanghai Qiwen Machinery Factory, which specializes in the production of numbering machines, has also been greatly affected in its output by daytime electricity restrictions.

### The Longhua Airport Runway Can Be Completed in May, With a Total Cost of 9 Billion, the Best Equipped in the Country

[This Newspaper's Report] The construction of the north-south runway at Longhua Airport, Ministry of Transportation, which is 6,000 feet long and 150 feet wide, began in December last year. The laying of the gravel base began in early February of this year. To date, the gravel base has been largely completed, and the concrete pavement has completed one-fifth, i.e., sixty blocks (each block is 120 feet long and 25 feet wide, and six blocks can be completed per day). The entire project is expected to be completed in mid-May, and it will be the longest and most complete runway in the country.

The runway is not only particularly wide and long, but also can carry 45 tons, to meet the weight standards of the Constellation aircraft. The runway thickness is 11.2 inches, and the joints are thickened to 14.6 inches. A total of 12,000 tons of cement, 17,000 tons of sand, and 70,000 tons of gravel are required, but the gravel is currently short of 30,000 tons, which is the most difficult part of the project.

A Total of 2,000 Workers Are Employed

The total cost of the runway project is estimated to be 9 billion yuan, which is allocated solely by the Ministry of Transportation, and 8.7 billion yuan has already been received. According to the engineers there, this amount should be sufficient, and the remaining funds are intended to be used for the construction of taxiways along the runway. The project is divided into three sections: north, middle, and south, contracted by Baohua Construction Company, Tao Guiji Construction Factory, and China United Engineering Company, respectively.

The machinery used in the project, in addition to the twelve concrete mixers, seven crushers, and two road rollers rented by the contractors from the First Mechanical Road Construction Engineering Corps of the Highway Administration, and one road roller borrowed from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the site also purchased ten concrete mixers from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

Other works that should be continued for the Longhua Airport, such as the air station, parking apron, taxiways, east-west runways, etc., are still under detailed consideration by the Civil Aviation Administration.

### The Federation of Trade Unions Asks for Regulations on the Minimum Wage for Workers

Recently, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has noticed that some manufacturers' wages are often overly harsh, leading to frequent disputes. The federation, concerned about this, recently submitted a request to the Municipal Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, requesting the establishment of a minimum wage standard to ensure the livelihood of workers. The original text briefly stated: "The wages of workers in various industries in the city," and the basic salary standards have been adjusted for most industries, but a few still follow the old habits, with excessively harsh treatment that does not meet the minimum standards. Moreover, there are different basic salaries for the same job, which is unfair, making it impossible for workers to maintain their minimum living standards, resulting in frequent disputes. If measures are not taken to solve this problem quickly, future disputes will inevitably be impossible to eliminate."

### The Doodles on the Walls of the Waiting Room Reveal the Anxiety and Depression of the Prisoners

[Special Feature by this Newspaper] The anxiety, unease, and extreme nervousness of a prisoner before trial cannot be avoided, even if he is a person of strong reason and calmness on weekdays. The great thieves who kill and loot, the habitual petty thieves, and the prisoners who have committed crimes of injury and fraud, when squeezed into a small waiting room, mostly face the wall, silent, or look up in a daze, muttering to themselves. Some desperately bite their cuffs or the corners of their clothes, and some unconsciously pat the plaster on the wall. In short, laughter and crying have never been heard in the waiting room, and of course there is no high-level discussion. They are all single-mindedly planning for themselves, and never want to know the details of other people's cases. On weekdays in prison, prisoners often yell and make noise, and are the most difficult to manage, but in the waiting room, they are all unusually quiet. Experienced judicial police all know this, so they unanimously believe that guarding the waiting room is the easiest and least troublesome job.

The criminal court of the North Zhejiang Road Local Court is attached with a waiting room, allowing prisoners brought from the detention center to rest here while waiting for trial. It is not a large room, with a small hole in the door and iron bars on the window. The walls and ceiling are all painted black. I can't figure out why it must be black, but the passers-by here, under the cramped and uneasy mood, can just use it as a blackboard, scraping off the plaster on the wall and scribbling on the wall to kill their longest and most impatient time. This can also vent their anxious emotions and relax their overly tense nerves. Their works, in addition to irrelevant words and sentences such as "Wang Agen, you have a good life!" "Today I came to this room...", the rest are irregular money strip patterns. From these murals, it clearly tells how anxious and uneasy, and how depressed the prisoners waiting for trial are. The bad emotions increase their destructiveness. Batches of prisoners come in and out, causing the holes and ugly murals on the black wall to constantly increase and expand.

Previously, in the waiting room of the Capital High Court, the reporter had talked with Lin Bosheng, who has now been executed by shooting. Although he pretended to have a calm smile, the muscles on his cheeks were constantly twitching. The old-fashioned traitor Yin Rugeng frantically waved his fan in the waiting room, but the weather was not too hot that day. Liu Hangxia, the thief of the "Four Famous Mountains," spoke eloquently in court, compiling a set of confessions in the waiting room, facing the corner of the wall. Maysber, the "Foreign Tiger," muttered to himself in the waiting room, looking like he was suffering from neurasthenia. These group portraits are indeed quite interesting, but the bailiffs never look inside again, they are used to it.

It is now divided into prenatal examination, gynecological examination, and infant and child health examination. The hospital plans to gradually expand, organize mothers' meetings, children's meetings, and add nurseries to meet social needs.

### The Beijing-Shanghai Express Train Actively Plans to Resume Operations, Starting with Engineering, and Striving to Achieve It Within the Year

### Reader Consultation, Legal Questions (1) Mutual Promise for Life

Jin Qiang asks: I have a girlfriend who is 19 years old. We have known each other for many years and have made a marriage pact. Her mother has already expressed her agreement, but the girl's father insists on opposing it. I have three questions. Please answer them. (1) If the mother decides alone and does not seek the father's consent to make the marriage pact, is it legally valid? (2) Does the girl, who is now 19 years old, have autonomy over her marriage? (3) If the girl's father firmly opposes, how should we deal with it?

[Lawyer Mi Xitong answers] (1) When a minor makes a marriage pact, the consent of the legal representative should be obtained. This is the provision of Article 974 of the Civil Code. If both parents are alive, the father should be the legal representative. (2) No. (3) There are two methods to solve it. A. While she is still a minor, ask a matchmaker to go to her father to intercede, or earnestly beg B. Wait until she is an adult, then according to the provisions of Article 972 of the Civil Code, she can make the marriage pact by herself.

(2) Redemption of Pawned Property

Chen Wenkang asks: In 1942, I was stationed in India with the army and lost contact with my family. When I returned home in August this year, I learned that my mother pawned the house to a Mr. Zhuang in March 1942 for 3,600 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, with a term of ten years. Because I have nowhere to live this time, I asked someone to redeem it from Mr. Zhuang. The other party demanded 14 shi of white rice, or 840,000 legal currency. Please ask: (1) Is Mr. Zhuang's request legal? (2) How should the pawn price of Central Reserve Certificates be converted? (3) Is there a standard for the cost of subsidies in the middle, and must it be converted with materials? (4) If Mr. Zhuang is unreasonable, how should we resolve it?

[Lawyer Mi Xitong answers] (1) It is not legal, but it depends on whether the calculation of his request is reasonable in human terms. (2) The government only stipulates the conversion of Central Reserve Certificates to national currency, and there are no other regulations. (3) According to local customs, there are no regulations. (4) You can apply to the court to resolve it.

Most of the materials for this prefabricated house have arrived, but the underlying floor equipment is missing. This has been shipped to Shanghai and will soon be transferred to Nanjing. The association believes that its area and capacity are only sufficient to separate four or five small rooms, which is insufficient for its needs. Guan Songsheng, chairman of the construction committee, and members Zhang Xinfu and Huang Shaoliang, have designed an additional building and started leveling the ground on the large open space on Jiange Road to build a one-story building. The prefabricated house will be placed on top, creating a two-story building for temporary use. Once sufficient funds are raised, expansion and necessary equipment will be added.

### Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs Issue Measures to Prevent Securities Speculation and Manipulation; Stock Exchange Requests Temporary Suspension; Du Yuesheng and Wang Shengxin Go to Beijing to Present Everything

[Report from our newspaper] The Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs have stipulated measures to prevent securities speculation and manipulation. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has received notification from the ministries. The exchange convened an extraordinary meeting of the executive council yesterday (Sunday) morning to discuss the matter. Chairman Du Yuesheng presided, with executive council members Xu Jilun, Zhuang Shuhao, Xu Weiming, Zheng Xiaozhou, and acting general manager Wang Zhixin present. As a result of the discussion, it was determined that the Shanghai securities market is currently stable, and the measures notified by the ministries do not seem necessary in the current situation, to avoid stimulating market prices. It was decided to request a temporary suspension of implementation. The exchange believes that if stock market fluctuations remain normal, without sharp rises or falls, it should be properly maintained to cultivate its function of developing the capital market, so that it can absorb idle funds as much as possible and channel them into productive avenues. This would not only benefit industry but also help stabilize prices. It was resolved to submit an explanation to the ministries, requesting a temporary suspension of implementation. Chairman Du and acting general manager Wang left for Beijing last night to meet with senior officials of the two ministries to present everything in person.

### Content of Preventive Measures

It is reported that the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs, in order to prevent securities speculation, are considering temporary measures for the Shanghai Stock Exchange, including: (1) appropriately shortening the deferred delivery period to five or four days; (2) appropriately shortening the stock price fluctuation limit, from 15% to 12% or 10%; (3) temporarily suspending the establishment of a large transaction counter; (4) brokers must pay earnest money for both buying and selling, all in cash; (5) preventing brokers from engaging in excessive buying and selling, the stock exchange may decide to levy special securities margins on both the selling and buying parties; (6) strictly prohibiting off-exchange trading and insider transactions.

### Reorganization of De Fu and Bayer Factories Still Without Progress

The De Fu and Bayer pharmaceutical factories liquidation office, after receiving orders to prepare for reorganization, has been delayed for months due to various reasons. It is understood that De Fu Yanghang itself has pigments in stock, estimated to be worth more than 5.5 million yuan. The inventory of Xiaoxiang Bank that has been cleared out is worth 200,000 yuan. Since the reorganization began, the pigments have not been distributed once. Recently, the market price of pigments has plummeted. If the office releases them again, it will affect the industrial market. The office intends to distribute them once more when the market price stabilizes. The office recently purchased a sodium sulfide plant in Qingdao, preparing it as a subsidiary factory after the reorganization, specializing in the production of sodium sulfide drugs. On the Bayer pharmaceutical factory side, it has distributed drugs twice during the reorganization preparation period. The factory's inventory is estimated to be worth more than 500,000 yuan. If the reorganization date is extended, the office also plans to distribute drugs again in the near future to avoid a shortage of medicines in the market.

### Wool Textile Industry Association Established: Raw Material Allocation Committee

[Report from our newspaper] The Limited Allocation Office of the Supervisory Commission has stipulated a wool import limit of US$1.4 million for February to April this year. This includes wool, wool tops, and wool yarn. The allocation targets include all Chinese and foreign privately-owned wool spinning mills nationwide. Therefore, the result of the limit allocation is less than one-tenth of the national factory needs. In view of this, the Chinese and foreign wool spinning industry established a Raw Material Allocation Committee for Wool at the city's Wool Spinning Industry Association at 4:00 PM the other day. Cheng Nianpeng, Tang Junyuan, Tang Weizhang, Wu Shandi, Chen Yuanqing, Lobaisen, Kaise Wei, and 15 others attended. After discussion, it was decided: (1) Regarding the allocation of raw materials, it is planned to investigate the actual operating needs of each factory to allocate raw materials accordingly. According to the investigation, there are about 80 wool spinning mills in Tianjin, Lanzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places (more than 50 in Shanghai). Currently, fine spinning raw materials require wool, coarse spinning raw materials require wool tops, and weaving machines require wool yarn. Wool yarn is the final product of wool tops and wool. Therefore, the US$1.4 million limit will be based on this relationship to determine the priority of allocation. (2) The regulations concerning required amounts: fine spinning spindles require 0.4 pounds of wool tops per spindle for a ten-hour workday. Coarse spinning spindles require 0.6 pounds. Knitting yarn spindles require 1.5 pounds. (3) It was decided that 45 wool tops would be calculated at 55 pence per pound, 64 wool tops at 125 pence, and 60 washed wool at 60 pence. The foreign exchange needed by each factory can be converted to US dollars based on this amount.

[Our Taiyuan Correspondent, 22nd] After the announcement of the Economic Emergency Measures Act, the price of commodities in the city entered a state of fatigue and hibernation. After the blow of the recovery of Yan'an and Xiaoyi, the key point of the west of Shanxi, on the 19th, people's hearts were apprehensive, and prices have continued to fall for days. Merchants are all frowning and sighing that it is difficult to maintain daily expenses and responsibilities. The gold and jewellery industry is particularly miserable. Gold jewelry cannot be sold because the black market price of gold bars is higher than the listed price. The sale of gold bars is strictly prohibited without a formal market, so only silver jewelry is sold, but buyers are scarce. More than half of the 26 stores have applied to close, and the rest are considering whether to close or change their business.

### China Tobacco Company: Overview of the Past Year

Highest Production Volume: 8,000 Boxes Per Month

[Report from our newspaper] China Tobacco Company was ordered to be established on January 9th of last year, and started work on January 11th of the same month. One year has now passed. The company currently has three factories, factories one and two each have 25 cigarette machines and can produce 3,500 boxes of cigarettes per month. Factory three has 15 cigarette machines. This factory is experimental in nature and produces more than 2,000 boxes per month. It is understood that the company's maximum monthly production can reach 10,000 boxes. However, because the facilities for leaf cigarettes and other departments were not balanced during the Japanese management period, it was busy reorganizing after the takeover. The highest monthly production was 8,000 boxes. The total production for the whole year last year was 55,336 boxes. The total sales volume was 53,534 boxes. Shanghai accounted for the majority of the sales area, with 16,440 and a half boxes. Other cities including Hubei, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, Hunan, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qingdao, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou also accounted for 37,093 and a half boxes. The sales amount was 23,748,145,000 yuan. The current estimated value of the company's total assets is approximately 318 billion yuan. Its products include Double Axe, Quanrong, and Compass. At the beginning of the company's establishment, to avoid competing with the people for profit, a consultant committee was specially set up, inviting Gu Shaoqing (Xucheng), Kuang Zhaoji (Nanyang), A. S. Grew (Yizhong), Zhang Zizhuang and Guo Kexi (Ministry of Economic Affairs) as members, so that they could offer many suggestions on the company's business.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Requests Allocation Committee to Approve Required Raw Material Quotas

The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association recently stated that its members urgently need dyes and chemical products. Since the implementation of import management, these goods have been decreasing daily. Those who hold goods manipulate prices, and market prices have soared, affecting production and increasing costs, making it difficult for industry to survive. The Limited Allocation Office of the Supervisory Commission previously only approved the import limit for February to April, but there are no regulations regarding the overall quantity. The association states that the dyeing and weaving industry is one of the national industries, and if there are no clear regulations on the import limits of required raw materials, factories will not be able to survive. Therefore, it has investigated the types and quantities needed each month, formulated reasons, and requested the allocation committee to quickly determine the quota allocation. The reasons and required product names are listed below:

Dyes and chemical products are necessary for dyeing, printing, and finishing projects in each member factory of the association. The consumption accounts for more than 80% of other industries. In the past, during the period of free import, the industry directly ordered from importers. Because the sources were smooth, there was no difficulty in adopting them. Since import restrictions, the bottom line in Shanghai has become thinner day by day, and actual sales have been strong, resulting in those who hold goods taking the opportunity to raise prices, making the industry's business scope greatly controlled. Such measures do not conform to the government's goal of supporting the national industry. If these main raw materials are further delayed and not determined, the needs of the industry will still be in the hands of importers, and the domestic dyeing and weaving industry will not have similar categories. Currently, for the cigarette industry and the wool spinning industry in the city, the Supervisory Commission has already stipulated the import limits for tobacco leaves and wool. According to the monthly production volume of each factory, their allocations are separately approved, and each factory is notified to directly sign contracts with importers. After the limited allocation office approves them, it issues import licenses. This measure is extremely appropriate. It can avoid the malpractice of taking the opportunity to raise prices and reduce the cost of industrial products. Now, the above-mentioned raw materials required by each member factory of the association should be treated equally and handled in accordance with precedents. The association has compiled the types and quantities of raw materials required each month and submitted them for rapid approval. It is requested that the quota be transferred to the association and distributed to each factory according to its output. The names of the required raw materials are as follows: (Dyes) vulcanized yuan, Shilin blue with Haichang blue, Naftol AS, Naftol salt and base, direct dyes with salt base, vulcanized dyes. (Raw material chemicals) caustic soda, soda ash, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, vulcanized alkali, bleaching powder, insurance powder, glacial acetic acid, sodium perborate, sodium nitrite, sodium hypochlorite, sodium red alum, aniline oil.

### Wool Arrival and Sales Volumes

[Report from our newspaper] A large quantity of wool has arrived. Merchants are taking advantage of the large quantity to purchase for export. Transactions are very lively. Shandong wool is 50,000 yuan per batch, Huzhou wool is 123,000 yuan for top-grade goods per dan, and 110,000 yuan for medium-grade goods.

### Industrial Raw Material Downturn

[Report from our newspaper] Industrial raw materials have been weak for nearly a month, and the ability to absorb them is still difficult to improve. Prices continue to decline. For foreign orders, the US restrictions on goods exports are more severe than before. According to market rumors, the head positions of many factories are suppressed by expensive items etc., and it is difficult to cut them off with painful resolution. Therefore, raw materials are not only unable to be absorbed, but existing raw materials are being sold to the raw materials market. Yesterday, caustic soda (American goods) fell to 3.6 million yuan per barrel. There are also many emerging goods, and there is still a downward trend. The price of insurance powder once rose to 2 million yuan per dan, but now 800,000 can buy it. The sales volume of soda ash is also low. Glycerin and styrene, the peak season is over, and market prices are still difficult to stabilize. Zinc oxide is still used in rubber factories and the paint industry, so the price still stands at a high price of 10 million per ton. Ammonium sulfate has issued frequent sales orders, and the price looks high.

### Central Government Discusses How to Use First Batch of Japanese Reparations Materials: China Can Obtain 1.35 Million Tons

[Report from our newspaper] The amount of the first batch of reparations from Japan and its allocation will be decided in the short term, and China will obtain 1.35 million tons. The central government has been discussing the budget for the use of this reparations material for a long time, but it has not made a final decision as of Song Ziwen's resignation. It is said that the regulations include 60 billion for freight and 300 billion for installation costs. The Real Estate Bureau is determined to make good use of the first batch of materials so that China can be in a favorable position when discussing total reparations in the future. The transportation of materials is not a problem, the difficulty lies in its use. According to an estimate by an expert, the cost of use needs to be more than 20 times the cost of freight. When the total compensation is implemented in the future, China can obtain at least 3 million tons of materials, and the number will be even greater if light industry is included. Therefore, the relevant authorities are now racking their brains and trying to raise this fund in various ways.

The old batch of dismantled reparations materials accounts for 30% of the total reparations, a decision made in August of last year. Regarding the implementation of the compensation process, there was a dispute between the Scientific and Economic Group and the Foreign Property Management Group within the Allied Headquarters. It has now been stipulated that the former is responsible for design and allocation, and the latter is responsible for execution, with the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters presiding. The first batch of dismantled materials does not include transportation, mining, or light industry. In fact, MacArthur's headquarters is quite encouraging the recovery of the Japanese textile and shipbuilding industries. For example, last spring, the headquarters invited representatives from Britain and India to inspect the Japanese textile industry and advocated that Japan should maintain a production capacity of 3.5 million spindles. In terms of ships, Japan currently has 1 million tons of seagoing vessels, but headquarters hopes that Japan will have 3 million tons and is trying to encourage its shipbuilding industry to recover. Based on Japan's existing equipment, it can build at least 350,000 tons per year.

The issue of Japan's total reparations is not simple and has not yet been discussed. The central issue of compensation is to determine the standard of living that Japan should have after the implementation of reparations. The Chinese delegation advocates 1914 and 1920, but the US holds different views and may decide on 1930 to 1934 in the future. The later it is, the greater the productivity and the more favorable it will be for Japan. The Allied Headquarters has two views: (1) hoping that Japan can become a self-sufficient country; (2) hoping that Japan can bear the military expenses. Therefore, it advocates leniency in the implementation of compensation.

### UNRRA Continues to Send Fishing Boats, 15 Vessels to Arrive in China

UNRRA, in order to assist in the revival of China's fishing industry, has granted China 83 new-style fishing boats, managed and operated by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). These boats are being prepared for lease. Yesterday, CRRRA received a telegram from UNRRA stating: UNRRA still has 36 new-style fishing boats that can be allocated to China for transport. Recently, Director General Rooks has approved the allocation of 15 to China, which have now set sail and will arrive soon. The remaining 21 vessels will arrive successively this summer.

### US$40 Million Ship Loan: US Reopens Negotiations with China, 159 Ocean Liners Available for Purchase

According to reliable sources in the shipping industry: The long-pending US$40 million ship loan from the United States to China has been revived and negotiations have resumed. This US$40 million can purchase 159 ocean liners of various sizes, totaling 810,000 tons. These include 32 ocean liners of over 10,000 tons, more than 20 of over 5,000 tons, and the remainder being over 3,000 tons. A formal agreement on this loan is expected by the end of April. Once these ships arrive in China, domestic passenger and cargo transportation capacity will be more than sufficient. The shipping industry is currently planning to form a joint company to manage these ships effectively, open domestic and international routes, and establish China's position in the international shipping industry, aiming to replace Japan's pre-war international position in shipping.

### China Salt Industry Corporation Established: Merger and Reorganization of Northeast and North China Companies, Total Salt Production Expected to Exceed 9 Million Dan This Year

The enemy's Northeast Salt Industry Company and North China Salt Industry Company have been taken over by officials dispatched by the Ministry of Finance. The takeover has been completed. The two organizations have been merged to form the China Salt Industry Corporation, with Yao Yuanlun as the General Manager. To facilitate business operations, four branch offices will be established in North China, Northeast China, Qingdao, and Taiwan. The branches in Tianjin (North China) and Shenyang (Northeast China) are being actively prepared. It is learned that the salt field area under the jurisdiction of the former North China Salt Industry Company is 96,000 mu in Dagu, 34,560 mu in Tanggu, 52,320 mu in Hangu, and 110,704 mu in Daqinghe, totaling 293,584 mu. Except for the Daqinghe salt fields, which cannot be restored due to unstable security, the remaining salt fields are planned to be fully reopened. The characteristics of the North China salt fields are: (1) The Dagu salt fields have been fully converted to permanent operation, using electric pumps to extract water. (2) The remaining salt fields are also large, continuous tracts of land with excellent water extraction equipment. The production volume this year is estimated at 7 million dan, accounting for half of the Changlu output. The salt field area owned by the Northeast Salt Industry Company is 48,512 mu in the Suizhong area, 125,760 mu in the Yingkou area, 65,792 mu in the Fuxian area, 10,624 mu in the Zhuanghe area, and 25,200 mu in the Jinzhou area, totaling 501,888 mu. Except for the Jinzhou area, which is still occupied by the Communist forces, the remaining salt fields are planned to be repaired and gradually reopened. These salt fields all use electric pumps to extract brine. If fully restored, the annual salt production could reach 20 million dan. With restoration just beginning this year, a production of 2.5 million dan is expected. 60% of the salt produced by these two companies was shipped to Japan, with the remainder sold domestically to regulate the food supply for the people.

### Hunan Manganese Powder Sells Well

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Hunan-produced manganese powder is of excellent quality and meets industrial needs. A large amount has arrived this year, and sales are widespread. Last year, due to poor transportation conditions, the cost of transporting each ton to Shanghai accounted for one-fifth of the price. Conditions are slightly better this year, so a steady supply is expected in the future. The current price for the best grade is 2 million yuan per ton, while lower grades range from 1.4 million to 1.6 million yuan. Transportation costs account for about 800,000 yuan per ton. The price of the top-grade product is 1 to 2 times higher than last year's price of 600,000 yuan per ton.

### Weasel Skins are Firm, Shanghai Bristles are Stable

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Tight supply for weasel skins has come from Europe, merchants are striving to buy, and market prices are becoming firmer. Yesterday's market price was 37,000 yuan per pair. Badger and sable skins also followed the upward trend. The New York market for weasel skins remains soft, with 18-inch skins priced at US$2.50 and 14-inch skins at US$1.15. Shanghai bristles are facing stock depletion, and the New York market is active. Exporters are frequently replenishing their stocks, and prices remain stable.

[Another Dispatch] Yesterday's market price for lake lambskins was 11,000 yuan per piece. It is reported that the New York market price is US$1.25 per piece, making exports profitable and transactions frequent.

### Cigarette Industry Sluggish

Labor and Management Gather to Discuss Solutions

Amid the general economic downturn in the city's industry and commerce, the crisis in the cigarette industry has become acute. Even foreign-owned cigarette factories cannot stem the tide. In addition to the largest foreign-owned Yizhong Cigarette Factory having completely ceased operations, the Huacheng Cigarette Company, a well-known domestic giant in the cigarette industry, has also implemented work reductions, operating for only five hours per day. Some cigarette factories are laying off workers to survive. Some small factories operate for only two hours per day, essentially being in a state of semi-shutdown. Therefore, if no countermeasures are taken to remedy this deteriorating situation, the number of unemployed workers will greatly increase. It is reported that the Production Promotion Association has scheduled a meeting today to bring together labor and management in the cigarette industry to discuss rescue measures.

### Shantou Drawn-Thread Work Industry: Over 30,000 People Have Resumed Work

Shantou drawn-thread work is a unique product of Guangdong Province. It involves drawing threads from fine cloth to weave various patterns and make handkerchiefs, tablecloths, bed sheets, and sleepwear, which are exported to Europe and the United States. Due to its exquisite craftsmanship, it is very popular and widely sold. Before the war, over 400,000 people in the Chaozhou region of eastern Guangdong relied on this industry for their livelihood. Due to wartime displacement, only over 30,000 people have resumed work. According to 1940 statistics, the annual output was valued at over 80 million yuan (US$2 million). Calculated at current prices, this would be 16.7 billion yuan. However, this year's output is unlikely to exceed 4.2 billion yuan. Furthermore, raw material costs are high and controlled by foreign merchants. The local government has considered implementing export incentives, but they have not been effective. Before the war, imported linen cloth was mostly used for drawn-thread work, but due to high costs, locally produced summer cloth is now mostly used. In the past, designs often followed traditional methods and lacked artistic value. If reforms can be made, and with government guidance to improve quality, the annual increase in income could be considerable.

### National Defense Iron Fence, Industrial Backbone: Anshan Iron and Steel Smelting City

— Special Dispatch from Shenyang, March 15th, by Our Northeast Correspondent, Han Qingtao

Anshan's iron and steel industry is the iron fence of China's national defense, the backbone of industry, and is even more connected to China's entire economic future. The central government has increasingly attached importance to it, as evidenced by the recent continuous investigations and strengthening of its reconstruction and production capacity.

In order to report the actual situation to the people of the country, I, as a reporter, made a special trip from Shenyang to Anshan and visited for three days. Three days was not enough to see the whole picture, but the scale is large enough. When I stepped into the steel plant, the first thing I saw was the cranes emitting steam, roaring back and forth, unloading the heavy, damaged objects next to the iron-smelting furnaces. Many workers were standing on two potentially repairable iron-smelting furnaces, hammering and welding, with "ding-dong" and "clang" sounds forming a chorus.

In the air inside the steel plant, huge electric cranes were running horizontally, moving or clearing debris. The rumbling sound vibrated the eardrums. A small rolling mill was burning many semi-finished steel bars. A red steel bar was hooked out, following the rotating axle, drilled into the rolling mill, went in, came out, and became a long snake, then followed the axle again into several rows of rolling mills. Skilled workers, with quick hands, rolled it into the desired shape. When I visited, they were rolling steel bars used in buildings.

In the machine factory, rows of lathes on the left and right were turning train axles. In another factory, a one-and-a-half-ton steam hammer and several larger ones were hammering the axles, thumping and thumping, making the steel dense and solid, and then sent to the lathe factory.

A iron foundry has an electric motor, grabbing a large iron pot, with a pot full of molten iron, moved left and right by pulleys, pouring iron juice, manufacturing wheels and hooks. The work is quite tense and busy.

The steel company now has ten departments: mining, ore dressing, ironmaking, chemical, steelmaking, steel rolling, power, transportation, labor, and heavy industry. It owns mining sites such as Gongchangling, Yingtaoyuan, and Dagushan. The ore dressing department has workshops for reduction, ore dressing, medium ore, sintering, and pelletizing. The ironmaking department has workshops for pig iron and granular iron. The chemical department has workshops for coal washing, coke, gas absorption, asphalt, sulfuric acid, xylene, and ammonium sulfate.

The steelmaking department includes steelmaking and ferroalloy workshops. The steel rolling department includes workshops for ingot casting, large shapes, first and second small shapes, medium plates, and thin plates. The power department has a power plant. The heavy industry department includes the medium steel plate workshop, iron casting workshop, steel casting workshop, machine workshop, cold working workshop, oxygen manufacturing workshop, analysis institute, construction engineering machinery section, and substation equipment, which were originally the "Okura Heavy Industries Co., Ltd." Truly a grand sight!

Among these departments, some are irreparable and need to await compensation from Japan. According to General Manager Shao Yizhou, "The Northeast can account for one-fifth of the national allocation of Japanese compensation, and Anshan can get 75,000 tons. The most urgent need is about 45,000 tons, and the remaining secondary need is about 30,000 tons, which can be urgently transported to Anshan!"

The repairable ones have already started working, starting to move, with electricity, fire, steam, and human power all mixed together. Everything is for reconstruction, for resumption of work, showing a bright future everywhere!

Iron and Steel Production Work

The iron plant originally had nine iron-smelting furnaces. In addition to those that were dismantled and destroyed, it is planned to repair the first and second furnaces (each furnace produces 400 tons per day), as well as all accompanying equipment, with a capacity of 280,000 tons per year.

Demolition and repair have recently been supervised. The clearing work of the damaged parts of each furnace has lasted for more than a month and has now been largely completed. The repair and installation work is now in progress.

The steelmaking department plans to repair three open-hearth furnaces, and prepare refining furnaces and mixing furnaces, as well as all accompanying equipment, with a capacity of 270,000 tons of steel ingots per year. In order to supplement the insufficient gas, four new gas furnaces are also being installed.

The steel rolling department plans to repair the ingot rolling machine, the first small steel rolling machine, the second medium steel plate rolling machine of the foundry, and all accompanying equipment, with a capacity of 500,000 tons of steel ingots per year. After the repair, it can produce 100,000 tons of medium-sized steel, 70,000 tons of small-sized steel, and 30,000 tons of medium-sized steel plates per year.

Shao Yizhou said: "The small steel rolling department has been in operation for some time. The semi-finished products—steel ingots—stored by the Japanese can be used until the end of May. The steelmaking department can start work in June, which can keep the steel rolling department working until the end of August. At that time, the first smaller iron-smelting furnace, which can produce 400 tons per day, can be repaired and start smelting iron, so the steel plant can continue, and the steel rolling plant will have no worries about raw materials!"

Successful Processing of Poor Ore

The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant's utilization of poor ore is a major feature. From an economic point of view, the poor ore processing procedures are more numerous and the cost may be a bit higher, but because the mining costs of rich ore tunnels are higher, poor ore saves labor. For example, the Dagushan mine south of Anshan is a good example of poor ore mining. As a result, the cost of poor and rich ore is almost equal, so the Japanese once boasted to the world about the success of their "Anshan-style poor ore processing method."

The ore dressing plant is the main base for processing poor ore. The processing steps are to crush the ore into powder, the magnet absorbs the iron powder, and then the concentrated magnetic iron powder is burned into ore. As a result, manpower is used to turn poor ore into rich ore.

Unfortunately, the machines in the ore dressing plant have been almost completely destroyed. Most of the parts need to be supplied from abroad, and the gas is insufficient, so the repair will take a long time. Therefore, at present, it is only limited to sorting and storage work.

Before the ore dressing plant is repaired, the raw materials required for the first phase of the ironmaking plan will be supplied by high-quality iron ore produced from the Gongchangling, Yingtaoyuan (northeast of Anshan), and Xiaofangshen mines. The planned annual output of Gongchangling mining is 450,000 tons (for ironmaking and open-hearth furnace). Because the size of the iron ore used in the iron-smelting furnace is 50 to 10 mm, the mine focuses on repairing the ore crushing equipment.

The by-product powder ore is planned to be made into pellet ore in a part of the pellet ore plant in the ore dressing plant to supply the iron-smelting furnace. Fluorite, manganese ore, limestone, dolomite, and magnesite are planned to be used from existing materials, so the mines will not be repaired for the time being. Only the first-grade silica, because there is not much existing material and it is needed earlier, is planned to be repaired in the Jin-Rehe area and the Jilin area.

In addition to repairing all the necessary equipment for ironmaking and steelmaking and mining equipment, the company's first phase of the plan also verified the amount of existing materials in other medium and small factories, the supply and demand situation in China, and the extent of repair, and formulated a part of the factories to be prioritized for resumption of work.

The Sorrow of the Coking Plant

The coking plant is a very large plant. In order to prompt Japan to surrender as soon as possible, the Allied B-29 heavy bombers flew from Chengdu to Anshan to drop bombs several times. Some bombs fell to the east of the railway, and some hit the coking furnaces in the coking plant. The coking furnaces were partially destroyed.

The coking plant bears the heavy responsibility of all coking, and is executed by three plants: coal transportation, coal washing, and coking furnace. It also has by-product departments to recover by-products from the gas, and uses this by-product to process and manufacture chemical products. It also has a gas office to use the surplus gas to supply the residents of Anshan City.

Before the coal coking plant was taken over, it suffered heavy losses. All the coal transportation and coal washing equipment had been destroyed. If other equipment can be repaired, it can still restore the production capacity of 1,000 tons of coke per day.

The plant has formulated a phased resumption plan. The goal of the first phase of the resumption plan is to produce 250,000 tons of lump coke and 50,000 tons of powder coke per year, and produce by-product chemical products. It has been actively implemented since October 1946, and it is expected that mining can be started in phases this month. It is stipulated that the first phase of the resumption work will be completed four months after mining begins.

Second phase of the resumption plan: The goal of this phase is to produce 500,000 tons of coke and by-product chemical products per year, which is expected to be completed in one year, and then the third phase of work will begin. The goal of the third phase is to produce 2 million tons of coke and by-product chemical products per year.

When I visited the coking plant, I walked up to the coking furnace, stepped into the chemical room, and leaned against the cooling absorption tower, as if walking in a large forest, like "Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden," feeling gloomy and terrible, and also feeling small. I kept asking the factory director and Mr. He, who enthusiastically explained and guided us.

The coke and gas for steelmaking and steelmaking, as well as chemical products, completely rely on this coking plant, but transportation in the Northeast is difficult. In the past, a coal train would run in every two hours day and night, but now a coal train may not come in 20 hours.

After repeated requests from the Assets Committee, the Northeast Headquarters is also making its best efforts and decided to supply 510,000 tons of lump coal from Fushun and other fields to the Anshan Coking Plant and other places this year. It is estimated that there will be 38,000 tons in March, a little more in April, and even more in May. The plant is praying for a solution to transportation, otherwise everything will be over.

The Northeast needs stability, and Anshan needs stability even more. In instability, the work of heavy industry cannot be carried out, and at the same time, I am afraid that the tragedy will be staged again. According to the person in charge of the steel company, "If the communist army had not entered Anshan twice in May last year and destroyed the steel plant, then ironmaking and steelmaking could have started long ago. By today, there must be many achievements. If there is another decisive destruction, then everything will be irreparable!"

Everything is for Industry

The nine iron-smelting furnaces of the iron plant, the rows of chimneys of the steel plant, the cooling absorption tower of the coking plant, the wide-mouthed cooling tower of the power plant, and the tall gas storage tanks, are huge and towering into the sky, forming a spectacular sight. On the flat ground and high hills, there are large and small factory buildings of unknown number, occupying a large area, making the surroundings appear unusually small.

We saw the railways surrounding the iron factory and Anshan, some leading to the mining area, and some going to and from other raw material production sites. The fork roads for unloading and loading are even as dense as spider webs. If the railways owned by these steel plants themselves are connected together, the total length can be 438 kilometers. In addition, there are 170 kilometers of military railway lines, which are not included. The factory area is truly grand enough.

During the day, heat is flying, black smoke is lingering, filling the sky, and the molten iron flowing out of the iron furnace, with red light, is blazing and shining with sparks, cutting through the darkness. Great, beautiful, and moving! Southeast of Anshan, the hills are overlapping, and a little further away there are mountains of various heights, which is the famous "Qianshan" scenic spot in southern Liaoning. To the northwest is a vast plain, bordering the ancient capital of Liaoyang in the north, and the famous "Tanggangzi" hot spring in the south.

Anshan City is a famous heavy industrial city, and the city scene is special. It is very clear that everything is for the steel plant. The main components of the city streets are the residences of the steel plant and other factory employees, as well as institutions for the employees' livelihood, recreation, and medical care.

A long Zhongchang Road divides the area into east and west regions. The eastern one is the Tiedong District, and the western one is called the Tiexi District. In the Tiexi District, except for a few large residences for Japanese workers in the empty places, the rest are all the residences and shops of our compatriots.

The residents in this area are either factory employees or their families, or some merchants who indirectly rely on the factory employees for their livelihoods. There is a wide street running east-west, reaching the western suburbs, and there are also many vertical and horizontal streets, which are generally considered neat.

Steel Industry Zone

The northwest of the Tiexi District is the location of steel and other heavy industries. On a dirt hill, several rows of black factory buildings like corridors are covered, undulating with the mountains, forming a spectacular sight. That is the ore dressing plant, where the world-famous "Anshan-style poor ore processing method" is processed.

Walking north along the asphalt road, a row of white buildings blocks the way. That is what the residents call the "White House," which used to be the office of the Showa Steel Works and is now the office of the Steel Company of the Assets Committee. Passing the White House and turning the corner are the nine iron-smelting furnaces of the steel plant, standing there like giants. To the west is the location of the power plant, and the cooling towers and gas storage towers are also huge. Behind a row of chimneys is the steel plant. The coking plant is to the east and west, and the scale is even larger. The construction is very special. All the coke and gas used by the factories are supplied here.

Further north. Various heavy industrial factories stand in great numbers. In the past, they were the factories on the periphery of the steel plant, but now they are completely included within the steel company, extending all the way to Lishan Station.

In this area, there are trains and trams, as well as cars, connecting every distant place. It used to be tense and busy, but now it is not so convenient and not so tense.

Blessing to Stand Up Again

The Tiedong District is a special area. In the past, in the eyes of the compatriots living in Tiexi, it was a noble and mysterious place. Because there was no place for our compatriots here. The Japanese simply did not allow our compatriots to enter the Tiedong District.

Look, the beautiful small western-style houses are surrounded by spire-shaped pine and cypress trees, and some are planted with small, low shrubs, or rows of tall poplars that pierce the sky and form a lane. There are no walls and no wooden fences. Walking here is like visiting a beautiful garden.

Standing on the top of the "Yingbingguan" (Guest House) building at the east end, you can see the eastern suburbs and the mountains far and near. The south side is also very good. So today, many people who come to Anshan say in unison: "This is a very ideal and beautiful paradise!"

The Japanese authorities called the senior Japanese in the steel plant and other factories to live in this beautiful environment and enjoy themselves as much as possible, so that they would be grateful and do their best to work for the factory. Another reason, perhaps, is to say: the "children of God" are unusual.

Now, although it is covered with white snow and the houses are somewhat damaged and empty, it has not been able to erase and conceal its beauty.

Anshan was originally a desolate grassland. After the railway was opened, people gradually settled here, and later it developed into an industrial city. Now the area of Anshan City is 123,247,300 square meters.

The Japanese, in view of the sharp increase in population and the continued upward trend of various industries, formulated a large urban plan, dividing parts of Liaoyang and Haicheng into it. The total area is 459,500,000 square meters, but before it could be realized, it was destroyed due to the urgency of the war.

After the restoration, the Anshan Municipal Government was established on April 10, 1946. The population plummeted from 280,000. First, more than 70,000 Japanese withdrew. Because the factories could not be fully started, some workers left Anshan. At present, there are at most 200,000 people.

The municipal government's finances are very difficult. In 1946, there was a shortage of more than 37 million circulating bills. The administrative expenses budget for 1947 is 200 million circulating bills. It is estimated that at most 80 million circulating bills can be collected from land tax and local tax. Now the administrative staff and teachers have not been paid for three months. The person in charge of the municipal government said: "During the puppet Manchukuo period, the national treasury and the steel plant provided subsidies to the municipal administrative expenses. The current order is that tax items cannot be increased, and there is no way to close the financial sources. A clever woman cannot cook without rice. As for construction, it is even more out of the question!"

The primary and secondary schools in Anshan are still in a very difficult situation and are being destroyed. They are planning to restore them. The steel and steel plants are even more devastated and are being rebuilt. I wish this iron capital of China a speedy recovery of health and stand up again in the Northeast!

### Look at This Clean Land of Guangxi

— Dispatch from Guilin, August 8th, by Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong

For a series of days, the sky here has been frighteningly gloomy. At midnight, the storms swept the sky, chilling people to the bone, often suggesting the destruction of the sun, landslides, and tsunamis... It's mid-March, and we still haven't seen the trees sprouting new buds. Who knows when the scenery of a dormant field will wake up?

At the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Guangxi Provincial Party Department, Chairman Huang candidly pointed out in his policy report: "All reconstruction work in Guangxi is only in the planning stage." Natural disasters and wars have made everything lag behind by who knows how many years. To realize the plan, to restore the weather, we must look up and hope that God will bless us not to have another disaster, and hope that the central government will give us a few more coins; looking down, we must hope that the people can endure unparalleled suffering, and hope that the officials will be less "hands-on," and then everything will be possible. From a political point of view, Guangxi is still a clean land. Even if there are two more Mao Zedongs, it is still as Mr. Huang Xuchu said: "Guangxi has no so-called 'liberated area,' which is clear proof of political stability." To ensure that this proof is always a proof, the provincial government is printing a comprehensive policy program, reminiscent of the eight large characters "Build Guangxi, Revive China" that were raised high into the clouds ten years ago. However, the people are much more thoughtful!

Special Envoy Liu Visits Guilin: Talking About His Impressions of This Trip

Mr. Liu Wendao, with a mandate from the central government, came to Guilin. In addition to enjoying all kinds of the highest honors (it is rare to see one or two specially appointed officials visiting Guangxi all year round, so it is no wonder that it is so grand), he stayed for ten days. After the entertainment, the reporter asked about his impressions of Guangxi. Special Envoy Liu unhesitatingly read: "The people of Guangxi are diligent, thrifty, capable, lively and energetic, the social order is stable, and they are led by wise leaders. The future must be extremely bright!" When asked about his opinions on building Guangxi, Mr. Liu smiled and said: "Guangxi already has very good construction plans, and there is no need for more opinions." The vast sky made the people of Guangxi couldn't help but be excited. Now, Mr. Liu is about to return by plane. In the hearts of the small citizens of Guilin, there is only one thought: They are all thinking, "The central government will definitely understand our suffering from now on."

Air Transport One Mile: Needs Eight Angles of US Dollars

From the ground to the sky, the sky of Guangxi is lively enough. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) Air Transport Brigade has stations in Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, carrying passengers and cargo. It costs eight angles of US dollars for one mile. It costs more than one million to go to Nanjing, so the retail sales are quite sluggish. It is currently being improved. After the improvement, the number of people flying around will increase, and even the calmest place will be a little better.

Looking in four directions, it feels like there is a new life waiting to grow everywhere. However, how to clear the clouds and see the blue sky still awaits the efforts of those who are interested.

### Unemployed Technicians Call for Enrollment

Dear Editor: I am an unemployed worker, 22 years old this year, from Wuxi, Jiangsu. During the Anti-Japanese War, I fled to Guiyang with my brother. A friend introduced me to the Salt Bureau to study mechanical repair for two years, and I worked at the Huasheng Company in Kunming for two years. When the Anti-Japanese War ended, I resigned and returned home. I have now learned that the Mechanical Management and Communications Office of the Highway Bureau is recruiting 100 people: (1) junior high school graduates or those who can drive, (2) junior high school graduates or senior elementary school graduates with two years of repair experience. I think I meet the second item, so I immediately applied. However, on the day of the exam, the authorities said that I must take English and algebra. May I ask, how can a senior elementary school student have this ability? Is it necessary to be so strict to learn driving skills? Therefore, I urge the Highway Bureau to take care of unemployed technicians and relax the enrollment path. (Wu Bogou)

Reply by Mail to Zheng Fei: Regarding your letter pointing out that there are often shortages and damages in Shanghai-Xuzhou intermodal parcel transport, we have received a letter from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, saying: "After checking the sections mentioned in the original letter, because the location, date, and parcel ticket number are not accurate, and the shortage and damage were not declared to the arrival station when picking up the goods, it is impossible to investigate thoroughly. In addition to instructing our subordinates to pay attention in the future, and writing to the Jinpu Railway to pay attention to improvement, we hereby reply." Please contact them.

### On the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (NRRA) Joint General Meeting on Social Welfare Work and Review of the NRRA's Emergency Relief and Welfare Work in the Past Year (Part 1)

— Liu Dewei, Zhan Dehou

A few days ago, the UNRRA and NRRA jointly convened a social welfare work meeting, inviting the Ministry of Social Affairs, national social affairs departments/bureaus, national public and private welfare organizations, and social work professors to participate. Over two hundred representatives from all walks of life frankly shared their vivid work experiences and earnestly discussed the future work directions and steps. This move is indeed an unprecedented grand event in China's social welfare work field. The meeting included social welfare work designers, administrators, field workers, and scholars. In short, they are professionals who take increasing people's welfare as their own duty. It is hoped that they will firmly remember that this profession is sacred, and they must not make the mistake of being jealous of each other during the discussion. At this time when the people are in deep suffering, how to cherish the opportunity and not let this meeting become an empty spectacle, but let it generate an epoch-making force is very important.

In addition to placing high hopes on this meeting, we need to look back at the NRRA's welfare work. What has it given us this year? This type of work is generally divided into two major categories: one is direct relief, and the other is welfare for children and the elderly.

The so-called direct relief refers to the scope of relief and assistance that can be obtained without any cost or labor. Naturally, it is limited to the recovered areas, and the targets are poor refugees.

The biggest problem in carrying out direct relief work is determining the targets. In this country where most people only have the distinction between the very poor and the less poor, who can you say does not need relief? Impoverished public school teachers and cultural figures are good at organizing themselves to put pressure on various branch offices to demand relief, while poor ordinary people are scattered and unorganized, and have needs but no way to express them. Therefore, in the initial stage, it is inevitable that the poor masses who need relief more will not receive relief. The general office had no choice but to narrow the target of the so-called "poor people" to the following five categories: (1) Refugees who have just been sent back to their hometowns (young and strong people who return to their hometowns will receive direct relief for one month), (2) Poor widows and orphans, (3) Poor and helpless children under the age of sixteen, (4) Poor and helpless people over the age of sixty, (5) Poor and disabled people. These five points are the standards set by the NRRA for direct relief targets. It draws the bottom line of poverty. Those below this level are people who cannot survive without relief. It is said that it is difficult to open the door to charity, and the more you help, the more people need help. In fact, before there was a relief method, the number of people who needed relief was no less than it is now. It's just that there wasn't a standard to distinguish them from the general public. Therefore, we are always ignorant and don't know how poor our country's people are. This standard tells us that there are many people who are breathing their last breath below the level of survival.

The reasons for the poverty of these people are international, political, and social, not the initiative of any individual. Therefore, the responsibility for curing their poverty lies on the shoulders of the United Nations and the government. However, when the UNRRA's supplies stop, it will be the end of the NRRA's days. However, the needs of the people below this level still exist, and the government's responsibility to them is unavoidable. We deeply understand that foreign aid cannot be relied on for long. It is time for the government to make huge annual budgets to plan welfare for the people of the whole country.

The second major problem in doing direct relief work is how to find and recognize the set targets. There are two methods, one is active and the other is passive. The former is to organize work teams. Each branch office organizes several work teams according to the severity of the disaster in its jurisdiction and the nature of the area, divided into three types: stationed, fixed, and mobile. This is the most common method used by branch offices. There are currently 269 emergency relief work teams, with the Hunan branch office having the most, with 154 teams. The remaining branch offices have between 4 and 25 teams. The work teams distribute supplies directly to the refugees in principle, but because China is vast and populous, the NRRA must cooperate with the original local authorities. One is to save manpower and financial resources for the NRRA, and the other is to strengthen local permanent agencies. Therefore, local public and private social service organizations and autonomous institutions are often invited to participate in the work or invited to organize local relief associations. All procedures for application, registration, and review are mostly handled by local institutions because local people are familiar with local conditions. The distribution of supplies is still the responsibility of the work team. It cannot be said that the NRRA did not take great pains in this method.

In this active method, there is another distribution method that we are all interested in, that is, in some villages, the work team asks the villagers to send representatives to a meeting to vote for the names of those who need relief the most. Then, the work team distributes supplies to those who receive the most votes according to the amount of existing supplies. This method is the fairest, fastest, and most direct.

The passive method is to divide the city into districts, and set up individual relief application stations in each district, using the local social affairs bureau or office as a central registration station to avoid duplication through connections. Because the area is vast and there is a lack of talent, it is inevitable that there will be omissions in the investigation of those who need relief, or that the period for distributing supplies has passed and they cannot receive relief. Therefore, individual relief stations are set up for people to apply directly to the station without submitting documents or entering government offices. Branch offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong, and Hebei have all used this method to provide individual living allowances or loans to purchase agricultural tools for self-reliance. The Nanjing office cooperates with institutions such as the Social Service Office and the Social Service Department of the Central Hospital to set up five stations in different districts, and also mobilizes students from Jinling Women's University and the University of Nanking who are taking social case work courses to participate in the investigation work at each station. This can be said to be the first time that Chinese government agencies have adopted the method of case work.

(The conclusion will be continued tomorrow)

Tangshan Builds a Moat Around the City: 8 Kilometers Long, 4 Meters Deep

Tangshan is an important town in eastern Hebei, with many factories and the center of the Beining Railway. Since the victory, the Communist army has repeatedly planned to attack. Recently, the eastern Hebei pacification zone, in order to seek a permanent solution to Tangshan's security, in addition to establishing a city defense headquarters to closely monitor the activities of the Communist army, it is also planning to dig a moat around the city so that the Communist army cannot launch a surprise attack. After active discussions by all parties, this plan was implemented on the 15th of this month. It is expected that the moat will be 8 kilometers long, 8 meters wide, and 4 meters deep, with water introduced into the river to a depth of 2 meters. The first batch requires 150,000 workers, mobilizing people from all levels of the city, including public officials, teachers, students, citizens, workers, and police, who take turns working every day until the entire project is completed. On the first day of construction, the reporter rushed to the construction site to inspect. All military and political leaders of Tangshan personally directed the work. By noon, a section of the foundation with a length of 600 meters and a depth of 2 feet had been dug. There were more than 5,000 workers on that day. According to the person in charge who told the reporter: This project will take about two months to complete, and from then on, Tangshan's security will be safe and sound.

### Fuzhou Lacks Culture: The Book and Newspaper Industry is Declining

— Fuzhou News on the 12th, Special Reporter Chen Zhengyu of this newspaper

Two weeks ago, due to the impact of the gold rush, the Fuzhou market was very chaotic, and all prices soared in a whirlwind. The rise in the cost of living, coupled with the increase in foreign exchange, caused the price of newsprint to rise to 200,000 yuan at its highest point. Although it has fallen slightly now, it still requires 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. In addition, labor costs are also trending upwards, and the Fuzhou book and newspaper industry is facing an unprecedented crisis.

There are currently six daily newspapers and one evening newspaper in Fuzhou. In the past, about two broadsheets were published daily by the Central Daily News and the Fujian Times, one broadsheet was published daily by the Southern Daily, the Justice News, and the Democratic News, and one quarto sheet was published daily by the Cui News and the Minhai Evening News. After the consolidation, the Central Daily News and the Fujian Times publish about a broadsheet a day, and the rest can only maintain one sheet. The largest circulation is the Central Daily News, which sells five to six thousand copies a day, and the rest sell two to two thousand copies or one thousand copies. Various newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai have sales in Fuzhou, such as the Nanjing Central Daily News, the Shanghai Shen Xin, Dagong, Southeast, and Wenhui. Among them, Shen Xin, Dagong, and Southeast have more readers. Many local people in Fuzhou are old readers of this newspaper for more than ten years, and they have a deep impression and good criticism of this newspaper.

There are a total of thirteen bookstores in Fuzhou. In addition to a few such as Commercial Press and World Bookstore selling textbooks, most of them sell Shanghai edition books and periodicals. In this year, people who want to read have no money to buy books, and people who have money simply don't think about buying books. Therefore, there are many people reading books in bookstores, but few people buying books. Every bookstore relies on dragging accounts to get by. Large-scale bookstores like "Zhizhi" and the longer-established "Lida" bookstore only have a daily business income of two to three hundred thousand yuan. Lengthy and massive books are priced too high and no one cares about them. Only magazines sell a little, and the ones with good sales are "Digest," "World Knowledge," and "Zephyr." In addition, the magazine "Home" also sells well, probably because everyone always uses "Home" to warm themselves.

When it comes to the publishing industry, we can't help but feel that Fuzhou lacks culture. During the war, the "Improvement Publishing House," "Lida Bookstore," and "Joint Compilation Store" located in Yong'an were the hubs of Southeast culture. These publishing institutions did indeed gather a lot of talent and produced some high-quality literary works, which made immortal achievements for the culture of the Southeast Theater. Now, talents have scattered, high prices have stifled the publishing industry, and most magazines have ceased publication. The only ones that exist, such as Fujian Agriculture published by the Provincial Research Institute and Fujian Education published by the Provincial Department of Education, are mostly general discussions. Fuzhou can hardly talk about publishing!

### I Live in Tang Bohu's Former Residence

— Xiang Peiliang

"Heartless as a swallow or a goose, chasing after the fallen reeds on the west bank of Taihu Lake. A few desolate peaks, discussing the twilight rain. By the Fourth Bridge, I want to live with Tian Sui. Where are they now! Leaning on the railing to remember the past, the willows dance gracefully." (Dian Jiang Chun, Two Songs by Jiang Baishi).

Although Jiang Baishi was in the Southern Song Dynasty, it was still a good era. He could look at the lake and clouds from afar, watch the swallows and geese, savor the desolate dusk, and long for the former residence of the ancient poet Lu Guimeng, still vaguely present in the graceful willow branches. It seems that there would be no children's cries, the shock of beating tin foil, or the lonely cries of peddlers to disturb his mind.

I now live in Tang Bohu's former residence, a dilapidated old temple, the Zhunti Nunnery in Taohuawu, Suzhou. I have more than a dozen neighbors, almost all of whom are Shaoxing people who beat tin foil. Although I can't quite figure out their surnames, I have a very good friendship with them. This world is not as good as ideal, but it is not as bad as propaganda.

This is a house with more than 400 years of history. The earliest year is 1505, the year before Columbus died, the eighteenth year of Hongzhi of Emperor Xiaozong of the Ming Dynasty. There is a stele of Tang Bohu. The construction of the house must have been earlier. The original scene is impossible to imagine. The monks told me that the address of the nunnery was very large in the past, facing the river in the front and the Pagoda Shadow Pond (now blocked) and the Double Lotus Pond (this place name still exists today) in the back, covering an area more than ten times larger than today. Peach trees were planted extensively in the past, so it was called Taohuawu (Peach Blossom Dock). However, among the trees, peach blossoms have the shortest lifespan. Before it turned into mulberry fields, it had already disappeared. It has now become several rather desolate streets.

After Tang Bohu's death, he donated his house to become a temple, which has been passed down without interruption. Three Ming Dynasty sages are enshrined in it. The earliest was Jin Wang, with the courtesy name Zishang, who served as the prefect of Suzhou in the early Ming Dynasty. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty was still angry because the people of Suzhou stubbornly defended Zhang Shicheng, and imposed very heavy taxes. Jin Wang requested tax reduction, which angered him and he was killed. By the time of Emperor Xuanzong, the prefect Kuang Zhou requested a tax reduction, which was approved. Later generations missed Jin Wang and built a shrine for him. There is a stele inscription by Yang Xiangzhen from the eighth year of Tongzhi, but that text does not explain from what time Jin Prefect was enshrined in the house in Shanghai.

The latest one was Yang Tingshu, with the courtesy name Weidou, from the Fushe Society at the end of the Ming Dynasty, who died in martyrdom when the country was destroyed. There is an existing carved stone portrait of Lord Yang Zhongjie (Zhongjie was a posthumous title given by friends), with an image eulogy by Wang Yu: "Weinan has the Big Dipper, giving birth to a great man. Reading the books of sages and becoming a loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty, he first braved the disaster of the eunuchs. He helped the capital, and his name was high in the Fushe Society. His lofty integrity is the most rigorous in virtue. He is a model for scholars in the southeast and a model of Confucianism. His position is humble but his virtue is revealed, and his Tao is consistent. He is like Lin Zong of the Han Dynasty and Yuan Yan of the Jin Dynasty. When the Central Plains was torn apart, he generously supported himself. He asked for the task and worked on the plan. Soon after the land fell into ruins, he was quickly overthrown. He killed himself to achieve benevolence, calmly and unhurriedly. Xiang Xian Boqi followed in the footsteps of Wen Tianxiang, shining through the ages, and his aura filled the two realms. Ji Shao's clothes were red, and Chang Hong's blood was green. We look at the posthumous portrait together and pass it on without end." The image eulogy was written in the fifty-second year of Kangxi, which is also more than 200 years ago. After the large former residence of Tang Bohu was converted into a temple, some local gentry also attached themselves to it, so there are relics of Lord Jin and Lord Yang.

Tang Bohu's true work is a grinding stone, engraved with his own long poem. The original stele is still there, but it is mostly blurred and not very readable. There is another stele recarved during the Daoguang period, and the writing and size are all modeled after the original stele. The poem "Maple Bridge Night Mooring" by Zhang Ji written by Wen Zhengming that I saw at Hanshan Temple is also mostly blurred, with only a few characters intact. The stele inscribed by Qianlong at Dengwei Xiangxuehai has no characters at all. Although the climate is humid and the stele is easy to peel off, no one preserves the historical sites in the cultural land of the southeast, and everything is allowed to wear away naturally in the endless wind and rain. The long poem is as follows:

"Taohuawu, the Peach Blossom Nunnery, in the Peach Blossom Nunnery lives a peach blossom immortal, the peach blossom immortal plants peach trees, and plucks branches to exchange for wine money. When I wake up from the wine, I just sit in front of the flowers, and when I am drunk, I still sleep under the flowers. Day after day in front of and behind the flowers, year after year drunk and sober. I am unwilling to bow to carriages and horses, but I wish to die old among flowers and wine. Carriages and horses are for those who toil, and wine cups and flower branches are for the poor. If you compare wealth and nobility to poverty, one is on the ground and the other is in the sky; if you compare poverty to carriages and horses, they can gallop and I can be free. The world laughs at me for being too crazy, and I laugh at the world for not seeing through it. Remember that there is no wine or flowers on the graves of heroes like Wang Ling, and they are plowed into fields." At the end is written "Sixth Day of the Third Month of Hongzhi Yichou, written by Rujiushi".

During the Qianlong period, the nunnery was abandoned and became the forest garden of the powerful. Shen Jiyou visited this place and discovered Tang Bohu's tomb (a few dozen steps northeast of the current nunnery, in a place called Tang Yin's tomb, but the site of the burial cannot be found). He told Song Shouzhong about it, and Song donated money to repair the tomb. Shen Jiyou wrote four seven-character quatrains, and the stone carvings are still there.

(1) "The desolate path and mossy stele are two hundred years old, and I accidentally talked about the desolate grave mound. The Zhongcheng is a romantic master, and he takes pity on the little robbery immortal of peach blossoms."

(2) "Revisiting has built a few thatched huts, and the fine water embankment is divided like a swallow's tail. It is good to bury the bones in a dock of red fragrance, and many spring outings go to the tomb of the top scholar."

(3) "Ashamed to be a mediocre official, Tang Liu's remaining ink is more precious than pearls. How can his family lack a tall tomb? The fragrance kills the talented jade ball."

(4) "I should know that I am also drifting, and the fairy grass is sad as if it has a soul! Buy all the scarlet wine of Wu girls, and pour it to you in the nether world."

A former residence with 400 years of history. There are virtuous magistrates who died in their duties, famous scholars who despised wealth, and scholars who refused to submit to foreign races and closed their eyes forever. These are all the most precious legacies of our culture. Their relics include Tang Jushi's handwriting and Yang Zhongjie's portrait. Now they are all scattered in the old temple that is gradually collapsing and have become a place for the army to raise horses. As for me, after nine years of running around, I have finally settled down. As long as I don't have to hide from air raid alarms every day and don't have to carry my children to cross 5,000-meter high mountains, I am satisfied with everything and don't bother to ask where I will be next year. I rarely have time to imagine Tang Jieyuan's romantic life, so I can't write good lines for this place. Perhaps there are still good-natured "romantic masters" like Song Muzhong in this era, but I have no way to meet them and cannot ask them to relieve the small disaster for the sages hundreds of years ago. Late at night, I have not fallen asleep, listening to the shocking sound of the tin foil-beating women who refuse to rest, and I feel a little nostalgic. I dare not despise wealth like Liu Rushi, but I dare not forget the spirit of Lord Yang Zhongjie who refused to seek wealth in any way. I envy the good times of the past, but I still resolutely live on in this era.

Behind the house, in a small gap, there is a small peach tree, which should be the remaining species after thousands of robberies. It is almost full spring, and it is about to bloom. At that time, I want to pick a branch and put it on my desk, accompanied by a few strands of willow, and reread the sentences of Baishi Daoren.

### Yan Liu Ci Hua (Discussions on Lyrics with Swallows and Willows)

— Along

Wei Zhuang, with the courtesy name Duanji, was from Duling. He was once sent to Shu by Emperor Zhaozong. The lord of Shu, Wang Jian, seized his beloved concubine. Zhuang was filled with emotion and wrote a song called "Lotus Leaf Cup." "I remember that year under the flowers, late at night, when I first met Miss Xie, on the west side of the water hall, holding hands in secret. Regretting the remaining moon and dawn warblers, parting, and from then on, we are separated. Now we are all strangers in different places, and there is no way to meet again." Later, this poem was seen by the concubine, who stopped eating and died.

### Introduction to "Mountain Living Sketches"

— Wang Jinshan

Since entering Sichuan in the summer of the twenty-seventh year, until the end of this year (the thirty-fourth year), I have always lived in the mountains. "The waters of the Shu River are green, and the mountains of Shu are blue." Watching the flowing clouds and listening to the flowing water, it has been six or seven years. Over these years, I have not been willing to be lonely, and I have done some dreaming in bits and pieces. When the mood came, I scribbled and wrote some things.

It is said that since ancient times, articles have been divided into those that express aspirations and those that carry the Tao, and there is also the saying of "great words are flaming, small words are verbose." Thinking about what I have written, it is certainly insufficient to carry the Tao, and it may not be true to express aspirations; great words and small words are also beyond my reach. Although what I say is what I want to say, and what I write is what I want to write; I have not only not measured the merits and demerits, but also rarely calculated the remuneration; some have been taken by friends to publish, and some have been locked in a drawer. Now I have taken them all out, selected twenty articles, and looked at them again. I only feel that although what I have written cannot be said to be uniquely expressing my spirituality, it is still attached to life; although it cannot be said to be unconventional, it still records the feelings of a small life in a great era. Therefore, I say that my writing is just like the tail of a composition topic, only "slightly expressing my feelings."

Because I often live in the mountains and fields, in mountain villages, I see the mountains when I open the door, and I am still in the mountains when I close the door, so I named it "Mountain Living Sketches." Although I know that the word "sketch" has long been in decline, fortunately this is only to leave a little trace for some dreams that have disappeared and are about to disappear; I do not consider myself humorous, nor do I boast of my spirituality; and most of them are attached to reality and are related to the War of Resistance, so they should not be said to be "not divorced from the evil habits of Ming Dynasty sketches" as the Summary of the Four Libraries says.

### Window

— Zang Zan

There is a song, I remember it starts like this: "Quickly open your blue eyes, it is already dawn; you hear the birds singing in the forest, the song of love: you see the beautiful dawn light, the rose-colored sky..."

The world is originally beautiful, not only roses and love, but there are too many people who don't open their eyes; not only those who are sleeping. Not only those who are closing their eyes, not only those who are closing their ears and mouths, but also those whose hearts are deeply locked, I don't know how many.

Some are locked by others, and some lock themselves.

Of the ten silent people, nine are filled with resentment and explosives, unwilling to be silent. They want to cry, want to laugh, want to tear everything apart, but the experienced wall stands in front of them - only silence.

Silence is like a bottomless sea.

(People traveling in the sea should smell the strong breath of people. This is really an unbreathable air.)

I remembered the small earthen houses in the countryside of mountain cities: thick mud walls, low and repulsive roofs, no windows, only one door, especially in the hot and humid summers. When a person lives in the house, he can only live a moldy life with snakes and rats.

I also think of the large courtyards in some ancient cities. Although the houses are built beautifully, they are still surrounded by suffocating high walls, and there are two large stone lions sitting at the door. Living in these high walls, I dare not say that they are people. Their lives are the same as snakes and mice. If they are people, they are just people whose hearts are surrounded by thicker earthen walls.

There is no love between people, only prevention; no sincerity, only deception. The exchange of love and sincerity is blocked by walls of all sizes. Only in ideals does this world exist. No wonder those who say: "If one day everyone lives the life of Jing Yu Shi, this world will be transformed into heaven in an instant" are called dreamers, and are called people who are far from reality.

However, there are indeed people in this world who believe in heaven, and believe that it already exists in this world. They not only believe in it themselves, but also call on others to believe:

"I firmly believe that there is an ideal surrounding the earth, omnipresent, an ideal of heaven, which is not only produced from fantasy, but also produced from the ultimate reality in which everything dwells and in which everything moves. I believe that this illusion of heaven is already in the sunlight, in the green earth, in the beauty of human faces, in the wealth of human love..."

A heaven cannot be built by one person. Silent friends who believe in heaven! Open your window again, open a window in your strong earthen wall, outside the window is sunlight, is the green and wide earth, outside the window are the beautiful faces of human beings, and the abundance of human love overflowing...

Open your wall, one window, two windows, to see more broadly.

Push away that wall, you come out of the wall.

### Sandbag

— Wang Rui

I received a telegram from my brother, De Yi, informing me that Dr. Chen Hengyi, the orthopedic expert who had treated my leg injury in Chongqing in 1927, was practicing medicine at a pharmacy in Shanghai. I told this to Ci. Knowing that my leg could undergo surgery even after several years of being able to walk, she went to see Dr. Chen on her own without a word. According to her, Dr. Chen didn't recognize my name and had no recollection of my injury at the time, but he earnestly advised Ci that it would be best if I personally went to him for an examination.

One cold afternoon, I accompanied Ci to a pharmacy on a certain road. Dr. Chen, whom I hadn't seen in seven years, still had the same rosy complexion, full of energy, and kind smile as he did seven years ago, making him seem approachable. He asked me about the detailed circumstances of my retreat from the front line and my injury, saying that it was very likely that a false joint could be made for the malleolus when the bone quality was stronger. He also mentioned that knee joint surgery could now be performed to improve flexibility, but the outcome might not be better than the current situation. A more appropriate method would be to straighten the leg, let the knee joint hang over the edge of the bed, and place a sandbag on the instep of the foot to apply pressure and allow the lower leg to droop. With this therapy, the injured person should lie flat in bed reading books and newspapers, so that the knee joint will gradually bend unconsciously.

Nowadays, seeing a doctor is like the gold bar era. Although Dr. Chen had the demeanor of a scholar, Ci still prepared some money for unforeseen expenses in treating the leg injury. Now, with Dr. Chen's instructions, a sandbag seemed easy to obtain, which delighted Ci! After taking the elevator down from the pharmacy, in the biting cold wind, I suggested that we immediately go to a bank that was building dormitories on the Bund to get sand and mud, and buy an evening newspaper on the way to use as a wrapper for the sand.

During my student days on the sports field, I had a relationship with sand and mud. When we were playing and sweating profusely, it would mischievously hide between our toes, following us to the dormitory and classroom. But I probably only gained a genuine sense of connection with sand and mud from today onward. Concentrating and observing carefully, shells and gravel were mixed and mottled, exposed to the sun, and flashing with a bright golden light in the wetness. The pity was that there was a little too much moisture, which would soon soak through the newspaper and create a risk of tearing. So we had to go to the Heng's residence, near the bank, to borrow a sandbag.

Ci handed me the black velvet hot water bottle and held the heavy sandbag herself, climbing the eighty-one steps to the Heng's residence. Panting, she smiled and asked her brother and sister-in-law to guess what she had brought. They were making jujube cakes, preparing for the New Year. Outside the misty glass window, dampened with steam, the bare branches of paulownia trees could be seen trembling in the cold wind, and faint sounds of New Year's gongs and drums could be heard from afar. The children thought we were bringing New Year's gifts. Only when they learned it was a bag of sand to bend my knee joint did the initial mystery dissolve in everyone's smiles.

After eating the hot jujube cakes and borrowing a cloth bag, we bid farewell to Ci's brother and sister-in-law and went downstairs. I still carried the black velvet hot water bottle, while Ci held the sandbag in her arms like a young mother holding a newborn baby, hopping and skipping, and said to me in a gentle and delicate voice, "There is hope in here."

I kissed her, saying, "There's a little treasure in here!"

What I meant was that it would be good if the knee joint could bend with the help of the sandbag; and if we had a baby with a face shining with golden light soon, that little treasure would certainly be happier than any contemporary scholar, both spiritually and physically.

### On Poetry

— Renjie

The development of poetry is originally the development of human society as a whole; the changes in poetry should follow the rotation of the giant wheel of the times in the same direction. Then, let the poet only worship two gods of faith, which are "freedom" and "seeking truth," and through the results of labor and cultivation, make poetry the most robust and simple flower grown in the soil of reality, and lay the foundation for our future glory.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 204

— Ye Jingfeng

At this moment, we only heard Tsurumi say "Very good," and then there was no sound. In less than half a second, Tsurumi was asking for a phone number again. The number he wanted was precisely our phone number. This revealed that Tsurumi wanted to make a phone call to solicit Mr. W's opinion on the "attack." As soon as Mr. W heard the number that Tsurumi was reporting, he immediately turned off the microphone and reached for the phone, waiting for the phone to ring.

We already knew why Tsurumi wanted to make a phone call and we could guess what he wanted to say; so we were now only paying attention to Mr. W's answer: whether he would insist on the established plan to carry out the attack, or listen to Tsurumi and Pingzi's advice, "Leave behind useful blood... prepare for a counteroffensive..."

"That's right..." Mr. W answered Tsurumi's call like this; "The issue of the attack has already been decided to be canceled. I am very grateful for the advice of you and your friend, Miss Pingzi... Yes... You are too kind... Yes... Okay, we'll talk again later..."

Mr. W put down the phone and smiled at us. It was somewhat comical that we were now listening to Tsurumi's conversation on the microphone and also receiving Tsurumi's phone call. Only Mr. W suddenly stopped smiling and pondered slightly, as if he were trying to solve a difficult problem. After thinking for a while, it seemed that he had found the answer, and he opened the microphone in the drawer again. I thought he must have wanted to hear what else Pingzi had to say about this organization since Tsurumi had already told Pingzi about our situation. As soon as the microphone was turned on, Yaoqun quickly moved her chair closer to me, indicating that she wanted me to continue the translation work:

Ping, ...lives in the Six Nations Hotel. But even if the incident just now hadn't happened tonight, I would have had to find your brother.

Tsurumi—Why?

Ping—Because of the urgent time.

Tsurumi—What time is so urgent?

Ping—We have to leave immediately!

Tsurumi—"We?"... What for? Where to?

Ping—To Shanghai!... Sigh, Brother, you must have forgotten what I told you!

Tsurumi—Tell me? I don't remember you telling me anything.

Pingzi didn't continue. We were listening very intently, knowing that what Pingzi had told him must be the secret of "Eight." But Tsurumi was being difficult; perhaps he was afraid that Pingzi would deliberately hold back the content of this secret, thereby controlling Tsurumi, so Tsurumi also deliberately acted coldly, pretending not to remember Pingzi's words, and not taking her "admonition" seriously. This was a reverse tactic, not just ordinary mischief. Pingzi didn't speak, probably angry at Tsurumi's cold words. Sure enough, Tsurumi spoke again:

"Alright, alright, Miss Pingzi, it's not something to be sad about!... Consider it my fault. Since I came here, I've met many new and old friends, and I haven't had enough time for social engagements. I also wanted to rest for a couple of days, but unexpectedly, many problems have arisen..."

Ping—I know my brother has a lot of friends, at least one very respected "lady friend." How could you remember my words? (Her voice was very low, probably still in tears, and her voice was not as sweet and crisp as before. I didn't pay attention to the words "lady friend," and translated them verbatim. I regretted it in my heart, thinking that I shouldn't have told this to Yaoqun, for fear of making her angry. But upon closer inspection of Yaoqun's expression, apart from a chuckle, there was no change. The innocence and candor of the Northeastern ladies are truly admirable.)

### The Threat of Gold

— Li You

Reading "Gulliver's Travels," after the lands of the giants and the midgets, there are two more fantastical places. One of them is inhabited by creatures that are part horse and part human. These creatures are most fond of a special kind of stone found on the ground, which they regard as treasure. Those who obtain the "stone" hide it as if they were afraid of losing it, while those who don't have it try every means to steal and rob it. Many disputes in this country arise from this.

Looking at social news lately, I often think of the story above, and can't help but admire Swift's satirizing ability.

Take the news of the past few days, for example. The biggest and longest-running story is the case of the hidden gold on Fuxing Island, followed by the legend of gold bars carried on the crashed plane in Tianmen (the investigation result is hard to believe). In the past day or two, there has been the strange story of Zhou Gengsheng, a suspected traitor, dying of illness in prison and leaving a family letter saying that bail required thirty gold bars. These cases are often difficult to get to the bottom of in the short term, so readers often review them in the newspapers, giving some people endless interest and others a serious threat.

"People die for wealth, birds die for food." Logically, a person who doesn't covet wealth like life should be able to feel a little more at ease about this. But in fact, it is not. Before the trading of gold was banned, one day, while waiting for a tram, I stood in front of a small silver shop. It was already dusk, the twilight was like smoke, and pedestrians on the road were coming and going, making it seem crowded and hurried. Inside the silver shop hung a powder board with the market price of pure gold written on it. Despite the hustle and bustle of these pedestrians, when they walked to the silver shop, they stopped and looked at the powder board. Some muttered to themselves, some left silently, and there were other various expressions. In short, it is difficult to describe, but one thing is undoubtedly certain: the numbers on the powder board were closely related to them. They came and went hastily, and none of them were free from the control of these numbers. Anyone, even someone from Mars, would feel uneasy after seeing this scene.

Even though it has been banned, the threat of gold still exists in the shadows. There is a kind, well-behaved man who doesn't have gold and doesn't want gold. He has lived in a garret somewhere for ten years. Recently, the landlord received gold bars from someone else and asked all the residents, including that kind man, to move out. The kind man has always prided himself on not paying attention to gold, but now he also feels the whip of gold.

### Married Couples Should Have Friends of the Opposite Sex

— Liu Meng

After reading Mr. Fang's "Love, Divorce, and Married Couples" in the "Free Talk" section of the 17th, I cannot help but disagree with Mr. Fang's insightful opinions. Mr. Fang's words are not without considerable merit, but after silently observing the facts, my conclusion is the six words "cannot be generalized."

Humans are always emotional creatures, and making friends, except for those with ulterior motives, is a manifestation of emotion. The so-called "friend" of course does not distinguish between genders. Pure concepts of friendship should not contain sexual relationships. This is indeed a platitude, but there is truth in it, and it is also the criterion for making friends.

I don't know if it's because I'm male or for some other reason, but I like to make female friends, but there has never been any estrangement or conflict between me and my newlywed wife. The reason is that my wife trusts me very much, believing that I will not overstep the boundaries, and I am indeed as she believes, only at the level of friendship. I correspond and talk with my female friends. Although we talk about everything and have passionate debates from time to time, the other party knows that I am a married man, and I always remember that I am a "husband." We respect each other's personality, and the friendship becomes even deeper.

Due to work reasons, my wife and I are separated by a distance of several hundred miles. Whenever I work late into the night, I am extremely tired and the work is not yet finished, letters from my wife and letters from my female friends can lift my spirits and allow me to continue working.

Can one make friends of the opposite sex after marriage?

My opinion is clearly different from Mr. Fang's, because based on my personal experience (I don't care if these two words are used appropriately or not), making friends of the opposite sex after marriage not only does not hinder the feelings between husband and wife, but can also make oneself and one's wife (or husband) feel the preciousness and warmth of friendship outside of marital love, thereby not feeling the monotony of one's life.

However, humans are emotional animals, and also jealous animals (whether male or female). Therefore, when making friends of the opposite sex after marriage, one must pay attention to the following points:

(1) There must first be mutual trust and understanding between husband and wife, and a step back for "empathy" must be left for each other.

(2) One must be honest with friends of the opposite sex, respecting oneself and others, and there must never be any intention to deceive.

(3) Do not associate indiscriminately: indiscriminate association will make your personality worthless.

These three points are also my motto for making female friends.

(Editor's note: On this issue, we have received a large number of submissions from authors, most of whom disagree with Mr. Fang's opinions. We are now publishing one of them here).

### "Spring's End, Dream Broken" to Begin Filming Soon, "China Enterprise"'s First Film

— Hua

The film industry's new army, "China Enterprise" company, has chosen the playwright Tang Shaohua's "Spring's End, Dream Broken" as its first film. The plot of the whole play is mournful and lingering, and extremely moving. The film will be directed by the famous director Ma Xuwibang, with the red star Liu Qiong as the male lead and the famous star Li Lihua playing the female lead. It is said that it has been decided to start filming on April 10th, and will be released during the Dragon Boat Festival.

### Remembering Hui Wenzheng's Love of Talent

— Aiju

Wenzheng's staff was the most abundant source of talent, and the public often regretted missing out on talent. This is because those who join the staff cannot necessarily fulfill their potential. In Anqing, he lived in a large hall with my late father. In the middle three rooms, a long table was set up, and at dawn, the staff would gather and sit around the long table to discuss the matters to be handled that day, much like a meeting today. The other two rooms were a place for receiving colleagues and a dining room. The Duke resided in a room on the west side, and my late father resided in a room on the east side, specializing in memorials and all confidential documents. After lunch, the Duke would always take a short nap, and then play a game of chess. He was poor at chess but played quickly, making ten moves as fast as flying. Even if the opponent intentionally made concessions, he still lost most of the time. When he occasionally won, he would laugh loudly. He often quoted what Su Dongpo said: "Winning is certainly delightful, and losing is also pleasing" to console himself. After chess, he would definitely talk about literature and art, various notes on classics and history, and the "Thirty Poets Anthology" and the "Eighteen Poets Anthology" were all finalized at this time.

One day, he was granted a yellow mandarin jacket. At first, he was very happy when he received the imperial edict, but then he looked worried and said, "I am a farmer's son. My ancestors and father started their families by farming. Every time it rained and they went to the market, they only wore studded shoes. Today, let's write a poem clock about the yellow mandarin jacket and studded shoes to commemorate the favor and dare not forget our roots." Everyone in the room was stretching out paper and thinking, and Wenzheng was also holding a pen without writing, but Jin Meisheng, the Financial Commissioner, had already submitted his answer first. His poem said, "The Emperor bestows extraordinary colors, why should a man disgrace the muddy road?" This is a collection of idioms. The first couplet is naturally clever, and the second couplet is full of complaints. On the surface, it is still accurate. When the Duke read it, he praised it and said, "With this couplet, we can all put down our pens." On that day, the position of Shanghai Circuit Intendant was vacant, and it was decided to appoint him in the morning and recommend him to be appointed. When he went to take office, he especially warned him, "When we usually talk, I know that you are good at economics, and I have long thought of relying on your talent. However, I slightly dislike your impulsive temperament. Yesterday, your couplet was excellent, but your dissatisfaction was still too obvious, which is not the way to carry blessings. After you leave, you should focus on your work and be careful." Two years later, Jin was appointed as the Jiangsu Provincial Treasurer, but did not finish his term. Wenzheng can be said to have had foresight. However, although the Duke loved talent, he also had times when he made mistakes. My late father once talked about a matter concerning the Duke, saying, "There was a talented man on the staff who often discussed the great governors of various provinces, saying that so-and-so was authoritative, and people dared not deceive him; so-and-so was astute, and people could not deceive him; but only you, Duke, move people with virtue, and people cannot bear to deceive you." At that time, the Duke greatly approved of his argument, but who knew that he would later be entrusted with the likin administration and would end up losing hundreds of thousands of taels of gold. The Duke then beat his chest and exclaimed, "Cannot bear to deceive, cannot bear to deceive!" It can be seen that it is difficult to know a person, and a gentleman can be deceived by his way.

### Strange Tales of Plants

— Yang Shi

If you were to travel in a tropical forest, you would find that this forest is like a department store, with everything imaginable. When you get thirsty, there is a type of palm tree that grows a hidden trough at the base of its leaves. Cut open the end of the leaf, and a pint of clean water will be provided to quench your thirst. "Linas rattan," when cut open, will also flow out with water for bleaching. Another type called "Mother Tree Cow," when cut open, will flow out with a sweet and delicious juice, just like the milk you drink at home.

"Century grass" is the source of thread for local natives, and it even carries needles, with a barb growing at the tip of each thick leaf. After smashing this leaf, you will find that this needle is connected to many thin and tough strands of fiber. The red Indians of Central America use these strands of fiber to weave very strong cloths. The "hair-edged tree," called by the Spanish, is even more peculiar. Spreading out the pith of its branches reveals a beautifully structured white lace. Spanish women love to hear about this lace from the natives and use it as scarves or inlays on clothing.

When you want to cross a river, the bark of a purpleheart tree can be made into a boat, and its shape is like a rawhide raft. And the oar? Even more conveniently, there is a type called "oar tree," whose branches are flat, straight, and hard. Chopping one down gives you a natural oar.

Although you are in a remote forest, grooming still has to be done every day. There is a type of creeper that grows two sharp little leaves, which can be used to shave your face and trim your beard. "Soap rattan" can naturally be used as soap. Remove the leaflets from the stem of the "gru-gru palm" and you will have a new weaver's shuttle.

As for toys, the "kite tree" grows an oval leaf, two or three feet long and wide. Its leaf base is connected to extremely long and strong silk. Isn't that a kite string?

In terms of medicinal materials, in addition to the quinine tree that everyone knows, there are also "wild yam" and "ipecac," which are all treasures hidden in tropical forests. As long as you need them, they are inexhaustible.

There is also a type called "rape tree" in North Africa. Its nature is even more peculiar. Anyone who touches the "irritating part" of its branches will be captured by the tree with its roots and "raped" alive. The "mimosa" will shyly curl up its leaves when it sees your hand tempting it. The "daughterless grass" is an rootless parasite growing on tree trunks. The "insectivorous tree" uses poisonous mucus to hunt small insects. All of these will make you marvel at the wonders and magic of nature.

### Arts and Literature

The Cultural Life Publishing House will be reprinting new books this week, including: "God, Ghost, Man" by Ba Jin, "Wu Zixu" by Feng Zhi, and three selections from the works of Turgenev: "Smoke," "A Nest of Gentlefolk," and "On the Eve."

Ba Jin's famous "Torrent Trilogy": "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn" have all been adapted into plays by famous playwrights Cao Yu, Lin Ke, and Li Jianwu, and published by the Cultural Life Publishing House.

Kunming's "Weeklies" are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain, with many types, such as "Southwest Wind" and "Current Trend," among which "Social Weekly" is the most outstanding, and the "Friend Request Column" is especially unique.

Ma Zihua's "Yunnan Anecdotes" vividly describes the lives of the Yi people within the province and is well worth reading. (Yang)

The sixth issue of Volume 13 of "Family" has now been published, and the contents include the sections "Cosmic Points and Lines," "Essays and Notes," "Page of Cultivation," "Between Men and Women," "Love and Marriage," "Sayings and Deeds of Celebrities," "It Depends on Man," "Movies," and "Fiction." Each copy is sold for four thousand yuan.

### Pioneering and Fleeing

— Jue Ren

After years of clamoring to "go to the Northwest," unexpectedly, after "repatriation," everyone is still squeezing back to the Southeast. Originally, going to the Northwest was for pioneering, but in the end, the "wasteland" was not "pioneered," and all that was left was to "flee," as if it was "over and done with." (When he went to the Northwest and Southwest back then, he also fled.)

Logically speaking, the Southeast is densely populated, so there shouldn't be any wasteland. However, this is not the case. Not only is the countryside uncultivated, but even the wasteland in the cities is not pioneered. Has anyone seen Nanjing and Hangzhou, etc.? You will find many wastelands in remote areas. "Villages and towns are desolate, and the city faces the setting sun." One cannot help but chant the old tune of "Lament for Jiangnan."

Even if someone transports countless crops, fruits, cattle, and even farming machinery from other countries, they will either perish due to lack of support or exhaust themselves due to lack of assistance. Nature is so good, but human affairs are not managed well. We are clamoring about poverty every day, but there is no way to inspire production to flourish.

People are just crowding in the market, "bewitched by paper and drunk on gold," forgetting the local saying that "white jade grows in the soil, and gold comes out of the ground." A young man studying agriculture said to me, "The earth is lovely, the smell of the soil is fragrant, especially in this spring. But you are at a loss, and you cannot help but shed tears when you look at the vast wasteland."

These words are enough to sting the hearts of those who yearn for governance. But I remember a good story. In an ancient fable, an old man's last words to his sons were: "My sons, dig in this vineyard." They followed the old man's words and dug all over the vineyard. Although they did not find the hidden gold, they had plowed the vineyard all over, so the grapes were ripe that year, and they also became rich.

Just focus on plowing and cultivating. Don't dream of excavating the gold and silver treasures hidden by Zhang Xianzhong in front of the Wangjiang Tower in Jinjiang. You only need to dig through every corner of your own vineyard, and when the grapes are ripe, you will have a day of unexpected harvest.

It is a pity that too few of us have pioneering hands, and too many of us have opportunities to flee. Written in Hangzhou on Arbor Day, 1947.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Xu Shaoming nodded, feeling this guess was quite reasonable.

"Then, do you want me to mediate for you again?"

"Good, inviting him for a chat is possible!"

"Don't underestimate Old Zhu's gang! Old Xu." Little Shen was, after all, smarter than them, and because of the Jin Aili affair, he further understood the stubbornness of that bunch of poor bastards.

"Anyway, what's the harm in talking to him?" Xu Fatty's only goal was to prevent the associate manager, who had already been used by him once, from losing heart, so that he could always be in cahoots with him. "Regarding the donation campaign they stirred up, I donated over four hundred thousand all by myself, purely for Old Zhu's sake; now, for these trivial matters, if we ask him for help, how could he be embarrassed to refuse?"

Little Shen gradually understood Xu Shaoming's intention.

"Actually, you don't even need to appease them, just let them scold you in the newspapers! Look, for more than a month, which newspaper hasn't been vehemently denouncing Yue Zhang, but until now, Yue Zhang is still the commander-in-chief of the Seventh Army! Your China Tea Company isn't without a background, is it?" Little Shen showed his eloquence, making Xu Fatty and Old Zhu very happy.

Xu Fatty was even more excited, reaching out to grab Little Shen's new Hawaiian shirt made of white toweling, urging him to sit down and drink.

Little Shen pretended to be reluctant before sitting down. Xu Shaoming hurriedly used chopsticks to tap the plate, calling for Ah Shi to bring the wine glasses.

"With a clear conscience! How much money can I, Zhu Xinong, actually get? It's nothing more than helping friends!" Associate Manager Zhu, with his red nose, squinted his narrow eyes, complaining to the other two.

"Of course, you, old brother, are a man of conscience!" Xu Fatty said with a smile, with some satirical meaning, but not too obvious, and he didn't laugh out loud.

Little Shen was also laughing inside, but it didn't show on his face.

"What have Old Zhu's gang been busy with these past few days? It's like they don't even want to flee!" he asked curiously.

Xu Fatty was chewing on a piece of abalone and didn't have time to answer.

"Seems like they're busy performing and comforting the troops again?" Old Zhu said uncertainly.

"Who says otherwise!" The abalone in Fatty's mouth was already swallowed. "They just love doing these kinds of attention-grabbing things! My second cousin-in-law gets along best with them. After arriving in Guilin, she isn't in a hurry for anything. These past few days, she's been going to the Art Museum almost every day, saying she's helping them paint scenery..."

Little Shen suddenly paid attention.

"Isn't that the one sitting outside in the courtyard enjoying the cool air?" He opened his eyes wide, asking with unusual excitement. (Two) (Three)
