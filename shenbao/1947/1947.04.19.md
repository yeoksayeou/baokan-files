### The National Government Reorganization Has Been Completed; Chairman Chiang Explains Three Key Points; Still Hopes the CCP Will Change Its Rebellious Attitude

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The National Government celebrated the 20th anniversary of establishing its capital in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 18th. Chairman Chiang attended and delivered a speech, stating that: The National Government has been based in Nanjing for 20 years, but the Three Principles of the People have not yet been fully realized, and the national economy and people's livelihood have not yet been stabilized. Government colleagues feel deeply ashamed. However, the internal and external troubles that the country has encountered in the past 20 years, and the dangerous and difficult situations, are unprecedented in history. Fortunately, the National Government, with the support of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit and the united efforts of all colleagues, has been able to overcome all difficulties and lay the foundation for national construction, which is truly gratifying. Now that the reorganization of this government has been completed, it is the initial realization of our party's ideal of returning power to the people. In the future, the government should move towards democratic constitutionalism. It is hoped that all comrades will maintain their past spirit, work together with one heart and one mind, and strive to complete the mission of implementing the Three Principles of the People and building a new China.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The completion of the National Government's reorganization coincided with the 20th anniversary of the National Government's establishment in Nanjing (18th). Chairman Chiang specifically received Chinese and foreign reporters in the National Government Auditorium at 11:05 AM on this day and delivered a speech. This was the first press conference held by the Chairman in the capital since the victorious relocation. When Chairman Chiang arrived at the auditorium, he was wearing a khaki military uniform, with the Blue Sky White Sun Medal on his chest, and frequently showed a smile, seemingly indicating the infinite joy in his heart. Wu Tingchang, Peng Xuepei, Li Weiguo, Shen Changhuan, Cao Shengfen, and others were present, and more than a dozen Chinese and foreign reporters attended.

After Chairman Chiang exchanged greetings with the reporters, he said: Today is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, so I have specifically invited reporters in Nanjing to talk. Today is also the day of the National Government's reorganization. The order has already been issued, and everyone has probably seen it. This reorganization of the National Government is a new stage in the history of the Chinese revolution, and its importance lies in three points: First, in this reorganization of the National Government, all major parties except the Kuomintang have participated. The multi-party government that has been expected for years has now been realized. The establishment of this multi-party government is the first step for the Kuomintang to return power to the people. From now on, we will enter a period of constitutional democracy, and from this, we can further expedite the completion of the goal of unification and peace. Second, we must realize the return of power to the people and implement democratic constitutionalism, and we cannot wait until the end of the Communist Party's armed rebellion. At the same time, we hope that the Communist Party's armed rebellion will end as soon as possible, disarm, and no longer cause chaos, so that they have the opportunity to participate in the government and achieve unification. Third, for more than a year, the Communist Party has repeatedly claimed that the Kuomintang has no sincerity in returning power to the people. This reorganization shows that what the Communist Party said is incorrect. At the same time, not waiting for the end of the Communist Party's rebellion before implementing the reorganization indicates the Kuomintang's determination to realize it. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.

Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] On the 18th, the day of the 20th anniversary of the National Government's establishment in the capital and the reorganization of the National Government Committee, Chairman Chiang of the National Government specifically received the press at the National Government Auditorium at 11:05 AM in the morning. More than 20 Chinese and foreign reporters attended, and Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang and Minister Peng Xuepei also attended the meeting. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech on the spot, which was translated by Secretary Shen Changhuan. The original text of his speech is as follows: Today's reorganization of the National Government Committee is an important step in our country's transition from political tutelage to constitutionalism. This reorganization allows all political parties and social elites to participate in the nation's highest political decision-making body. After the reorganization, the distribution of National Government Committee members is as follows: Kuomintang 12 seats, Democratic Socialist Party 4 seats, Youth Party 4 seats, Social Elites 4 seats, and the heads of the five Yuan are ex officio members (5 seats). Currently, the heads of the five Yuan are still Kuomintang members, so the Kuomintang occupies a total of 17 seats. When members of other political parties or social elites serve as heads of the Yuan, the number of seats occupied by the Kuomintang will naturally decrease. The original quota for National Government Committee members was 40, and the original quota for Kuomintang members was 20. Now, only 29 names have been announced. If the remaining 11 seats are filled, the number of Kuomintang members will be 17 out of 40 seats, which is still less than half of the total number of seats. The selection of candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party for this reorganization of the government was determined by the two parties themselves. The selection of participating candidates from social elites was done with the consent of the individuals themselves. After the participation of various political parties in the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, followed by the expansion of the scope of the National Government Committee, a multi-party government has now been completed. Furthermore, when the reorganization of the Executive Yuan is completed, under the new Premier, the heads of various ministries and commissions will also be separately appointed by political parties and social elites. In the past, the power of our country's government was the responsibility of the Kuomintang. After this reorganization, it will be jointly exercised by the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites. The National Government Committee will exercise its powers during this transitional period and implement the resolutions of the National Assembly to complete the preparations for the implementation of the constitution, which will begin on December 25th of this year. After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's political situation can be divided into two stages. The first stage was to persuade the CCP to participate in the government through American mediation and to incorporate its army into the national army. The second stage began with the convocation of the National Assembly. The participation of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites in the National Assembly and the joint formulation of the constitution show that the people of the whole country are enthusiastically supporting the government's efforts to implement constitutionalism. At a time when the world situation is constantly evolving, our country's need for peace and construction is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the unification of the country must be realized in the shortest possible time. Democracy and constitutionalism cannot be indefinitely delayed while waiting for the CCP. If the CCP abandons its actions of seizing power by force and can cooperate for the sake of national unity and unification, then the party still has the opportunity to participate in the government and engage in national construction work. For the sake of alleviating the suffering of our compatriots, we sincerely hope that the CCP can finally change its rebellious attitude.

Speech by Chief Secretary Wu of the National Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Chief Secretary Wu of the National Government recently made the following statement: The significance of the National Government's reorganization lies in expanding the foundation of the government, transitioning from a government responsible by one party to a government jointly responsible by multiple parties. Chairman Chiang's remarks to reporters today have provided a detailed and clear explanation. Regarding Article 15 of the National Government Organization Law, which states that "The Chairman of the National Government is responsible to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang," the word "responsible" is based on the provisions of Article 10, which states that "The Chairman of the National Government is elected by the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang." This is because, in terms of the Chairman's own position, he cannot but be responsible to the organization that produced him. It does not mean that the resolutions of the National Government Committee must be decided by the Chinese Kuomintang. The National Government Committee is "the highest state affairs organ," which is clearly stipulated in the Organization Law.

### New National Government Committee Members to Take Oath of Office on a Scheduled Date; First Meeting to Be Held After the Inauguration Ceremony

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The new National Government Committee members are scheduled to take their oath of office on the 23rd. The National Government Committee will hold its first meeting after the inauguration ceremony.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] A letter signed by Zhang Junmai and Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party was brought to Nanjing from Shanghai by Yang Junmin on the night of the 17th and handed over to Jiang Yuntian. According to Jiang, the content only concerned the situation of the party in Shanghai. Although Xu still firmly declined the appointment, Jiang expressed that Xu has foresight and great ambition, and it is very appropriate for him to serve as a government committee member, so he will still be invited to accept the appointment. As for the internal problems of the party, he still advocates strict sanctions against Sun Baogang and others.

### Xu Fulin Going to Nanjing Today

[Central News Agency, This City News] Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party, in response to Chairman Chiang's telegram invitation, is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight. Xu told reporters yesterday that Wu Xianzi wrote in a letter a few days ago that his illness has not yet recovered and that he will not be able to come to Shanghai for two weeks. As for the vacancy for a Democratic Socialist Party government committee member, it will still be nominated by Zhang Junmai and then passed by the party's Central Standing Committee. Regarding the party's internal disputes, he believes that they are purely emotional and that Zhang Junmai does not attach importance to them. A few days ago, Tang Xiangming and others, under the guise of nine members of the Central Standing Committee, opposed Zhang Junmai. Among them, Wu Xianzi and Li Daming were not in Shanghai, Liang Qiushui was not a member of the Central Standing Committee, and Zhang Dongzheng had already left the party. Therefore, in reality, only five people participated in the matter. It is a joke for five people to launch a "party purge." He said that he will use his neutral position to persuade them to abandon their childish actions.

### Zhang Dongzheng Declares He Is Unrelated to the Internal Disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party

[Our Newspaper News] Zhang Dongzheng entrusted League of Democrats representative Ye Zhenyi to declare that he has long since left the Democratic Socialist Party, so he is unrelated to the party's current internal disputes. Although the letter from some members of the Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party to the Chairman on April 8th used his name, it did not obtain his consent. In the future, if his name is used within the Democratic Socialist Party, it will be considered invalid.

[Our Newspaper News] Democratic Socialist Party Standing Committee members Wu Xianzi, Zhang Dongsun, Sha Yankai, Tang Jiaxin, Li Daming, Wang Shiming, Sun Baogang, Lu Guangsheng, and other eight people issued a joint statement yesterday, criticizing the party chairman, Zhang Junmai.

### President Sun Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The newly appointed Vice Chairman of the National Government, Sun Ke, took a special train to Shanghai at 11:30 PM on the 18th. Sun's two daughters recently returned to the country after completing their studies in the United States and arrived in Shanghai on the 15th. Sun will spend the weekend in Shanghai with his daughters, whom he has not seen for many years, and is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 20th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] After President Sun was elected as Vice Chairman of the National Government, reporters specifically visited the Legislative Yuan to express their congratulations. Sun humbly said that in the National Government Organization Law, the powers of the Vice Chairman are only to act on behalf of the Chairman when the Chairman is unable to perform his duties due to an accident. There are no other provisions. When reporters asked about the nature of the new National Government, Sun replied: "The National Government Organization Law is formulated according to the current Provisional Constitution, and it can still be considered political tutelage, but there will be slight changes in administration." When reporters asked whether the National Government Organization Law still needs to complete the legislative procedure, President Sun replied that it is not discussed by the Legislative Yuan. If the press has any opinions on the National Government Organization Law, he hopes that they will provide as much reference as possible. Sun also clarified the matter of the Executive Yuan setting up a News Bureau, saying that although the Director of the News Bureau is specially appointed, he cannot be listed alongside the heads of the various ministries and commissions, and he cannot attend Executive Yuan meetings, but can only attend as a non-voting delegate.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 18th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke recently told our agency's interviewer that the article in the new National Government Organization Law stipulating that the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the National Government are elected by and responsible to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang will not be modified, although the minority parties have requested a revision. This article is formulated according to the Provisional Constitution of the period of political tutelage and will remain effective before the new constitution agreed upon by the National Assembly is implemented at the end of this year. Sun also denied that this article means that the Kuomintang will continue political tutelage.

### Rescuing the Textile Industry Crisis

Economic Policy Committee Decides on Countermeasures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Economic Policy Committee held a regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th, attended by Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, He Zhonghan, Lou Tongseng, and others. Chen Lifu chaired the meeting. The meeting discussed in detail how to rescue the current crisis in the textile industry. According to reports, there are two major crises facing our textile industry: (1) There is a possibility that Japanese textiles may stage a comeback and dominate the East Asian market again; (2) After the foreign exchange adjustment, the cost of cotton has increased several times, and due to the ban on exports, the future of the textile industry is precarious. The meeting resolved: (1) Since the cost of using foreign cotton is too high, it was decided to formulate a production increase plan so that domestic cotton can be self-sufficient. (2) The production of Japanese cotton should be standardized so that it can be fully used for self-consumption. If there is a surplus, it should be purchased by China. This matter will be negotiated with General MacArthur's headquarters through diplomatic channels. (3) Promote frugality and transport as much exportable cotton yarn as possible to Southeast Asia to replace the original Japanese market. (4) Increase the import tariff rate on cotton fabrics.

### Regulations for the Organization of the News Bureau Revised and Approved by the Legislative Yuan; Regulations for Military Personnel Voting Also Discussed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Legislative Yuan continued its 322nd regular meeting on the morning of the 18th to discuss important cases such as the Regulations for the Organization of the News Bureau. Sun Fo chaired the meeting. When he stepped into the meeting hall, everyone applauded warmly to congratulate him on his appointment as Vice Chairman of the National Government. The discussion began immediately. The first item proposed was the proposal to add Article 3 to the Executive Yuan Organization Law. It was resolved to add the following article after Article 2: "The Executive Yuan shall establish a News Bureau, the organization of which shall be determined by law." Then, the Regulations for the Organization of the News Bureau were discussed. First, President Sun explained, pointing out the differences between the News Bureau and the Central Propaganda Department. The News Bureau is subordinate to the Executive Yuan and is a government agency responsible for conveying government orders and achievements, clarifying national policies, and issuing important news, while the Central Propaganda Department is only a party organization that emphasizes party propaganda. The full text of the Organizational Regulations has 14 articles. The main revision today was to change the appointment of the Director from specially appointed to specially designated. There were no other major changes. The discussion lasted about half an hour, and it was revised and passed. Next, the Regulations for the Implementation of the National Assembly Election, Recall, and Initiative Law, which has 71 articles in its full text, was also successfully revised and passed. Among the articles, the provisions on military personnel voting and election expenses are more noteworthy. Regarding the military personnel voting regulations, it is stipulated that those serving in the military and possessing the right to vote should register as voters with the election authority of their place of origin. If they cannot return to their place of origin to participate in voting, they may vote for candidates announced for their place of origin at their military location. Regarding election expenses, there are detailed provisions in British and American laws. When the Legislative Yuan previously discussed the ten major laws of constitutionalism, Legislative Members Chen Ruxuan and others also solemnly proposed it. Due to factual reasons, this regulation only makes negative provisions. Another issue that caused controversy was how to interpret the "border ethnic groups" mentioned in this regulation. Rui Yifu suggested expanding its scope to include border residents in Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places, in addition to the southwestern border ethnic groups in Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces. Liu Butong and others disagreed, and it was resolved to maintain the original plan. Regarding the Organizational Regulations of the National Government Design and Evaluation Department, it was decided to hand it over to the Legal System and Economic Committees for re-examination. The meeting adjourned at about 12 o'clock. The next regular meeting is scheduled to be held on the 24th. The draft Banking Law is expected to complete its second reading and be passed at that meeting.

### To Safeguard Freedom of the Press, Convener of the Constitutional Propaganda Committee Requests Investigation into Incidents of Newspaper Office Destruction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] When the conveners of the Investigation, Research, and Propaganda Committees of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee held a meeting on the 17th, Chen Yixiu, the convener of the Propaganda Committee, stated that in recent months, incidents of newspaper office destruction have occurred continuously in Kaifeng, Hankou, Changchun, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Chengdu, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Wuxi, and other places. At this time of preparing for constitutionalism and freedom of speech and publication, such illegal incidents should not occur. In order to safeguard freedom of the press and truly open up speech, he specially proposed that the committee send a letter to the government requesting a clear order to safeguard it, so that newspapers in various places can exert the power of public opinion and promote society to reach constitutional rule as soon as possible, and to instruct the relevant departments and committees to investigate and deal with such destructive incidents. President Sun immediately agreed to forward the request.

### National Army Reinforcements Provide Strong Support, Flowing Continuously from Shaanxi and Henan into Shanxi, Remaining Communist Bandits on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Encircled on All Sides

[Our Correspondent, Taiyuan, 18th] Strong reinforcements of the National Army arrived in Yuncheng, Anyi, and Linjin on the 16th. Another force crossed the river from Dingchuan and advanced to Jixian in western Shanxi. A force of 60,000 Communists launched an offensive from southern Shanxi, capturing nine county towns in the past two weeks. Apart from Yishi, which has been retaken by the National Army, Yicheng, Fushan, Jiangxian, Jishan, Xinjiang, Hejin, Ronghe, and Wanquan remain occupied. Now, National Army reinforcements are continuously entering Shanxi from Shaanxi and Henan, determined to annihilate the Communist forces completely.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] The situation in southwestern Shanxi is very tense. Yishi is currently under siege by 300 troops. The situation is unclear. The National Army in Anyi is breaking through the Communist defenses to provide assistance.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] After merging, the Communists in Quwo and Xinjiang moved north, attacking Fenyang and Xiangling. Using cavalry, they moved north along the Fen River, besieging Xiangling and Fencheng, where fighting is fierce.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] The natural defenses of the Yellow River, such as Dongyumen Ferry, Hejin, and Longmen, are all in the hands of the National Army. Another Communist force is reinforcing north of Jishan. The Communists' flank detachment crossed Quanpo and fled towards Puxian. The National Army is on high alert in Linfen and Hongdong.

[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 18th] The Communist forces in the so-called Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are under simultaneous attack by the National Army from eastern Gansu, southern Ningxia, and southern Suiyuan, following the campaign in northern Shaanxi, and have now been completely encircled. The Communist forces trapped in the gourd-shaped encirclement have had their outlet closed due to the convergence of the National Army from the east and west. Since the beginning of this ten-day period, the National Army in eastern Gansu retook Qingyang on the 8th, Huanxian on the 11th, and Quxiqian between Qingyang and Huanxian. The National Army in southern Ningxia retook Anbianbao on the 8th, Ningtiaoliangzhen on the 10th, and Jingbian on the 13th, joining forces with the National Army in northern Shaanxi. The National Army in southern Suiyuan is advancing south from Yulin and engaging in fierce fighting with the Communist forces in the mountainous area north of Mizhi. The National Army in northern Shaanxi is attacking Suide on one hand and crossing the river to intercept and suppress the remnants of Chen Geng's forces who attacked southern Shanxi on the other. Currently, the Communist forces in the border region number about seven brigades, with Wang Zhen as the commander of the southern route, Wang Shitai as the commander of the northern route, and He Long as the overall commander. However, due to the encirclement by the National Army on all sides, they have suffered heavy losses and their main force has been broken up. It appears they will disperse and go underground in various areas to carry out guerrilla warfare. Their main force may abandon northern Shaanxi and flee into northern Shanxi. It is expected that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which the Communists have occupied for twelve years, can be cleared in the shortest possible time.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 18th] In recent days, there have only been localized engagements in the mountainous areas of southern Shandong. There has also been no intense fighting on the Jiaoji Railway.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 18th] After eliminating Communist resistance, Wang Yaowu's forces, which were sweeping southeast from Jinan, recovered Zhonggongzhen, 25 kilometers southeast of eastern Jinan, on the afternoon of the 17th and are continuing to sweep towards Xiying.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 18th] The Communist forces in southern Shandong have deployed two newly formed columns and some local forces to hinder the advance of the National Army pressing towards the Yimeng Mountains along the Jiaozhou-Qingdao and Tianjin-Pukou lines. The main force, eight columns, is concentrated in the area surrounding Linyi. One column is stationed in the Tangtou and Laigongzhuang area between Linyi and Yishui, two columns are stationed at Shizilu east of Linyi, one in Juxian, one in Wangwang, Yishui, one in Gongyin, one in Qingtuo, and one in Chuidun northwest of Ganyu, totaling eight columns, approximately 200,000 men. The command post is located in Tanbu near Mengyin.

### Jingxing Coal Mine Captured, Two Mine Directors and Employees Missing, Guolu Recovered, Continued Fighting on the Outskirts of Shijiazhuang

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] The Jingxing Coal Mine southwest of Shijiazhuang has fallen. The first mine fell on the morning of the 17th, and the second mine fell on the afternoon of the 18th. The whereabouts of the mine employees and security forces are unknown. The mine has a long-standing reputation. Before the incident, it was a Sino-German joint venture with an annual output of 800,000 tons of high-quality coal suitable for coking. During the occupation, the Japanese established the Jingxing Coal Mine Company. After the victory, it was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and later jointly operated by the Assets Committee and the Hebei Provincial Government. The head office is located in Beiping, with nearly 10,000 employees and a daily output of 3,000 tons of coal. Before the fall, there were nearly 100,000 tons of coal in storage. The first mine director, Zhao Shouyi, and the second mine director, Chen Shuping, are both in the mining area.

[Our Correspondent, Taiyuan, 17th] A major fire broke out at the Jingxing Coal Mine on the morning of the 17th.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] The dangerous situation in Shijiazhuang still requires further measures to be taken. The Shijiazhuang garrison continued to send telegrams requesting reinforcements last night. Li Zongren has dispatched Liang Shuzhe, the chief of the staff of the Xingyuan, to Beiping to request specific measures from the Party authorities. Military authorities here believe that Shijiazhuang is safe. It is reported that the Communist attack on the airfield is still fierce, with shells falling on the airfield overnight, but it does not affect its use.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] The National Army recovered Guolu (west of Shijiazhuang) yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th] The Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship was signed at 4:30 PM (Nanjing time 5:30 PM) on the afternoon of the 18th in the splendid State Council Chamber of the Presidential Palace in the Philippines, thereby further strengthening the close relationship between two independent and democratic nations of the Far East, both with close ties in race and culture and both leading the construction of peace. Ambassador Chen Zhi-ping signed on behalf of China, and President Roxas signed on behalf of the Philippines. The full text of the treaty will be announced simultaneously in Nanjing and Manila at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning. Its content is almost identical to the treaties of friendship that China has signed with other countries. Assisting Ambassador Chen Zhi-ping in the nine months of negotiations, which were interrupted twice, were Sun Biqi, First Secretary of the Embassy, who made many contributions, and Duan Mao, former Consul General in Manila, who began the first stage of negotiations shortly after the Philippines gained independence in September last year. Those attending the signing ceremony today included leaders of the Chinese community, officials of the Chinese Embassy, senior officials of the Philippine government, and journalists from various countries. During the ceremony, Ambassador Chen Zhi-ping gave a speech congratulating the Philippine officials and the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs led by Quirino.

[Further Dispatch] Ambassador Chen Zhi-ping told reporters today that negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, stipulated in the Treaty of Friendship, will begin soon. According to reliable sources, the Philippine side has requested that China prepare a draft of the commercial treaty. Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino issued a statement to the press today, saying that the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship is a guarantee of lasting peace and symbolizes the permanent and sincere friendship between the two countries.

[Further Dispatch] According to Philippine official sources, Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino will officially visit China after his upcoming visit to the United States.

[Associated Press Dispatch] According to diplomatic sources, the Chinese government recently suggested to the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs that it allow Philippine currency held by people in Shanghai and other places to be remitted to the Philippines for exchange for coins stamped with the seal of the Philippine Ministry of Finance. The Chinese Embassy in Manila suggested that such funds be remitted through Citibank and the Bank of China, and immediately transferred to the Philippine Ministry of Finance upon arrival in Manila. It is generally believed that the Philippine government will not object to this matter, but the inflow and outflow of Philippine currency must be approved by the Foreign Assets Administration. The exchange period has been extended to May 31st, and unstamped banknotes will then be illegal currency.

### Opening of Private Trade with Japan Opposed by China and the Philippines, Notes Verbale Submitted to the Far Eastern Commission

[United Press, Washington, 17th] China and the Philippines are opposing the United States' reopening of private trade with Japan. The two countries have submitted notes verbale to the Allied International Trade Bureau of the Far Eastern Commission, stating that the opening of private trade with Japan would hinder the payment of reparations and therefore expressing their opposition. The Trade Bureau had asked member states when private trade with Japan could be opened. The Philippines responded that private trade should be postponed until the proper allocation of reparations is ensured. China also expressed the same view, fearing that after Japan's production increases sharply in the future, Japan will use this as an excuse to demand the withholding of equipment and tools currently designated for reparations. Other Allied countries did not express their opinions, but it is said that they are not enthusiastic about the US proposal. Although these countries agree in principle that Japan's economy must be restored and become self-sufficient, they must first ensure that their individual interests are not affected before private trade with Japan and related matters can be implemented. China and the Philippines also believe that Japan's currency is not stable enough to allow for free trade.

### Japanese Reparations Materials to be Collected at Ports Awaiting Shipment

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] According to authoritative sources, General MacArthur has now been authorized to move 30% of the temporary reparations goods to Japanese ports for shipment to the various recipient countries. However, because the Allied Headquarters has not yet allocated these goods, and the transportation of equipment for reparations involves the issue of wood for packing materials and Japan's limited transportation capacity, the shipment of large quantities of reparations goods will take China more than two years.

### Huo Baoshu Reports to Reporters on the Inspection of the Yellow River Flood Area, Disaster Victims Desperately Need Help, Hope for Cooperation from Various Agencies

[Our Report] Huo Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), inspected the disaster situation in the Yellow River flood area with representatives from all walks of life in China and abroad a week ago. He and eight members of the UNRRA staff returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. He met with reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the inspection and the relief and rehabilitation plan. According to Huo, the most important issues in rehabilitating the flood area are agriculture and water conservancy. The plan is to restore the flood area to its pre-war state in three years and improve production so that all available land can be cultivated. However, it is currently necessary to provide relief to the disaster victims. At a minimum, they must be allowed to "live".

Huo continued, "The rehabilitation work is more difficult than previously thought. Since the Yellow River changed its course eight years ago, it has brought the Yellow River to the flood area. If cultivation is delayed for another year or so, the soil there will change and become barren. Therefore, it is urgent to transport seeds within six weeks, before the rainy season, to prepare for planting."

"As for refugees returning to their hometowns in the Henan area, an average of about 2,000 people return every day. However, after returning home, they are empty-handed, and food, clothing, and shelter are all problems. Although CRRRA and UNRRA are trying their best to provide relief, there are too many monks and not enough porridge. They are overwhelmed by the sudden influx of people and cannot take care of them. Therefore, we urgently hope that other agencies in various places can cooperate and not allow all the refugees to return at the same time. We hope that those who can produce will return first and start work, and those who consume will be allowed to return later. However, in terms of human sentiment, it is not convenient to separate the old, weak, women, and children, so we also feel difficult about this issue."

CRRRA has now prepared 20,000 tons of grain to provide relief to refugees and is transporting it to the area in succession. Some of it has already arrived. The government has approved a disaster relief and rehabilitation fund of 140 billion yuan for this year. UNRRA will provide materials and equipment worth approximately US$12 million for this year.

Huo also said that the Yellow River flood problem can be called one of the largest relief efforts in the world. He hopes that people from all countries can provide assistance. Based on the inherent strength and perseverance of the Chinese people, he believes that after initially providing material assistance, they can automatically work hard to produce.

[Our Correspondent, Bengbu, 18th] Zheng Daoru and other members of the Joint Inspection Group of the Yellow River Flood Area inspected the Huai River dyke and flood area on the morning of the 18th. At noon, they visited the teaching and dining station and factory in Huaiyuan, and left Bengbu for Beiping in the afternoon.

### Burma Sends Representative to Xiamen to Assist Overseas Chinese in Returning

### Bandits Rob Train at Shamian Station on Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway

[Our Correspondent, Guangzhou, 18th] At 5:00 PM on the 16th, the No. 88 slow train from Kowloon to Guangzhou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was suddenly attacked by more than 1,000 villagers and bandits holding long and short guns, light and heavy machine guns, and sledgehammers at Shamian Station. The military police on board immediately returned fire. A group of rioters swarmed onto the train, looting passengers' property, causing chaos. Passengers cried for help. Under the cover of concentrated fire from the military police, the train desperately started and managed to break through. However, the losses are estimated to be more than hundreds of millions of yuan. This incident is different from general train robberies. Because villagers participated in it, it is generally observed that this may be due to grudges between the local villagers and the railway bureau. The railway bureau has sent personnel to investigate.

Editorial

### The Future of China's Banking Industry

The Joint Conference of the Bankers' Association of the Republic of China, which began on the 15th of this month in Nanjing, concluded yesterday. For these few days, the leaders of the national banking and financial circles gathered in the capital, truly a grand occasion. The foundation of China's financial economy is inherently weak. After a long period of resistance against Japan, the original foundation has been shaken. Coupled with the decline of the general national economy, the hope for reconstruction and nation-building rests heavily on the banking and financial sector. Therefore, when the National Bankers' Association convened in the capital, our Chairman, despite being burdened with numerous daily tasks, specifically issued instructions for encouragement. In the Chairman's instructions, he placed particularly earnest expectations on the banking and financial industry in the great task of reconstruction and nation-building, saying, "What is hoped for in the future is that the financial sector should work together to further balance the national budget, consolidate the currency system, and establish a firm foundation; strive to stabilize people's livelihoods, increase production, and promote construction; and hope to broadly express insightful opinions and gather wisdom to fulfill the mission that the financial sector should shoulder for nation-building." Over these past few days, the National Bankers' Association meeting in Nanjing has indeed been able to understand the Chairman's good intentions and has discussed in detail the various aspects that the banking industry should adopt and reform in the future. Judging from the numerous and wide-ranging resolutions passed, it is evident that the convening of this National Bankers' Association will have a significant impact on the future development of China's banking industry.

In summary, the resolutions passed by this National Bankers' Association, those that are more important or involve the interests of the general public, are roughly as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of increased payment for pre-war deposits, the resolution has four points: (a) Pre-war savings deposits will still be calculated with compound interest at the original amount, (b) Please ask the government to promptly determine handling methods, (c) Before the government announces handling methods, the government should order national judicial organs to stop accepting lawsuits related to this matter, (d) Organize a petition delegation to petition the government; (2) Implement banking specialization; (3) Change current policies and strengthen the effectiveness of national banks, especially focusing on the Central Bank. There are files from Chongqing, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Shenyang, Beiping, Qingdao, Hankou, Xi'an, and other places requesting to strengthen the connection between the Central Bank and commercial banks to realize its mission as the bank of banks; (4) Simplify reporting procedures and standardize inspection agencies. It can be seen that the discussions at this National Bankers' Association not only concerned matters related to the banking industry itself but also involved major plans related to national governance. Regarding some current problems in the banking and financial sector, standing from the people's perspective, we would like to briefly express our views:

First, regarding the issue of payment of pre-war deposits, this is more of a national problem than a banking problem. Commercial banks, when accepting deposits before the war, did not anticipate such a drastic change in the value of the currency in the contract between the bank and the depositors. Strictly speaking, the payment of pre-war deposits should not be a problem for the bank. That is, however much was deposited before the war, plus the specified interest, should be paid. The bank cannot be held responsible for currency fluctuations, which are beyond its control. Recent court rulings requiring banks to pay a thousand times the original amount have no legal basis and are not consistent with legal principles. However, the sharp depreciation of the currency is a fact, and if the principal and interest were paid according to the original figures, this would naturally be a huge loss for the depositors. Moreover, in the process of currency depreciation, various banks may have used depositors' funds to obtain windfall profits. Therefore, for this issue, we must consider the facts on the one hand and the law on the other. The court's precedent of paying a thousand times the original amount is inappropriate, and the resolution passed by this Bankers' Association to calculate compound interest at the original amount does not take the facts into account. We agree that the government should promptly determine a method to follow. The relationship between a bank and a depositor is a private one, different from the relationship between a bondholder and the state. Therefore, the handling of this matter should not necessarily be the same as that of government bonds. We urge the government to promptly clarify the method for handling this private relationship and, in determining the method, not to ignore the fact of windfall profits gained by taking advantage of the currency crash.

Second, many banks and financial institutions in various regions have proposed business suggestions regarding the Central Bank. This indicates two points: first, the general expectation of banks and financial institutions in various regions for the Central Bank; second, the deep disappointment of the Central Bank with banks and financial institutions in various regions. From these proposals, they either hope that the Central Bank can truly become the bank of banks or that the Central Bank can strengthen its connection with commercial banks. Both of these indicate that the Central Bank has not yet become the bank of banks, and its connection with commercial banks is not close enough, hence such calls. The Central Bank's role was once demonstrated during the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army and the pacification of the Central Plains, and again during the establishment of the legal currency system. In recent times, the Central Bank's achievements seem to be more passive than active. During the War of Resistance, either due to special circumstances or complex institutions, the Central Bank was hindered from playing its unique role. The current situation is different from that during the war. Wartime setups that should be abolished should be abolished to avoid affecting the unique functions of the national banks. A more prominent one of these wartime setups is the so-called Four Banks Joint Office. This may have been necessary during the war, but whether it should be allowed to continue to exist at present seems worthy of consideration. The existence of this institution may have some impact on the Central Bank's ability to fulfill its role as the bank of banks. Since banks and financial institutions in various regions have high expectations for the Central Bank, this point also seems worthy of study.

As for banking specialization, this is something that should have been done long ago. The term "banking specialization" refers not only to national banks but also to commercial banks. National banks should be specialized, and commercial banks should also be specialized. Today's commercial banks are named after industry, agriculture, or mining, and each originally had its own specialization according to its name, but how many of them truly live up to their names? The National Bankers' Association is an organization of commercial banks, and since it has called for banking specialization at its inaugural conference, we hope they can start with themselves.

The modern banking industry operated by Chinese people is still less than sixty years old. Although the history of banking in China is short, its contribution to China's modernization is significant. However, as for the banking and financial industry itself, its impact on the modernization of the general public's lives seems insufficient. The situation today is not too different from that sixty years ago. Beijing and Shanghai are densely populated, but financial transactions between the two places still rely on remittances. Compared to other countries where a single check can be used throughout the country, we seem to be in the feudal era of the Middle Ages. Although the banking industry in China is a newly emerging modern enterprise, it is still full of outdated medieval systems. How to modernize China is a responsibility that the banking industry cannot shirk. To modernize China, it is especially hoped that the banking industry itself can modernize. Now that the national banking industry has the organization of the Bankers' Association, we hope they can move in this direction.

### Major Fire in Guling: Over a Thousand Households Burned

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 18th] A devastating fire occurred in Guling this summer. On the evening of the 16th, a fire accidentally started in house number 41 on Hou Street in Guling, igniting the wooden walls. The fire spread from Hou Street to Xia Street, Xin Road, and Zheng Street, eventually affecting over a thousand shops and houses, including the Yan Ren Ji Hotel on both streets, completely destroying everything. Over 2,500 people were affected, with losses estimated at around 20 billion [currency unspecified]. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Wang Lingji, after arriving in Shanghai from Hankou, went to Guling on the 18th to oversee relief efforts.

### Disregarding Our Country's Request: Siam Restricts Overseas Chinese Entry; Immigration Law to Take Effect Next Month

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 16th] It has just been learned from authoritative sources that the Siamese immigration regulations will take effect on May 1st. These regulations were originally scheduled to take effect on April 1st but were temporarily suspended due to Ambassador Li Tieh-tseng's suggestions. The number of Chinese allowed to enter (10,000 per year) is based on statistics of the number of Chinese who went to Siam in the past 20 years, which is quite unfair because, between 1937 and 1945, China was isolated from the outside world due to the Japanese blockade. Only 18,000 Chinese people went to Siam. China has strongly argued that a reasonable and fair number should be stipulated for Chinese going to Siam. Therefore, the sudden withdrawal of this new regulation will cause difficulties for those already en route or preparing to come here. Therefore, the Chinese authorities have requested that these regulations be postponed until May 1st. It is understood that China's request has been rejected. Siam's excuse is that since the resumption of transportation between China and Siam in the middle of last year, an average of 10,000 Chinese people have entered the border each month, many of whom have brought cholera and other infectious diseases. In view of this situation, the Siamese government and people have decided to formulate regulations to restrict the entry of large numbers of Chinese.

### Folk Impressions of Northern Jiangsu (V): On the Matter of "Surrender and Renewal"

— Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi

The original intention regarding "surrender and renewal" was also out of the government's leniency and not pursuing past offenses. Commander Li said: "Because most of the people in the bandit areas were forced into it and had no choice, that's why there is the motivation to handle surrender and renewal. But after this matter was implemented in various places, those handling it often didn't understand the reason and were perfunctory, so sometimes it caused trouble instead. For example, the battle of Sanyu Town was because the 'surrender and renewal' people took advantage of this opportunity to act as insiders, causing Sanyu Town to suffer a great loss."

When the reporter was in Haimen, I once received a letter signed "Haimen Refugee," which mentioned the matter of surrender and renewal, writing in the original text: "Using leniency as a policy to handle surrender and renewal, starting to feel and train, not only is there no effect, but they are also protected, becoming more and more reckless, supplying intelligence to the bandits, and if they have the opportunity, they try to resist, causing great losses, while the lower-level bandit cadres in the area, believing that the central government's policies are lenient, become bolder and more ruthless, the transport of supplies is even more rampant, the killings are even more numerous, without any fear, so there is no hope for suppressing bandits."

From this, it can be seen that the above paragraph of Commander Li's speech was indeed spoken with emotion.

We once visited the "Feeling and Training Center" in Tangjia Gate. This belongs to the "First Brigade of Youth Guidance," including 209 defectors, 194 renewed, and 954 captured people. Among these 1,357 members, there are also six women.

Here, at the invitation of the headquarters, we were given the opportunity to chat with these renewed people. When I stepped into the gate of the Feeling and Training Center, the first feeling was: they are all receiving highly disciplined military training.

A rural farmer who used to be a "militiaman" spoke to me, his mouth full of new terms such as "land reform," "liquidation," and "confession." His dull-witted demeanor, coupled with that set of things in his mouth, I almost laughed out loud, suspecting that I was watching a "puppet show." I asked him if he was literate, and he said very straightforwardly, "I am illiterate!"

Jia Yu, who used to be a female clerk at the "Huazhong Bank," I asked her how she came here? According to her own claim: she was originally a student at Rufou Girls' Middle School. When the New Fourth Army came, she worked as a female clerk at the Huazhong Bank. Later, Rufou was recovered, and she also renewed herself. She was wearing a set of cotton military uniforms that day, and she was chubby. Perhaps because our group of sudden reporters asked too urgently, she looked very nervous, her face flushed red, and she kept stroking herself with both hands.

He speaks with a slight stutter. Regarding his education, he said that after finishing three years at Fudan University, he later went to Chengdu Sichuan University because of the War of Resistance.

We asked her what her views were on the Communist Party? Her reply was: "I don't do political work, I'm just a bank clerk counting money!"

Later, when everyone started talking about everyday matters, she said, "My father and brother still live in the countryside thirty miles away from Rufou, and my father is still the current village chief!" She also said, "I was only sent here after renewing myself, and it's been almost two months now."

I asked her if she was living well here? She nodded, not denying it. We asked her again if her family knew about this situation? She said that she could communicate, but it had to be checked.

Finally, we also met Yang Tianhua, the "County Magistrate of Gaoyou County." Because he wasn't feeling well that day, everyone talked in his room for quite a long time. It seems that this "county magistrate" is one of the most privileged in the Feeling and Training Center, living alone in a room with a bed, a writing desk, and some pens, ink, paper, and a set of chess pieces on the cabinet. He used a pack of "Craven A" cigarettes and frequently offered them to every visiting reporter.

In addition to the conversation, everyone was given a mimeographed "Recollections of the Past Few Years." From his past history, we know that he had served as an instructor, a secretary in the commissioner's office, a secretary in the chairman's office, and a president of the local court. He started working in 1939 and defected on December 24, 1946, while serving as the County Magistrate of Gaoyou County, leading a special company of the county government.

He speaks with a slight stutter. Regarding his education, he said that after finishing three years at Fudan University, he later graduated from Sichuan University in Chengdu because of the War of Resistance. After that, he also lived in "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" for a year.

In this series of conversations, someone suddenly asked him what he thought was the most successful thing he did during his tenure as county magistrate.

He thought for a while, and then said falteringly, "Not being corrupt, not exaggerating..." But when we listened to him quietly, his tone seemed a bit forced.

Finally, he said: When he defected, his wife was in labor, so she couldn't come out with him. So someone asked him if she would be in danger? His facial expression did turn pale for a moment, and then he said helplessly, "That's hard to say!"

### Local Dispatches

Suzhou

At the Guomin Grand Theater outside the city gate, a strong stench suddenly appeared in the theater during a Yue opera performance of "Autumn River Moon" on the afternoon of the 16th, causing people to vomit. The audience in the theater immediately fled. After investigation, it was found that a girl had broken several small glass tubes, from which the ozone gas was emitted. The case is currently being interrogated by the public security authorities.

Haining

Near Zhujiang Town along the highway in this county, road workers discovered a giant snake with a head as big as a dou (unit of volume) and four large snakes when digging for stones at the beginning of the month. A wave of superstition arose for a while, and it was rumored far and wide that it was the manifestation of the snake god. Those who went to the area to seek elixirs and divination blocked the road. Recently, people from Hangzhou and Shaoxing also heard the news and came specifically to worship. The local police went to investigate and prohibit it but were humiliated and beaten. Upon hearing the news, the county government sent police officers and all police officers from the police station to drive away the ignorant people and arrest several snake god monks who were the ringleaders and send them to the county for legal action.

Nantong

The First Pacification District Headquarters has recently designated Nantong's city defense police district, with the urban area as the center, extending east to Guanyin Ditch and Lu Hong Lock, west to Tianshen Port and Tangzha, south to Langshan, and north to Qinzao. Military and police security agencies within the district are all under the unified command of the concurrently serving city defense commander Gan Ji.

Jintan

The county government put up for public sale 1,000 dan (unit of weight) of autumn grain rice. The bidding results on the 16th showed that a Zou County merchant, not hesitating to pay the highest price of 57,200 yuan per dan, won the bid and purchased it for export. Local rice merchants believe that since the county government encourages people to bid at high prices, then the price of rice should be calculated based on the bid price and should not be subject to price review restrictions. Therefore, the price of rice in this county has once again experienced drastic fluctuations.

Bengbu

Guo Jian, the magistrate of Yiyang County, who is known for suppressing bandits, was indicted because he appointed Sun Zhongyu, who received the second-highest number of votes in the Tianpeng Township Sun Sai Baomin election, as the village head without authorization, arousing public outrage. On the 5th, when Guo went on patrol to the Datian market, the people of the village petitioned and questioned him. Guo angrily ordered the guards to stab Baomin Bai Yuxian and others, and then prevented them from being taken to the city for medical treatment and continued to arrest Sun Tongde and others. The victims have now filed a lawsuit with the court, and the township has organized a petition support association to appeal to all parties.

Minhang

The newly appointed Shanghai County Magistrate Yu Yueqiu arrived in the county on the 2nd of this month to take over his duties. The County Council has also been preparing and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 19th.

### Discussions on Austrian Treaty Progress Slowly: Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces New Disputes; Austrian Foreign Minister Rejects Yugoslav Territorial Demands

[Associated Press, Moscow, 18th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber today pleaded with the Foreign Ministers' Conference to complete the Austrian treaty. However, observers generally feel that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference is in a stalemate, and the hope of establishing an Austrian treaty is rapidly fading. Several German experts in each delegation are now preparing to depart for Berlin, having already abandoned hope of continuing to seek progress on the German treaty. When Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber urged the Foreign Ministers' Conference to act quickly, he stated emphatically that the Austrian government would never sign the treaty if it gave any territory belonging to Austria to Yugoslavia. Much of Gruber's statement was in response to the demands made yesterday by Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj and denied that there were racial, cultural, or other reasons to transfer Austrian land to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia is demanding the southern part of Austria's Carinthia region, and the question of the border issue and which Austrian German property can be used as compensation is now pushing the Foreign Ministers' Conference closer to a standstill. At this morning's meeting, the four foreign ministers clashed over the first major issue of the Austrian treaty, namely how to deal with the 50,000-plus gypsy people in Austria. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov clashed with the foreign ministers of the three Western countries. The US delegation is preparing to stall in order to determine whether the Austrian treaty can be completed here.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 17th] The four foreign ministers continued to discuss the Austrian treaty today, first discussing Article 16, namely the clause on displaced persons, which is one of the most contentious points in the Austrian treaty. Although the foreign ministers apparently tried their best to compromise, they failed to reach an agreement and adjourned the item. However, the four foreign ministers agreed to repatriate the Germans who went to the warring countries because of the war, but they only failed to agree on certain details. As for the other seventeen military clauses, six were unanimously passed, three were partially passed, four were not discussed, and two were deadlocked. The two clauses that failed to reach an agreement were Article 17 (clauses on restricting Austrian national teams) and Article 27 (clauses on Austrian military research and equipment). Although the four foreign ministers unanimously agreed that the Austrian army should have 53,000 men, the navy 5,000 men, and 90 military aircraft, including 10 fighter jets, the Soviet Union hoped to stipulate that Austria could only use weapons and equipment made domestically, which was opposed by the foreign ministers of other countries, resulting in a failure to reach an agreement. Another proposal by France, advocating the establishment of a military expert committee in Austria to supervise the implementation of the military clauses, was automatically withdrawn by France after discussion. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss the economic clauses of the Austrian treaty tomorrow. According to observers, the foreign ministers of the four countries will need to hold six or seven meetings before they can complete the discussion of the Austrian treaty.

### Communist Parties in the Balkans Seeking to Control

[Associated Press, New York, 17th] The inside story of the Communist Party's control of the four Balkan satellite states of the Soviet Union is now gradually becoming clear. According to reports received by the United Nations, the Soviet Union has long instructed the highest central committees of the Communist Parties of Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, and Bulgaria to handle territorial issues, supervise military operations on the Greek border, and guide the political ideology of Albania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Romania. One plan is to use guerrilla tactics to combine the Macedonian regions belonging to Greece and Bulgaria into an autonomous state, and then apply to merge into Yugoslavia. Bulgaria will seize all of Thrace from Greece and Turkey, thereby obtaining the Dardanelles Strait and the Aegean Sea ports. The Macedonian autonomy declaration was originally scheduled to be issued this spring, but it was suspended due to the strong actions taken by the United Kingdom and the United States. This can explain why the United Kingdom and the United States insisted that the United Nations agency's Greek border dispute investigation team should remain in place to monitor the Greek border while drafting a report, fearing that a sudden change might occur before the report is submitted and discussed by the Security Council. Thrace belonging to Greece and Turkey, except for the military bases desired by the Soviet Union, will all be given to Bulgaria. It is slightly rumored that Moscow has now abandoned the extravagant hope of Greece joining its Balkan satellite states.

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 18th (Radio): Former U.S. Vice President Wallace arrived in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, yesterday by plane from England. In a press conference in Sweden today, he stated that European countries have a major mission to seek world peace, and that the Nordic countries are particularly important due to their geographical location. Mr. Wallace said that before leaving London, he received a declaration jointly signed by 111 members of Parliament, stating that they share Mr. Wallace's view that any policy that divides British-American-Soviet relations is harmful to world peace.

Dr. Poulter, who represented the Army Department in this expedition, revealed that an international conference will be convened in the future to encourage cooperation in the field of Antarctic science. Rear Admiral Byrd also announced the gains of this trip, including the discovery of fifteen mountains, twenty-six new islands, twenty giant icebergs, nine bays, and five headlands.

### "Saving People and Helping Others, I Didn't Think This Was a Crime" Yuan Ludeng Admits "I Was Wrong" High Court Retrial, Disciples in Attendance Stand Up in Unison When He Arrives, Tang Shoumin, Lin Kanghou and Others Called to Testify

[Our Dispatch] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," was originally sentenced to life imprisonment. After the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial, the High Court continued the investigation and trial in the afternoon yesterday, presided over by Judge Qiu Huan-ying. Many of Yuan's relatives and friends came to listen upon hearing the news, and there were no empty seats. Yuan was wearing a beige coat. When he entered the court, his disciples all stood up to show respect.

According to Yuan's confession: I was unable to leave Shanghai at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War due to being burdened with the affairs of the Shanghai Refugee Association as Secretary-General and due to economic difficulties. In the spring of the 30th year, Li Shiqun and Ding Mocun met with Yu Qiaqing. Because Elder Yu went to Hong Kong, they asked me to continue as the Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Because I had served as the Chinese Director of the Municipal Council for more than ten years, I was unable to refuse. I had informed Mr. Du Yuesheng in Hong Kong of the situation in a letter, which can be passed on for evidence. The pseudo-Rice Grain Control Association already existed. I only helped as the chairman of the association. The association only managed a part of the people's food supply. It negotiated with the Japanese army to allocate a part of the military rice as household rice. It never purchased military food from the enemy in place of rice. The allocation of household rice was 2 jin of rice per person per day until the interruption of household rice in April of the 33rd year. Therefore, around May 10, I claimed illness and entered the Hongqiao Sanatorium, and then resigned. The successor was Chen Guoquan. The pseudo-City Chamber of Commerce directors were publicly recommended because I was a director of the City Chamber of Commerce before the war. The trade associations already existed and were not organized by me. I have never attended the Committee on Material Control Deliberation. The chairman of the Baojia Preparatory Committee was because the public elected me after negotiating with the Japanese army to lift the blockade. The association did not establish rules and did not clear household registrations. The member of the Pseudo-New National Movement Promotion Committee was only a name, and I never went to Nanjing to attend meetings. The articles published in the pseudo-newspapers were all written on behalf by Chen Binsu and Yuan Shu. In the end, he said: I usually do things with my conscience. I only know how to save people and help others. I didn't think this was a crime. The court rebuked him, saying that these were all matters of colluding with the enemy, how could you try to excuse it with the words of helping. Yuan repeatedly said: I know I was wrong. Then Tang Shoumin, Chen Guoquan, Zhou Chunyu, and Lin Kanghou, who were in custody, were summoned to testify. Finally, the defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stood up and requested that Du Yuesheng, Xi Yushu, and He Dekui be summoned to testify at the next hearing. He also requested a postponement of the trial. The court ordered a re-examination at another date. The defendant waved to the relatives and friends on both sides when he was taken back into custody, repeatedly saying: "I'm sorry."

Three days on the road south of the Yangtze River, spring blooming in every family, plum blossoms in Wuxi, willows along the Zhenjiang; Thousands of miles of hazy wilderness, a lifetime of wandering, the Cold Food Festival has passed at the end of the world, and I am sad alone at dusk.

Standing alone in the setting sun, I casually look at the end of the horizon, where the sails fall and smoke rises at dusk.

The matter was reported to the Garrison Command for review and handling, it was said.

### Zhubao Three Road Restores Original Name

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the municipal government approved the restoration of the original name of Zhubao Three Road in this city. The name Zhubao Three Road originated in the early years of the Republic of China, when Zhu Bao San served as the president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other positions, sparing no effort in the city's charitable undertakings. The road was initially very narrow, and Mr. Zhu specifically widened it. The local residents, to express their gratitude, submitted a request to the French Concession Public Works Bureau at the time to adopt the name Zhubao Three Road as a memorial. Later, after Shanghai fell into enemy hands, the road was renamed Xikou Road by the enemy and the puppets. After the restoration, his son Zhu Zikui specifically presented detailed reasons requesting the restoration of the original name of Zhubao Three Road, which has been approved by the Municipal Council.

### Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Order for Secret Investigation of Black Market for U.S. Dollars

[Our Dispatch] Since the authorities stipulated that the free trading of gold and U.S. dollars is prohibited, unscrupulous people, unafraid of the law, continue to operate secretly in many cases. Their transaction methods either use secret codes or private transactions, and the transaction locations are cunningly scattered to avoid official surveillance. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has received another secret report that coffee shops opened by Jews in the Hongkou area of this city, and some restaurants along Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, and Jiangxi Road, are being used by U.S. dollar brokers as black market trading places, with very large daily inflows and outflows.

### Workers at China Textile Factory No. 1 Go on Strike; Lotte Wah Employees Petition

[Report from Our Newspaper] The wages of the workers at China Textile First Hemp Weaving Factory are calculated based on output. Recently, due to the change of raw material from Chinese jute to Indian jute, and the replacement of machinery, the daily output per person has increased from 190 yards to 230 yards. Consequently, the workers' wages have increased. Although the management has made some deductions, the wages are still higher than before. The female workers as a whole expressed dissatisfaction with the management's reduction measures and have been staging a slowdown since the 16th. The factory has submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting assistance in mediating the situation. In addition, the old workers of the factory have also sent a written request to the Social Affairs Bureau, asking to resume work.

Previously, the Lotte Wah Garment Factory dismissed two female workers, Zhang Meie and Pan Zizhen, which repeatedly caused collective complaints from all the female workers. Yesterday, the workers again sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to appeal, requesting the factory to withdraw its decision. According to the Bureau, the two female workers were dismissed for mistakenly affixing stamps. Mediation has been ongoing, but unless the management provides new evidence, the fault does not lie with Zhang and Pan.

### Warehouse Workers at Minfeng Paper Mill Engage in a Major Brawl

[Report from Our Newspaper] Minfeng Paper Mill at No. 3, Lane 74, Ningbo Road, has a warehouse located at Da Wang Temple, North Chengdu Road, formerly the site of Jingcheng Paper Mill. Recently, due to labor-management disputes in the factory, a strike broke out on the 4th, which has continued to this day without resolution. Old workers such as Ma Weiqing stopped moving goods in the warehouse. Yesterday morning at 9:30, the factory hired old foreman Zheng Jinde, who led over 20 laborers to enter and work. Unexpectedly, they were blocked by a crowd of about 70 or 80 striking workers, who each held firewood sticks and arbitrarily attacked them, severely injuring Fang Jinde in the waist. The other laborers, Zhao Tingfu, were injured in the lower part of the body; Xu Chaoyou, in the head and buttocks; and Zhao Wenshan, in the left shoulder. Afterward, the injured were sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment by the factory. After receiving the report, the New City Police immediately dispatched officers to investigate the truth. However, the striking workers inside the factory guarded the factory gate, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. They had not dispersed by dusk.

### Commander of Captured American Ship Asks Mayor for Assistance to Aid Chinese Crew – Request to Petition National Government to Make Demands to the US

[Report from Our Newspaper] Smith, the commander of the US Naval Reserve, has written to Mayor Wu, requesting a petition to the National Government to formally request the US Navy Department to provide prompt assistance to the loyal Chinese crew members of the former US warship "Wake" stationed in Shanghai. According to reports, the "Wake" had a total of 23 Chinese employees. When the Pacific War broke out in December 1941, they were arrested by the Japanese army, suffered abuse, and were forced to do hard labor for three and a half years. One of them was arrested and disappeared while trying to escape with the ship's commander, Smith, and his whereabouts are still unknown. His family urgently needs assistance. In addition, several others were subjected to torture and have become disabled. After the victory of the war against Japan, Smith repeatedly requested the US Navy Department to reissue the salaries that the Chinese crew members deserved during the war and asked to give them lifelong jobs. He has now received the approval of the Commander of the Pacific Fleet, but whether the US Navy Department will approve it is still a question. Therefore, Smith has specifically asked the mayor for assistance.

### Sudden Explosion of Oil Tanker on the Huangpu River

At around 12 noon the day before yesterday, an oil tanker exploded at the border between Gaoqiao Town and Yangjing Town on the Huangpu River, and the fire was unstoppable for a time. Firefighters nearby immediately went to rescue, but the fire hydrant next to the oil tanker had been sabotaged beforehand.

### Gradual Collection and Inspection of Weights and Measures in the City

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau held a discussion meeting on the import of weights and measures yesterday afternoon. Xu Zifan, the director of the Weights and Measures Verification Institute, reported on the import procedures for weights and measures, saying: For the import of weights and measures, the customs must first obtain a permit from the Weights and Measures Verification Institute before it can be imported. The Verification Institute must first obtain a guarantee before issuing the temporary import permit, that is, within four days after picking up the goods, they must be brought to the Institute for verification of whether the system is legal and accurate before the permit is issued. The central government originally did not allow the import of British weights and measures, but now, to take care of merchants, imports are allowed. However, it must be modified, and only after the Verification Institute verifies that it is legal can it be used. Currently, the Verification Institute is gradually verifying all weights and measures in the city. Those that pass the inspection will be affixed with a sample mark, and citizens are asked to pay attention to it.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Zhixiu, Wang Xiangyun, Tai Jianguo, Luo Hongbin, Ma Junjie, Wang Gangqiang, Li Douzhi, Yang Zhiqiang and other eight people repeatedly used counterfeit legal tender (that is, using small tickets or Central Reserve Bank notes wrapped outside large tickets to deceive) to swindle businesses and illegally make profits. They were arrested by the police bureau and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office. Now, Prosecutor Shen Zushou has concluded the investigation and believes that the defendants are engaged in fraud as a regular business. They have been charged with Article 340 of the Criminal Law.

Many people were deceived. After a long time, people noticed it and reported it to the police bureau, who arrested them and sent them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Investigation of Garbage Dumping in the Huangpu River Has No Factual Basis

Unsuitable Transportation Vessels Ordered to Be Replaced by Contractors

The city's garbage transportation work has been contracted out to merchants by the Health Bureau through bidding and has been underway for more than ten days. In recent days, it has been rumored that the Health Bureau has received accusation letters accusing the garbage contractors of dumping garbage into the Huangpu River, which is detrimental to public health. According to Director Yang of the Environmental Sanitation Division of the Health Bureau: After receiving the accusation letter from a certain Mr. Chuan, the Health Bureau immediately sent Technician Jiang to personally take a boat and secretly follow the garbage boat of the contractor for inspection. The investigation result was that there was no factual basis, and the accuser, Mr. Chuan, could not be found either. After investigation, the new contractor has performed well since starting work, but at present, most of the vessels used by the new contractor to transport garbage are unsuitable. If too many tons of garbage are loaded, the ship body will shake during sailing, and garbage on the ship surface will fall into the river at any time, which is also a fact that endangers hygiene. The Bureau has ordered the new contractor to pay close attention and immediately deploy qualified vessels to transport garbage.

### Digging Flesh to Heal Sores, Demolishing Dikes to Repair Dikes - Gaoqiao District Council Reports Bribery by Contractors of Dike Project

[Report from Our Newspaper] Cui Zhiming, Chairman of the Gaoqiao District Council of this city, recently telegraphed the Municipal Council reporting the situation of bribery by contractors of the Seawall Project Team using old dike stones to repair dikes, requesting a thorough investigation and severe punishment. The telegram stated: "According to a telegram from the Gaoqiao District Seawall Project Supervision Committee, the Gaoqiao Seawall Project is huge and the expenses are enormous. How to carefully construct it to prioritize public funds and seek a permanent solution should be a matter of concern. However, it has been found that the three-layer four-stone stones of the outer dike outside the Jinjiazhai in the East Dike (the section from the north end of Changshuitian northward) were transported by the contractors of the Project Team to the outer dike of the Tangjia Tong Dike, which is currently being repaired, and priced as new stones for purchase. Digging flesh to heal sores and demolishing dikes to repair dikes is truly unheard of. Moreover, in broad daylight, without avoiding the eyes and ears of the public, they used vehicles from the Public Works Bureau to transport them. Such a blatant and massive bribery incident has never been heard of. In addition to telegraphed reports to the Supervisory Envoy's Office and the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau, requesting them to send personnel for on-site inspection and verification, this is hereby reported by telegram, requesting a prompt and thorough investigation and severe punishment."

### Verdict in Suspected Case of Bribery in Bidding - Pan Shufan and Others All Not Guilty - No Evidence of Crime in Seeking Welfare for Police Officers

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of bribery in the bidding for cloth by the former Municipal Government Materials Management Office, which Chairman Jiang ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to directly send to the District Court for trial, has been heard by Judge Huang Guangyu. After the debate was concluded, the judgment was pronounced yesterday: "Pan Shufan, Xu Jingbo, and Liao Gongshao are all not guilty." The reasoning for the judgment is briefly stated as follows: The defendant, Pan Shufan, served as the Deputy Director of the Municipal Government Materials Management Office and was actually responsible for office affairs. It was found that the office put up 5,800 bolts of Lanfeng brand bleached cloth for bidding on February 14 last year. The public notice was only given for two days, which does not comply with Article 3 of the Shanghai Municipal Government Materials Management Office's Measures for Bidding and Selling Materials: "The public notice should be given three to five days before the opening of the bids." Moreover, Rongmao Cotton Cloth Company, which won the bid, had not yet joined the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. Pan Shufan, as the person actually in charge, could hardly shirk his responsibility for dereliction of duty. This is an administrative issue. As for the criminal responsibility of the defendant, there is a lack of active evidence of seeking profits. The second defendant, Xu Jingbo, is the Chairman of the Police Welfare Committee of the Municipal Police Bureau, and the third defendant, Liao Gongshao, is the Director of the General Affairs Office of the Police Bureau. They were also accused of forcing the merchant to resell 1,000 bolts at the original price plus 10,000 yuan per bolt after Rongmao won the bid, and were accused of joint corruption. Now, after investigation, it is clear that the resale was aimed at seeking welfare funds for police officers and was approved by Deputy Director Yu Shuping, with no possibility of seeking private gain. Moreover, there was no coercion in the resale, and there is no evidence of a crime. Therefore, a joint acquittal is declared.

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee has actively carried out its work. The Lung Disease Center Clinic, located at 371 Huashan Road, has seen over 3,000 patients. Considering that many young students also suffer from tuberculosis, the Committee has requested students from various universities to launch an anti-tuberculosis street donation campaign on the first Sunday of next month to encourage students to respond to the anti-tuberculosis movement. At that time, 10,000 students will be mobilized to solicit donations along the streets, with a target of 50,000 yuan per person, totaling 500 million yuan.

### Large Quantities of Rice, Wheat, and Soybeans Being Negotiated for Purchase and Will Be Shipped to Shanghai to Stabilize People's Livelihood

[Report from Our Newspaper] The measures taken by the government to increase the sources of supply of major people's livelihood materials can be summarized as follows: (1) Rice: The Food Bureau has entrusted the China Trust Bureau to order 200,000 tons of foreign rice from Vietnam and Burma, to be shipped in monthly quantities. It was originally scheduled to be fully shipped to China by the end of June this year, but due to difficulties in sea transportation, only about 60,000 tons have been shipped so far. In addition to sending personnel to Burma and Siam to supervise transportation, relevant parties have also negotiated with Chinese and foreign shipping companies to expedite the completion of transportation. (2) Wheat: Representatives of the China Trust Bureau are negotiating the purchase of 100,000 tons of wheat in Argentina, which is generally not a problem, but the formal contract is yet to be signed. The other party is responsible for transportation and delivery in Shanghai, and we bear the freight. (3) Soybeans: The China Trust Bureau plans to purchase 200,000 tons in the Northeast. However, due to price fluctuations and transportation difficulties, it is difficult to determine whether it can be fully purchased. Relevant people said: Whether a fixed amount of 8,000 tons per month can be supplied to oil factories in the city at a flat price depends entirely on the transportation situation. The biggest difficulty in soybean transportation is the insufficient railway transportation capacity in the Northeast, followed by the insufficient number of seagoing vessels. President Zhang of the Central Bank recently discussed with Chen Yanjiong, hoping to get more assistance in railway transportation. As long as transportation is no problem, sufficient quantities will be supplied.

### Saving the God of Wealth Under Lingfeng Mountain - Owner of Xinda Xiang Rescued After Abduction - Ding Dading Said to Be Redeemed for 300 Million Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ding Dafu, the owner of Xinda Xiang Silk and Cloth Store on Nanjing Road, took his family by boat to Ningbo (actually Dingjiashan) on the 8th to sweep tombs and host a housewarming banquet. The scene was lavish, and the guests were as numerous as clouds, which was coveted by bandits. On the 13th, at the second hour, four bandits broke in and kidnapped Ding Dafu and He Xiaru. At the same time, they looted cash, gold rings, clothes, and other items, as reported in the previous newspaper. After the incident, the bandits extorted 250,000 US dollars from Ding as a ransom and released He Xiaru first. Subsequently, the Zhenhai County Police Station received a tip that the hostage was hidden in the Dimu Temple at the foot of Lingfeng Mountain. They dispatched many police officers to search, and they found the hostage Ding Dafu inside. Two bandits guarding the hostage were captured on the spot, and Ding Dafu was rescued. Ding has been admitted to the local Huamei Hospital for recuperation due to physical discomfort.

Another report: After Ding was kidnapped, his family contacted the bandits. Because the asking price of 50,000 US dollars was too high, after several trips, they paid 300 million yuan in legal tender to redeem him. Ding himself has arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo on the morning of the 16th.

### Ambush Outside Money Shop to Rob - Sprinkling Pepper Powder and Firing Guns to Resist Arrest - Two Criminals Ultimately Escape

[Report from Our Newspaper] Outside the entrance of Dingkang Money Shop at No. 6, Weiqing Lane, Tianjin Road, at about 1:30 PM yesterday, two robbers lay in wait, focusing on the people going to withdraw money. Not long after, Zhang Huimin, an apprentice from Chunyuan Yarn Shop on Shiji Road, arrived with 5 million yuan for withdrawal. The two robbers saw the large amount of banknotes, and one of them took out a package of pepper powder and sprinkled it on Zhang's eyes, intending to rob him. After Zhang cried out loudly, the two robbers fled. On the way, they fired a shot, fortunately without hurting anyone. The patrolling police heard the alarm and chased after them, blowing whistles. Nearby traffic police gathered upon hearing the sound, but because there were too many pedestrians, the robbers were able to escape. At about 2:10 PM, a No. 3 revolver and three bullets were found next to the Shen Ji Line ladder at No. 37, Shanxi Road. After the shop's bookkeeper reported it to the Bureau of Examination, personnel were dispatched to take the gun and ammunition back. However, whether they belong to the robbers who failed to rob Dingkang Money Shop in Weiqing Lane is under investigation by the Bureau.

### Early News and Ten Major Hospitals Jointly Organize Anti-Tuberculosis Examinations

### Health First!

Our Newspaper Readers Can Apply for Free Check-ups

In order to promote national health and advocate for tuberculosis prevention, this newspaper has specially partnered with ten of the most renowned hospitals in the city, including Zhongshan, Sino-American, Renji, Gongji, Hongren, Municipal Second, Municipal Fourth, Guangci, Nanyang, and Hongqiao, to implement free X-ray examinations for tuberculosis prevention starting from April 20th. All Shenbao readers can apply for free check-ups by following the prescribed procedures. Each period will last for one month, and the program will continue based on actual circumstances, in accordance with the purpose of Shenbao serving society.

The spread of tuberculosis in our country is shockingly severe! According to expert statistics, the mortality rate is 400 out of every 100,000 people. If the national population is estimated at 450 million, approximately 1.8 million people die each year, which is more than the number of deaths on the battlefield or from war disasters and famines during the eight years of the War of Resistance. It can be said that the tuberculosis bacteria is a killer that draws no blood! Shanghai currently has 160,000 tuberculosis patients, with 16,000 deaths each year, which is greater than the total number of deaths from all infectious diseases in the city! Our country's tuberculosis prevention facilities are rudimentary, and most patients belong to the impoverished class. Especially after the war, with difficult living conditions and a harsh environment, many are unable to afford medical treatment after contracting this "disease of the wealthy," leading to transmission to others and creating a terrifying phenomenon! Furthermore, according to expert statistics, most deaths from tuberculosis occur in young people under the age of 25, who are the pillars of our national construction and the masters of the future. If prevention and treatment are not implemented early, the consequences will be unimaginable. Are our beloved readers aware of this?

Our newspaper, in cooperation with ten major hospitals for tuberculosis prevention, is conducting preliminary examinations entirely for advocacy purposes. We hope that the virtuous in society will provide assistance and plan for progress to eradicate this terrible bacterium. We especially hope that young readers will not conceal their illness and avoid medical treatment, bringing misfortune upon themselves. This is a small token of our newspaper's care for the youth. (Note: Free guidelines, a list of hospitals, application forms, and examination procedures will be published in this column starting from the 20th. Please take note.)

### Thoroughly Resolve the Cotton Spinning Crisis: A Unified Production and Sales Plan to Be Implemented; Private Yarn Factories and Government Officials Reach Consensus

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that the cotton spinning industry in this city has recently faced obstacles in the reproduction and survival of the industry due to the price controls implemented by the Standing Bureau, causing price negotiations to deviate from cost prices and creating difficulties in the supply of raw cotton. After repeated research, a thorough reform plan for unified production and sales has been obtained for the future development of cotton weaving. It is understood that the principles adopted include unified supply of raw materials, unified planning of funds, and unified allocation of finished products. The thorough plan has been repeatedly discussed by representatives of various private yarn factories, Wu, concurrently Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, and Zhang, Governor of the Central Bank, and the two sides have reached a consensus. Once the government reorganization is completed next week and the personnel arrangements of various departments are finalized, the thorough plan is expected to be actively promoted and implemented.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and Guo Litian, the executive directors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, visited Zhang, Governor of the Central Bank, at his residence at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. At around 4:00 p.m., they visited Wu, concurrently Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, to discuss the issue of maintaining the reproduction and survival of yarn factories for a considerable time. It is understood that the two sides had quite consistent opinions. Chairman Wu expressed his intention to retain Wang and others who resigned from their positions as members of the Textile Control Committee.

Yesterday, an authoritative figure in the cotton spinning industry in this city told our newspaper reporter that since the negotiated price of cotton yarn in this city has become increasingly detached from the market price, the government's sale of Zhangjiang has only resulted in intermediaries reaping huge profits. Direct consumers have not benefited, and the national treasury has also suffered losses. Furthermore, private yarn factories continue to face difficulties in opening yarn according to negotiated prices, and as a result, both reputation and morality are damaged. Therefore, under the current circumstances, what the authorities are implementing is nothing more than a passive and destructive control. In the absence of a better solution, a unified production and sales plan is still a kind of encouraging control. After the implementation of this plan, raw materials will be supplied by the government in a unified manner, and funds will also be planned by the government in a unified manner. The government will commission various yarn factories to manufacture finished products by placing orders, giving each yarn factory a reasonable profit. Although this profit cannot be used for the development of the business, the problem of reproduction and survival can be easily solved.

Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. At the meeting, Wang Qiyu, Zhao Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, and Zhu reported on the process of resigning from their positions as members of the Textile Control Committee. The attending directors and supervisors expressed their admiration for Wang and others' tireless efforts in mediating multiple times and unanimously supported them. However, it was believed that this resignation was not related to the personal issues of Wang and others, but to the survival of the entire textile industry. The textile industry is related to the overall national economy and the people's livelihood and is extremely important for economic recovery. The current control policies of the authorities are threatening the survival of the industry, and there is a real need to seriously discuss methods of reform. It is understood that the association plans to convene a temporary general meeting of members in the near future to issue a declaration on the difficulties currently facing the industry, preparing to appeal to all sectors of society.

### Stable Government Bonds

Government bonds were stable yesterday, miscellaneous brands flat. Traders in room 503, etc., first exited and then entered, the process thus went from low to high. Unified bonds opened in the morning at 14,100 yuan, the low price was 13,200 yuan, the high price was 14,700 yuan, and finally hovered at 14,000 yuan, a rise of 700 yuan compared to the previous closing. Unified E bonds also rose by 300 yuan, while A, B, and D bonds slightly fell by 100 yuan. In general, people have an optimistic atmosphere towards the reorganized government, and the turnover remained at more than 5 million yuan.

### Foreign Stock Market Declines

Foreign stocks slightly underperformed yesterday. Retail investors and traders in brokerage houses slightly unloaded their holdings. Yi Yarn opened at 40,500 yuan, but the high price did not exceed 41,000 yuan and then declined, with the low price reaching 39,100 yuan, before then presenting a flat picture. Rubber stocks revived buying interest. As a result, shipping and steel stocks each fell by about 10%, while other stocks also fell slightly.

### US Dollar Bonds Can Be Mortgaged to Banks for 70% of the Cash Value

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Responsible officials of the Ministry of Finance stated that the Ministry of Finance has considered the promotion methods for US dollar bonds and short-term treasury bills and has decided that these bonds can be mortgaged to banks for 70% of their value to obtain cash. In this way, the market can be made more flexible, and at the same time, buyers will be encouraged to purchase them, and the main purpose of the issuance and the maintenance of its credit can also be achieved.

### Reasons for Tight Credit

[Our Newspaper's Report] The market credit has been slightly tight recently, and there are rumors that the National Bank secretly intends to tighten it. After inquiries with major banks by the reporter, it was proved that the main reason for the slightly tight credit at that time was due to the sale of a portion of cotton. At the same time, various factories are now paying a portion of their taxes, using up some of their funds. As for US dollar bonds, they do absorb a portion of floating capital. For example, Zhejiang Industrial Bank alone has absorbed more than 3 billion yuan, but from the perspective of the entire market, the impact is not very large.

### The Issuing Department of the National Bank Denies Issuing Large Denomination Notes

Responsible officials from the issuing department of the Central Bank stated that the recent rumors that the department is about to issue 10,000-yuan large denomination notes are completely unfounded. The reporter further inquired about the exact number of 50-yuan Customs Gold Unit (关金券) notes currently in circulation. It was said that the exact number issued could not be disclosed, but in short, the amount issued is still far from meeting the needs of the market. Various banks and firms repeatedly request to exchange Customs Gold Unit notes from the National Bank, but only a limited amount can be paid.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Xu Botuan, Deputy Minister of Finance, told reporters at the Silver Association this afternoon: (If there is a need in the market, 10,000-yuan banknotes can be issued in moderation.) According to the previous meeting of the Legislative Yuan, some legislators passed opinions prohibiting the issuance of large denomination banknotes. The Ministry of Finance then submitted a request to the Executive Yuan based on the actual needs, and the Executive Yuan has replied: that if there is a need in the market, they can be issued in moderation.

### Yarn Merchants Association Holds Meeting to Discuss Difficulties Faced by Members

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Yarn Merchants Association of this city, due to the urgent situation and business difficulties faced by its members, who have flocked to the association to request that the authorities be asked for relief, convened a temporary meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the association, presided over the meeting. Tang reported five difficulties faced by the members: (1) Private factories have not been allocated raw materials for a long time, and they cannot allocate and sell cotton yarn, so members cannot replenish the cotton yarn they sell. The Textile Construction Company only limits each company to one bale, resulting in a phenomenon of imbalance between supply and demand. (2) The price of banknotes in various outer ports is higher than in Shanghai, and they are flocking to Shanghai to purchase them, but due to the negotiated price relationship in Shanghai, the Zhangjiang price cannot be stabilized. The authorities should be asked to reasonably adjust the yarn price. (3) Recently, the authorities have been checking the accounts of the same industry from time to time, and there are even rumors of legal measures being taken, causing members to feel uneasy. Can the authorities be requested to waive the investigation in order to understand the difficulties of the industry? (4) The profit of the industry was previously stipulated at 5%, but now the Textile Construction Company only allocates one bale of yarn to each company, and the profit earned is not enough to cover expenses. Please adjust the profit to maintain operations. (5) Please ask the association to quickly request relief from the competent authorities, increase the amount of yarn allocated, adjust the yarn price, and increase the profit of the yarn merchants. After discussion, it was resolved: In order to protect the business of the members, in addition to accepting the requests of the members, documents will be prepared immediately to request relief from the relevant competent authorities.

[Another Report] The association decided to prepare documents and go to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Garrison Headquarters, the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Textile Control Committee, and other agencies next Monday to request relief.

His business license should be revoked as a warning to others. As for the broker's change of capital, which was not reported, the original was not in compliance, but since the license has been revoked, it can be exempted from further punishment.

### Buyers Wait and See, Transactions Are Sluggish; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Trend Weak; Tianjin Yarn Prices Have Already Fallen Back Yesterday

Cotton yarn was opened for sale by Textile Construction Company as usual yesterday morning. 42-count Jianfeng was listed at 7.55 million, 40-count Football at 6.7 million, 32-count Double Strand Xiantao at 6.8 million, 32-count Yinyue at 5.4 million, and 20-count Xincheng and Tianfunu at 3.6 million. 16-count Jinhu at 3.2 million. 10-count Boy Scout at 2.45 million. Bids outside the market were still mostly flat and weak, and manufacturers and customers remained hesitant. It was heard that 16-count Guangming was trading secretly at 4.7 million, but the rest were sluggish.

Estimated opening of cotton cloth was not smooth. Due to the weak trend yesterday, sentiment was depressed, buying interest was flat, and transactions were very few. Bids continued to decline. Longtou fine cloth was bid at 223,000 yuan, Wufu at 210,000 yuan, Siqun and Riyuan Biji Jin Yin from 217,000 yuan to 213,000 yuan, and the lowest bid was 210,000 yuan. However, among the Shilin cloth, Xiaoji Shilin unexpectedly rose alone, with the factory bid as high as 400,000 yuan, while other Shilin cloth remained unchanged.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee yesterday as usual, totaling 2,647 pieces, including 2,262 pieces for manufacturers and 385 pieces for yarn numbers. Manufacturers submitted a total of 1,504 application forms. A total of 385 households applied for yarn numbers.

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to yesterday's Shen Xinwen, the 20-count Tiannu yarn shipped to outer ports was 6 million yuan per piece (the negotiated price was 3.7 million yuan per piece). It was heard that a telegram came from Shenyang yesterday, stating that the yarn price in that area has reached 10 million yuan per piece due to the Tianjin shipping export relationship. On the Tianjin side, the price has fallen back.

### Chinese Peppermint Shipped to the United States

[US News Agency, New York, 18th] The Business Periodical reported that fresh menthol will be shipped from China to this area at the end of this month. The import of this item will alleviate the general tight supply situation.

### Production Price Reported to Resist, Sales Increase; Grain Market Trend Slightly Eases; Mayor Expresses Strict Crackdown on Black Market

Yesterday, the rice market saw a total arrival of about 1,800 dan (石) from the north and south. Although the source was scarce, the production price in the inland area has turned down, and 100 to 200 ships from the Wuxi and Suzhou areas will be transporting food to Shanghai. High costs might mean some damage to the goods, but once the goods flood in, prices will inevitably fall back. The market price of white yuan and silver yuan is stable, while the market price outside the market has fallen by 10,000 yuan, but there are few buyers.

[Another Report] The Social Affairs Bureau threw out a total of 9,000 bags of white japonica, red Xian, and Dinggong rice at the same price as the previous day. The market trend has eased considerably as a result. Market transactions, apart from the purchase of rationed rice, are very few. Outside the market, the bid for japonica thin rice is still above 170,000 yuan.

Strict Investigation Will Be Conducted for Exceeding the Price Limit

[Another Report] Mayor Wu met with reporters in the Municipal Government conference room yesterday afternoon and said: The rice market has been fluctuating in recent days due to reports of rising prices in the production areas. Now, the government has ordered the suppression of prices in Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places. Although the black market prices in Shanghai are very rampant, they have now fallen back. In the future, the price limit for food rice will still be 130,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau will continue to sell large quantities of white rice and foreign rice. If rice merchants continue to price above the limit, a strict investigation will be conducted, and the black market will be strictly cracked down. Furthermore, the Mayor has scheduled to meet again with the leaders of the rice business and rice shop associations, Cha Bao San and Qu Zhenhua, etc., at 8:30 a.m. this morning. It is reported that they will discuss reducing the retail price. At the same time, the sales price of social rice will also be proportionally reduced, because the rice price in the production area has fallen by 4,000 yuan yesterday, and it is expected to continue to fall in the future.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Prices All Fall

Flour continued to fall by 1,000 yuan yesterday, and bran also weakened by 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake followed and fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Edible oil was allocated according to party affiliation, but outside the market, it plummeted by more than 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil also dropped sharply by 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were sluggish and fell again by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame and other items followed the downstream and fell back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum weakened slightly. Wheat fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to the decline in the flour market.

Soybeans turned strong by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan because oil factories still have some demand. They are hovering in a circular pattern. Broad beans still sold well and rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, while raw peanuts, sesame, soybeans, rapeseed, etc., which are all raw materials for oil production, have been banned from export.

### Foreign Firms' Tea Has Few Actual Sales

Yesterday's tea market in foreign firms, since the sellers' intention to sell has slightly improved, the trend has not been as loose as in recent days, and prices have been barely maintained. However, transactions were still unremarkable due to the lack of smooth negotiations between buyers and sellers. Only Wang Yutai and Wuchang have been involved in recent days. As for domestic sales of tea, supply and demand are difficult to distinguish, and it is unusually peaceful.

### High Tung Oil Prices Hinder Sales

The tung oil market situation yesterday was that the Hankou position was extremely tight, banks could not provide timely transportation, inventory was weak, and the exchange rate soared, causing tung oil to rise by 60,000 yuan. It is worried that apart from a small amount of domestic sales in the market yesterday, the foreign sales market has been very limited, because foreign prices have been cut again, and domestic prices have exceeded foreign spot prices, with little trading.

### Carrying National Currency Out of the Country Is Not Allowed to Exceed 500,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jianghai Customs issued a notice: According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, it is stipulated that anyone traveling from various places in China to Hong Kong or other regions outside the country, the national currency carried by each traveler shall not exceed 500,000 yuan, unless approved by the Ministry of Finance and issued a passport. Those who carry more than the prescribed amount will have all the excess amount confiscated.

### Fish Vendors Resumed Operations Yesterday; Mediation Extended for One Week; Both Parties Seek Solutions Externally

[Our Newspaper's Report] The fish vendors in this city who went on strike before have resumed operations yesterday under the persuasion of the Social Affairs Bureau. The fish vendors association went on strike previously to oppose the establishment of a joint cashier's office by the Fish Business Association to implement a unified collection method. After the Social Affairs Bureau convened mediation, it was decided to postpone the establishment of the joint cashier's office, and the fish vendors resumed operations first.

Yesterday afternoon, the bureau convened representatives of both sides again to discuss unfinished matters. Due to the fish vendors' insistence on opposing the joint cashier's office organization, the negotiations were unsuccessful. However, both sides, remembering their past cooperation, were unwilling to create rifts because of this, so they agreed to seek solutions externally, with a deadline of one week. The negotiation results will be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau one week later.

As for the Haichan Transportation and Sales Association's request for compensation from the fish market for the losses suffered due to the delay of more than 4,000 dan of goods due to the fish vendors' strike, it was not discussed yesterday because the representatives did not arrive.

### Random Notes from a Visit to Northern Shaanxi (3): A Stroll Through "Liangshanbo"

— Yan'an Nine-Day Express News, Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhu

If we were to divide the Shaanxi map into two circles, one centered on Guanzhong and the other on Yan'an, Luochuan would probably be the dividing point. South of Luochuan, it is currently a paradise on earth, while north of it, there is a sky filled with sand and wind, with fluctuating temperatures.

Yan'an is regarded as "Liangshan," and it is said that many people came here in the past because they were "forced" to. After living here for a week, Yan'an makes me feel a distance from many things in Xi'an. There are no rows of Western-style houses here, nor crisscrossing streets. There are only two simple main streets, forming an irregular T-shape. A dozen years ago, Yan'an was just a small town of four or five thousand people. After the Communists arrived here in the twenty-third year, after more than a decade of development, they touted it as the "Red Capital," making people feel somewhat like "Liangshanbo" in "Water Margin." It is said that at its peak, there were about 100,000 people (around 1928-29). My impression of Yan'an is that it is chaotic, small, and simple, in short, a small city.

Miscellaneous Scenes Within the City

In Yan'an, you will find few trees, few people (the current population within the city is seven or eight thousand), few wastelands, few shops, and few door panels on the street houses. Whether it's the earthen mountains surrounding Yan'an or the various counties in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia "Border Region," apart from the mountainsides that have been cultivated into fields, there is nowhere that is forested. However, you will also find many auditoriums, many empty houses, and many women and children (comparatively speaking); In these few days, we have seen six or seven large auditoriums. Apart from a few that are quite well-built, most are not very exquisite, without paint, carvings, or ceilings. Only at the entrance is there usually a patterned painting, representing the symbol of the auditorium.

The prices here are very high, about half as much again as in Xi'an. Most businesses are not open, only many small stalls on the street, selling mostly cigarettes and daily necessities, all transported from Xi'an. Occasionally, there are cigarettes and pencils left over from the past, but they are all broken and unusable, but the matches are still usable. The people have a good relationship with the National Army, the elderly are very happy, young people are rarely seen on the street, and the women hope for a quick, peaceful life. More and more people are returning every day. If you often stroll on the street, you will find that Yan'an is much warmer than it was a few days ago.

Desolate Abandonment

We have visited the residences and offices of former personnel, and these places are now desolate and abandoned, with courtyards full of messes. Although most of the buildings are not magnificent, they are much better than the residences of the ordinary people in northern Shaanxi.

Yangjialing is north of the Yan River, about five or six li from Yan'an. This is where the CCP Central Committee was located, and there is a large auditorium with a "red star" and hammer and sickle symbol above the door. The stage inside is very grand, and the CCP's plenary sessions in recent years (after 1940) have all been held here. On the north side of the hall is a large dance hall, with a highly polished floor. It is said that many dances have been held here, and this is the "recreational activity resort" for CCP officials. Further north are the dining hall and library, which are quite luxurious, no less than those in Xi'an. Due to the lack of wood in the vicinity of Yan'an, there are very few houses for the residents, and they are all arched cave dwellings built of adobe, with large windows and plenty of light. From ordinary people to CCP officials, they all live in this kind of house. Mao Zedong's former residence is on the slope north of the CCP Central Library. There are a few pieces of wooden furniture in the cave, and outside there is a small kitchen. The only difference between this and other rooms is that there are springs on the dilapidated sofa. In this courtyard, there are four cave dwellings, and to the northeast, there are eight cave dwellings built exactly the same. It is said that these are the residences of Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and others.

CCP Army Headquarters

The headquarters of the Eighteenth Group Army (i.e., the CCP Army) is also a hall, but it is not very large and is also very simple. Next to the hall are three caves, each with three cave dwellings below. These were the offices of Peng Dehuai and Lin Biao, etc., a long time ago. These many guest rooms are built against the mountain, with bridges separating them on all sides. There is a courtyard, with inner and outer courtyards, each with four rooms. The outer courtyard is the office, and the inner courtyard is Zhu De's bedroom. There are many kinds of wooden furniture in the room. (In fact, there is just as much wooden furniture in Zhu and Mao's room, and it is all made very sturdy and painted yellow.) Every two cave dwellings are connected together, with small holes in the middle. You can't walk near the base of the wall, and landmines that have not been swept away are still buried underground. On the large parade ground, many captured militiamen are standing. These people are all ragged, but they have no color on their faces. They don't seem to have much feeling about the Battle of Yan'an, and they have a bit of a "carefree" attitude. North of the parade ground, there is a large camp-style building. Due to time constraints, we didn't go to see it and wanted to return immediately.

A Full View of Zaoyuan

Anyone who has been to Yan'an says that "Zaoyuan" is the place with the best scenery, and this is the residence of "Labor Hero" Wu Manyou. Since this "hero" "voluntarily" "donated" the land, it has become the residence of CCP officials. There are large pear trees and peach trees in the garden, and now they are all budding, full of spring. The entire garden covers more than 300 mu, with a small dance hall in the middle, the floor of which is highly polished. On the wall hangs a plaque with the words "Savior of the People." Not far to the southwest of the dance hall are three Western-style houses, said to be the residences of foreign advisors when the CCP occupied Yan'an. There were often more than 20 people living here. In the kitchen near the three Western-style houses, we saw thirteen Western-style stoves. Mao Zedong also had a residence here. It is said that this is his summer villa, located on a high place on the hillside, overlooking the entire garden. The house is a small chapel-style Western-style building, with many thatched roofs on top, probably for shelter. There are three offices, two dormitories, and a "wireless room" equipped quite completely. Now all the important things have been moved away, leaving only some farm implements and the remnants of the electric wires on the walls.

At the entrance of Zaoyuan are the words "Yan Garden," which is the name changed after the CCP came to Yan'an. Kang Sheng and Chen Yun's residences are near Mao's residence, all in a row of four or five cave dwellings. In the mountainous areas near the garden, there are air-raid shelters that penetrate into the bedrock of the mountain, which are quite dangerous.

The Desolation of the Old City

The old city of Yan'an has not been rebuilt since the Japanese planes bombed it wildly in 1928 and 1929. Now, as the car speeds past, all that can be seen is broken tiles everywhere, a desolate scene.

He Long's headquarters is now the Farmer-Soldier Hospital. On the walls of the CCP Party School, there are slogans left over from opposing the Central Committee. Like other places, there are no large trees in the courtyard, only willow trees that are about a zhang tall.

Yan'an University is at the southern end of the New Market. Apart from the auditorium and kitchen, there are only two or three classrooms and more than a hundred cave dwellings. There are many trenches in the aisles of the school. There are things buried underground. When I walked past, I saw several soldiers digging up many wooden boards and broken books from the underground cave.

The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government is the residence of the reporters. Many "guests" live in the two rows of cave dwellings. The place where Lin Boqu used to work is now our dining hall. The interiors of the cave dwellings here are all plastered with lime, clean and tidy, and the exteriors are all walled with stone strips and built with corridors. In the barren northern Shaanxi, this is indeed considered quite magnificent.

The Border Region Assembly has only one auditorium. The Xinhua Bookstore has also left behind only an empty room. The Border Bank is the best and most magnificent building.

Impoverished to the Bone

Before coming to Yan'an, someone told me that northern Shaanxi was a place for people on business trips, but after I arrived, I found that the people of northern Shaanxi are now truly impoverished to the bone, living in broken houses and wearing clothes patched with thousands of stitches. Apart from the tattered clothes, the people of northern Shaanxi are quite healthy.

Although the Yan'an market is gradually recovering, it seems that I have not heard any specific plans on how to allocate so many CCP army residences and offices. The current problem should be to try to bring everything back to normal. The "Moscow of the East," the modern "Liangshanbo," is poor, chaotic, and narrow.

Cave Dwellings or Mansions?

Before withdrawing from Yan'an, CCP leaders lived in magnificent mansions and spent their lives there. (Top) A panoramic view of the CCP "Central Auditorium." (Bottom) After the National Army recovered Yan'an, residents returned to their hometowns one after another. Relief funds were distributed to poor women and children, and a National Army Service for the People Office was specially set up to be in charge of relief matters.

Spring and Autumn

### On Organizing a Branch of the "Writers Association": A Belief, An Attitude

— Wang Jinshan

On January 26, 1946, when the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Workers and Writers Association was organized and established in Chongqing, I wrote a short essay. The general idea was:

China's literary and artistic land is originally a desolate wilderness of weeds. Moreover, it has gone through eight years of catastrophe, and there are so many things to do. Writers, who are shamelessly human spirit technicians, are "carrying a heavy burden and a long road." Therefore, we sincerely hope that writers across the country should first unite and unite by party, and the national literary and art circles should first unite and unite for national unity. Furthermore, we should take the democratic unity of the group as a model for the democratic unity of the whole country; and the writers' self-respect and mutual respect should be the basis for the people's self-respect and mutual respect, participation in politics, and constitutional governance.

Although this is a piece of artistic talk from more than a year ago—at that time it was during the political consultation period—now that times have changed and I am revisiting the old work, I am truly overwhelmed with emotion. However, my belief has not changed: I always believe that literature and art are beyond politics, that groups are not the tails of parties, and that literary and artistic undertakings are the undertakings of all mankind. In addition to having the rights and obligations of a national citizen to the country, writers do not necessarily express the narrow political opinions of political parties in their writing. Of course, I do not deny that modern writers are not all politically neutral, or that writers do not want to participate in political activities: however, that is another matter. If we only talk about a writer's writing, it is not necessary to confuse political propaganda and pure literary creation.

The theme of a work is based on the writer's thoughts and personality, and is a reflection of the writer's worldview and real life. However, this has the difference between breadth and narrowness, and the difference between abstract and concrete from the political propositions of political parties. Strictly speaking, the responsibility of a writer is to be faithful to his feelings, faithful to his experiences, grasp his emotions, and reflect life in response to reality. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," Mao Dun's "Midnight," and Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," etc., have all faithfully fulfilled this responsibility, so they have won a wide range of readers and audiences.

Some people say that literary and artistic undertakings are a kind of emotional education, and I agree. I also believe that it is emotion that stimulates creativity in our thoughts and behaviors, that makes the writer's life and his works one, and that what radiates the light like the stars in the dark night is emotion. And the key to the one heart connection, association and combination between writers and writers, that is, between people, is also emotion. —Emotion is the greatest mystery in the universe.

Therefore, the organization of a writer's group is not a passive act of agreeing with one's own kind and rejecting others, but an active act to promote friendship and mutual assistance.

"Birds chirping softly, seeking their friend's voice," this is the feeling of emotional response of species; "Gathering friends with literature, assisting benevolence with friends," this is the feeling of emotional response of literati. Unaffected and extremely natural. Therefore, a writer's participation in a group organization only asks whether you are faithful to art, faithful to your feelings and experiences, and if you do not deny your enthusiasm, but also love free writing; then no one needs to ask anyone's religious beliefs or political relations. Everyone is a good friend, (Even if the smell is not completely compatible, it is not necessarily an enemy.) Everyone can shake hands and work together in the literary and artistic garden that has become even more barren after the war.

World culture has never had a force that can stop its exchange. Why can't a limited number of writers in a country get along harmoniously? At this year's drama festival, we saw a grand gathering of the drama world, no longer distinguishing between Nan Tian and Bei Xiong, or Mei school and Qi school; local operas and dramas, crosstalk and singing were all performed on the same stage. Zhuang Zhou said: "The carp in the dried rut, moisten each other with saliva, and breathe each other." Because we can't aspire to rivers and lakes yet! Therefore, I believe even more that this is the beginning of a new stage of the Chinese New Culture Movement, and it is also the dawn of the Chinese Renaissance. Therefore, in the literary and art world, there is no longer any left wing or right wing, Beijing school or Shanghai school; the Literary Research Association and the Creation Society have long been integrated together, and the Yu Si Society and the Modern Society have also become a family. What everyone needs now is to jointly establish a new belief in creation and create a new style of modern Chinese literature and art.

Recently, the Writers Association wants to organize a branch in Shanghai. Several friends talked about this issue. Of course, some people inevitably have some concerns; I said that this kind of organization is actually needed. Shanghai is the cultural center of the country, and it is also the confluence of cultural exchanges; the Shanghai Writers Association not only affects writers across the country, but the Shanghai Writers Association is also concerned by China and foreign countries, and is noticed by writers around the world. Therefore, I feel that since an organization is needed in objective fact, what needs to be considered is not whether there is a conflict with groups of a similar nature, but whether we can organize a "real" writers' own group. Because a "real" group is a combination of the personalities of people, an exchange of emotions; and only through "truth" can "goodness" be accomplished, and "beauty" can be developed—this is my belief.

Based on this belief, I feel even more that every writer may as well actively participate in the organization of the Writers Association branch: First, break the past concepts of leadership and the boss system, no one monopolizes it, and no one is allowed to manipulate it; do not accept government subsidies, do not seek social relief, and do as much as you can with as much power as you have. Purely based on friendship as a binder and mutual assistance as a sustaining force, not only is it unnecessary to build a large door, but even the boundaries of the surrounding walls should not exist; if there must be boundaries, then it is the boundaries of the entire literary and art world. Only ask whether you are a writer, whether you are a writer residing here. If so, then you should extend the hand of friendship to express a sincere welcome, and welcome everyone to organize a Shanghai writers' own group together. —This is an attitude of mine toward this kind of organization.

If a group, in addition to the emotional connection and business cooperation between members mentioned above, must also have its realistic goals, then, in my opinion, the goal of this group is at most to strive for freedom of writing and publishing, and to protect the rights of writing and publishing; and then to establish a free style of modern Chinese literature and art, and promote the revival of modern Chinese literature and art. Therefore, it not only does not conflict with existing literary and art groups, and will not cause friction, but it should also be hoped that similar sister groups will continue to emerge. Because this is not a party organization, nor is it a guild combination. Similar groups can complement each other, and of course, they may also undergo metabolism. A writer may well participate in more than two similar groups; and two sister groups may also jointly hold various activities. In this way, writers can walk in front of politics, value their own mission, and respect our tasks. In this way, the group will have its future, and literature and art can become a common undertaking of mankind that will last forever—this is another view of mine.

P.S.: The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Writers Association now has a number of membership registration forms, and entrusts the Chunqiu Editorial Office of this newspaper to handle the membership application procedures on its behalf. Those who are interested in joining, please attach a return envelope for a letter, and the deadline is at the end of the month.

### Hongwei Old Man's Painting Exhibition

— Fang Jiekan

In the autumn of Bingxu year, Hongwei Old Man came to Shanghai from Chongqing. Coincidentally, his nephew Zheng Zimanqing was also holding a painting exhibition in Shanghai, so he went to visit him immediately. Although the old man is nearly seventy years old, his ears and eyes are sharp, and his spirit is strong, like someone in his forties; he can be said to be blessed by nature. The old man said that he had obtained the method of meditation, and that he had achieved this through it. It can be said that books and paintings can not only benefit the world, but also that those who are nourished by nature's essence will surely enjoy a long life. People in the world often discuss that the emphasis of calligraphy and painting should be on brush and ink, and that the spirit should be the main thing. If the spirit is insufficient, then nothing can be accomplished, not to mention artistic matters. I said that the brush and ink can be used to observe the original thinness of the blessings and longevity of the ancients. The old man's painting skills are exquisite, and his workmanship is deep. He has long been highly praised at home and abroad. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once inscribed the words "Comparable to Xu and Huang" and presented them to him, which is a well-known story in the art world. For a year since then, the old man has been wielding his brush day and night, studying hard and never tired. He has created more than a hundred works of flowers, birds, grass, insects, trees, and rocks. Most of them are painted with meticulous outlines, and the colors are ancient and beautiful, lifelike. The calligraphy is elegant and graceful, obtaining the essence of Chu Suiliang. The poems are also fresh and light, with the charm of the Song Dynasty, which is even more precious. I said that meticulous brushwork is the most difficult to be lively. If you only engage in depiction, it will be stiff and lack spirit, and it will not be taken seriously by those who know art; the key to this is the precision of the outline; if it is precise, it will be lively and spirited, and its meaning and expression will often come from outside the brush and ink, and the aura of harmony and simplicity will overflow on the paper, making it tireless to watch. Now the old man is indeed better than and no less than this, so it is not accidental that the world treasures every inch of silk and paper he creates. Now the old man has taken out his recent works to be exhibited at the China Painting Gallery, making them public to the world. The world knows it, and I know that there will definitely be a crowd one after another to view the masterpiece and be happy.

### Kite—Yangzhou Continued Dream No. 14

The "Yangzhou Painting Boat Record" says: "Kites are popular during Qingming Festival. The sound is in the bow, and the force is in the tail. The large ones are one zhang square, and the tail is up to two or three zhang long. The style is mostly rectangular, called a board door. The rest are mostly crabs, centipedes, dragonflies, butterflies, 'Fu' characters, and 'Shou' characters, followed by Chen Miaochang's meeting with the monk, the old camel and the young camel, and Chu Bawang. And things like rejoicing, and universal peace, are extremely ingenious in craftsmanship. In the evening, they often hang lights on the tail, up to three or five in a row." According to what I saw in my childhood, there are many differences. When it comes to "Kites are popular during Qingming Festival," it has always been so, and it is the same everywhere. If "the sound is in the bow," it should depend on the size of the kite. The smaller ones do not have bows, so naturally there is no sound to be heard. The larger ones use cattail bows, the larger ones use rattan bows, and the largest ones use bamboo bows. All of them are made by scraping the cattails, rattan, and bamboo extremely thin to serve as bowstrings. As for "the force is in the tail," this is not the case for all kites. For example, centipedes (called "centipedes" by the people of Yangzhou). Regardless of size, they are all tailless. Among other finely made kites, such as crabs, dragonflies, and butterflies, they are also tailless. There are also single tails, double tails, and triple tails. The tails used for small kites are just thin string coins, while the larger ones require thicker ropes. What is called "the style is mostly rectangular, called a board door," the board door refers to the larger ones, and the smaller ones are called gluten bubbles. The method of making gluten bubbles is extremely simple, and the price is extremely cheap. Most of the kites flown by children belong to this type.

The form of kites can be roughly divided into two types, large and small. Among the small ones, in addition to gluten bubbles, most of them are high-quality products. What is called "extremely ingenious in craftsmanship" is indeed worthy of the name. The prices are not cheap, especially small centipedes are the most expensive. Because the quality of small centipedes depends not only on whether they are tied beautifully, but also on whether the whole body is symmetrical. If it is slightly asymmetrical, it will continue to somersault when released into the sky, and finally fall back into the dust. This somersaulting of kites is called "calling" by the people of Yangzhou. Small centipedes have about a dozen sections, including the head and tail. It is considered a high-quality product if it can be released into the sky and be able to dance in a lively manner without somersaulting and falling. In addition, crabs, dragonflies, butterflies, eagles, and beauties all belong to the small category, and most of them are fine products. Very few ordinary children fly this type of kite, so it becomes the exclusive product of wealthy young masters and silk-clad young men.

In addition to board doors in the large category, there are also hexagons, octagons, nine-linked lanterns, large centipedes, etc. Small kites can be flown with cotton thread or silk thread, but these large ones must use hemp rope, and they cannot be controlled well by one or two people. Those who fly this type of kite are mostly adults, and mostly lower-class people who are fond of courage and fighting. After releasing them into the sky, they will tie the rope to a tree, and then gather in groups of three or five to chat and appreciate them. Smaller kites, if they happen to touch their ropes, are always entangled and difficult to separate, and eventually become vassals of their large kites, floating beside them. They are the victors, and they will clap and cheer for a while, while the losers can only be depressed. Especially the children, often holding back their tears, staring up for a long time, before leaving three steps back and two steps back. Occasionally, if they encounter opponents of similar strength, they will roll up their sleeves and bare their arms, first scolding each other, and then fighting each other.

These many large kites, in addition to bows, also have bells or whistles. The sound of the bow is loud, the sound of the bell is clear, and the sound of the whistle is clear. They echo in the sky at the same time, which is quite pleasing to the ear. Most of them are not taken down in the evening, and some red lanterns are added to the ropes. Whether what the "Wing Navigation Record" says about "tying lights to the tail" is a misremembered by Li Dou, or whether it is different from the past, is unknown.

In the past, the locations for flying large kites, in addition to outside the city, were the Dawangbian in the old city and Kangshan in the new city. Since there are more and more houses in Kangshan, and there is less and less open space, and the Dawangbian was built as a school, it is not easy to find a suitable location in the city. In addition, Yangzhou is declining day by day. From an economic point of view, and from an emotional point of view, it is not permissible for large kites to appear in the sky. In the past, in Yangzhou, during the March fireworks season, one could hear the sound of kites in the sky all day long, and see many red lanterns at night. Now, however, one only feels the loneliness of the sky lining the aging of Yangzhou.

In addition, it must be mentioned that the large centipedes in the past were best made by the Mei family village outside Guangchu Gate. The villagers made centipedes in their spare time from farming, some up to more than a hundred sections long. Every spring, there are always two or three large centipedes tied to the trees in front of the village, ready to be flown into the sky. Buyers can choose on the spot, and if they feel that one is stable, they can specify that one and negotiate the price.

Finally, the "Painting Boat Record" also says: "Recently, new Western-style lanterns have been made, taking the image of kites, but without using thread. The method is to use cotton paper without flaws or holes, one foot and four inches long and one foot and two inches wide, to reduce its elasticity. Attach its edges like a hub; cut bamboo strips into rings as large as the paper, and attach the paper to them. Two copper wires are interlaced and tied in the middle, and a very thin copper sheet is placed at the intersection. Walls are made of Qiao wood all around, and hemp is spread in the middle. The hemp is soaked in mature sorghum wine, and yellow and white wax, sulfur, tidal brain, and wolf dung are spread on top, and lit with fire. Let four strong people hold the paper with the side facing up that does not have a bamboo ring, and the Yan medicine rises, not letting it go from above, as large as the evening star, and it falls overnight." I used to see this occasionally in my childhood, but in recent years, not only have I not seen it again, but no one talks about it anymore.

### Portrait

— Manet

Manet (E. Manet 1830-1880) was an important figure among the Impressionist artists. Impressionism was a school of painting that arose with the prosperity of science in the nineteenth century. Their main pursuit was "light" and "color." The technique advocated was quick and simple, and emphasized brushstrokes (Tauch). The subject matter was the same as that of the Realist school, absolutely unrestricted. They just particularly emphasized "light."

This is one of Manet's proudest works, a portrait completed in two hours with colored strokes. The colors are bright but not vulgar, and the expression is just right. (Lion)

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 400

— Ye Jingfeng

After Elder Hou Hejian finished speaking, he immediately gave the young man two instructions. After the young man led Zheng Yan away, the elder translated the two instructions to Hejian, fearing that Hejian might misunderstand.

"What kind of relationship do you have with Miss Nakamura?"

"Miss Nakamura is a friend of a comrade of ours in Peiping. Our comrade sent a telegram stating that this lady is very sympathetic to our group's movement and therefore wishes to meet her."

"You probably know she is Japanese?" Hejian said with a cold smile.

"We know... but there are also quite a few people in your country who sympathize with our group's movement!"

"You probably know Miss Nakamura's position?"

"We only know that she is a powerful figure in your military's special affairs agency," the elder said, each word steady and deliberate.

"Then you still trust her?"

"Her actions, at least, are not harmful to us!"

"How so?"

"We also have a very sound organization, and our information is very well-informed."

"Why didn't you know that Miss Nakamura disappeared this morning?" "This matter is a bit too unexpected," the elder raised his hand, gently stroking his sparse long beard, revealing a thoughtful expression. "We only received this news at 11 o'clock this morning..."

"Then, your subordinates are still waiting in the park?" Hejian's tone implied some criticism.

"We hope that Miss Nakamura is safe and sound; at the same time, we also want to leave this as a contingency plan to see if anything more unexpected will happen. Therefore, we did not withdraw the people from the park and ordered them to pay closer attention..."

"There are more than ten in total: inside and outside the park?" Hejian wanted to confirm whether his observation before getting into the car outside the park was correct.

### On Poetry

— Polo

Poetry has the possibility of harmony, nature, and beautifying life; within it burns true inspiration and is filled with beautiful thoughts. Its emotion can make our spirit joyful, and its thought can irrigate our hearts; it is a song that stirs people's blood, a melody that moves people's hearts.

### Random Musings While Alone

— Wang Cong

When I was young, I heard a story;

It probably happened during the reign of Emperor Dezong of the Qing Dynasty. Famine, coupled with the existing oppressive policies, left the people of several southeastern provinces unable to breathe. More than a thousand kind fishermen along the coast of eastern Zhejiang were forced to become pirates. The court repeatedly sent troops to suppress the "bandits," but unfortunately, none of them were successful. This incident actually reached the ears of the "Master of All Under Heaven." At that time, there was a clever servant, who was called the "Parent Official of the People," the county magistrate, who came up with a good idea: falsely claiming that he was acting on imperial orders to offer amnesty, guaranteeing these thousand-plus people food and clothing. This group of so-called pirates, naturally, were happy to return, having received a guarantee for their lives. They all believed that this "parent official appointed by the court" could bring them blessings.

How could they have known that this was a trap set by the "Parent Official"? Over a thousand heads were lost thanks to the magistrate's brilliant plan. Then, the magistrate, having been recognized for his "wit," had a smooth career, rising from a "parent" of a county to a "parent" of a prefecture, and then to… removing the blue cap and putting on a red cap.

At that time, a concerned person wrote two lines of poetry for the red cap of this official:

"Pitiable are the countless lives of the people, whose blood has dyed the red dot on the鳌头(aò tóu, the champion's name on the list of successful candidates in the highest imperial examination)."

This story is filled with a sense of sadness. Even now, when I think of it, it is still deeply imprinted in my mind.

Beneath the official robes, above the halls of power, who knows how much blood and tears of the common people there are?

### Freezing and Thawing

— Jue Ren

Spring has passed, and the weather of early summer has arrived.

Nowadays, everything in society is inconsistent with its name and reality. Contradictory and absurd symbols are presented before people's eyes, truly too many to count. Logically speaking, the timing of nature and human affairs should be coordinated. Spring behaving like summer is certainly wrong, but spring behaving like winter is even worse. Summer has arrived, and the season of "treading on spring ice and walking on a tiger's tail" is over. There shouldn't be any more ice. "Summer insects cannot discuss ice," as the ancients said, but today there are indeed real examples because there is too much artificial ice in the summer. Even though they are "summer insects," they should be able to "discuss ice." (Everything is artificial, and not just artificial ice.)

Artificial ice is cold and ruthless, not only changing the climate but also changing human life. The vast wealth of Chinese rich men in foreign banks can remain unfrozen, while the cost of living for the domestic lower classes is frozen. It has been frozen since the cold weather, and it is still not thawing in the summer. This is naturally unrelated to "spring ice is thin, and human feelings are even thinner."

Moreover, freezing the cost of living is not the only problem. It also freezes all production industries.

A certain newspaper carried a special dispatch from Jingdezhen, with the headline:

"In the Season of Growing Grass and Flying Orioles, the Spring Kilns of Jingdezhen are Frozen."

The original manuscript said it well:

"Spring returns to the earth, and the east wind thaws the ice. This is a season of vitality. According to custom, the so-called break during the Lunar New Year is at most ten and a half days. Who would have thought that January, February, March, and April have passed, and Jingdezhen has not seen a single chimney of a porcelain kiln emitting smoke?..."

Why is there such a tragic scene? In a word, the spring kilns are also frozen!

The kiln industry is like this, and most other industries are also frozen. If we say that the reason for all this freezing is because there was ice in the past, there is certainly a reason.

In the "Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government: Tang Dynasty, Tian Huan Eleventh Year," Zhang Bao, a Jinshi from Shan County, said to people, "You rely on Prime Minister Yang, just like Tai You. I think of you as relying on ice. If the bright sun comes out, will you not lose what you rely on?"

Obviously, this iceberg has already been melted by the bright sun today. Everything should be able to thaw, whether it is life or production. But in reality, there is no sign of thawing. Has the bright sun not yet come out? We cannot help but be deeply worried about this.

### Sticking to One's Profession

— Guo Hua

Pickpocket (visiting a friend in prison)! "Today, I hired a lawyer for you, but I had to give him my watch as a retainer."

Friend—"Did he take it?"

Pickpocket—"He thinks he did."

### Really?

Child: —What does a lawyer do, Dad?

Dad: —A lawyer is a person who encourages two people to take off their clothes and fight, and then he takes their clothes and leaves.

### Lana Turner and Van Johnson in "State Fair"

### Letters from Overseas

— Jian

Speaking further about the general reaction in England towards our country, it's truly hard to put into words.

The news from home is bad, and we are looked down upon abroad. Just talking about the present, the New Fourth Army has problems, there are riots in Taiwan, Dalian and Lushun have not yet been received, and there is a famine in western Hunan. It's truly heartbreaking. Now, England, standing in the position of an ally, is raising funds to relieve the victims of the famine in western Hunan. Posters are being put up everywhere, and each cinema is showing the conditions of the disaster in western Hunan, in order to arouse the sympathy of the general British people. In reality, how can people bear to watch it?

Now, we don't dare to go ashore—in our free time every day, we can take a small ferry to visit the streets. When we walk on the streets, many men, women, old, and young people point at us and discuss Chinese affairs. Sometimes, they even stop us and ask many questions that are difficult to answer at once. Therefore, even if the classmates are bored, they have to stay at home. We are now launching a fundraising campaign, and in less than three days, we have already raised over a thousand pounds. We are now discussing how to remit it back to the motherland, so that no one skims off the top and it can directly reach the hands of the refugees.

I still need to continue packing my luggage, so I won't write much more. Tomorrow is the first day of our Long Leave. This time, I am being sent to Carlisle, because the gentlemen of that place have sent a letter inviting the Chinese Navy to visit, and everything will be taken care of by the local gentlemen. However, I am afraid that I will encounter many accusations about Chinese issues again, but no matter what, I am still happy, because I feel that all the difficulties that China is currently encountering are precisely the phenomena that must occur before national construction.

### Li Wenzhong—Dying at the Right Time

— Mu Tao

After the Sino-Japanese War, although Wenzhong was no longer the Minister of Beiyang, he still held the position of Grand Scholar of the Wenhua Hall and was soon appointed as the Minister in charge of Foreign Affairs. The system of the Zongli Yamen (Office for Foreign Affairs) was also led by a prince, similar to the Grand Council. Hefei (Li Hongzhang) was old and experienced and often insisted on his own views, and even the presiding official could do nothing about it. Therefore, in Weng Songlun's diary, there are often satirical remarks, and sometimes the discussions in the central court were secretly kept from him. (The Grand Council ministers were summoned every day, but the Zongli Yamen was not.) This is ridiculous.

Hefei was dignified and tolerant and never complained about the Eastern Dynasty. What he often discussed was that after the death of the late Minister (Zeng Guofan), there were too few people in the same position with a global perspective. After the Restoration (Tongzhi Restoration), not only was there no construction to compare with the energetic efforts of various countries to strengthen their war preparedness, but the difference was too great. In the future, diplomacy will be even more difficult to handle with a weak country. He could not help but regret it.

In the Wuxu year (1898), Hefei took up the post of Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi. Therefore, during the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year (1900), he was able to cooperate with the two Governors, Liu and Zhang, to protect the overall situation in the Southeast. Hefei made a great contribution to the Qing Dynasty. If Hefei had still been in Beijing during the Gengzi year, he would have suffered the same fate as Xu Xu and the other officials. Therefore, if Hefei had died before the Sino-Japanese War, in his position as the Governor-General of Zhili, the public opinion would have been mixed, and his true intentions would have been difficult to understand. If he had died from a Japanese bullet, it would have been lighter than a feather. Even if he had died when he was dismissed from his post at Xianliang Temple, his overall evaluation would have been uncertain. Only when the Allied forces entered Beijing and the two palaces went on a western hunt, and he re-entered Beijing to preside over the peace talks, exhausting his efforts to extend the Qing Dynasty's life by ten years, did his loyalty to the country become clear to the world. How can we not say that he died at the right time?

### Distinguished Guests Fight Fire

— Lei Ke

A certain large hotel in New York recently caught fire. At that time, the former Dutch diplomat Baron Qiu Lin and his wife were hosting distinguished guests. Therefore, the guests present and other residents on each floor all waved portable fire extinguishers, laid water hoses, and assisted in the rescue. The Duke of Windsor, the former British king who loved the beauty more than the country, was also among them. These distinguished guests did not excessively cherish their precious lives and were actually able to brave all kinds of dangers and fight against the fire god. It is truly worthy of our admiration.

In the initial stage of the fire outbreak, before the firefighters arrived, this short moment was the most important juncture. If the people on the scene could bravely provide assistance at this time, the effect would be far greater than the work that the firefighters could do after the fire had spread. This is why the fire fighting of the distinguished guests is valuable and not just a kind of amateur appearance.

However, the fact that the distinguished guests condescended to fight the fire is still worth mentioning. The reason why the news agency specifically pointed it out is also because of this kind of psychology. From this, we can easily see that the Duke of Windsor's love for beauty over the country originally stemmed from his pragmatic personality. He could give up the throne for a woman and could also risk his life to fight a fire. This kind of spirit of advancing bravely and without hesitation is really not something to be ridiculed.

If we think carefully about this matter (the distinguished guests fighting the fire), we feel that there is another reason to be said. Imagine under this kind of situation, if it were our Chinese distinguished guests, they would probably just make a lot of noise and run around in a panic. But this is not enough to explain the inferior nature of our Chinese distinguished guests only watching the fire from across the river and not having the courage to do what is right. I say that Chinese distinguished guests and the general Chinese people all have the same compassionate heart as foreigners. They definitely do not want to see a fire and not put it out. The reason why they do not help is simply that their strength is not enough. Because our distinguished guests and the general public rarely have this kind of training that requires courage and physical strength. They have spent their lives with their hands in their sleeves. How can you expect them to bravely fight the fire at this time? Foreign distinguished guests can risk fighting the fire and not encounter danger. If it were our Chinese, they would probably lose their lives because of it. Speaking further, it would involve the entire issue of our education and social atmosphere. We are still a civilized country.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Jiufei, who hadn't said a word for half a day, had turned pale and was about to faint because she couldn't bear the torment of the heat, the crowding, and the fear. Old Zhu called her name twice, but she didn't respond.

"Feifei! Feifei!" Lan also immediately became anxious.

As soon as their strength was slightly dispersed, the ground under their feet immediately became unstable due to the bumping of the bodies. Old Huang and A Li clenched their teeth and desperately pushed outward with their fronts, but they also seemed to be unable to withstand it.

Old Zhu saw that the situation was not right and hurriedly handed the small leather suitcase he was carrying to Lan. At the same time, he snatched Rong'er and held her in his left hand, and with his right hand, he picked up Jiufei. He immediately gave the order to the others:

"Retreat! We can't get on!"

But it was really not easy to retreat. The five adults used almost all their strength to break through the encirclement and retreat to the open fields. Rong'er, overcome by excessive shock, just hugged the copper rabbit father tightly and trembled. Jiufei's color improved slightly, but her eyes were still blank, as if she had lost consciousness.

Lan threw down the suitcase in her hand and collapsed on the ground, exhausted.

"Nian! What should we do………?" She dragged her face with her hand, leaned on the mud that had been moistened by the night dew, and unconsciously called out the name that she had not forgotten for twelve years but had not called out again. (48)
