President Chiang's Opening Speech

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] At the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session and the Joint Conference of the Party and League on the 9th, President Chiang personally presided and delivered a speech, stating: Today is the opening day of the Fourth Plenary Session of our party and also the anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising led by the Premier in the year of Yiwu (1895). Looking back over the past fifty years, countless revolutionary martyrs and comrades of our party, under the leadership of the Premier, shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, and struggled arduously, laying a deep foundation for the revolutionary cause of our party. Today, on this great anniversary, all party members and league members should reflect upon themselves, strive hard, and strive to carry forward the glorious history of our party and complete the unfinished tasks of the Premier and the martyrs, so that we can comfort their spirits in heaven. The President continued: The revolutionary cause of our party has entered a new stage since the victory of the War of Resistance. In this stage, the revolutionary environment is more difficult and the tasks are more arduous. Only by enriching our party, strengthening our organization, and working together with one heart and one mind, can our party comrades overcome all difficulties and complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. At present, the most urgent tasks are to suppress the communist bandits who are armed and betraying the country, complete the unification of the country, convene the National Assembly, and implement constitutional government, in order to show the determination of our party to return power to the people. To accomplish this task, our party must have a unified will and concentrated strength. Therefore, the unified organization of the party and league is the only urgent task for improving our party itself. I hope that all comrades will recognize its significance and their own responsibilities, sincerely and thoroughly implement it. After the unification of the party and league, advanced comrades must uphold the spirit of mutual love and sincerity to support the younger generation, and the younger generation must cherish the glorious history of our party, recognize the great mission of the revolution, obey the orders of the party, abide by the party's discipline, unite as one, and work together to strengthen the revolutionary forces of our party, realize the Three Principles of the People, and complete the urgent tasks of this conference.

### President Zhang Reports on Politics and Diplomacy at the Plenary Session

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] At the first session of the Fourth Plenary Session in the afternoon of the 9th, President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan reported on politics and diplomacy for one hour and ten minutes. Zhang first explained the position of the Executive Yuan after the reorganization of the government, stating that: At the current stage, the National Government Committee has replaced the Supreme National Defense Council as the highest decision-making body of the country, and the Executive Yuan is responsible for implementing the decisions of the National Government Committee. Zhang expressed his admiration for the sincerity and shared responsibility of the parties participating in the government in overcoming the current difficulties. He then reported on the domestic situation, pointing out the government's painstaking efforts to maintain peace and unity, and emphasized the significance of general mobilization, which is to "suppress the rebellion to seek unity and work hard to seek revitalization," concentrate the will and strength of the whole country, not only to suppress the rebellion passively, but also to actively build.

Finance and Economy

When discussing the financial and economic situation, Zhang pointed out that the national budget situation this year is such that due to military tensions and economic depression, expenditures are huge. Although the government has made every effort to economize, necessary expenditures cannot be forcibly reduced. The government's strategy is to economize on expenditures on the one hand and increase revenues as much as possible on the other. The main method is to rectify tax collection, followed by issuing public bonds to make up for the deficit. Although it is difficult to expect the budget to be completely balanced, we can only strive to reduce the gap. As for currency reform, the conditions are not yet ripe.

Turning to the international balance of payments, in the two years after the war, the international balance of payments was in deficit. After the implementation of the emergency economic measures, it was able to maintain a balance in the initial stage, but then it turned into a deficit again. After the revision of the import and export trade and foreign exchange management methods in August, the balance of payments has been in surplus for the past three weeks. During this period, in addition to the special import of materials that are still settled by the Central Bank, the rest are settled by designated banks at market prices, and the amount is not large, and it is offset by foreign exchange from exports and remittances from overseas Chinese, which is expected to remain in surplus. Zhang pointed out that the current financial and economic difficulties can only be overcome by utilizing the abundant manpower and developing the vast land and resources to seek self-reliance. The emergency economic measures have been revised due to changes in the situation and should continue to be implemented in earnest, but this is a palliative measure, and the economic reform plan for addressing the root causes must be actively implemented, and the National Economic Commission is drafting implementation measures and handling them one after another.

Here, Zhang listed three principles of China's financial and economic policy today: (1) In order to balance the budget, it is necessary to save expenditures and increase revenues. (2) In order to balance the international balance of payments, it is necessary to restrain imports and encourage exports. (3) In order to balance the supply and demand of materials, it is necessary to conserve consumption and increase production. Zhang also emphasized that China can only achieve self-reliance by working hard, saving expenditures, avoiding enjoyment, and making every effort to increase production. China's industrial base is weak, but there is still much to be developed in agriculture and mining, and the Chinese people should do their best. The government's recently promulgated outline of measures for strict economy, the revised methods for managing imports and exports and foreign exchange, and the principles for tightening lending adopted by the Quadruple Joint Treasury, are all determined based on this need.

Political Reform

Turning to the issue of political reform, Zhang believes that the corruption and dereliction of duty, illegality and corruption of some unscrupulous elements in the government have become a trend, and the reasons for this bad political atmosphere are diverse and constitute a serious social problem. The government's position is to always carefully examine personnel selection, strengthen the prevention of malpractices, strictly conduct audits, and encourage reporting. Once corruption is discovered, it will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished, and the superiors in charge will be held jointly responsible, in order to thoroughly reform the political atmosphere. As for the issue of compensation, it is also one of the factors affecting the political atmosphere. This adjustment of compensation is only to seek the fairness of compensation for civil and military officials and personnel of state-owned enterprises and institutions. How to achieve a reasonable standard still needs to be planned.

Regarding the issue of administrative efficiency, Zhang believes that in order to improve administrative efficiency, it is necessary to clearly define the responsibilities, improve the organization and equipment, simplify and rationalize the procedures, eliminate redundant agencies, and eliminate contradictory laws and regulations. In recent years, the central government has continuously studied and discussed improvements, and the reorganized Executive Yuan has paid special attention to this issue. Zhang said: The above-mentioned conditions have been very different for central agencies, and the situation at the provincial and county levels is even more unreasonable. Regarding the issue of adjusting laws and regulations at the provincial level, the Executive Yuan has decided to organize an Administrative Laws and Regulations Review Committee to be responsible for it. In terms of institutions, last month, taking advantage of the opportunity of the chairmen of the provinces coming to Beijing to participate in the food conference, four administrative symposiums were convened to listen to opinions. At the same time, at the invitation of the chairman, a comprehensive discussion was held on various issues at the provincial level, and a plan for provincial government reform and simplification was drafted, but it has not yet reached the decision-making stage. As for the issue at the county level, the Executive Yuan has issued a circular to the provinces, requiring the provincial governments to be responsible for implementation. In addition to the financial plan that has been submitted to the State Council and needs to be implemented after the completion of the legislation, the management of institutions, the reduction of concurrent posts by county magistrates, the limitation of the command system, and the selection and assessment of county-level officials have all been given clear instructions.

Diplomacy

Regarding diplomacy, Zhang emphasized that China's basic diplomatic requirement after the war is to strive for world peace so that China can obtain the opportunity for stability and construction. The government must try its best to maintain its own friendly relations with the major Allied countries and support the United Nations to promote cooperation among the major powers.

Regarding diplomacy with the United States, the United States fought alongside us during the war, and it also provided a great deal of help in the surrender of prisoners of war after the war. In the future, there will be many opportunities for mutual cooperation with us in international politics. Zhang said that some of the views of the United States on China are quite correct and can be used as medicine for self-reflection and self-encouragement, but it cannot fully understand the difficulties encountered by China. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance mutual understanding between the two countries in the future to strengthen their cooperative relationship.

As for diplomacy with the Soviet Union, China and the Soviet Union are neighbors, and the relationship must be friendly. In view of this need, we signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship after the war. This treaty is very disadvantageous to China, but at that time, the government wanted to have a common treaty with the Soviet Union as the basis for adjusting the relations between the two countries. Therefore, it reluctantly accepted the Yalta Secret Agreement and relaxed some of its sovereignty in Northeast China. Now China only requires the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship from the Soviet Union. China absolutely abides by its treaty obligations, and if the Soviet Union does not abide by them, we will definitely argue on the basis of reason.

Regarding the veto issue, China advocates that the charter should not be fundamentally amended to abolish the veto power, but it believes that a reasonable interpretation should be found to limit its abuse.

Speaking of the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, Zhang pointed out that our basic attitude is not to adopt a revengeful attitude, but we will never give up our demands for due compensation from Japan. We are willing to see Japan's peaceful reconstruction, but we must prevent it from becoming a threat to peace in the Far East again.

Regarding the Korean issue, Zhang expressed great concern and explained that what China expects is the emergence of a unified and independent new Korea. China is willing to promote anything that is conducive to this goal, and China will oppose anything that violates this goal.

Finally, Zhang mentioned the issue of the freedom and independence of weak and small nations. The independence and freedom of nations is the basic policy of the Kuomintang. China, in principle, expresses sympathy for the struggle for independence and freedom of the nations in Southeast Asia, but the protection of the lives and property of overseas Chinese is particularly important.

### Today's Agenda

Joint conferences of the party and league will be held both this morning and this afternoon to discuss the party's new proposed program. A reorganization committee will be convened in the evening.

### Gleanings from the Opening Ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session

The National Assembly Hall was filled with an atmosphere of boundless joy and solemnity today. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Joint Conference of the Party and League were opened here today. Around eight hundred party and league cadres brought their opinions from various regions to participate in this epoch-making and important conference inside and outside the party.

The capital, which had been overcast for several days, was clear and blue today, and the autumn sky was high and bright. The morning sun shone brilliantly on the party and national flags fluttering in front of the hall, giving people a feeling of excitement and also a sense of respect and reverence.

▽ The layout of the venue was slightly different from the past. It showed the unity and cooperation of the party and the league. Everywhere on the four walls and in the corridors, you could see the interweaving of the party and national flags and the combination of the league emblem and the party emblem. The light yellow walls, matched with red and blue tones, created a harmony. In an extremely soft atmosphere, everyone had a very calm and comfortable mood. Some people used this to wish the conference a successful outcome.

The venue was filled with greetings of reunion after a long separation and inquiries about election preparations. Everyone showed infinite concern.

As the opening ceremony began, the party leader, President Chiang, walked out slowly from behind amidst welcoming music. Today, he was wearing a khaki-colored Zhongshan suit. His silver-white hair roots once made every loyal and patriotic party comrade feel a little worried and also feel infinite sympathy for the hard work of the head of state. However, his radiant face and his bright and firm eyes dispelled all these thoughts.

The sound of President Chiang's instructions was still so clear, almost as young and energetic as ever. He said that unity is strength and that unification brings about new life. His words were enough to remind people of the unity and unification needed in the current difficult environment.

After President Chiang's instructions were completed, a burst of loud applause erupted in the venue, expressing excitement and reverence. President Chiang withdrew with a kind expression of thanks.

▽ Madame Song Meiling did not appear on the stage or in the front row today in her capacity as Madame Chiang. She simply sat in the middle seat in the back row of the Central Committee. She appeared in the venue earlier than the President, wearing a long gown with a black background and white flowers, plus a black short coat, showing a quiet and inconspicuous identity.

After the opening ceremony, there was a 20-minute break, followed by a preparatory meeting, which was still presided over by President Chiang. When the election of the presidium began, Ma Chaojun immediately proposed to ask the President to designate candidates, which was unanimously approved. This precious trust was fully demonstrated here.

Sitting next to Madame Chiang were Ms. Qian Yong and Ms. Zhang Weizhen, two female senators, who looked very close. The Madame always showed a very amiable smile. She did not attend in the afternoon. Everyone said, "Probably because she is already very familiar with the government's major plans."

The lounge was still upstairs, but unlike the National Assembly, there was tea but no snacks. Although soda and Coca-Cola were available, they had to be paid for.

The time management of the conference has been done in accordance with the conditions of observing economy and consumption. Not to mention the morning, the afternoon conference was originally scheduled to end from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, but it started at 3:05 PM and ended at 6:35 PM.

The political and military reports were both concise and simple, so three reports in one afternoon did not give people a feeling of fatigue bombing. Each report lasted about an hour.

▽ When Bai Chongxi reported on military affairs, there were written documents in the policy section, but Bai still read them page by page, and made corrections where there were errors, so the audience was busy proofreading.

There were no traces of journalists in the venue, and the public was not allowed to attend, but there were many newspapers distributed inside the venue.

### Wu Tiecheng Reports on the Unified Organization of the Party and League at the Plenary Session

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Committee Member Wu Tiecheng gave a report on the unified organization of the Party and League at the first session of the Fourth Plenary Session on the afternoon of the 9th. The main points are as follows:

I am honored to be ordered to report on the progress of the important event of the unified organization of the Party and League as one of the conveners of the Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and League, and to briefly describe the main points of the leader's instructions and the opinions of the comrades. Previously, when the Provisional National Congress of our party was convened in Wuhan in March of the 27th year of the Republic of China, in order to strengthen the leadership of the military and civilians in engaging in the War of Resistance, in addition to establishing the party's leader after the death of the Premier, the Three Principles of the People Youth League was also organized, relying on its establishment to exert great strength during the war and finally achieve final victory. Now, the Communist Party's tricks of harming the country and the nation and dividing the revolutionary forces are more sinister than before. Party and league comrades have all realized that the first major event at present is to enhance the spirit of one heart and one mind and strengthen the actions of concerted efforts to respond to the division of the Chinese Communist Party and eliminate the rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party. In March of this year, when our party held the Third Plenary Session, party and league cadres had already proposed the unification of the leadership of the party and league. After repeated meetings and detailed research by the responsible comrades of the Central Committee of the Party and League and the instructions of the President and concurrently the Head of the League, the Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and League and the Guidance Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and League were established. From this, a draft of the new construction program of our party was drafted. One part of the draft is the draft organizational program of our party at present, and one part is the draft political program of our party at present. In addition to making this case an issue and sending it to the comrades of the party and league departments in various provinces and cities for research, the recent Second Plenary Session of the Central League Headquarters has also conducted detailed research, and its opinions will be sent to the Party and League Federation.

### The Second Plenary Session of the Youth League Discusses the Draft Program for the Transformation of the Party and Approves It in Principle with Further Textual Amendments

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Second Plenary Session of the Youth League continued to hold its fourth session at 9:00 AM on the 8th, chaired by Chen Xueping, to discuss the "Draft Program for the Transformation of the Party." This draft program has become more substantial and complete after being comprehensively researched and supplemented by the eighteen-member group. The current political program section has been reorganized and expanded into eight items, the main points of which are: (1) Ensure national unity and territorial integrity. (2) Realize political democracy and complete constitutional government on schedule. (3) Thoroughly reform politics and severely punish corruption. (4) Guarantee the economic interests of workers and peasants and rationally improve the treatment of officers, soldiers, and public educators. (5) Guarantee equal opportunities for young people to study and find employment. (6) Promote the spirit of self-reliance and stimulate the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build the nation. (7) Uphold collective security, respect international equality, and maintain world peace. The current organizational program section has been expanded and revised into: (1) Principles, (2) Party Members, (3) Organizations at All Levels, (4) Cadres, (5) Discipline. The chairman read each item aloud, conducted detailed research, and especially discussed the part on organizations at all levels for the longest time. As a result, it was approved in principle, and another five-member group composed of Huang Shao Valley, Chen Jiesheng, Li Junlong, Tu Gongcui, and Chen Xueping was formed to refer to the various revised opinions and make textual amendments. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.

### Zeng Qi Elected Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Youth Party, Zuo Shunsheng and Others Elected Standing Committee Members

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Eleventh Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee of the China Youth Party held their first session at Lidu Flower Garden at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, respectively, to elect the chairman and standing committee members. As a result of the vote, Zeng Qi was elected chairman of the Central Executive Committee. Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Yu Fuxian, He Luzhi, Zheng Zhenwen, Liu Dongyan, Xia Taosheng, Wang Shizeng, Lin Keji, Yang Yongjun, Yu Xiaoquan (female), Zhang Zizhu, Liu Jingyuan, Wang Lanzeng, Duan Shenxiu, and Liu Siying were elected as standing committee members of the Central Executive Committee. Li Buwei and Zhang Mengjiu were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee.

The conference reference, once approved by the Fourth Plenary Session, will be the highest standard for the future movement of all comrades. This conference is a revolutionary, constructive, and political conference, a conference to concentrate revolutionary forces and consolidate revolutionary organizations. It is believed that the strength of the unified organization of the party and league realized by this meeting will surely be able to quell the rebellion, unify the country, and improve the national economy and the people's livelihood, just as the reorganization of the Revive China Society into the Tongmenghui two years before the Republic of China was able to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, the reorganization of the Kuomintang into the Chinese Revolutionary Party in the third year of the Republic of China was able to overthrow Yuan Shikai's imperial system, the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China was able to pacify the warlords, and the implementation of the new construction of our party in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China was able to win the victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the comrades of the party and league have firm confidence in the unification of this revolutionary organization and the solidarity of the revolutionary forces.

### Special Envoy Wei Will Suggest Massive Aid to China

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th Broadcast, the New York Afternoon Paper reported that although Special Envoy Wei Temeyer's investigation report in China is still kept secret, according to observations from all sides, Wei will suggest providing the National Government with a huge amount of aid. According to well-informed sources in Washington, Wei's statement issued on August 24 did not close the door to further aid to China.

### Foreign Minister Wang Arrives in San Francisco, Washington Rumors Say That We Have Notified the US Government of Our Determination to Rely on Our Own Efforts to Suppress the Communists and Build the Nation

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 8th] Wang Shijie, the chief representative of our delegation to the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, and his entourage arrived here tonight. Wang plans to stay in San Francisco for two days before departing for New York, the world capital.

However, Wang did not express his opinion on how or when this could be accomplished. Asked if there was still hope for the resumption of peace talks in the country, Wang solemnly replied: "No."

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Reliable sources here revealed tonight that the Chinese government has notified the United States that it wants to eliminate the "communist threat" and intends to proceed with the reconstruction of post-war China, whether or not it receives US aid.

### Those Who Criticize the Chinese Government Have Never Been to Communist Areas

Comment by Howard Newspaper Group

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th, Associated Press] An editorial in the Howard Newspaper Group recently quoted a dispatch from Northern China by the newspaper's reporter, Newton, saying that the accusations against the Chinese National Government that the CCP restricts the freedom of the people, oppresses the working masses, and that officials are corrupt and incompetent, most of the authors of these arguments have never been to the CCP's liberated areas, but are deeply poisoned by the CCP's propaganda, thinking that the situation in the liberated areas under the rule of the land revolution party is naturally better. Therefore, the newspaper specifically pointed out Newton's observations, saying that when the Communist Party occupies a place, the people flee one after another. Whenever the National Army recovers a place, the people happily return to their homes.

### US-China Agreement Reached on Handling and Distributing Relief Supplies; Details Under Negotiation with Progress

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] Regarding American foreign relief after the end of UNRRA, the US Congress passed a bill for $350 million in May, which includes China. It is now learned from official sources that the United States and China have reached an agreement on the general principles for the handling and distribution of relief supplies. A State Department official told reporters today that the details of the relief agreement are being negotiated by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US Embassy. The State Department has not received reports recently, but it is expected that the negotiations will have made progress. It is also reported that Ambassador Gu Weijun has consulted with State Department officials several times regarding US aid to China after the end of UNRRA. The bill passed by the previous Congress stipulates that $350 million in basic relief supplies will be delivered to Austria, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Greece, the Trieste area, and China. The United States has already reached agreements with Italy, Greece, and Austria, and US relief delegations have been sent to various countries to supervise the distribution of relief supplies. Relief supplies will not be sent to Poland and Hungary because the food situation there has "improved". The general principles of the agreement between the United States and China should be the same as the agreements with other countries. This stipulates that the country receiving relief should submit a plan for relief and import needs to the United States in advance. This plan must be reviewed and approved by the United States. The distribution of relief supplies should be directly supervised and controlled by US representatives under the terms of the agreement. The US allows the distribution of supplies through commercial channels, but the extent should be practical and in good condition. The United States will send relief delegations to the countries receiving relief. The delegation is affiliated with the US Embassy in each country, and its mission is to supervise and inspect the reports of each country, and to travel to various places to see how the terms of the agreement are implemented. The country receiving relief will appoint a senior official to contact the US representative and take the necessary economic measures to reduce its need for relief supplies. Relief supplies, as well as similar materials produced in the country or imported from foreign countries, should be distributed to all levels without distinction of race, religion, or political belief. The country receiving relief also decides to maintain the rationing and price control system to ensure the fair distribution of supplies. In some cases, relief supplies can be sold, and the proceeds are deposited in a bank in the country receiving relief, but withdrawals cannot be made without the consent of the United States. The agreement also stipulates that the country receiving relief should maintain complete statistics on relief supplies, and newspapers and broadcasts are allowed to report on the distribution and use of relief supplies. The relief plan should be fully publicized to the outside world in advance.

### National Army in Jiaodong Captures Gu Xian; Yantai, Longkou, and Other Places Have Become Dead Ports; Recovery Work in Southern Shandong Fully Underway

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 9th] The National Army in Pingdu engaged in fierce battles with bandits in the Dazeshan area north of Zhengda. By dusk yesterday, they had captured all the key points of the mountain passes. The remaining bandits fled into the deep mountains and are being pursued. The eastward advancing National Army captured Gu Xian this morning. The northward advancing National Army began to advance north yesterday and is currently fighting fiercely with bandits in Lingshan. Bandits are stubbornly resisting from the top of Lingshan. Large formations of the air force have been heavily bombing for days. Yantai, Weihai, Longkou and other places have become dead ports.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 9th] The National Army that recovered Pingdu in the Shandong Peninsula continued to advance north along the Ping (du) Ye (xian) highway. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, they continued to capture Li Pu. The remaining bandits were defeated and fled north. At this point, the bandit's Ninth Column, the Yellow River Detachment, the New Fifth Division, the New Sixth Division, the Police Fifth Brigade, and other 20,000 to 30,000 men have been driven by the National Army to the eastern mountainous area of ​​the peninsula, facing the sea on three sides, with no way to escape, and are like fish in a net.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th] The National Army in Jiaodong has been advancing smoothly for days and has entered a state of complete victory. Judging from the situation, the eastern Shandong area can be completely recovered within a month. The defensive works in Jinan have already been mostly completed.

[United Press, Peiping, 9th] The Mayor of Beiping, He Siyuan, told a United Press reporter today that the ports controlled by the Communist bandits in Yantai and other parts of the Shandong Peninsula are expected to be recovered within two or three weeks. At that time, the military situation in Shandong will be virtually over, and the actions of hundreds of thousands of National Army troops in Hebei and the Northeast will be free from any risk of being hampered. He also estimated that the number of Shandong Communist bandits, originally 500,000, has now been reduced to around 100,000 due to deaths, injuries, desertions, and retreats. Liu Bocheng initially led 60,000 troops to invade the southwest, but now he has broken through and fled to Hubei, with no more than 15,000 remaining. Those who stay in the province have mostly abandoned their weapons and armor, planning to resume their old occupations.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th] The recovery work in Southern Shandong is fully underway. Yu Jimin, Director of the Shandong Provincial Government's Eastern Shandong Administrative Office, and the Mayor of Weihaiwei Long, flew from Jinan to Qingdao together on the 8th to preside over the recovery. In addition, a group of more than 300 members of the Yantai Municipal Government's Armed Return-to-Homeland Corps has also set off with the front-line troops of the National Army, preparing to enter Yantai together to start the recovery work. After the Jiaoji Railway's Jinan-Zhangdian section and the Zhangbo branch line were approved by the Ministry of Communications for emergency repairs, the Jinpu Railway Administration has sent personnel to Zhangdian to set up an office to preside over the emergency repairs and railway restoration work. In addition, the Jinpu Railway's Xuzhou-Jinan section had previously been rushed to Dawenkou, but later the Wen River bridge was washed away by the autumn rains. In order to strengthen the restoration project, the Railway Administration decided to rebuild the bridge and will continue to rush north from Wenkou starting on the 10th. Ge Tan, Director of the Sixth District Bureau of the Ministry of Communications' Highway Administration, arrived in Jinan by plane from Peiping on the afternoon of the 8th to inspect the national highway lines in Shandong Province and make plans for the restoration project.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] The Communist bandits have once again blocked the necessary route for merchants traveling north and south on the Songhua River, and the blockade is even tighter than the previous ones.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 9th] The restless Northeast Communist bandits, in the Jichang area, have been contained daily by the results of the National Army's attacks.

### Anhui Communist Bandits Eyeing Tongcheng; A Major Battle Will Unfold in Liu'an

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 9th] After the Communist bandits captured Shucheng, they looted extensively. On the 8th, more than 1,000 bandits advanced towards the west bank of Chaohu and reached Sanhe. Another group advanced on Tongcheng and was intercepted by National Army teams in the Tongcheng Jiantian Mountains. The front line in Liu'an was quiet yesterday and today, with both sides busy reinforcing, and a major battle is about to unfold. Liu Bocheng is still in Shangcheng commanding. Liu's troops' escape to Shucheng seems to be to contain the National Army's forces. A force has joined forces with the local Eighth Route Army between Huoshan and Tongcheng. Ying Mountain in eastern Hubei has fallen, and the local Eighth Route Army between Huangmei and Taihu is also very active.

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 9th] The National Army attacking Liu'an from the north has reached the suburbs of the city. A group of four to five hundred bandit soldiers who had fled into Shucheng encountered the National Army at Taoxi Town, thirty miles north of the city, on the night of the 8th and engaged in a fierce battle. The bandit army immediately collapsed.

[Central News Agency, Hefei, 9th] A group of two to three hundred bandits who had fled into Shucheng harassed Taoxi Town on the Shu-He Highway on the night of the 8th, and were repelled by the National Army after fighting for about two hours.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 9th] Military news: (1) The bandits who were scattered from Macheng are fleeing in the direction of Luotian, and our army is intercepting them.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] On the 8th, a powerful air force formation cooperated with the army in the areas of Luotian, Macheng, Yingshan, and Liu'an to encircle and annihilate the bandit army, killing hundreds of bandits.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] Liu Bocheng's Communist bandits fled from southwestern Henan this time for three weeks. Their remaining force of 23,000 has suffered about 5,000 casualties due to interceptions by the National Army everywhere (the bandits never formally resisted the National Army). However, the number of strong men and civilians who were coerced and drafted by the bandits along the way must have been considerable, and the number of those who fled is enough to offset it. The current force is actually only about 20,000 people.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The battle for Huaiyang is being waged fiercely. On the morning of the 9th, a melee broke out at the four passes, and the bandits suffered heavier casualties.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 9th] After Song County was lost, County Magistrate Miao Weifan's whereabouts are unknown. The bandit army that captured the city continued to invade Lushi to the west.

### Preliminary Revival of Industry and Mining in the Northeast; Northeast Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Committee Launches General Mobilization of Electric Power Production

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] The Resources Committee's Northeast Electric Power Bureau launched a "General Mobilization of Electric Power Production," which is the first step towards the revival of industry and mining. Three principles have now been decided: (1) All the power plants belonging to the Resources Committee in Fushun, Benxi, Jinxi, Fuxin, Anshan, and Hezuo will be repaired and put into operation by the end of September, with a total power generation capacity of 65,000 kilowatts; (2) All power generation equipment of various highway production enterprises will be repaired and utilized as much as possible, which can obtain 4,000 kilowatts of power. The Electric Power Bureau will subsidize those that are insufficient; (3) The Chang-Shen transmission line will be repaired by the end of September, which can transmit 40,000 kilowatts from Xiaofeng Man. It is expected that 100,000 kilowatts of thermal power and 40,000 kilowatts of hydropower can be generated by the end of November, a total of 140,000 kilowatts. The power problems in southern and western Liaoning can be solved. Guo Didi, Director of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, told reporters: The problem of industrial and mining production can be said to be that it is alive with electricity and dead without electricity. 70% of the electricity in the Northeast relies on Xiaofeng Man. It is hoped that the National Army will quickly drive out the Communist bandits in the Meihekou area and open up the Ji-Shen transmission line.

[Another dispatch] Industrial and mining production in the Northeast has decided to overcome all difficulties and lead to the path of revival.

### Military and Official Discipline Inspection Corps of Peiping, Tientsin, and Hebei Uncovers Another Case of Malfeasance; Hebei Central Electricity Company Unauthorizedly Establishes an Agency

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Beiping, dated the 9th] The Military and Official Discipline Inspection Corps of Peiping, Tientsin, and Hebei has uncovered another case of malfeasance. Tu Jingsheng, a standing committee member of the Supply Committee privately established by the Hebei Central Electricity Company, has now been turned over to the court. Bao Guobao, the general manager of the company, is suspected and is still under investigation. After Bao replaced the manager, he unauthorizedly established a Supply Committee specifically for purchasing materials, without the approval of the National Resources Commission. This agency was not abolished, and Bao appointed himself as the chairman, with Tu as a standing committee member, responsible for managing affairs on Bao's behalf. Now, after investigation by the supervisory team, it has been found that Tu engaged in numerous acts of malfeasance when purchasing materials, involving a large sum of money, which is still difficult to estimate. It has been verified that he embezzled profits from purchasing gasoline, asbestos powder, hardware, etc. The methods included purchasing expensive goods in Tianjin instead of cheaper goods in Beiping and having someone named Wang forge stamps for reimbursement. Sixty-four pieces of evidence have been found. Yu Hezhi, the purchasing team leader under Tu, is a relative of Yu Changju, the manager of the Beiping branch of the company, and is also heavily suspected. It is reported that due to frequent breakdowns of the company's generators in Peiping, resulting in constant power outages, citizens have repeatedly filed complaints with the authorities and the Provisional Consultative Council, and Bao and Yu have been censured by the Supervisory Department for their dereliction of duty. The Inspection Corps also uncovered another case, namely, the major embezzlement case of Qi Wenping, a former Major General Commander of the Jinjing Border Region of the Hebei Advance Army (now the Military Law Office of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters), which was adjudicated by the Military Law Supervisory Department of the former Eleventh War Zone last year. The Inspection Corps believes that the sentence was too lenient and that the embezzled funds were not fully recovered. The offender, shortly after the Japanese surrender, used his position as commander to receive 11 tons of silver and 1 kilogram of cultured pearls from the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin. After being reported, he was sent to the Military Law Department and sentenced to nine years in prison, but only 7 kilograms of cultured pearls and a small amount of silver were recovered from the embezzled funds. The corps believes that the Military Law Supervisory Department is suspected of dereliction of duty and perverting the law and has decided to order the competent authorities to bring them to justice.

Editorial

### Accepting Criticism and Striving for Improvement

——After Reading Chairman Chiang’s Speech

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party solemnly opened in the capital yesterday morning. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech on the spot, pointing out that it has been two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the revolution has reached its final juncture. Success or failure hinges on this moment. The dangers and difficulties of the revolutionary cause are greater than at any time in the past. Therefore, the main task of this plenary session is to seek the merger and unity of the party. Going forward, there are two points we should pay attention to: (1) Recently, China's politics, economy, and military have been criticized by foreigners. We should not resent this but should humbly accept well-intentioned criticism and strive to improve our politics, economy, and military; (2) In the future, if we want to eliminate the Communist bandits and stabilize China, we must reform the party's internal structure and strive for improvement in all aspects of politics, economy, and military. Although Chairman Chiang's speech was not specifically directed at the statement made by President Truman's special envoy, General Wedemeyer, Chairman Chiang's magnanimous spirit, in not only being able to humbly accept criticism from others but also using this to encourage all members of the Nationalist Party, truly makes him worthy of being called a first-rate statesman of our time. After repeatedly reading Chairman Chiang's speech, I firmly believe that whether one is a member of the Nationalist Party or not, anyone who is a part of the Republic of China should accept Chairman Chiang's instructions and teachings.

Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper expressed the hope that the Nationalist Party could lead the Chinese people on the path of "self-reliance" to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. This was not inspired by Wedemeyer's statement but was the result of our internal examination of the domestic situation and external consideration of the world situation. We believe that China has only one way out, and that is "self-reliance." As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." As long as we can truly embark on the path of "self-reliance," we will not have to worry about international assistance. The reason is very simple and well-known to the Chinese people. Taking the victory of the War of Resistance as an example, if we had not used our own flesh and blood to fight against the enemy's artillery fire after the July 7th Incident and fought alone, the international situation would never have become completely favorable to our country. The fact that China won the War of Resistance is enough to prove that China can only take the path of self-reliance. There is no other way to survive. This is the unanimous understanding of the current state of affairs by the Chinese government and the public. We knew long before Wedemeyer's statement that we should take this great road of "self-reliance." It is said that before Wedemeyer made his statement, the Chinese government had already sent a memorandum to Wedemeyer, but this memorandum has not been officially announced. According to a report by the United Press, in this unreleased memorandum, the Chinese government solemnly declared that China had resisted alone for four years, so China believes that it has the ability to overcome current difficulties. At the same time, it pointed out the four steps of "self-reliance": (1) Communist armed forces must be suppressed; any compromise should not be considered. … The outcome of this struggle is related to the peace and security of the entire Far East. (2) Effective steps must be taken immediately to control inflation, without further delay. (3) Within the limits of government resources, the work of economic recovery should be intensified. (4) Political reforms have been implemented, basic democratic institutions and practices have been established, and efforts will continue in the future. If the United Press report is a true reflection of the facts, then it is clear that the Chinese government was already prepared to implement self-reliance.

Wedemeyer's statement can be observed from two angles, and there are two different views in domestic public opinion: one is that Wedemeyer's statement is the earnest advice of a friend, and we should humbly accept his criticism, adopt the attitude of "correcting mistakes if we have them, and making improvements if we don't," and engage in deep self-reflection, striving for political, economic, and military reforms; the other is that Wedemeyer's statement is nothing short of a great insult to the Chinese people, and everyone should consider it a great disgrace. As the saying goes, "Knowing shame is close to courage," and we should carve out a bloody path for the country and the nation in shame. What is the government's attitude? Since no formal announcement has been made, we have no way of knowing. But today, after reading Chairman Chiang's speech, we can understand Chairman Chiang's views. Chairman Chiang's magnanimity and broad mind, which can accommodate criticism from outsiders, are truly admirable. In fact, so-called democratic politics is a kind of politics that can withstand criticism from others. Without the criticism and attacks from the opposition, politics will not progress. We have long seen this subtle effect from the practical application of democratic politics in Britain and the United States. Going forward, the Nationalist Party should not only humbly accept criticism from others but also constantly reflect on itself. As the saying goes, "Examine oneself three times a day." Only in this way can we "strengthen ourselves unceasingly" and "improve ourselves day by day." Since Chairman Chiang has admitted that the present moment is the final juncture for the success or failure of the revolution, we naturally do not need to shy away from the fact that the internal organization of the Nationalist Party urgently needs to be reformed. For more than 20 years of the Nationalist Party's rule, the Communist Party has always been the Nationalist Party's only enemy, but its power has not only not weakened but has grown day by day. While other factors are undoubtedly numerous, the unsoundness of the Nationalist Party's internal structure cannot be denied as one of the important factors. Now that we are in the period of suppressing the rebellion, in addition to suppressing it with military force, the Nationalist Party must also reform itself, so that it can cooperate with the military. Only by taking this dual approach can we achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### British Cabinet Discusses New Policies to Address Current Major Economic Crisis; Plans to Borrow from International Monetary Fund to Overcome Difficulties; Balancing Exports and Imports is the Biggest Challenge

[Report from this newspaper] London, dispatch dated the 9th: The British Cabinet held a meeting today, with Prime Minister Attlee returning from vacation to personally attend and preside over the discussion of methods to revive the American economy in order to cope with the current economic crisis. In the coming week, the British government will continue to hold meetings of a political, economic, and financial nature, and the atmosphere is tense. The British side is eager to eliminate the difference between imports and exports. Therefore, the International Monetary Fund meeting to be held in London this Thursday will have a major impact on the British economic situation, as the world economy is interconnected. The British side may request that the International Monetary Fund provide the UK with a certain amount of US dollars, pending the implementation of the Marshall Plan. This transitional measure will be sufficient to help the UK overcome its current difficulties. The most noteworthy event this week is that Minister of Commerce Cripps will announce on Friday a plan to increase production and exports to gradually close the gap between exports and imports. Britain may again tighten the import of food and other commodities. Britain's economic war is about to gradually approach its climax.

[United Press] London, dispatch dated the 8th: US Treasury Secretary Snyder arrived here today and will hold important talks with the British government, but the chance of success in providing further dollar aid to Britain remains uncertain. When Snyder arrived at Southampton on the Queen Elizabeth, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton traveled by car from London to the dock to greet him. He also greeted Canadian Finance Minister Abbott, who arrived on the same ship. Snyder arrived in the UK as the US director of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund Board of Directors to attend the second annual meeting, but he will also take this opportunity to discuss Britain's financial situation with British Prime Minister Attlee, Chancellor Dalton, and other senior British officials. As it stands, there are three ways Britain can obtain dollar aid before the Marshall Plan is implemented: (1) Unfreeze the final batch of US loans that were frozen during continued negotiations, totaling US$400 million; (2) Negotiate a loan from the US Export-Import Bank; (3) Borrow from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. Accompanying Snyder to the UK are more than 100 financial experts from various countries attending the International Monetary Fund meeting.

British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Ambassador Massigli exchanged speeches, expressing that Britain and France are determined to stand on the same front, not only to deal with any future military aggression, but also to cooperate in taking constructive economic action to maintain Western civilization. The treaty is valid for 50 years and stipulates that if Germany engages in re-aggression, Britain and France will provide mutual assistance. It also stipulates that the two countries should regularly exchange views on matters affecting their economic relations. Bevin pointed out that the treaty has two goals, preventive and constructive, which is tantamount to telling Germany that if militarism or aggressive attempts occur again, Britain and France will deal with them together. Massigli replied that the treaty has already stipulated that Britain and France have common aspirations and common goals, and he believes that this treaty will be the beginning of an era of closer cooperation.

### European Federal Parliament Holds Its First Meeting

[Associated Press] Gstaad, Switzerland, dispatch dated the 8th: The "European Federal Parliament" held its first meeting today. Chairman Professor Coudenhove-Kalergi of Austria said in his speech that the Paris economic cooperation conference initiated by Marshall will definitely fail. The obstacles are the same as those when French Foreign Minister Briand convened a meeting of European foreign ministers in 1929 to discuss the organization of a European federation, that is, everyone agrees in principle, but there are differences in implementation, because everyone is prepared to enjoy the benefits of the federation, but no one is willing to make the necessary sacrifices. A European federation is impossible unless its members transfer some of their sovereignty to the federal government. However, all governments are unwilling to make such sacrifices. The three major political agendas of the "European Federal Parliament" are as follows: (1) Mobilize the majority parties in the European Parliament to support the federation; (2) Promote cooperation between these parties; (3) Convene a European constitutional assembly.

### Behind-the-Scenes Efforts to Mediate the Anglo-Egyptian Dispute Fail

[Associated Press] Lake Success, dispatch dated the 9th: It was learned today that the behind-the-scenes efforts of the representatives of the UN Security Council to mediate the Anglo-Egyptian dispute have failed to break the deadlock and have now decided to adjourn for 24 hours.

### Britain Plans to Negotiate with the Soviet Union to Break the Stalemate in Atomic Energy Control

[Associated Press] Lake Success, dispatch dated the 9th: It is reported that Britain will suggest holding talks between Britain and the Soviet Union to break the long-standing stalemate between the East and West on the issue of atomic energy control. British officials said that "other countries interested in this issue" are also welcome to participate.

Britain deeply understands the crisis of failure to agree on how to control atomic energy. After the Soviet Union firmly opposed the principles of the US atomic energy control plan supported by the majority of countries on the 8th and rejected the committee's draft plan for implementing the plan, Britain decided to proceed with the plan for Anglo-Soviet negotiations. In August, Soviet representative Gromyko also expressed agreement with the control of major powers rather than international control when answering questions from British representative Cadogan. This is also one of the reasons for Britain to propose the current plan. Other governments seem to agree with Britain's plan. They firmly believe that continuing the debate in the Atomic Energy Commission will not break the deadlock, and they firmly believe that the control of atomic energy is impossible without the participation of the Soviet Union or any other major power.

Stalin was accompanied by the Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers from Yalta to Saki, but it is not known whether Stalin is still staying in Saki or has returned to Moscow. Saki is Stalin's winter resort. Stalin's inspection of the fleet in the Black Sea proves the Soviet Union's importance of the construction of the Black Sea Fleet and the Black Sea region. On the opposite shore of the Black Sea is Turkish territory.

All aircraft flying south of the coast on the night of the 12th must be inspected by night fighters. The Ministry of Aviation also said that whether the defensive aircraft will attack aircraft of unknown origin depends on the "circumstances."

### Britain and the United States Reach an Agreement to Co-manage the Ruhr Coal Mines

[Associated Press] London, dispatch dated the 8th: Well-informed sources at the British Foreign Office said on the evening of the 8th that Britain has agreed to the United States jointly managing the Ruhr coal mines, which are the largest source of support for European recovery. This decision may be announced within 48 hours as part of the Anglo-American agreement to increase Ruhr coal production. It is expected that this statement will be announced simultaneously in Washington and London to end the negotiations that have been held in Washington for almost a month. According to this provision, the North German coal mines currently controlled by Britain will be transferred to a new Anglo-American management bureau. The US side guarantees that the Ruhr miners will receive rations higher than the average and guarantees to assist in restoring the railway system on which the Ruhr area relies to import coal production. The statement will not mention the thorny issue of nationalizing the Ruhr coal mines. Although the two sides cannot discuss this issue, because it is not on the formal agenda, there is no decision to be made. Britain believes that coal mines should be nationalized, and the United States hopes that it will be resolved by a citizens' referendum.

[Reuters] Berlin, dispatch dated the 8th: Representatives of Britain, the United States, and France held talks here today on the export of Ruhr coal and coking coal, which will involve the issue of coal consumption caused by the Anglo-American decision to raise the level of German industry.

### The Four Powers Discuss the Korean Issue; The United States Announces Postponement of the Meeting; The State Department Still Hopes that the Soviet Union Will Propose a Solution

[Associated Press] Washington, dispatch dated the 8th: The State Department announced today that although China and Britain have agreed to the US proposal to hold a four-power meeting on September 8 to discuss the Korean issue, the Soviet Union has refused to participate. The meeting has been postponed, but it has not been cancelled. However, it is difficult to say when it can be held and how the United States will try to break the deadlock in the future. The Soviet Union's reply said that the US-Soviet Mixed Commission has not yet exhausted its wisdom and efforts, and it seems that the Soviet Union will propose other solutions. Brown, the US representative on the commission, also said that he is willing to consider any suggestions from the Soviet Union at any time. Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee declared in Seoul: "What do you hope for from the Soviet Union? Now the only thing to do is to submit the Korean issue to the United Nations for handling."

### Japanese Prime Minister Calls on the Labor Community to Cooperate

Workers Dissatisfied with Minimum Wage Standard

[New Asia News Agency] Tokyo, dispatch dated the 9th: The Liaison and Coordination Council of the All-Japan Labor Committee convened by the Japanese government held its first meeting in Tokyo on the 8th. Ministers Katayama, Wada, and Yonekubo, as well as other relevant leaders, attended the meeting on behalf of the government. Labor Minister Yonekubo issued a statement: "It is difficult to maintain life with a standard wage of 1,800 yen. I am well aware of this. Therefore, we will increase the supply of goods and increase the real wage. If it is still impossible to maintain life by mid-November, the government will also re-examine countermeasures." Prime Minister Katayama then asked the workers to cooperate and adjourned the meeting.

[New Asia News Agency] Tokyo, dispatch dated the 9th: After the implementation of the Labor Standards Law, the Japanese government decided to establish a minimum wage system to ensure the lives of workers. However, the current standards are not realistic. Therefore, how to determine the basis for the minimum wage this time is the dividing point for whether the working class supports the Katayama cabinet, which is worthy of attention.

Afterwards, Van Mook told reporters that after speaking with Marshall, he felt more hopeful about reaching a further understanding on this issue. Van Mook continued, saying that, aside from seeking a resolution through the United Nations, they have not yet begun using other methods to resolve the problem. The Dutch ambassador stated that during the war, the Queen of the Netherlands advocated for strengthened autonomy for the Dutch colonies, and this policy has not changed.

### Japanese Public Office Screening Committee Considers Purging Ashida Hitoshi

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, August 9th] Following Foreign Minister Ashida's recent remarks in Kyoto regarding political unrest, there has been much speculation here about the subtle relationship between Ashida and Katayama. According to information obtained by this agency, there has been a new development regarding whether Ashida will be purged under the regulations for purging the media. The previous reason for acquitting Ashida was that the English-language "Japan Times" had a circulation of less than 10,000 copies. However, an investigation by a member of the Central Public Office Qualification Screening Committee has revealed that the English-language "Japan Times" had a circulation of far more than 10,000 copies before and during the war, possibly over 20,000 copies. The fact that the newspaper still has a circulation of 12,000 copies under the current severe paper shortage and strict paper controls also provides counter-evidence. It is rumored that a certain committee member has expressed a willingness to resign in order to fight for this matter, and although major news authorities have stepped in to mediate, it is feared that the matter will be difficult to resolve privately. This matter may be related to Ashida's aforementioned remarks.

### Emperor Hirohito Reverts to Old Habits, Refuses to Shake Hands with Workers

[United Press, Tokyo, August 9th] Although Emperor Hirohito wishes to connect with ordinary people, he still refuses to shake hands with labor leaders. When Hirohito inspected Nikko, Ando, the leader of the copper mine labor union, requested to shake hands with Hirohito on behalf of the workers. Hirohito politely declined, saying, "Please replace it with Japanese etiquette." As he spoke, he smiled and returned the greeting to Ando. This incident caused a great uproar.

### Large-Scale Bloody Riots Expand in India, Gandhi Rushes to New Delhi, U.S. Ambassador Mountbatten Discusses the General Situation

[Reuters, New Delhi, August 9th] U.S. Ambassador to India Grady visited the Viceroy's House today and spoke with Mountbatten for an hour. Grady declined to disclose the content of the conversation afterwards, saying only that they discussed the general situation in India.

[Reuters, New Delhi, August 9th] Gandhi arrived in New Delhi today, where the riots continue unabated. Within an hour, he met with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Interior Minister Patel, and Health Minister Mrs. Kaur. Mountbatten specially assigned twelve Indian soldiers as his guards, but Gandhi politely declined. Gandhi has not recovered from his fast in Calcutta, and his health remains weak. Gandhi remains in the sweeper's colony after arriving in Delhi. There has been no indication as to when he will begin a fast for the riots in New Delhi. The overall situation will depend on how the situation evolves.

More Than a Thousand Dead, Vultures Appear in Flocks

The Royal Indian Air Force has officially assisted the government in suppressing the riots starting today. When Gandhi met with Nehru and others, planes were already soaring in the air. The number of deaths in the Delhi riots has increased to over 1,000 today. This is an informal estimate; officials have not released the number of casualties in the past 24 hours. The unburied corpses in the streets have emitted a foul odor, and flocks of vultures have appeared in the sky, from which one can imagine the terrifying situation in the city. Delhi's commercial district has not yet reopened today. Riots broke out again in Connaught Place today, and the police opened fire three times, killing seventeen people on the spot. This was based on the authorities' shoot-to-kill order. Although the relocation of Hindus in Lahore has been completed, rioters set fire to houses along three roads last night. Calcutta is in an unsettling quiet, as Gandhi's departure from the city may cause the bloodshed to occur again.

### Grand Gathering of New Xiannlin Dance Industry, Thousands of Dancers with No Makeup and Tearful Words, Representatives to Fly to Beijing This Morning to Petition

[Our Report] The deadline for the dance ban is fast approaching. Dance girls, musicians, dance hall employees, and dance hall owners throughout the city all feel panicked. A temporary meeting was held at New Xiannlin Dance Hall at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Owners Sun Hongyuan, Zheng Weixian, Wang Jingwen, etc., dancers Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, Li Ling, etc., Western and Chinese pharmacists He Hai, Aranas, Guan Huashi, etc., and workers Tang Zongjie, Mao Zhihai, etc., totaling more than 27,000 people attended. Order at the meeting was maintained by military police in cooperation with the workers' union picket team. Representatives from all parties in the Party, government, and military also attended.

After the meeting opened, Tang Zongjie, chairman of the Dance Industry Workers' Union, gave a speech. After a brief report, he suddenly became emotional and could not speak clearly. He then shouted "We want to eat!" and "Thrift is not creating unemployment!" several times. The entire audience echoed unanimously, and the applause and shouts were continuous for a long time. Subsequently, Sun Hongyuan, Zheng Weixian, He Hai, and others gave speeches in succession, and dancers Sun Zhimin and Meng Yan tearfully pleaded their case. Sun claimed to be a high school student who had lost her family in the War of Resistance Against Japan and had no choice but to work as a dancer. The reason for working as a dancer was that it was not easy to find other jobs in society. Now, if they wanted to ban dancing, where would they find work? Meng Yan said, "Dancers have always been looked down upon by society. A weak woman has already suffered enough in an evil environment. Now, if they want to ban dancing again, aren't they pushing us further into a dead end of despair?" She spoke and wept, and the whole audience was moved. The thousands of dancers who came to the meeting yesterday all washed off their makeup and wore simple clothes and shoes. They listened attentively, and at this point, they all covered their faces and sobbed, and their emotions became even more sad.

Subsequently, Aranas of the Musicians' Union and Senator Wang Xianqing spoke. Wang expressed sympathy for the workers' demands, which won a round of applause. Then, Bai Zhu, a red star from the Paramount in Hong Kong who had recently arrived, also automatically stepped onto the stage to speak. Bai was dressed in a glamorous white dress and spoke softly. The tense situation in the venue was greatly eased.

After the meeting, the entire group originally intended to march, but they were persuaded to give up. It is said that twelve representatives of the dance industry have decided to fly to Beijing this morning to petition the Ministry of Social Affairs, and at the same time, another group of representatives will be elected to visit Mayor Wu and Director Wu again to reiterate their views.

### Investigation of Direct Tax Bureau Auditors' Extortion from Merchants: Zhang Zhongyuan's Letter to the City Council Reports Details

[Our Report] City Councilor and Director of the Chinese Wooden Furniture Trade Association, Zhang Zhongyuan, previously reported instances of corruption by auditors of the Direct Tax Bureau, notifying Director Pan and Political Affairs Committee Secretary-General Lei, among others. The exposure of this case attracted significant attention from all sectors. Councilor Zhang yesterday presented a detailed report to the City Council regarding the extortion and bribery of investigated members of the association by tax bureau auditors. The original letter stated: "On August 15th of this year, in my capacity as Director of the Chinese Wooden Furniture Trade Association, I, Zhang Zhongyuan, along with Directors Zhu Jianni and Gu Jianting, attended a lottery draw upon notification from the Direct Tax Bureau. According to the bureau's regulations, for every one hundred members of a trade association with two to four hundred members, three would be selected for investigation. Our association has over two hundred and fifty members, so seven should be selected. The host of the lottery at the bureau presented a list containing twenty-five names. Upon review, I found that eight of these were not members of our association. I stated this at the time, and the host removed them. Therefore, only seventeen participated in the lottery, from which seven were drawn, listed as follows:

Store Name Manager

Zhang Senmao Zhang Xianliang

Wufu Cao Caigeng

Zhang Wanli Wang Yongxiang

Qiao Yuantai Qiao Fangfeng

Store Name Manager

Zhu Genji Zhu Jianni

Yang Longxing Yang Longquan

Zhang Wantai Zhang Shouqi

(Note) Qiao Yuantai is a Chinese wooden furniture store that filled out the membership form but has not yet paid membership fees and requested to withdraw from the association, which the association has not approved.

On the morning of the 17th, the businesses selected in the lottery were notified by the tax bureau to submit their account books to the bureau for inspection on the morning of the 18th. The next morning (the 18th), I, Zhang Zhongyuan, sent Wang Wenhao, the bookkeeper from my store, to the bureau with the account books. According to his report, 'The auditors were critical and intimidating during the inspection, nitpicking and demanding tax supplements of over one hundred million yuan.' Subsequently, managers from Zhu Genji, Zhang Senmao, and other investigated businesses also reported similar situations to me, each facing tax supplements ranging from tens of millions to one hundred million yuan. That afternoon, the businesses received phone calls from Zou Wenlong, an official from the tax bureau, inviting them to a meeting at the Jinghua Restaurant. Considering that my store's annual turnover is only over three hundred million yuan, and the tax supplement should not be so high, and having heard rumors of similar extortion in other industries, this phone invitation seemed like an attempt at extortion. I instructed the business owners to attend the meeting to investigate the truth, but to be evasive as much as possible. If it was indeed extortion, I had my own plans. Around 7 p.m., I received a phone call at the Daguan Commercial Plaza from Wang Yongxiang, the manager of my store, saying: 'The auditor in charge of our store's account books, surnamed Wang, said that our store should pay at least one hundred million yuan in tax supplements and 'social expenses,' and that I, Zhang Zhongyuan, needed to meet him in person to discuss it.' At that time, besides sending Shen Wenbin (accountant of Daguan Commercial Plaza) to represent me and deal with him, I wanted to secretly inform Bureau Chief Lou by phone, but I could not find the phone number of his residence. I then called Director Pan, but he was out. So I called Councilors Shao Yongsheng, Yang Fusheng, and Secretary-General Yan Esheng of the Chamber of Commerce to report the situation. At the same time, I received a phone call from Shen Wenbin reporting that the tax supplement and so-called 'social expenses' had been reduced from one hundred million yuan to eighty million yuan, and now further reduced to a minimum of sixty-nine million yuan.' I still instructed them to be evasive and postpone the matter until the next day. That night at 11 p.m., Shen Wenbin, Zhang Xianliang, and Zhang Zhonghui and Wang Yongxiang from my store returned to Daguan Commercial Plaza, all saying that 'Auditor Wang Rentang asked me, Zhang Zhongyuan, to personally go to the bureau the next afternoon to discuss everything.' The next morning (the 19th) at 8:30 a.m., Councilor Yang Fusheng and I went to see Director Pan together. However, he was chairing a conscription association meeting at the City Council, so we went directly to the council. We finally met him around 11 a.m. At that time, Chairman Xu Jiqing of the Chamber of Commerce, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan of the City Council, Chairman Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union, and others were present. After hearing my report, they were all extremely indignant. Director Pan instructed me to continue negotiating properly to obtain conclusive evidence before reporting the matter. I immediately called Shen Wenbin and instructed him to still represent me and meet with Wang Rentang to negotiate and obtain conclusive evidence. Around 2 p.m., Shen Wenbin and Zhang Xianliang came to report the results of their negotiations, reducing the amount from 29 million yuan to 23 million yuan (including 13 million yuan for tax supplement, to be paid after receiving notification from the tax bureau, and 10 million yuan for so-called 'social expenses,' to be paid no later than the day after tomorrow (the 21st), with the payment location and interest rate to be notified by phone). Subsequently, other businesses came to report that they had also reached agreements:

Store Name Manager Tax Supplement Social Expenses

Zhang Senmao Zhang Xianliang 7 million yuan 7 million yuan

Zhang Wantai Zhang Shouqi 4 million yuan 10 million yuan

Wufu Cao Caigeng 4 million yuan 10 million yuan

Zhu Genji Zhu Jianni 5 million yuan 9 million yuan

Zhang Wanli Zhang Zhongyuan 13 million yuan 10 million yuan

Yang Longxing Yang Longquan 7 million yuan 7 million yuan

Qiao Yuantai Qiao Fang Note: No report, reason as previously noted

On the morning of the 21st, Zhang Xianliang and Zhu Jianni came to me, saying: 'Zou Wenlong from the tax bureau just called, asking us to pay the social expenses at 11 a.m. today. What should we do?' I instructed Zhang and Zhu to issue a check for 500,000 yuan from the Benqi Service Society's Dade Qianzhuang (the total amount of social expenses for the six businesses was 53 million yuan, pretending to bargain down by 3 million yuan to show sincerity) to obtain evidence for the planned reporting.

Around 8 p.m. on the same day, after returning to Daguan Commercial Plaza from outside, Shen Wenbin and Zhang Xianliang introduced me to Wang Rentang (the tax bureau auditor who inspected the account books of Zhang Wanli and extorted bribes from my representative Shen Wenbin). At the time, Councilor Fei Shusheng, reporter Gu Huiren from the Dagong News Agency, and others were present. Wang Rentang told me: 'Bureau Chief Lou has already sent someone to investigate this case and is willing to return the 10 million yuan of social expenses under my name.' Because I had a trip to Wuxi the next day, I instructed them to continue contacting Shen Wenbin. At 10 p.m. on the 23rd, I returned to Shanghai from Wuxi. Zhang Xianliang and Zhu Jianni reported to me: 'This morning, we received a phone call from Zou Wenlong of the tax bureau, asking us to discuss the payment location before 11 a.m. After arriving as scheduled, Zou Wenlong returned a Chengdu Bank check with the name Deng, totaling 50 million yuan. In the afternoon at 2 p.m., the bureau sent Inspector Miao and another supervisor to investigate, claiming that bribery and accepting bribes are the same crime, and asked us to sign written statements.' I have prepared a detailed written account of the entire incident and request investigation and supervision.

### Initial Court Hearing Investigates, Summons Informant Witnesses

[Our Report] Regarding the case of corruption by Direct Tax Bureau officials, previously reported by Zhang Zhongyuan and others of the wooden furniture industry, eight suspected officials, including Wang Lianlu, have been sent by the bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office for detention and interrogation. Yesterday, the prosecutor summoned the informants Zhang Zhongyuan of Zhang Wanli, Zhang Shouqi of Zhang Wantai, Zhang Xianliang of Zhang Senmao, Zhu Jianni of Zhu Genji, Cao Caigeng of Wufu, and the female owner of Yang Longxing, as well as witness Qiao Fang of Qiao Yuantai, a total of seven people, to court for investigation. The hearing lasted from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The details of the officials' extortion, how they demanded 50 million yuan in gratuities, and how the suspects returned the checks after the incident were vividly described. After questioning, they were all instructed to return and await further questioning at a later date.

### U.S. Military Tribunal Arraigns Malley, Begins Closing Arguments in the Afternoon

[Our Report] The U.S. Military Tribunal convened at 9 a.m. yesterday, continuing to examine witnesses De Dutrelet and Oberlin. De Dutrelet testified that he had known Cooley for six years. Before August 1st, he met Cooley on Avenue Joffre, where Cooley indicated he wanted to do a transaction that would be easy and profitable. On August 1st, he saw Cooley and Malley drinking together in the Huizhong Hotel bar. Oberlin was then examined, testifying that he met Cooley on Nanking Road on the morning of August 1st. Cooley told him that there would be an easy money-making deal that afternoon and that it was the kind of opportunity where you could take money from the Chinese. Defendant Malley was then examined, and his testimony was consistent with his written statement from the previous day, except he admitted that he had committed a crime in Chicago when he was eighteen. He placed the responsibility for the shooting of Yu Ganxiao entirely on Cooley. After a recess at noon, the proceedings resumed at 1:30 p.m. The prosecutor raised various questions, cross-examining Malley. Malley's attitude was particularly unnatural at this time. He paused to think for a moment before answering even the most important questions with very short responses. His voice was so low that not only was it difficult to hear from the gallery, but the court also had to ask the stenographer to repeat the responses several times to understand their content. The judge also seemed uninterested in Malley's testimony; one judge was chewing gum to relieve boredom. In his testimony, Malley insisted that Cooley held the gun, but when the prosecutor asked which hand Cooley held the gun in, he could not answer. He also admitted that he pushed the injured and bleeding Yu Sheng out of the car while Cooley stood by and watched, without helping.

After the judges asked questions and the prosecutor finished questioning, the judges raised questions, which Malley answered simply. The main points were: (1) Malley had only four U.S. dollars with him when he came to Shanghai from Beijing. (2) Before Malley returned to China, Cooley had promised him a job after he arrived in Shanghai, but Cooley went back on his word after Malley arrived. (3) Before cooperating with Cooley (referring to buying gold bars from Yu Shengxiao), no one had warned him or advised him not to work with Cooley. (4) The meeting with Cooley on the afternoon of August 1st was unexpected and not prearranged. (5) He threw the injured Yu Shengxiao out of the car entirely due to Cooley's threats. Although Cooley did not point a gun at him at the time, he dared not resist because Cooley had the weapon in his hand. At this point, the defendant's attorney stood up to add that Malley had flown to Shanghai from Beijing at 9 a.m. on August 1st and arrived around 11 a.m. Presiding Officer Colonel Palmer then announced the adjournment of Malley's hearing.

The prosecutor presents his views After a five-minute recess, the closing arguments began. First, the prosecutor, based on his own investigation and the summation of the testimony of various witnesses, reported the contents of the case, stating that Malley and Cooley were definitely related to the bloody incident. The two had known each other for years, and their relationship was generally good, so Cooley first sought work for Malley. But after Cooley went back on his word, the relationship between the two deteriorated. Malley's trip to China this spring was entirely self-funded, so after arriving in Shanghai, he spent ten days visiting Cooley, hoping to get compensation, but he was unsuccessful because Cooley had moved. Unable to make a living in Shanghai, Malley joined the U.S. military service. On August 1st, after Malley came to Shanghai, he went to the New Lidu Bar around 3 p.m. and met Cooley. At this time, Malley proposed buying five gold bars, and Cooley came forward to contact Yu Sheng, and he rented a car, which ultimately led to the bloody incident on the Shanghai-Qingpu highway. The prosecutor further stated: "In my opinion, this case involves robbery and murder, and the criminals should be brought to justice."

The defense vigorously attacks Cooley After the prosecutor spoke, the defendant's attorney stood up to defend Malley, arguing that Yu Shengxiao's dying words identified Cooley as the murderer but did not mention the "American." According to the law, this matter was entirely an "individual act" and not a joint enterprise. Therefore, if Cooley is guilty, then Malley is completely innocent and should be exonerated. Moreover, Cooley's numerous statements are contradictory and full of loopholes, while Malley's numerous statements are consistent throughout. Therefore, according to legal principles, Cooley's testimony cannot be considered valid. At this point in the debate, it was already past 5 p.m., and the presiding officer announced the adjournment of the court and that it would reconvene at 9 a.m. this morning to collect all relevant information, give it careful consideration, and then make a judgment. According to observers in the gallery, the closing arguments should not take too long, but a "secret ballot" requiring a three-quarters supermajority is needed to decide whether Malley is guilty, so the announcement of the verdict may not be imminent.

### Yarn Factories Withdraw from the Industrial Association, Hu Boxiang Claims Ignorance

[Our Report] A reporter yesterday visited Hu Boxiang, a standing director of the Shanghai Industrial Association, to inquire about the resolution passed at the recent joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Federation of Yarn Factories, ordering its members to withdraw from the Industrial Association. According to Mr. Hu, the Industrial Association has no knowledge of this matter. He also stated that many textile industry units participate in the Industrial Association, all voluntarily, and that the textile industry occupies a very important position in the Industrial Association. For example, Rong Hongyuan, a standing director of the Shanghai Industrial Association, is the general manager of Shenxin Yarn Factory, and Director Rong is very enthusiastic about the affairs of the Industrial Association and has no intention of "withdrawing."

### Mayor Wu Anxious About City Budget Issues, Shortfall Reaches One Trillion, Meeting to Discuss Today

[Our Report] The issue of the municipal government's budget preparation for next year has become the most difficult task for the municipal government. According to Min Zhoufan, director of the accounting office, yesterday, the total budget after reductions by various agencies still exceeds two trillion yuan, while the municipal government's income for next year will be at most around one trillion yuan. Therefore, the municipal government's budget for next year still cannot be prepared. The municipal government is very anxious about this. Mayor Wu has scheduled a meeting today with the heads of various bureaus and offices to hold a discussion on the budget preparation for next year to make a final decision.

Inauguration of the Velvet Exhibition, Film Star Li Lihua Cuts the Ribbon (Photo by this newspaper)

### Yumin Factory Velvet Exhibition Opens, Li Lihua Cuts the Ribbon

[Our Report] The Earth Brand Shuangyang Brand Velvet Exhibition organized by the Shanghai Yumin Woolen Velvet Factory was unveiled at 10 a.m. yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association by Shen Laizhou, Director of the Woolen Velvet Trade Association. Li Lihua cut the ribbon, and guest Yan Huiqing delivered a speech, elaborating on the excellence of domestic goods, which are no longer inferior to imported goods, making promotion necessary. Finally, Li Runsheng, General Manager of the factory, delivered a speech of thanks.

Subsequently, the exhibition officially began, and the audience was very crowded for a time. In addition to displaying pictures of the factory's production and manufacturing process, there were also twenty award-winning works from the previous knitting competition, displayed around the venue. At the same time, a temporary sales point was attached to the venue, limiting each person to purchasing one set. A lottery was drawn on the spot with evidence, and the special prize winner could receive the right to a "free sea, land, and air tour." The first prize included valuable prizes such as a sofa bed, watch, radio bicycle, and Eversharp fountain pen. It is said that the factory's total prizes this time are several thousand units, with a total value of about 500 million yuan?

Regarding the factory's production situation, because the raw material wool is mostly sourced from the UK and Australia, it is affected by import quotas, so the current output is about 80,000 pounds per month.

### Violations of the General Mobilization Order Will Be Handled by Military Law

The Songhu Garrison Command recently received the following two telegram orders from the Ministry of National Defense: (1) During the general mobilization period, those who violate the general mobilization order will be handled by military law. (2) Fugitive soldiers, after being arrested, must not be punished on the spot but should be sent back to the original military agency for disposal according to law.

### Fuxin Factory Rice Case Opens, Zhang Zhixue Takes the Blame for Others

[Our Report] The case of Fuxin Flour Company No. 1 Factory at 423 Guangfu Road, Zhabei, hoarding 420 dan of rice was sent by the Social Bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in mid-June. The defendants Hu Zhuping, an employee of the Wuxi office of Fuxin No. 1 Factory, Zhang Zhixue, a cadre of the Women's Christian Association, and Tan Fangxing, the manager of the Wuxi Yuxin Rice Factory, were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Crimes Against Grain Management in Extraordinary Times. The case was opened in the District Court yesterday, but it was adjourned for further investigation.

[Another Report] Regarding the part of the case involving Zhang Zhixue, who is suspected of being accused, the truth is as follows: Qiu Zhenhua, Zhang Yushi, Guan Wangshi, Zhang Guoji, Bian Zhongliang, and six others are friends with Zhang. In January of this year, they jointly entrusted Pu Zhiyuan, the factory director of Fuxin No. 1 Factory, to purchase 49 dan of rice for their families' needs, based on their friendship. Zhang Zhixue's share accounted for only 4 dan. At that time, due to limited living space, Zhang consulted and agreed with Factory Director Pu to temporarily store the rice in Fuxin No. 1 Factory. When the Social Bureau sent personnel to investigate the factory in March, because Zhang worked for the Women's Christian Association, they mistakenly believed that the rice was purchased and stored by the Women's Christian Association, and thus accused him of violating the Grain Management Regulations. Qiu and the others had sent a letter to the Social Bureau stating the true facts. It is understood that the total number of family members of Qiu and the others is as many as 86 people. Calculated at one shi sheng per person for three meals a day, 49 dan of rice is not enough for two months. Zhang had no intention of making a profit, but he took the blame for others with such a small amount, which was unexpected.

### Insufficient Volunteers, Conscription of Young Men Will Adopt an Indirect Lottery Method

[Our Report] The city's conscription of 3,000 soldiers this year will be mainly based on the recruitment of volunteers. If there are not enough volunteers, then conscription will be carried out by lottery according to law. However, the city is vast and there are many eligible young men, so a direct lottery is impossible. Therefore, an indirect lottery method will be adopted. The Ministry of National Defense has stipulated that the indirect lottery method is divided into two types: (1) If too few active-duty eligible men are unable to attend the lottery in person, the township (town) chief may draw the lottery on their behalf. (2) If most active-duty men are unwilling to participate in the direct lottery or are unable to attend the lottery in person due to circumstances, representatives of the conscription association may draw the lottery on their behalf. It is also reported that the Civil Affairs Office has received registration lists of requests for deferment of conscription from 26 districts, totaling more than 96,000 people.

### Father's Crime Not Cleared, Daughter's Body Defiled First, Police Officer Uses Coercion and Inducement, Incident Exposed and Accused

[Our Report] Zhang Juanjuan, 25 years old, from Suzhou. Last July, her father was detained in the Lujiawan Police Station for drug use. Juanjuan went to deliver food twice a day. A police officer from the station, Lu Lingsheng, 35 years old, from Nanjing, told Zhang that he could find a way to acquit her father. He also invited Zhang to meet him at Room 203, Lushan Apartment, Julu Road. Lu told her that he was still single. Under coercion and inducement, the dream came true, and he repeatedly raped her dozens of times, resulting in a secret pregnancy. However, her father was sentenced to six months in prison by the court and was released after two months. Seeing his daughter's big belly, he knew something was wrong. After questioning her, she argued with Lu. Lu only agreed to pay 500,000 yuan for one birth, and ignored the rest. Juanjuan filed a complaint with the police station, which has now transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling.

### Patient Refused Discharge, Jumps from Building and Dies

[Our Report] Yao Youcai, a patient in the fourth-floor ward of Guangci Hospital, wanted to be discharged and return home because his condition had not improved after a week of treatment, but was rejected by the French doctor at the hospital, Yidishate. At 6 a.m. yesterday, Yao suddenly jumped from the building and died on the spot.

### Hoping to Save Wasteful Expenses and Benefit Poor Students

Today is the nineteenth day of fundraising for the "Reader's Bursary," and the deadline has passed more than half way. In these nineteen days, a total of only 42,996,000 yuan has been received. This amount is about one-twentieth less than our final goal of one billion yuan. There is no doubt that this number is too far from the planned plan. If this situation continues, the amount of donations will definitely not exceed 200 million yuan by the time the deadline expires. At that time, it will be difficult for us to fully realize our plan. The facts clearly tell us that it is the vast group of poor students who are eagerly awaiting help who are suffering the misfortune. In this society, countless rich people and local tycoons spend countless amounts of money every day for extravagance and pleasure, a night of revelry, perhaps enough to provide dozens of poor students with tuition for a semester, a luxurious feast, perhaps enough for a poor student's meals for half a year.

We hope that enthusiastic readers can save a little money so that these poor young people will not suffer the misfortune of dropping out of school.

### ### Canton-Hankow Railway Massive Embezzlement Case Officials at All Levels Involved, Reaching a Huge Sum of 2.5 Billion

[Central News Agency Changsha Seventh Dispatch] A major corruption and embezzlement case recently occurred in the Canton-Hankow Railway, involving all section chiefs of the railway transportation system and station masters of major stations. The freight rate of the railway increased by 200% starting from August 1st, and station masters took the opportunity to collect packages as much as possible before August 1st, then delayed the delivery of goods, accepting bribes. Former Changsha East Station Master Zhou Yifang, Transportation Section Chief Li Wentao, Deputy Section Chief Zhou Shuxiong, and others colluded to illegally collect approximately 50,000 packages, from which they profited to the huge sum of 2.5 billion yuan. Fearing implication, the Director of the Railway Transportation Department also took advantage of his authority to allocate vehicles, receiving 50,000 yuan for each vehicle allocated. He deliberately protected Zhou, Li, and others by transferring them to other positions to cover up the matter. This was discovered by Jiang Guodong, the Director of the Railway Police Department, who immediately dispatched officers to arrest Zhou, Li, and others from their respective locations and bring them to Changsha for detention. The entire case is currently being investigated by a senior investigator appointed by the department.

### Geological Survey of Zibo Mining Area Boshan Pottery and Materials Industry

[Our Newspaper Boshan Fifth Dispatch] As early as the Song Dynasty, more than 700 years ago, Boshan began manufacturing pottery. The products at that time were mostly black. White pottery first appeared in the Ming Dynasty. The raw materials used for pottery, such as coke spar, silica, and feldspar, are abundantly produced in Beiling Mountain and Touwudian in the county. Before the War of Resistance, during the most prosperous period, more than 200 manufacturers were engaged in production, and there were more than 120 large merchants specializing in kiln products. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Boshan was "liberated" by the communist bandits three times. The original larger pottery businesses, even if they were not liquidated, were subjected to struggle, and the pottery industry declined sharply. Currently, only a dozen or so businesses are still continuing production, and the largest of these is the state-run "Shandong Provincial Model Pottery Factory."

The predecessor of the Shandong Provincial Model Pottery Factory was the "Shandong Provincial Pottery Experimental Factory." The factory was founded in April of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and was located in Daliukeng, Boshan. In July of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), it was renamed to its current name. The young engineer Wang Chengke, only 28 years old, took office as the factory director. When Director Wang arrived, it was just after the second retreat of the communist bandits. The factory was in a state of disrepair and everything needed to be rebuilt. Through his hard work and painstaking management, by September of the same year, the factory had achieved a basic scale and began production. Before the communist bandits entered Boshan for the third time on February 23rd of this year, the factory was already able to

Produce a large quantity of goods, with a monthly output of 210,000 pieces of porcelain (two-thirds of which were electrical porcelain) and 300,000 fire bricks (including special-shaped bricks). All necessary equipment for porcelain manufacturing, such as horizontal boilers, water-tube boilers, vertical and horizontal steam engines, grinders, ball mills, iron bowl machines, and steel brick soil crushers, were fully installed. The manufacturing process is roughly as follows:

(1) Raw materials – crusher – rotary crusher – ball mill – mud pump – mud press – horizontal mixer.

(2) Forming – mold making – blank making – billet pressing – trimming.

(3) Glazing – spraying glaze, dipping glaze, immersing glaze.

(4) Firing – kiln construction – loading kiln – firing kiln – unloading kiln – inspection and selection.

(5) Painting (decal, drawing, brushwork) – firing – finished product.

In addition to the manufacture of ceramic products and chemical materials (such as various refractory, acid-resistant, silicon, and magnesium-calcium bricks), the factory also plans to add a glass manufacturing department in the second half of this year. At the same time, the established research laboratory is also planned to be greatly expanded, with analysis, measurement, and research on the composition of various raw materials to make improvements. Unfortunately, in February of this year, the communist bandits "liberated" Boshan for the third time. When they retreated on August 17th of the same year, they swept away all valuable instruments, chemical reagents, and pigments for porcelain.

Fortunately, the main machinery did not suffer major damage. During the communist occupation, two machines originally located in the Qingjinlang factory in Nanding were moved to the factory to increase its output. However, to fully restore the factory to its former glory will take more than just a few months of effort.

According to Director Wang, the local magnetic soil has a high iron content and the color is slightly inferior. However, if the entire factory is completely repaired and the machinery and equipment are complete, and if porcelain clay from Wendeng, Jiaodong (which can be used to make high-voltage electrical porcelain and exquisite porcelain), is also used, the raw materials will be sufficient. When the factory has 427 workers (currently only over 100 workers), it will be able to produce 60,000 pieces of porcelain per month (two-thirds of which are electrical porcelain) and 50,000 fire bricks (including special-shaped bricks). The quantity and quality will be better than ever before. At present, the production of Zhens porcelain is still done by hand, the output is small, and the cost is high. With machine manufacturing, the output is large, and the selling price is low.

The glass industry in Boshan is called the furnace material or furnace mining industry.

The main raw materials are stone alkali, white sand, purple stone, foreign alkali, saltpeter, fire saltpeter, green soil, and ganza soil. The tools are furnaces, including sitting furnaces, chute furnaces, flat sheet furnaces, round furnaces, crucible furnaces, blowing pipe molds, pressure machines, and flat sheet stone wheel carts. Before the war, there were a total of 53 factories, with more than 2,000 workers, producing 200 tons per year. The main products were various lampshades, water bottles, and stationery. At that time, they could be sold throughout the country. During the war, due to restrictions by the enemy and puppets, sales were limited to the Jiaoji Railway line. The number of factories was reduced to more than 20, with thousands of workers, and annual production also fell to dozens of tons. After the victory, due to frequent bandit troubles, less than 10 factories were able to maintain their current status, with monthly production of less than one ton. In addition, due to the communist bandits' struggle, they urgently hope that the government will provide effective relief or loans. (Special Correspondent Luo Tian)

### ### Yi Tribal Leader Arrives in Chengdu to Petition Demanding Equal Political Participation and Suppression of Rebellion

[Our Newspaper Chengdu Sixth Dispatch] The Yi tribal leader from the Chuanbian area, Zhuo Guanguan, the head of Zhuokeji, in order to support the government's suppression of the rebellion and demand equal political participation, specially sent a representative, the Tusi Abu, to Chengdu to pay his respects to Chairman Deng of the provincial government and present his views on political participation. Yesterday, with the help of an interpreter, the reporter spoke with this knowledgeable Yi youth about the recent situation in the Yi area.

According to Tusi Abu, Zhuokeji is the leader of the four major Tusi in Sichuan Province, governing the four counties of Songpan, Lifan, Mao County, and Maogong, with a vast territory. The Yi people in the area number about one million. The general level of knowledge is average, but they suffer from not being understood by the outside world. The Yi tribe hopes for the opportunity to participate in politics and for equality between Han and Yi.

According to Tusi Abu, before the war, Zhu Mao and his gang disturbed the Chuanbian area, and the Yi people suffered greatly from poisoning. They hold the communist bandits in deep hatred. The government should promptly use some strong force to wipe out the communist bandits, the public enemy of the country. Regarding the rumors of forced opium cultivation in the Yi area, Abu said it was not true. The good Yi people unanimously support the central government's plan to thoroughly ban opium and drugs this year. He hopes that the government will provide more guidance and welcomes people from the mainland to visit and travel for investigation. They have met Chairman Deng several times, with good results. In addition to expressing his condolences, the provincial government has agreed to forward all opinions to the central government. After the completion of their mission, they will return to Li County within a few days to report. (Reporter Zhou Xueduan)

### ### Participating in the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Elections Must Adopt an Open Activity Method Suzhou Provincial Chairman Telegraphs to All Counties to Pay Attention

### Wu Kaixian Convenes Rice Industry Representatives to Discuss Food Distribution Issues: Abundant Sources from All Regions, No Reason for Rice Prices to Rise

[Our Newspaper Report] Wu Kaixian, Chairman of the Food Distribution Committee, convened responsible persons from the city's Rice Merchants Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the city's food rice issues. More than 20 people including Wan Molin, Qu Zhenhua, Xu Hongren, Zhang Chao, and Hu Xianzhou attended, chaired by Wu as Chairman. He reported on the city's food distribution situation and discussed relevant city supply events, adjourning at approximately 6:00 PM.

It is also learned that the Food Distribution Committee will establish a storage and transportation office and entrust various rice merchants to purchase food rice from various producing areas. The committee will provide pledge funds for the white rice purchased. Rice merchants will convene a meeting today to discuss detailed measures. It is said that Director Wu will return to Shanghai to make a decision.

Government Decides to Step Up Rationing

It is also reported: It is learned that there are three reasons for the recent rise in rice prices in the city: (1) Due to the once tense military situation in Hankou, the river was sealed, resulting in unsmooth transportation. (2) A large amount of Wuhu rice is exported and smuggled to North China. (3) The new rice has not yet been on the market, and the period between the old and new crops has not yet passed. However, Hankou has now stopped sealing the river, and transportation is smooth. Wuhu was also ordered by the Executive Yuan last Wednesday to strictly prohibit exports to various parts of North China. New rice has also gradually entered the market, so rice prices will only tend to stabilize.

At the same time, in terms of the city's supply, the Food Distribution Committee needs 200,000 shi of rice per month, and approximately 30,000 shi are rationed to public and education personnel, and approximately 25,000 shi are allocated for military food for resident troops and police food, so the city's monthly supply totals more than 250,000 shi. If Shanghai is calculated with a population of 4.5 million, it only needs 450,000 shi of rice per month. The government's current supply has already exceeded 250,000 shi, and the shortage is only about 200,000 shi. The amount of rice arriving from various places can also exceed this number, so there is no shortage of supply. Therefore, there is no reason for rice prices to rise again. Moreover, the government has now decided: (1) to continue to step up rationing, (2) to control the market, (3) to reduce factors that increase rice prices, and (4) to expand the source of food rice. It is heard that a contract has now been finalized with the United States for 120,000 tons of American wheat, and shipment can begin in September after the technical issues have been resolved. In addition, 30,000 tons of Burmese rice and 90,000 tons of Siamese rice are currently being negotiated.

In addition, the United States also has 43,000 tons of rice. The import of the above rice and wheat is estimated to require more than 60 million US dollars, which has been prepared by the Rongjing government. Therefore, there is no problem with the source of food rice. Therefore, after the new rice is on the market, rice prices will tend to fall. However, if rice prices are too low, it will cause harm to farmers due to low grain prices, which is not a good strategy. It is heard that the government will consider purchasing grain in rice-producing areas after the autumn harvest for future adjustment, but the purchase will be based on the principle of not affecting market prices. Currently, Shanghai has hundreds of thousands of bags of rice in stock, and there is also a large amount of flour in stock, so the supply will definitely not be a problem.

Thin Rice Sells Well, Prices Rise

Yesterday, a total of more than 7,200 shi of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. Japonica rice and early thin rice were still active, and continued to rise by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. Indica rice, both new and old, arrived, and the source was connected, but sales were still weak, still set high and second weak. The situation of japonica and indica is completely opposite. Baiyuan's new japonica is fixed, and fragrant japonica rice is seen for the first time.

Although the ration price of flour has not changed, raw materials are expensive. Miscellaneous brands of flour are unwilling to sell cheaply due to high costs, and the situation tends to be secretly tight. Wheat bran is firm, soybean cake sales are light, and still stagnant. Soybean oil manufacturers are immovable, but local streets have turned prosperous, rising slightly by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The state of tea beans is sluggish. The supply of yuan wheat is intermittent, and the price is stable.

Red sorghum arrives and sells well, and the price is stable. Corn in North China is picked up at a high price, rising by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The middle and second grades are lacking and difficult to trade, and the situation is high, pretty, and weak. Sesame from Guangzhou is inquired, weak but turning stable. Raw peanuts are in a slump, falling another 10,000 yuan. Broad beans are rare to come and go, and the market is calm.

The oil market has ups and downs. Soybean oil is selling well, and the price is up 10,000 yuan. Raw oil is extremely sluggish, and the performance is weak by 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil is flat, vegetable oil is firm, and clear oil is firm.

### Flour Market Opens Today

The Flour Business Association will open the auction market for trading from 10:00 AM today. Eleven market management committee members and five mediation committee members were elected. Approximately one hundred industry members participated in the market. The commission for flour trading is set at 200 yuan in national currency per bag for both buyers and sellers. Both parties pay half each. The market management rules have been established and sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval.

### Domestic Black Tea Transactions, Approximately 250 Boxes Yesterday

Black tea from the Suzhou and Wuxi areas, which has been thinking about starting operations for a long time, has approached merchants in the market yesterday to negotiate. By the close of the market, approximately 250 boxes had been transacted, but most of them were low-grade old goods, with prices ranging from 365,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan per batch. The market atmosphere continued to be firm and stable. Other varieties, although lacking a certain amount of activity in the street shops and customer gangs, are still secretly being pursued. The asking price is maintained as before by suppliers, and all are unwavering. As for the foreign firm tea market, the process is still quite quiet, because both buyers and sellers are in hesitation.

According to industry sources: Qimen black tea, which has always been loved by the British, is now even more interested in this year's new tea in the area, but the offer is still stingy, and the situation is difficult to open. It is now heard that companies such as Yutai, Wuchang, and Huacha are planning to send telegrams overseas requesting price increases, but whether or not it is possible is difficult to predict at this time.

### Rayon Stable

The rayon market was stable yesterday, with sparse trading. In the morning, the asking price for No. 120 bright, Jin San Ma, and Tianqiao was 25.78 million yuan, and the transaction price at noon was 5.8 million yuan. The asking price was 6 million yuan. In the afternoon, the transaction price was 5.9 million yuan, and Dongyang asked for 6 million yuan, which was 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day.

Factory warp yarn trading was still only in lots yesterday, with transaction prices the same as the previous day. Raw warp yarn for immediate delivery was priced around 18.5 million yuan after discounts. Because of slightly better sales, silk quilt covers from rural areas held firm yesterday, rising 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of Dacheng Xinghua's strong fabrics were mixed. Checked crepe was still asking for 40,500 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### Qinhuangdao Coal Awaiting Transport to Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] As of August 21st, the total amount of coal awaiting export from Qinhuangdao had reached 60,680 tons, which is extremely important for Shanghai, which is suffering from a power shortage. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has telegraphed the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee to quickly send ships to transport it.

### Goldsmiths' Operating Expenses Deemed Too High by Director Wu

Representatives of the goldsmith industry in this city visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau at 4 p.m. yesterday to present their requests regarding the operating expenses for resuming the trading of gold ornaments and legitimate profits. The operating expenses they listed were 40 percent (including donations, taxes, chemicals, labor costs, staff commissions, packaging, coloring, molds, material losses, and others accounting for 15 percent, and interest accounting for 25 percent), and the profit was 20 percent, totaling 60 percent. It is said that Director Wu considered this cost too high and will discuss it again after Wu Min returns to Nanjing.

### Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee Holds Ad Hoc Meeting; Principles for Exporting Yarn and Cloth from Private Factories Acceptable

[Our Dispatch] The Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee held an ad hoc meeting at 5 p.m. on the 8th, chaired by Liu Siying, with more than ten committee members present. The matters discussed were: (1) Regarding the processing fees for cotton yarn spun on behalf of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee, it was decided that the fee for 20-count standard yarn would be 3.8 million yuan per piece (previously decided at 4 million yuan). The processing fees for other counts of yarn would be calculated proportionally. (2) The previous request from private yarn factories to export yarn and cloth was, in principle, acceptable. In the future, the private yarn factories would provide the yarn and cloth, and the Import and Export Control Committee would find ways to export it. It was decided to discuss it further with the committee. (3) The procedures and methods for purchasing yarn spun on behalf of the committee from foreign cotton in the first and second quarters were decided.

### Actual Sales of Yarn and Cloth Launched; Prices Increased Yesterday

The cotton yarn market was driven by actual sales yesterday, and trading was brisk, with prices rising across the board. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose to 18.35 million yuan, a rebound of 650,000 yuan from the previous day.

Actual sales of cotton cloth gradually increased yesterday, and businesses began to switch from selling to buying, with even stronger buying interest from retail investors. The market trend was directly upward. As a result, Dragon Head fine cloth was raised to 500,800 yuan due to buying from all sides, an increase of 10,000 yuan from the previous day.

China Textile Construction Sells Cloth [Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company opened sales of 23 types of cotton cloth and 1 type of bed sheet as usual yesterday, with allocation prices similar to before. Because the cloth market was quite brisk yesterday, those who went to purchase were very enthusiastic.

### Flour Re-export Permits Directly Issued by the Ministry of Food

[Our Dispatch] Since the Ministry of Food announced the measures for flour re-export quotas, the total amount of flour from factories in Jiangsu Province and the Shanghai-Nanjing area for shipment in August was 600,000 bags, allocated to 26 factories. Among them, the five major factories, including Mianxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huapan, and Yutong, accounted for half of the total amount. The previous allocation ratio was designated by the Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, according to the actual production volume of each factory, with 34.89 percent of the approved export volume. Previously, in order to facilitate the application of each member, the Fourth District Association requested the Ministry of Food to issue the re-export permits to the association for distribution to each factory. However, there was no response for a long time, so Qian Zhonghan, the managing director of the association, was dispatched to Nanjing to make a request. Qian has already returned to Shanghai, and the Ministry of Food did not approve the association's request to issue the re-export permits in total. The application for the issuance of re-export permits for the approved export volume of each factory in August has been approved by the Ministry of Food, and each factory shall prepare a document and apply directly to the ministry for issuance, with the association affixing its seal for certification. In addition, the re-export quota for September is approaching, and each factory should fill out a list of the actual daily output according to the forms previously issued by the Ministry of Food and submit it on a weekly basis, which will be forwarded by the association to the ministry for approval. Those who fail to submit it by the deadline or do not fill it out according to the regulations will be deemed to have voluntarily given up their quota.

### Preparatory Meeting Held for Textile Production Conference

[Our Dispatch] The National Textile Industry Production Conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs appointed the heads of the ministry's agencies in Shanghai as preparatory committee members, totaling 23 people.

(4) Textile machinery, textile technology, textile raw materials, replication industry, yarn factory association members, and relevant textile education trade, and other textile experts from all aspects were invited to attend the conference. (5) It was decided that the scope of discussion at the conference would be matters related to textile industry production. It is said that the conference venue is currently under discussion.

### Spot Cotton Continues to Rise

Spot cotton prices continued to rise yesterday because yarn factories' buying interest was not strong and the prices offered were not high. Traders were firm and trading was very brisk, with more than 2,400 bales traded throughout the day. Prices increased by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the price for delivery to the factory was 2.335 million yuan for Lingbin, 2.17 million yuan and 2.2 million yuan for Shashi, and 2.17 million yuan for Hankou fine lint. The price for warehouse delivery was 2.22 million yuan for Mitelin, 2.2 million yuan, 2.25 million yuan, 2.3 million yuan, and 2.335 million yuan for Lingbin. The price for extra grade Mitelin was 2.5 million yuan, Shashi was 2.15 million yuan and 2.18 million yuan, Hankou fine lint was 2.06 million yuan, 2.12 million yuan, and 2.15 million yuan.

### Calculation of Tip Money for Reporting Black Market Gold and Currency Transactions Changed

[Our Dispatch] After the official exchange rates for gold and US dollars were announced, the reporter inquired with the National Bank yesterday about whether there had been any changes in the calculation of tip money for reporting black market transactions. It was learned that according to the regulations on rewarding those who report gold and foreign currency transactions on the black market, the tip money for the informant is calculated based on the value of the confiscated goods converted into national currency. Now that there are new regulations for the exchange rates of gold and US dollars, the calculation should be based on the government's newly set exchange rates. In addition, once a black market foreign exchange telegraphic transfer is uncovered, the seized evidence should also be rewarded in comparison with foreign currency in order to encourage reporting.

### Consolidated Bonds Weak, Foreign Stocks Remain Buoyant

Consolidated bonds were flat yesterday, with the rest declining. Consolidated C opened at 14,400 yuan, with the highest price no more than 14,500 yuan, retreating to 13,800 yuan at the close. Runde advanced from 550 to 538, and Dacheng New advanced from 503 to 555. As a result, compared to the previous close, Consolidated A, B, and E each fell by 600 yuan, Consolidated C also fell by 800 yuan, Consolidated D was the only one that was flat, and the turnover was still only around 6 million yuan.

Foreign stocks continued to be buoyant yesterday, with the Guangdong group and the banking group absorbing more shares, and that stock rose the most. Yisha had 5,000 shares absorbed by the banking group, and Dacheng Securities group and foreign company group sold. Yisha opened at 90,800 yuan in the morning, with the highest price no more than 92,900 yuan, retreating to 92,000 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Shipping, and Telephone rose slightly, while Yeguang, Paper, and Steel each rose by half a percent, and Xiangtai rose by slightly less than 10 percent.

### Transactions Remain Sparse; Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks Narrow

Chinese stocks were still lifeless yesterday. Outside the market, the demolition of telephone lines and the tightening of inquiries by weaving companies invisibly constrained Hengtong's activities. Transactions inside the market also remained sparse. Except for the indirect and slight stimulus from foreign exchange and foreign stocks, and the stubborn resistance of Multifarious No. 116 and No. 152, it still presented a deserted scene. However, there was still a residual force after the close, and the asking price was slightly tired. Although Xinguang and Jingfu were slightly constrained by the environment in the middle and retreated slightly after rising, the exhaustion of chips made it easier to support the closing price.

The opening was high in the morning. After the opening of Shiyong Yarn, it rose to 241 yuan after being bought by No. 10 and others. No. 36 and No. 223 both sold, and after retreating to 238 yuan, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had changed slightly. No. 116 and others came in, and the buying sentiment recovered slightly, rising back to 244 yuan. No. 223 and No. 14 still sold hard, retreating to 241 yuan. However, foreign stocks continued to rise. The interest rate outside the market opened low at 12 cents and 16.5 cents, and No. 116 and No. 22 bought, rising to 245 yuan. However, the stricter inspection of telephones by the authorities inevitably hit the activities of the movers and shakers. No. 105 and others sold off, and No. 99 also supplied Shiyong Yarn, gradually falling to around 239 yuan. Until 11:30, No. 155 and others came to buy at the low, and No. 218 also entered after exiting. Shiyong Yarn closed at a price of 239 yuan and 241 yuan, and the asking price tended to rise after the close.

As a result, compared to the previous close, spot delivery stocks Xinguang, Jingfu, Shiyong Yarn, Xinyi, and Meiya rose slightly, Huati fell slightly, Xinhua, Qinxing, and Yonggong were flat, Zhongfa Matches fell by half a percent each, and Rongmeng, Datong, Jinglun, and Lian were all flat, Underwear and Zhongfang rose slightly, and China Silk and Commerce fell slightly. Among the forward delivery stocks, Feng fell by half a percent, Shiyong Yarn, Xinyi, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing rose slightly, Meiya was still flat, and the old stocks outside the market were still stable.

### Request to Extend Forward Delivery Trading

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Stock Exchange submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs last week, requesting that the three-month trial period for forward delivery trading approved by the two ministries be extended, as it will expire at the end of September of this year. The words "trial" will be removed, and no time limit will be added. In addition, the exchange is scheduled to hold a meeting of the standing directors at 4 p.m. today.

We forwarded the letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for inquiry, and we have now received the following reply:

In reply: We recently received a letter from your newspaper forwarding a question from reader Zhu Yiqing asking whether the student screening in the recovered areas will continue to be held. This office has been holding screening events for more than a year, but recently received an order from the Ministry to terminate them and no longer hold them. We hereby reply for your information and transmission. Sincerely, Social Services Section of Shenbao, Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, August 30th.

We hereby reply accordingly for your information. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health, Social Services Section of Shenbao.

### Beware of Pickpockets

A reader submits a warning

Editor: I am an employee of a hardware store. This morning, I wrapped 50 "shuttle cores" and "bottom plate springs" destined for the dyeing and weaving factory on Changshou Road in newspaper, tied them with a handkerchief, and hung them on the handlebars of my bicycle. When I reached the entrance of Yitaixing Coal Ball Factory on Maigen Road, I suddenly felt that I couldn't pedal. I stopped and saw that the rear wheel chain was wrapped with a ring of yarn. I bent over to pull the yarn away, and when I looked up, the items on the handlebars had disappeared. I immediately realized that this was the work of pickpockets, but there was no way to chase them. I think similar things must happen often, so I ask your column to publish this to make everyone who carries items on bicycles aware and careful. Thank you!

Sincerely, Reader Zhang Cunchong, September 3rd.

### An Old Mother Longs for Her Son

I am an old widow with only one child, named Hu Lingen. In the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938], he secretly left home and went to the rear to join the army. In the autumn of the following year, he sent a letter from Shaanxi. Since then, until the victory of the war, there has been no letter. I have seen people returning home and reuniting, but there is still no news of my Lingen. How many days do I have left in this world at the age of 60? Therefore, I have asked people to inquire many times, but my longing is still not answered.

Now, I ask your newspaper to publish my letter and beg kind people everywhere to help me find him, so that our family can be reunited. How grateful I would be! My son is named Hu Lingen, also known as Yunpu, 26 years old, from Hutai, Wuxi. (Mailing address: Yao Ahe, c/o Zhang Tongshun Store, Hutai, Wuxi.)

### Enrolling Students for Cost Accounting Evening Class

Editor: I am a bank employee.

Currently, there are only 14 participants, and the class can only be opened if there are 25. The tuition fee is 120,000 yuan, and classes are held every Sunday morning. I have always admired your newspaper as the one and only major newspaper in our country, with a wide readership. I dare to send this letter and respectfully ask you to publish it so that the Cost Accounting class can start on time. I am extremely grateful. Sincerely, Reader Ma Jijian.

Spring and Autumn

### A Windy and Rainy Night

— Lan Hui

From the distant, abruptly rising peaks, sweeping one's gaze over the undulating hills like blue waves, and casting it upon the great bend of the Kunrong River, one can see a few Western-style houses nestled beside it like turtles; that is Zhihua Middle School.

Rain drifted down from the sky. The time was already late, and the bell had long ago clearly announced: the last class of the afternoon had ended.

The girl, Miao Jingying, rustled the pages of her book, searching for something, and turned her head to say to Niu Weineng, who was sitting in the back row:

"Niu, why are you sitting alone in the classroom instead of going out to play with them?"

"Hmm," he stopped writing, turned his gaze out the window, yawned, and said, "It's raining outside, the roads are muddy, there's nothing fun to do outside, so I might as well sit in the classroom and review my lessons."

"Ah, that's what diligent students think." She said admiringly, and smiled slightly; a letter, like a fallen leaf, floated from her open book to Niu Weineng's feet. He quickly noticed it, bent down

—"To Miss Miao Jingying," the letter was hers! It was still unopened; he quickly stood up

"Miao!" He handed the letter to her as she was about to step out of the classroom door, then returned to his seat.

…

Night.

The classroom was filled with the smoke of tung oil, which stained the lives of some young people.

The school servant announced outside the classroom door: "Niu Weineng—which one is Niu Weineng? The Dean of Students wants to see you!"

Hearing that it was the Dean of Students, it was a bit of a headache: his cold face, like winter, made people shiver at the sight of him; he never easily called students to speak with him; could it be a disaster today? Niu Weineng put down his book, with a fearful heart, somewhat panicked, took an umbrella from the corner of the room, and walked towards the office…

"Report!"

"Come in."

He timidly approached the desk and respectfully bowed to the Dean of Students.

The Dean of Students seemed not to have seen him enter, and continued to write something with his head down; after a long, long time, he slowly raised his head and said coldly:

"Oh, Niu Weineng, you've come!"

"Yes, Dean." His heart was pounding, and he tried his best to calm himself and answered respectfully.

"Do you know the saying, 'A small pond cannot raise a flying dragon'?" The Dean of Students stared intently at Niu Weineng with a meaningful gaze.

"Yes." He replied blankly.

"Do you understand the meaning of the saying, 'A great man dares to act and take responsibility'?" The Dean of Students pressed again.

"Yes."

"! Aha, that's good." The Dean of Students stood up with a subtle look, a confident smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and he spoke one word at a time: "Then—now, you go down, pack your luggage, and leave the school tomorrow morning."

"Why?" Niu Weineng was shocked.

A dismissive answer: "The school is expelling you."

"What have I done wrong?" Niu Weineng's heart was breaking; he felt like he had been struck suddenly, and all the blood rushed to his head; but he tried his best to restrain the excitement of his emotions.

"A great man should stand up and take responsibility for what he has done wrong; look at you, you look like you can't even count two hundred coppers…, " The Dean of Students began to pace back and forth in the room.

"What do you mean, 'can't count two hundred coppers'? What exactly have I done wrong?" He asked as sternly as before.

"You know yourself." Still a cold answer.

"The school can't just expel people without a reason, can it?" Like a erupting volcano, Niu Weineng shouted angrily; at this moment, all he had was self-confidence and honesty, and the heavy fear from before had disappeared without a trace.

"No reason, huh!" The Dean of Students stopped pacing, and his originally stiff face was now covered with a layer of terrible gloom, and these words were forced out from between his teeth: "I'll tell you: Miao Jingying reported you!"

"What?"

"Miao Jingying reported you!" The Dean of Students repeated impatiently, then closed his mouth tightly, as if his responsibility was over and he didn't want to say another word; then he looked up, staring at the ceiling in a daze.

"Dean…" Niu Weineng's lips trembled.

"No need to say more!" The Dean of Students waved his hand dismissively, and pointed to the door with his finger: "Now you go down, I can't decide on this matter; we'll decide everything when the principal comes.—I've already sent someone to invite the principal."

The wind and rain, carrying mud and sand, whistled and beat against Niu Weineng's body, and all he saw was a chaotic darkness! As deep as the sea…

With a trace of confusion, he entered the classroom; facing him was Zhang Zeya, who was known as the big mouth in the class, and as soon as they met, he went straight to the point:

"Niu Weineng! What did the Dean of Students call you for?"

Niu Weineng did not answer, and walked straight to Miao Jingying.

"Tsk tsk, it's terrible! The Dean of Students spoke to him!" Zhang Zeya, who did not get a reply, grumbled dissatisfiedly behind him

"Miao! Why did you report me?" Niu Weineng's voice trembled with emotion

Miao Jingying stood up in surprise, stayed for a while and then slumped back down, crying on the desk;……………

The eyes of all the classmates were focused on the two of them;………

…………………….

The principal came, and Niu Weineng was summoned to the office again.

"That's how it's decided!" the principal said to the Dean of Students, then turned his face to him: "Niu Weineng, the school has decided to expel you."

"Decided to expel me?" Niu Weineng couldn't quite believe his ears; but this was the truth! In the dark office, an oil lamp like a ghost fire flickered on the hideous faces of the principal and the Dean of Students.

"Yes. It's decided to expel you, yes, young people are often easily moved by emotions, … the ancients also had the saying, 'No man is perfect, and no one can avoid making mistakes,' even sages can't avoid making mistakes! It doesn't matter if you take the wrong path, turning back is the shore, you can start over; you should go back and let family life cleanse your mind, it might be good for you…"

"I'm not going back! What right does the school have to expel me?" Infinite anger took over him, and Niu Weineng interrupted the principal.

"What right? There's evidence!" The principal replied coldly.

"Where's the evidence?" Anger rose even higher, Niu Weineng's body trembled with excitement, his voice also trembled violently, and his eyes burned with white-hot fire.

"Look at yourself! Is this the attitude a student should have towards a teacher?" The Dean of Students said condescendingly to Niu Weineng, and glanced at the principal.

"Okay, give it to him to see for himself."

The Dean of Students obediently took out a Western-style letter from the desk drawer and handed it to Niu Weineng.

Ying—

You said: Who doesn't love bright roses? Who doesn't love rich and fragrant roses? ……… "Good flowers don't bloom often, good times don't last"! The door of youth will not always be open to those who hesitate, Ying! For the gifts of the creator, I hope that in the quiet Yangliu Lakeside of Baishui Park, we can have a spring date! Amen.

Not knowing what was going on, Niu Weineng looked at every word on that Western-style letter as if he had seen a ghost, and silently handed it back to the Dean of Students.

"Now, you go down and prepare everything, and you must leave the school before ten o'clock tomorrow morning!" The principal struck a match, lit a cigarette, and leaned back, blowing rings, and said calmly.

"Principal! I…"

"No need to say more, get out! This is the school rule!" The Dean of Students shouted angrily, and pushed Niu Weineng out of the office.

Back in the classroom, at his seat, Niu deeply buried his head, covering his face with trembling hands, and a layer of indescribable bitterness covered his heart.

The news that Niu Weineng was going to be expelled, like his own grand theory: "I told you, good people only do stupid things! Look at him, he's always reading, you think he's studying hard? Hehe! Wrong, that's not the case, he's actually… hehe, 'Sister, I love… love you'; so I said, those who are always reading are not good things!—You, you, you belong to this category." Then, he pointed at a classmate next to him with a finger, and all the male students in the classroom burst into laughter.

"Bullshit! Go to your mother!" The one who was pointed at protested loudly.

"You can know a person's face but not their heart, a beast in human skin!"

"Amitabha, to hell with it! One less A student, and 'I' will be one place higher!"…

The idle gossip of the classmates, like a flying gust of wind, kept blowing in his ears; a fire of poison was burning in Niu Weineng's heart, sorrow and hatred took over his entire mind, he could no longer bear it, he stood up, ran over, opened the classroom door with his hand, let the wind and rain rush in, he ran out…

Night; deep night! Thunder and lightning mixed with storms, from that vague illusion, waved the whip of unreason, composing a miserable song. …

The next day, the wind and rain stopped.

On the bulletin board in front of the office, a new notice was posted, with a few short sentences:

"After investigation, Niu Weineng, a student in class X of this school, has improper conduct and is hereby expelled to serve as a warning to others! This is the notice."

A group of classmates stood in front of the bulletin board, and the big mouth Zhang Zeya was also squeezed inside, pointing and gesturing: "Ah, Niu Weineng didn't return to the dormitory to sleep all night last night! His bed is next to mine, and it was empty until dawn."

"According to a fisherman, he saw a dead body floating on the river this morning…" Another classmate reported the news and speculated. ……

At this moment, a panicked classmate ran into the office, panting.

In the office, the principal was leisurely smoking a cigarette, and the Dean of Students was pacing calmly.

"Principal, the love letter to Miao Jingying was written by me!"

Like a loud spring thunder, the principal was horrified and stiffened, and the Dean of Students stopped walking; their bodies were trembling, and they were stunned for a moment.

Outside the office, a wave of infinite grief and anger was set off.

…………………….

In the garden of the living, there was a beautiful fruit tree that was destroyed by the storm. ……………

### Collected Lectures of Blok

—

Recently, Lindsay, a British scholar, has newly translated a collection of lectures by the Soviet poet Alexander Blok (1880-1921), a total of six articles. The title "The Spirit of Music" is quite misleading, as it is not specifically about music. Blok's "Spirit of Music" has something of the meaning of the Christian "Holy Spirit." He spoke of the general lack of this spirit before the revolution.

These lectures were apparently given during the revolutionary period, and their exposition of Christian doctrine is quite clear. It is a pity that the translator did not choose to translate some of Blok's beautiful poems, which is a loss.

But this book also talks about music, and that is the third lecture, "Art and Revolution." Blok wanted to link Wagner with Soviet Communism, and through the declarations of Marx and Engels, he mocked the general "giggling women and indifferent officials" who wanted to "starve Wagner." Blok shouted, "When the sound of revolution shakes in the air, Wagner's art is a strong answer."

But later, the Soviet Union thought that Wagner, Mozart, Beethoven and other music masters had nothing to do with politics, that they were all arts of the upper class, and should be banned. However, recently, these musical saints have been revered again.

This collection will not increase Blok's reputation outside of political circles. To remedy this defect, we should translate his poems well in the near future.

### Wuyou Temple

— Ye Dingluo

——Jiazhou Six Records, Part 2

When you come to Jiazhou, many friends will talk about Wuyou Temple and Giant Buddha Temple as famous attractions here.

I have also visited many famous places. The so-called famous attractions are not necessarily particularly outstanding places, but they have been highlighted by a famous figure in a certain era. Therefore, people of later generations all come here to visit in admiration. The ancients who highlighted the famous attractions mostly came from a temporary sense of excitement, and the modern people who visit the famous attractions mostly come from a sudden pleasure. Therefore, the so-called scenic area is actually like a potted landscape, a corner of the land for people to enjoy, its value is really less important to the community than the countryside that truly produces crops. However, famous attractions are, after all, places that many people manage.

In such a bad situation, to be able to forget all the worries of the present and the future one day, and to go to the mountains and forests to walk around recklessly, is really a rare blessing in life, which does not require much capital, and there is no need to have struggles with people. Why not do it?

In the morning, I was awakened by the noise of a thief made by my neighbor. As someone who is not a police officer, I felt that there was no need to interfere in this kind of event, and I was afraid of hearing this unpleasant sound, so I quickly got up, locked the door, found a friend, and went to visit Wuyou Temple together.

I bought some dry food on the street, walked out of Anlan Gate in the southern part of Jiading that is close to the water. The picturesque landscape made me forget the noisy city behind me, and I stood with my friend on the dock for a while, watching countless ships leaping in the waves by the river; the crowds crossing the river and countless boatmen made a deafening noise.

From the chaotic stone beach under the dock, I boarded a small covered ferry. The boatman followed the current, rowing towards the shore upstream, and then put it into the middle of the stream, allowing the water to push the boat towards the foot of the mountain on the opposite bank. Sitting on the boat, following the rise and fall of the waves, watching the turbulent Minjiang River and the Dadu River merge, countless wave boats floated like toys in this stream; the rocky hills of Giant Buddha Temple and Wuyou Temple gradually approached us, and I felt very spectacular.

The boat floated past the foot of the Giant Buddha Temple Mountain, and the Giant Buddha, standing majestically between the two stone walls, could be seen from afar. Because, although it is said to be at the foot of the mountain, it is actually still far away, so it can be seen. If it were really at the base of the Giant Buddha, one could only see a part of the Buddha's body below the base that is covered with messy trees. Comparing the boats on the river with the Giant Buddha in the mountains, one can only say that it is like an ant walking under a bamboo shoot?

The boat approached the foot of Wuyou Temple Mountain, and I saw countless stone eyes on the rock at the foot of the stone mountain, formed over countless years by the iron arrowheads on countless bamboo poles on countless boats. Several stone cracks, like those chiseled out by a file, were formed by the force of water over countless years. The power of water is indeed greater than the power of the mountain, but the mountain has stood still for countless years.

Leaving the boat and landing on the shore, I walked from the beach towards the stone steps, winding up the mountain. The unique tall and thin bamboo bushes of Sichuan, bending in all directions, were like objects standing in the aisles; there were originally many other large trees in between. Moss grew on the stone steps, making people feel like they were walking into a green net. It was a not very sunny autumn day, and the air was a bit humid. Sitting down in the cool shade halfway up the mountain, looking at the stone carvings on the wall, I saw that there were more than just my friend and I visiting the mountain. Many students and government officials' families were walking up the mountain, and there were also many people selling food and delivering meals. Naturally, since this is not the private property of my friend and I, and people who come here to visit do not need to buy tickets, why not make it lively, even if it is a cloudy day?

Walking up the mountain from here, walking to the end of the stone steps, there is a clean dirt road that leads directly to the mountain gate of Wuyou Temple. The so-called mountain gate is more luxurious than the yamen of various places. This temple is quite magnificent, and what makes it magnificent is not the so-called solemn Buddha statues or ancient-style halls, but many brightly painted plaques and couplets. With exquisite religious slogans and signboards, it is like a newly opened shop, making us know that the monks here have also acquired the minds of merchants, and are using the Buddha's holy place to run businesses in the nature of tea houses, restaurants, and hostels. After all, in modern times, the great benefactors who burn incense and give alms have decreased, what do some bald men who do not serve as attendants to officials, dignitaries, local tyrants, and wealthy gentry eat?

We ate dry food and tea in their living room, and bought a few rubbings. The Arhat Hall in the back is a place where you can stay for a while, because there are more men and women visiting the temple. This temple has become a social place, and we who have no way to socialize have no choice but to look at the dull appearance of the clay figures. In the middle of the five hundred Arhats sitting in rows, the statues of Ji Dian and the Mad Monk are sculpted at the intersection of the walkways. These two stories contain social and satirical poor monks, who are regarded by many as men reincarnated as Arhats, but are actually warm-hearted and upright people who despise the hermits and pity the world's streams, so they talk nonsense, and are afraid of being beheaded, so they have to pretend to be crazy and act foolish. Perhaps there are some. However, the statue really cannot convey this kind of depressed spirit.

In the center of the Arhat Hall is a statue of the Wuyou God. This Wuyou Temple is the temple of the Wuyou God. I don't know where the name Wuyou comes from. It is said that at the beginning, because Guanyin Bodhisattva had worldly thoughts, she turned into a hideous monster. I, like many tourists, have no ability to explain this untraceable legend and name. Walking out of the Arhat Hall, the sky released clear light. Before leaving the city, I heard that there lived a scholar who could also be said to be a poor scholar. The receiving monk inquired and knew that he had already left, and our interest in visiting then shifted to the Giant Buddha Temple.

### "Earthy Rustiness"

— Zhu Wen

In the summer month of Bingzi, I rested with friends at the Dayou Farm in Songjiang at night. Returning, I composed a poem, and two of its couplets say: "The bright moon shines on the turned-over thousand-layer willow, the cool wind blows the stars of a pond into chaos; the environment is secluded, making the sound of frogs feel silent, the night is quiet, making the smell of earthy rustiness faintly audible." The three words "earthy rustiness" seem quite obscure, but in fact, I am not imitating the ancients. It is the Iron Ox Temple Poem: "Broken horns with green moss, hoof marks with earthy rustiness" that has already said it before me.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Perhaps the news was too tight, and the timing was unfavorable, Yaoqun never found a trace of a comrade (the way to find comrades: one, suspicion—relying entirely on observation, with no obvious signs. Two, secret code; three, special action; four, hidden language; five, transitional dialogue, these five steps are the way comrades approach each other) Originally, in a city as big as Tianjin, there were only a dozen working comrades, how could they meet anytime and anywhere? However, the "French Concession" was the area designated by the headquarters for stationing, and Yaoqun hoped to meet one or two people.

Walking past several hostels, Guanqun chose the China Decoration Hotel, and coincidentally, room 27 was vacant, so he prepaid ten yuan for the room fee, and settled on it. Here, because of the French relationship, the Japanese invaders and their lackeys did not deeply penetrate. Except for the tea boy asking Qun to fill out a registration form with his name and whereabouts, there was no other trouble. Yaoqun only wrote the three characters "Miss Yu Xiaojie" in the name column.

This number 27 was in the back of the bottom floor. Because the hostel door had not yet been marked with a secret sign, and the names of the travelers were not immediately posted on the "overview" sign, Yaoqun was afraid that the little tiger would come back quickly and it would be troublesome to find him, so he ran to the door and deliberately asked the traveler's reception desk for information, while waiting for the little tiger, and preparing to find an opportunity to print a mark on the outside of the door. All the old fort people knew the use of this secret sign.

Yaoqun was asking the receptionist two questions when he saw a "person" walking in through the gate. A person, but why put a parenthesis symbol on it? This shows that this guy is too unusual: at first glance, it is absolutely impossible to define it as male or female, because its actions, demeanor, physique, posture, etc., all look like men, but the clothes and dress are women's style—shirt, short skirt, knee socks, half-high-heeled leather shoes, high chest and lungs, and a vaguely exposed—same, it is even more impossible to determine what ethnicity or nationality: high nose and sunken eyes, plus dark brown curly hair, revealing the outline of a Westerner, but the face, eyes, expression, etc., have a very strong Eastern color.

"You've worked hard," this neither male nor female, neither Chinese nor Western guy greeted the two receptionists as soon as he entered the gate. This opening made Yaoqun, who was surprised as if he had seen a rare sight, even more surprised: because this guy's fluent Beijing accent, the speaking rhyme of a Westerner, and that sharp and heavy throat voice, were all in contrast; in other words, it was pure Chinese, but with a foreign flavor; a clear female voice, but mixed with a man's departing tone. While greeting the hostel receptionists, he intentionally or unintentionally showed his teeth to Yaoqun and nodded with a smile.

As soon as this half-male half-female, half-Chinese half-Western hybrid entered the door, the two receptionists seemed to have received mobilization orders, one rushing to run inside first, and one accompanying the guy while talking and walking inside. Qun took advantage of this gap and hurried out of the gate. She prepared to make a secret sign first, and then admire the rare sight; her sense of responsibility surpassed her curiosity.
