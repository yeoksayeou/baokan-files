### Raising Prices and Disrupting Finance: Ministry of Finance Declares Firm Legal Action; Three Thousand Tons of Selected Rice Expected to Arrive in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the Central Bank's issuance of Customs Gold Unit notes in denominations of 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000, the Ministry of Finance stated through a spokesperson: In recent months, the Ministry has received requests from various banking associations and chambers of commerce to issue large-denomination banknotes for ease of payment. After careful consideration to meet the current practical needs, these requests have been approved. The Central Bank is instructed to issue them in various localities. Merchants and civilians must not take this opportunity to raise prices. The Ministry has also instructed local governments and financial management institutions to closely monitor and strictly prosecute any instances of profiteering and financial disruption according to the law.

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 10th] Due to the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, the local financial situation has experienced slight fluctuations. The Hong Kong dollar has risen sharply, from 260 to 320. General commodity prices have subsequently increased. It is reported that this surge in foreign currency is largely due to withdrawals from Shanghai. Although the upward trend is relatively intense, it proves that the amount of floating capital in Guangzhou is stronger than that in Shanghai.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The National Bank received a telegram from its head office on the morning of the 10th regarding the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, without any other instructions. Large-denomination notes of 10,000 and above have not yet arrived. Commodity prices have generally risen following the news of the large-denomination banknotes' release. The fastest increase has been in the black market for gold.

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 10th] After the news of the large-denomination banknotes' issuance reached Jinan, the prices of all commodities uniformly rose. Flour increased by 10,000, with top-grade flour reaching 430,000 per bag. 20-count locally produced cotton yarn rose by 2.8 million, with each piece reaching as high as 39.8 million. The black market for gold has soared.

[This Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 10th] After the news of the large-denomination banknotes' issuance spread here, the financial market suddenly became chaotic. Transactions in all industries were hesitant and cautious, with no deals made all day.

[This Newspaper, Xian, 10th] Commodity prices in Xian on the 10th rose due to the emergence of large-denomination banknotes, but not as drastically as expected. Apart from a relatively high increase in the price of cigarettes, rice was priced at 1.35 million per 100 catties, and no flour was available for sale. The main reason for this phenomenon is the tight credit situation. It is generally believed that commodity prices may rise sharply within the next week.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 10th] According to the most reliable sources, the 3,300 tons of selected rice allocated to China by the International Emergency Food Committee for the second half of this year is expected to arrive in Shanghai before the first month of the next year. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Chen" vessel recently arrived here to load the first batch of selected rice for return to China.

### Dong Xianguang Answers Reporters' Questions: National Banks' Business Contraction Aims to Curb Speculation; Loans Will Be Reopened After Price Stabilization

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram to the Central Government, requesting that the National Banks reopen lending and revise the restrictions on foreign exchange, Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, replied to inquiries at a press conference on the 10th: The government's establishment of National Banks was originally intended to support industry and commerce and facilitate the people. This has been consistent for thousands of years, and the facts are there, so there is no need for much explanation. As for the recent order to contract business, it was originally a temporary countermeasure due to rampant speculation and soaring prices in Shanghai, and it has already shown considerable effect. Once prices have stabilized for a period of time, the banks will resume their original mission and continue to operate. It is hoped that industry and commerce will understand the current difficulties and work together to sanction speculation and eradicate the recurrence of past price surges. Whether legitimate industry and commerce can maintain long-term prosperity depends entirely on how everyone works together.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The settlement method for pre-war deposit interest was reviewed and passed by the joint meeting of the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the 10th and will be submitted to the plenary session for discussion. During the discussion at the joint meeting, opinions were divided into two factions. One faction believed that the matter should be resolved as soon as possible so that the price and debt disputes that have lasted for several years can be cleared up as soon as possible. The opposing faction believed that if calculated according to the previous method, the banks would be too cheap. In the end, the majority believed that in this period of continuous decline in currency value, it is appropriate to settle at an earlier date, even if the multiplier is not large.

### Jiang Tingfu Arrives in Nanjing to Report on the War; Says the Future of the Far East Economic Commission is Unpredictable; Thailand's Absence Affects the Food Problem

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Jiang Tingfu, our representative to the United Nations Security Council, returned to China from Baguio and stayed in Shanghai for a few days due to illness. He arrived in Nanjing by overnight train on the 9th and went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs around 9:00 on the morning of the 10th to confer with Minister Wang Shijie and Vice Ministers Liu and Ye for a long time. He also had lunch with them at 12:00. In the afternoon, he met with Premier Zhang Qun at 6:00 and stayed for dinner. When interviewed by this newspaper's reporter in the afternoon, Jiang said that his conclusion on the Far East Economic Commission was: "The future is unpredictable. If done well, it may achieve something." He gave an example: the core of the Far East Economic Commission's work is to solve the urgent problems of food, fuel transportation, and supply. After the war, the supply of these necessities of life has not been properly adjusted due to reduced production in producing areas and increased shortages in consuming areas. This phenomenon is particularly severe in the Far East. At the previous meeting, all countries discussed this, but at the beginning of this meeting, the dispute over the qualifications of participating countries took up seven days. The Dutch East Indies issue is being discussed by representatives of the United States, France, and Australia with the parties to the dispute, seeking a solution. In fact, participating in international conferences does not necessarily require prior recognition as an independent country. The Far East Economic Commission actually affected the conference agenda due to the Indonesian membership issue, which is necessary. Jiang admitted that Thailand's failure to participate in this meeting has an impact on the solution of the food problem and hinted that concrete possible plans and sufficient financial resources and materials will determine the success or failure of the Far East Economic Commission. As for his comments on the Security Council, he said: "As far as the Security Council is concerned with dealing with peace issues, I feel that most members are fair, but if members can be more proactive in handling issues and less focused on maintaining the status quo legally, the Security Council's contribution will be greater." Jiang denied previous reports from foreign media that he had stated that China advocated that Japan should join the United Nations after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. He will meet with Chairman Chiang within a few days and is expected to return to the US in three weeks to resume his duties.

### The Partition of Palestine

Since the United Nations General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan on the 29th of last month with a vote of 33 to 13, Jews everywhere have celebrated the success of their Zionist movement. However, the majority of Arabs in Palestine and other places with the same religious beliefs as the Arabs are extremely indignant. Even when the United Nations General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, the representatives of the six Arab nations left the meeting in protest, accusing the majority of "assassinating" the United Nations Charter. At the same time, the Prime Minister of Lebanon declared: "We are waiting for an opportunity to act, and once the opportunity arrives, we will move towards our goal." As for what the so-called goal and opportunity refer to, we can vaguely see an outline due to recent developments. Recently, the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine has become increasingly acute. Even the commander-in-chief of the army preparing to establish the Jewish state in Palestine was assassinated, and bloodshed is constantly occurring. At this moment, we see the Arab League meeting in Cairo, and the British Commander-in-Chief in Palestine has announced that British troops will begin withdrawing from Palestine on December 15th and will completely leave the Holy Land by next August, in preparation for handing Palestine over to the Arab and Jewish states. Currently, the bloodshed and unrest in Palestine are in full swing. At this juncture, we see reports inviting our country's troops to be stationed in the Holy Land for guard duty. Based on this, it can be seen that the development of the situation in Palestine is not only related to the success or failure of the United Nations as an international organization and the guarantee of world peace in the future, but also to our country's position in international politics in the future. We must pay attention to it.

The United Nations General Assembly's passage of the Palestine partition plan was originally after considerable consideration. Before passing this plan, a fact-finding mission was sent to the Holy Land to conduct on-site investigations. When this case was submitted to the General Assembly, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union were not necessarily consistent. The Soviet Union initially appeared to support the Arab nations, thereby gaining their favor. When the partition plan was proposed, it strongly supported the Arab nations, indicating that it was unwilling to align with the United States in order to elevate its position. After several twists and turns, the Soviet Union stated that it would no longer adhere to its prejudices. As a result, the United States and the Soviet Union reached a consensus, and the Palestine partition plan was finally passed by the United Nations General Assembly. According to this plan, the Holy Land will be divided into Arab and Jewish states next August, and the holy site of the Holy Land, Jerusalem, will be under international co-management and will not belong to either the Arab or Jewish states. Due to the passage of this motion, the Palestine issue, which had not been resolved for thirty years, has finally been resolved on paper. However, given the Arab people's resolute opposition and willingness to shed blood to maintain the integrity of the Holy Land, it can be seen that the Palestine issue does not seem to be resolved by the passage of the United Nations General Assembly motion, or it may even cause new disputes as a result.

We must first understand that the problem of Palestine is actually the result of the First World War. This can be divided into two aspects: First, before the First World War, Palestine was a part of the old Turkish Empire. Under the Turkish Empire, Palestine could originally coexist peacefully. The result of the First World War was the disintegration of the Turkish Empire. France obtained Syria and Lebanon; Britain also obtained Iraq and Palestine. When the League of Nations was established, Britain and France obtained the so-called mandate rule in these places. Based on this mandate from the League of Nations, Britain has held the power of rule in Palestine to this day. Second, during the First World War, Palestine was a part of the Turkish Empire, but the Turkish Empire was Britain's enemy. Therefore, Britain used all sorts of methods to try to divide the Turkish Empire, which was originally an indispensable strategy in warfare. Among these many plans to divide the Turkish Empire, one of them was to promote the return of Jews to the Jewish homeland. The famous Balfour Declaration clearly stated Britain's willingness to help the Jews restore their country. It should be known that Jews have been scattered around the world for two thousand years, and have even been to China. In Kaifeng, the Jews continued to preserve their "Israel" religion and temples until the late Qing Dynasty. In their homeland, the descendants of the Jews have almost become extinct and have been completely occupied by Arabs. Britain's support for the Jews' restoration of their country was not out of love for them, but to dismantle the platform of the Turkish Empire. This was a strategy of war and was very obvious. However, due to the disintegration of the Turkish Empire after the First World War, Britain had to fulfill its promise to help the Jews restore their country. The Jews in Palestine today can be said to have mostly returned after the end of the First World War.

Since the historical background of the Palestine problem is like this, we believe that the partition plan passed by the United Nations General Assembly this time is regrettable. Needless to say, all Arab nations have expressed dissatisfaction with this, and other nations that believe in Islam are also indignant. If the United Nations loses the trust of the people who believe in Islam as a result, it would be very regrettable. As for the passage of this motion representing the closeness of American and Soviet views, the result seems to be the opposite. It is truly said to be the Soviet Union's cunning diplomacy. The Soviet Union is geographically closer to Palestine. The Soviet Union also has stationed troops in southern Russia. Once something happens in the Near East, it can quickly send troops. It is also secretly promoting the return of a large number of Jews in Eastern Europe to Judea. It accepts the partition plan because it fears that there will be no peace in the Near East. If something happens in the Near East, it can find an excuse to quickly send a large army to establish a foothold on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. In this sense, the Soviet Union accepted the partition plan, and the United States also supported this case, and finally passed the partition plan. Due to the existing signs, Palestine will likely be troubled by this. The lack of foresight and firm policy of the United States on the Palestine issue is also truly lamentable.

As for the matter of inviting Chinese troops to guard the Holy Land, our government has denied it. If there is such a thing, our government will certainly refuse it. When the United Nations General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, our country's representative abstained and did not vote. Our country's decision not to participate in the Palestine dispute is wise. What we do not understand is: Since the Palestine problem mainly arose due to British policy, and now that it has reached a point where it is difficult to resolve, Britain is preparing to withdraw quickly. We certainly know the difficulties that Britain is currently encountering, but we also know that Britain is the nation that values responsibility the most. Now, they are so eager to leave, isn't there a suspicion of evading responsibility? "Plucking votes from the fire" is the magnanimity of the American nation; however, in international politics, only magnanimity seems not enough. There should also be the vision and firm policy of a statesman. This is the case on the Palestine issue, and it is the same on other issues. Only in this way can the United States lead the world, and only then can world peace be guaranteed!

### American Reporter Talks About the Situation in Xinjiang

(Continued from page one) Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Executive Headquarters, stated to reporters today that the Ili rebellion in western Xinjiang was instigated by the Soviet Union. This statement has now been confirmed by foreign observers returning to Shanghai from Ili. The Ili rebels have an army of 50,000 men trained by the Soviet Union, demanding Xinjiang's independence and the establishment of the so-called "East Turkestan Republic," and refusing to negotiate with the Chinese government. Han Chinese account for only 10% of the province's population. Located in a remote area, transportation to the mainland is virtually cut off except by air. The limited number of troops stationed in the provincial capital have very limited ammunition and are definitely no match for the rebels backed by the Soviet Union. Once Xinjiang breaks away from China, the rebels will immediately unite with the Soviet Union economically and militarily and become its satellite state. Although Inner Mongolia also demands autonomy, it is wary of the Soviet Union and knows that it cannot resist the invasion of Outer Mongolia. The reporter traveled to Inner Mongolia last year and interviewed a chieftain of a certain banner, Prince Duerbe, sixty miles from the Outer Mongolian border. He was told that if Inner Mongolia gains freedom, it fears that it will follow the same disastrous path as Outer Mongolia. The only choice at present is to choose the lesser of two evils between Outer Mongolia and China. The people of Inner Mongolia are severely affected by poverty, are simple-minded, and cowardly. Outer Mongolian troops often harass them, looting sheep and horses. However, the national government is busy dealing with the civil war and has no time to spare to protect them and alleviate their suffering. In some places, Outer Mongolian invasions occur as often as twice a month. Although there have been no conflicts with the Nationalist army yet, if they do come into contact, the government does not have sufficient troops in Inner Mongolia to defend. Prince De also said: "I and all the people are afraid that the Outer Mongolian army will eventually launch a large-scale invasion and permanently occupy Inner Mongolia. I firmly believe that Outer Mongolia's advance is on the orders of the Soviet Union, otherwise it would not do this. Before Outer Mongolia was occupied by the Soviet Union, the people's inclination was the same as that of Inner Mongolia, but after Soviet indoctrination, their hearts have now changed and they have become accustomed to violence."

### Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly Battle Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, announced the battle situation for the week (December 3rd to 10th) at a press conference on the 10th, which is recorded as follows:

Situation of Bandit Suppression in the Dabie Mountain Area

What needs to be specially explained this week is the situation of bandit suppression in the Dabie Mountain area. Since the National Army began its campaign, it has successively recovered Lihuang, Luotian, Yingshan, Xishui, Xuanhua Store and other places. Recently, it has also moved into Yuexi, a key point in the Dabie Mountain area, as well as various strongholds at the foot of the Dabie Mountain between Macheng, Guangshan, and Huang'an. It continues to press towards the mountainous area between Jingfu and Huang'an, the core area where the Liu bandits gather supplies. At the same time, our troops from Shangshan and Xinyang are also advancing to the southeast. As a result, under the attack from all sides, the Liu bandits had to abandon their original dream of establishing a base area in the Dabie Mountain area and gradually moved their main force to the northwest, intending to avoid a decisive battle and preserve their strength. According to a report from the front line a few days ago, although the 11th Column of the Liu bandits, after moving towards the Lin Station near the Ping-Han Railway for a period of time, disintegrated into smaller groups at night, successively mobilizing seven to eight thousand people, reached the Jiahe River area west of the railway, they were surrounded by the National Army. One deputy regimental commander of the bandit army has surrendered to the National Army with weapons and leading more than 500 bandits. More than 1,000 other bandits are also in contact to surrender. In addition, in the areas of Damao Fan and Xishuanghe, more than 1,400 bandits were captured, and more than 1,100 were wounded or killed. That bandit force was unable to escape, with fewer than 2,000 remaining. As for the bandit army of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 intercepted by the National Army in the areas of Sanlicheng and Jinjiawan east of the railway, they have been scattered, scrambling to escape. There are also remnants of about two columns fleeing towards Gushi, who fled from west of Lihuang after being attacked by our army advancing west from Lihuang and retreating to that area, are also wandering aimlessly. Judging from the current situation, the National Army has taken the first successful step in defeating the Liu bandits and crushing their offensive to establish a foothold in the Dabie Mountain area.

Chen Yi Bandit's Flight in the Yu-Wan Border Area

Chen Yi's bandit units of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns in the Yu-Wan border area, since crossing south of the Longhai Railway, were first defeated west of the Jinpu Railway, and then driven out of various counties in the Yellow River flood area, with no time to catch their breath, fleeing everywhere. From northern Henan, eastern Henan, western Anhui, and southern Henan, they are desperately fleeing. One part is still in the Huaiyang Zhoujiakou area. If they go south to join forces with the Liu bandits, they will surely perish together. If they return north, they are afraid of being surrounded and attacked by the National Army again, and they are still hesitating on the wrong path, with the intention of continuing to sabotage the Longhai Railway.

There have been no battles in Western Shandong recently! Chen Yi's bandits, due to heavy losses, have now coerced more than 20,000 old and weak militiamen aged sixteen or seventeen and over fifty from north of the Yellow River, preparing to replenish the remnants of their failed attempts to stir up trouble outside the countryside, which shows that the bandits in Hebei are about to reach the point of "exhausting all able-bodied men."

Failure of Bandits in Jiaodong and Southern Shaanxi

In Jiaodong, the battles in Haiyang Jinkou and Nanjian were more intense. Although there are not many National Army troops in the area, they are extremely brave. The total number of bandits is more than 30,000, but due to their weak combat power and the clumsy command skills of the bandit leaders, they only drove one or two thousand innocent people to serve as cannon fodder, and the result was still failure.

The Kong Congzhou bandit unit in Southern Shaanxi is currently located in the Mianchuan Pass area. Part of Chen Geng's 4th Column and the main force of the Huo Column are still entrenched in the Lushan Nantai Fangcheng area. Recently, they had a fierce battle with the local militia near Xixiakou. News received yesterday stated that the bandits were counter-surrounded by the National Army and the militia, and more than 3,000 people were killed on the spot, and more than 1,400 guns were seized. According to captured prisoners, the Kong bandits have been surrounded internally, and the main force of the 4th Column is lurking in the Funiu Mountain area north of Neixiang. Overall, although Chen Geng's bandit unit claimed to have established two guerrilla bases after crossing the Yellow River and fleeing south, it has failed politically because the people have seen through his cunning and deceptive tricks and have developed strong aversion and courageous resistance. From this, it can be predicted that the future of the communist bandits' general counter-offensive is not very promising.

This Week's Battle Results are Extremely Fruitful

As of noon on the 10th, continuing to receive news from the front lines, summarizing this week's battle results, the National Army has defeated Liu Bocheng's main force in the Dabie Mountain area and restored eleven important towns in the Henan-Hubei border area. On the 9th, it also entered Jingfu. In addition, the bandits of the 6th Column of Huang'an have also fled from the northwest. According to incomplete statistics, six small cannons buried underground by the bandits were found in the mountainous area west of Shangtian, and military supplies and weapons of the bandit army were seized in Xuanhua Store, Jingfu, and Liuhe Xishuanghe, piled up like mountains, including more than 300 horses. More than 7,000 bandits have been wounded or killed, and more than 3,400 have been captured, including one regimental commander of the 81st Regiment of the 28th Brigade of the bandits, and fourteen political instructors, whose names are being investigated. Also, 780 bandits were captured and 400 bandits were killed between Gushi and Shangcheng at Shangshiqiao. In the Dong Jia Dian area west of Wusheng Guan Road, about 4,000 bandits from two *[missing text]* have been surrounded and can be annihilated soon.

### French-Soviet Relations Hang by a Thread France Refuses Soviet Protest and Returns Note Soviet Overseas Chinese Suspected of Participating in Strikes and Have Been Expelled from France

[Our Newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: Paris Dispatch, French-Soviet relations have become more strained as the French government refuses to accept the Soviet note. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman believes that the conditions mentioned in the note are unacceptable, and the content is also based on inaccurate information. The French General Confederation of Labor has ordered the cessation of strikes. Currently, except for one million workers who have not yet returned to work, the rest have begun working, and the government's position has therefore been strengthened, but several major political and economic issues have not been resolved. However, the government's stance on the Soviet Union is quite firm.

[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The Soviet Union suspended French-Soviet economic negotiations and expelled the personnel of the French repatriation mission stationed in the Soviet Union. The French government refused to accept the Soviet note regarding these two matters on the 10th. The French Cabinet held a plenary meeting, and Prime Minister Schumann submitted a motion. With the unanimous agreement of the departments, the French Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Chapentier, was instructed to send the Soviet note back to the Soviet Foreign Ministry and explain that the French government could not accept it. A cabinet spokesman said: "Before the French government received the note, its contents had already been published, and its conditions are sufficient to make us refuse to accept it." Developments on the morning of the 10th seemed to indicate the possibility of a break in French-Soviet diplomatic relations.

[Reuters, Paris, 9th Dispatch] After the interruption of French-Soviet trade negotiations, the French government ordered the expulsion of the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation stationed in France on the 9th. The delegation left French territory by train via Strasbourg on the evening of the 9th. Afterwards, according to a foreign ministry spokesman, the French government's decision to expel the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation was due to the fact that some members of the delegation were engaged in secret activities that endangered French security and were related to the current labor unrest and riots in France, but were not directly engaged in espionage activities.

Colonel Filatov, head of the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation, was one of those involved in the aforementioned secret activities. It is also learned that a total of twelve members of the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation have been expelled, in addition to twenty Soviet citizens who have been arrested by the French authorities for allegedly engaging in activities that spy on French national interests and will be deported. According to sources from the Soviet Embassy, one of those arrested was an employee of the Soviet Embassy, but his name and rank are unknown. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires visited the Foreign Ministry on the afternoon of the 9th to formally protest the arrest of Soviet citizens, but officials at the Soviet Embassy refused to express their opinions when asked about the expulsion of the overseas Chinese delegation.

[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] In the past three weeks, France has expelled 35 Soviets, reflecting the tense relations between France and the Soviet Union. Although the French side believes that the possibility of a break in French-Soviet diplomatic relations is unlikely, Soviet personnel stationed in Paris report that they believe that France's resolute measures are sufficient to cause a break in diplomatic relations.

[United Press, Paris, 9th Dispatch] According to news from London, diplomatic circles acknowledge that this development is related to France's foreign policy at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, with French Foreign Minister Bidault increasingly aligning with the United Kingdom and the United States at the conference.

### After the General Confederation of Labor Issued a Resumption Order, Most French Workers Resumed Work Workers in the Northern Mining Area Refuse to Surrender

[Reuters, Paris, 10th Dispatch] After the French General Confederation of Labor issued an order on the 9th to resume work on the 10th, starting at 8:00 AM this morning, reports of resumption of work have come from all over the country, including one million striking workers, including miners, dock workers, steel workers, and transportation railway workers, from Paris to Marseille, from Le Havre to Lyon. All right-wing and centrist newspapers believe that the end of the strike is a major setback for communism. Leon Jouhaux, a communist leader of the National General Confederation of Labor, made a statement in the communist newspaper Humanité, declaring that the perseverance of the workers has forced the government to make concessions.

[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The French resumption order was generally followed by workers, except in the northern mining area. Pickets in several northern mines are still trying to prevent returning workers from resuming work. Striking workers occupying the mines also refuse to surrender or return to work on their own.

[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The French General Confederation of Labor issued a lengthy 2,000-word statement last night, calling on trade unions to unite their forces and prepare for a renewed struggle. It is said that most workers have been forced to resume work out of desperation due to hunger.

[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] Politicians acknowledge that Schumann is sufficient to eliminate the strike turmoil, saying: He has undoubtedly delayed De Gaulle's restoration of power by several months. The appearance of this order from the French government comes just hours after the Soviet Union announced the cessation of trade negotiations with France. Although there is no correlation between the Soviet Union's actions and the order of the French General Confederation of Labor, this matter demonstrates that the rift between the Schumann cabinet and the Soviet Union is widening, and it has gone a step further.

### Italian Government Accepts Demands General Strike Averted Cabinet Reorganization Negotiations to be Completed

[Our Newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: Rome Dispatch, The Italian government decided today to allocate 103.5 billion lire ($17,595,000) for the Rome development public utility plan, thus accepting one of the main demands of the Communist Party. The Communist Party is scheduled to begin a general strike in Rome at midnight.

[United Press, Rome, 10th Dispatch] Prime Minister Gasperi declared today after ending a meeting with the leaders of the Social, Republican, and Labor parties, "Our discussions have lasted for a long time and are about to reach an end. I deeply believe that the attempt to expand the government's foundation and accommodate left-wing moderates can be completed today." Today is the deadline for the trade unions to demand a response from the government, and if there is no response before the deadline, a general strike will begin in Rome and the province tomorrow.

### Situation in the Soviet-Occupied Zone of Germany British and American Urge the Soviet Union to Submit Reports Four Powers Reach Agreement on German Import and Export Plans

[Our Newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: The British and American sides believe that unless the Soviet Union provides a report on the situation in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, this foreign ministers' conference will not be able to reach any basic agreement on the German issue. Marshall and Bevin have jointly made this request to Molotov, whose reply was very smooth, claiming that if an agreement can be reached on the issues currently being discussed, the Soviet Union is very willing to provide this information, while Marshall and Bevin insist that the report must be provided first. According to various signs, Marshall seems to have become quite impatient and is preparing to end the conference, because Marshall is currently dealing with the most thorny affairs, and its outcome has a major relationship with the Marshall Plan and countries such as France and Italy, and cannot be delayed.

[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] The Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 9th discussed the economic principles of Germany, passed the British proposal, and decided to draft an import and export plan for the entire Germany. Then, it discussed a chapter in the British document on the common use of resources in each occupied zone, which suggested abolishing the zone barriers, facilitating the free flow of materials, and using the resources of each zone for the entire Germany.

Molotov accepted this suggestion, but insisted that the establishment of a German central agency suggested in the Soviet document must be a prerequisite for the common use of resources in each zone. Marshall also expressed his acceptance of the British suggestion, but Bidault said that he could not accept it. Marshall suggested that items that could not be agreed upon should be temporarily set aside. Proceed to discuss the next item, and then hand the document over to the foreign ministers' representatives to rewrite it. This proposal was accepted.

[United Press, London, 10th Dispatch] American officials privately stated today that the Soviet Union's demand for $10 billion in German reparations may become a major problem that causes the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to break down. It is believed that Soviet representative Molotov does not intend to agree to German economic unification until he receives guarantees that at least substantially meet his reparations demands. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to discuss reparations this afternoon, but the United Kingdom and the United States have so far firmly opposed this demand. In the current situation, the Foreign Ministers' Conference is not expected to reach an important agreement.

At the same time, the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives are said to have informally agreed to reduce the funds to $500 million.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th Dispatch] The $590 million temporary aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria is scheduled to be voted on in the House of Representatives on the 10th. The bill could have been submitted for a final vote on the 9th, but the debate on the amendment took up a lot of time, so the debate had to be extended. One of the amendments suggested reducing the supply of fertilizer to Europe when fertilizer is most scarce, which took an hour on Monday and two hours on Tuesday, before being rejected by a vote of 135 to 107.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th Dispatch] The House of Representatives also passed several amendments by voice vote today to prevent domestic price increases caused by the purchase of foreign aid materials.

### Soviet Union is Training Special Talent to Promote Anti-Imperialist Policies Malenkov's Speech Published Today

[Reuters, London, 9th Dispatch] Moscow Radio said: At the end of September, when Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Malenkov accompanied Zhdanov to Warsaw to attend the International Communist Conference, he delivered a speech to the Polish Communist Party Organization Bureau, stating that the Soviet Communist Party is training representatives to promote its foreign policy abroad. This speech has only recently been published by Pravda. According to Malenkov, the Soviet Communist Party is now paying special attention to foreign policy and training special talent so that the Soviet Communist Party's foreign policy can be effectively implemented by these personnel. These personnel should know how to safeguard the status and interests of socialist countries in the international arena, how to distinguish between friends and enemies, and how to thwart the conspiracies of imperialists and their spies. Communist parties in various countries must maintain close contact, otherwise it will be impossible to coordinate their actions to resist the plans of imperialism. Today, the United States is organizing anti-communist and anti-democratic movements to oppose the Soviet Union and other new democracies, attempting to enslave Europe under the guise of aid. Communist parties must clearly define their attitude towards these plans of the United States.

### Mayor Anxious, Directors Worried, New City Government Organization to Cut More Than a Thousand People, To Be Discussed in Tomorrow's Municipal Government Meeting

[Our Report] The new organizational structure of this city's municipal government has been approved by the Executive Yuan and arrived at the city government last week. The reduction is as follows: The current establishment of the city government is 3,576 people, which should be reduced to 2,450 people, a decrease of 1,126 people. It has also been resolved to reduce 44 senior-grade officials, 331 intermediate-grade officials, 602 junior-grade officials, 10 assigned senior-grade officials, 75 assigned intermediate-grade officials, and 64 employees.

The various bureaus and offices of the city government should be streamlined and reduced as follows: In the city government itself, the number of counselors remains at six, and the number of specialists is reduced to six. The Secretariat, originally a senior-grade position, is now changed to an assigned senior-grade position. The Secretariat was originally ten sections, reduced to seven sections. The Information Office remains at two sections. The Personnel Office is reduced from four sections to three sections. The Statistics Office is reduced from four sections to three sections. The Accounting Office remains at three sections. The Civil Affairs Bureau is reduced to four sections. The Finance Bureau is reduced from twelve sections to eight sections. The Social Affairs Bureau is reduced from ten sections to eight sections. The Public Works Bureau is reduced from fourteen sections to eight sections. The Health Bureau is reduced from eleven sections to eight sections. The Land Administration Bureau remains at nine sections. The Police Bureau is reduced from nineteen sections to fifteen sections. The Public Utilities Bureau is reduced from fourteen sections to six sections. The regulations regarding senior-grade positions are as follows: City government: seven people; Civil Affairs Bureau: one person; Finance Bureau: one person; Education Bureau: one person; Social Affairs Bureau: two people; Land Administration Bureau: one person; Health Bureau: one person; Public Works Bureau: two people; Public Utilities Bureau: one person; Police Bureau: three people. The positions of Deputy Director in the various bureaus under the city government will not be established.

Reporters visited relevant responsible persons in the city government yesterday to confirm the above news. It is reported that Mayor Wu is very worried about this, and the directors of various bureaus are also very anxious. For example, if the Public Utilities Bureau is slimmed down from ten sections to six sections, it will be impossible to work. During the effective period of authorization in the recovered area, although Mayor Wu still has the right to appoint extra personnel to the new organization, they cannot be submitted for review and will not be approved by the central government. It will be difficult to continue to employ them when the constitution is implemented next year. Therefore, the city government has decided to make slight reductions with great difficulty. If there are any points that cannot be complied with, it will submit them to the Executive Yuan for review and request that personnel be sent to Shanghai for on-site investigation. Detailed measures will be discussed in tomorrow's municipal government meeting.

Asano was 34 years old, a native of Kawai County, Japan, and a warrant officer intelligence officer in the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Shanghai Military Police Headquarters. He was accused of making the arrest of our personnel working in Shanghai his main task during the war, and continuously subjecting non-military personnel to torture.

He was previously sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal, and the order was approved by President Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government in a telegram on the 8th of this month, ordering its execution.

After confirming his name, age, and origin, Tribunal President Shi informed him that he would be executed today and asked if he had any last words.

Regarding the disposal of his belongings, Asano said that it was not necessary to send them back to his family in Japan, and that they should be given to the war criminals detained in Jiangwan. At this point, the handcuffs were loosened and he was ordered to fingerprint. At this moment, he suddenly remembered that he wanted to write a letter to say goodbye to war criminal Tokawa. The court ordered him to sit down and provided him with paper and a pencil. Asano paused from time to time while writing, lost in thought. He finished writing at 11:55 AM, signed the statement, and the handcuffs were put back on. Tribunal President Shi then ordered the execution.

### Humans and Ghosts Living Together, Coffins in Disarray, A Picture of Refugees in Chao Hui Villa

[Our Report] Amid the housing shortage, news has recently emerged of funeral parlors in the city being occupied by refugees from various places. So far, it is said that about a dozen units, including Chao Hui Villa, have been affected. In this so-called modern metropolis, is this scene of survival being played out a satire of civilization? A tragedy of the times? It really makes people feel at a loss! According to the person in charge of Chao Hui Villa: The occupation of the villa has only occurred in the most recent one or two periods. When they came to live there, the discipline was very poor. They would break through the walls at night and open the doors to come in. Moreover, without obtaining any consent, they automatically carried away the coffins stored in the funeral parlors one by one at night and occupied the vacated rooms.

According to his investigation, there are more than 2,000 people in this group claiming to be refugees, but as far as he knows, only 200 or 300 of them are truly refugees from war zones. The rest are mostly impoverished families near the villa or households who cannot find housing. Therefore, there are all kinds of people in this occupying group: vendors, shoemakers, rickshaw pullers, pedicab drivers, and even shops opened inside. There are also fashionable girls wearing gorgeous clothes and jewelry, entering and exiting by pedicab. Of course, there are also many truly impoverished refugees!

### A Tragic Scene

Yesterday, the reporter stole half a day of free time to visit the villa for a practical inspection. I felt that this picture of competing for survival was tragic enough. Nine out of ten of the funeral parlors were occupied. Most of the coffins originally resting in the funeral parlors were moved out without authorization by the occupiers and scattered in dilapidated funeral parlors with broken roofs and no doors or windows. Some could not be piled up and were exposed outside, at the mercy of the wind and rain. Some coffins were damaged during the moving process, and some coffin lids and bodies were on the verge of breaking apart. In several funeral parlors, entire families simply slept next to the coffins. Cooking utensils and stoves were set up everywhere. In several funeral parlors, there were some furniture and furnishings, and the layout was not too bad. A man and a woman were lying leisurely on a couch, dressed quite decently, chatting leisurely.

### Should Prevent Problems Before They Arise

It is said that the responsible parties at Chao Hui Villa have sent representatives to Mayor Wu to request a solution. Mayor Wu has promised to instruct the Public Works Bureau to rush to build a large number of sheds on the site before the 20th of this month and try to accommodate these refugees.

The difficult situation of the refugees is to be sympathized with. They have been ravaged by war, leaving their homes and fleeing to this big city, and they are gathering more and more, and food, clothing, and housing are all problems. Moreover, the cruel winter is approaching. Behind this seemingly stable society, there seems to be a hidden tumor, and if this tumor is not resolved reasonably, it can fester and ulcerate at any time and have an impact on the general society. To prevent this tumor from festering and ulcerating is the common responsibility of the municipal authorities and the upper and middle classes of society and philanthropists who are in a better situation.

A Word of Advice

Who has no ancestors, who has no parents? The reporter finally wants to offer a word of advice to the refugees. Occupying the funeral parlor is one thing, but moving the coffins arbitrarily without obtaining consent, or even damaging the facilities of the funeral parlor, and damaging the coffins stored in the funeral parlor, will undoubtedly cause the refugees to lose the sympathy of society. The desire to survive is everyone's inherent desire, but we must seek survival on the condition that we do not infringe on the freedom of others, and we must not allow others to use the name of refugees to seek survival by benefiting themselves and harming others!

### Public Transportation Company Celebrates Second Anniversary of Operations, Grand Celebration, Mayor Inspects the Parade and Awards Medals

[Our Report] Yesterday was the second anniversary of the opening of public bus service by the Public Transportation Company of this city. At 8:30 AM, a grand celebration was held on the square of the company at 959 East Daming Road. More than twenty people including Wu Guozhen, Wang Xiaolai, Zhao Zukang, and Zhang Shi attended. Zhao Zengjue presided over the event. At the beginning of the meeting, the company's entire staff of more than 500 people, dressed in uniforms, lined up on the side of the square. After Mayor Wu and others inspected the parade, Director Zhao reported on the general situation of the Public Transportation Company, stating briefly:

Supplementing North-South Transportation

The operation of public buses in this city for the past two years can be divided into two periods: the first year was the pioneering period, and the second year was the enrichment period. The layout of the bus route network has broken the segmentation phenomenon of the former concession era. The development of Shanghai City is from east to west, and the development of traffic routes in the past has mostly been east-west. The bus routes of this company are striving to supplement the deficiency of north-south traffic routes.

Solving the Problem of Transportation

At present, the company has a total of 233 vehicles, an increase of 92% over last year. The number of passengers has also increased by 90% over last year. According to statistics for October, it was more than 7.77 million people, and the total ticket revenue reached 18 billion. The company's vehicles are converted from Dodge F234 trucks, with wooden bodies at first, and lead skins this year. The chassis is also lowered and the wheelbase is lengthened. In the future, the company will try to add vehicles as much as possible to solve the public's transportation problem.

Cooperate to Overcome Difficulties

Subsequently, Mayor Wu expressed three points of feeling, stating briefly: Chinese people have a worst habit, which is to like to put on official airs. For example, employees of post offices and banks have given the public extremely bad impressions, and I hope that you will be humble and kind to others. Cherish public property. Every piece of paper and every object belonging to the public should be regarded as your own. Workers of the public bus company once went on strike due to salary issues, which is deeply regrettable. I hope that this will not happen again in the future. The country is currently in a difficult situation, and I hope that you will only seek to work hard, regardless of the amount of salary, so that we can cooperate with each other to overcome difficulties.

Awarding Two Types of Medals

Afterwards, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, expressing his satisfaction with the company's work performance, and wishing that next year today, he will make all citizens feel more convenient in their travels. Finally, Mayor Wu awarded medals, divided into two types: service and safety. The service medal was awarded to employees of the company who did not take leave within one year. A total of 182 winners, represented by Xuan Tailin, accepted the award. The safety medal was awarded to drivers of the company who had no accidents within one year. A total of 79 winners, represented by Xing Hongguan, accepted the award. The conference concluded with the company song. In the afternoon, there were also entertainment and movie programs to celebrate.

### Attempted Murder of Mistress After Taking Poison, District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution

[Our Report] He Hengsheng and Chen Caidi, a native of Yangzhou, became lovers. Recently, he learned that Chen was in love with someone else, and he suddenly developed murderous intent. He bought 10,000 yuan of sodium carbonate and also bought a pair of scissors, intending to kill Chen and then commit suicide by taking the sodium carbonate himself. On the 2nd of this month, He quietly got up while Chen was sleeping soundly, first dissolved the sodium carbonate in water and swallowed it, and then stabbed Chen in the neck with the scissors. Chen was in extreme pain and cried for help, and He also collapsed from the poison. Neighbors rushed to the scene upon hearing the cry and took them to Si Ming Hospital for emergency treatment. The case was transferred by the police station to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. Prosecutor Chen Tao concluded the investigation and believed that He was guilty of attempted murder, and filed a public prosecution yesterday.

### Band Leader Accused of Forgery

[Our Report] Chen, a well-known Chinese Dadong band leader in dance halls, was accused of forgery. The case was transferred to the District Court for trial yesterday after the District Attorney's Office filed a public prosecution. Cao Zuwei, the judge in charge of the case, scheduled the trial to be held on the 16th. Last July, Chen told Huang Gang that he had 1,200 bottles of foreign wine that he wanted to sell for US$1 per bottle. Huang believed it to be true and paid US$1,200 to order the wine. However, Chen never delivered the foreign wine. Dragging on until February of this year, Huang asked for the money back. Chen issued a check for 168 million yuan in legal tender from the Allied Bank, but it was returned due to insufficient funds. Subsequently, Shi Bimen, the manager of Wanguo Savings Association, came forward to mediate and issued a check for 450 million yuan in legal tender from the Mainland Bank, but it was also returned. Huang Gang believed that Chen had deliberately defrauded him and filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office accusing Chen of "forgery."

### The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Mediate Fish Market Disputes; Fisheries Administration Massively Dumps Goods, Private Businesses Unable to Survive

[Our Newspaper's Report] The situation where disputes have arisen due to the Fisheries Administration of the Executive Yuan dumping fish caught by relief fishing vessels, causing sluggish sales, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is understood that the cause of this matter is that a month ago, various private fishing companies, seeing that the fishing vessels of the Executive Yuan were equipped with new equipment, caught fish quickly, and delivered large quantities, causing fish prices to plummet, requested that the Fisheries Administration of the Executive Yuan reduce the amount of goods unloaded. However, the Fisheries Administration stated that it was technically impossible to reduce the quantity of goods shipped and that it was also unable to expand sales to other places besides Shanghai, so it expressed its unwillingness to accept the request.

Subsequently, as the losses of the various private fishing companies accumulated, they again approached the Fisheries Administration for negotiations. After several discussions, it was decided that from November, the Fisheries Administration's fishing vessels would unload no more than 350,000 catties per month in principle. According to the Fisheries Administration, if shipments were limited to this amount, only six or seven fishing vessels per month would be sufficient to supply the market. If the remaining fishing vessels remained berthed at Fuxing Island and were unable to unload their catch, the cost of continuous refrigeration would be unbearable. Regarding the rumors of disturbances in recent days, it is said that because the private fishing companies delivered too many goods, the fish market obtained the Fisheries Administration's consent to temporarily suspend the unloading of the Executive Yuan's fish. However, as of last night, all the fish from the Executive Yuan in the fish market had been completely unloaded. The rumors that some of the fish and the Executive Yuan's fish had rotted are not untrue, as the new refrigeration equipment on the Executive Yuan's fishing vessels can preserve the freshness of fish for more than two years. According to the private companies, each fishing trip costs them about 300 million yuan per boat. If the Fisheries Administration engages in unrestricted dumping, affecting fish prices, they will be unable to survive. Therefore, they urgently hope that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry can quickly negotiate with the Executive Yuan to rationalize production and sales, so that, on the one hand, private fishing companies can survive, and on the other hand, the food supply for the people will not be affected.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in order to resolve the Shanghai fish market problem, has dispatched personnel to Shanghai on the night train on the 10th to mediate.

### Tilanqiao Volunteer Police Corps Arrests a Large Number of Drug Offenders

### Seven Merchants Arrested, Rice Market Briefly Stalled, Resumed After Negotiation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Municipal Police Bureau, acting on orders, dispatched the Economic Police Brigade to monitor transactions in various markets throughout the day. The general situation was good. The Southern Rice Market was briefly stalled due to the arrest of seven rice merchants who were illegally raising prices: Chen Meizhang (Yuanchang), Zhang Yuanyi (Taishan), Li Boxiang (Yongchun), Yang Baofeng (Changfengtai), Li Yongyuan (Tiantai De), and Zhu Guiqing (Zhu Guiji). After negotiations between market officials and the police bureau, who agreed to continue trading in accordance with the order not to exceed 800,000 yuan per shi, the police bureau released the seven individuals. At the same time, the seven rice shops sold all 475 shi of white rice they had purchased at the limited price. In addition, when the oil market opened in the morning, there was unrest because the oil mills had stopped selling. After Zhang Chao, the chairman of the Oil Industry Association, requested the oil mills to allocate 3,000 dan of edible oil directly to retailers at a fair price, the situation stabilized.

### Jurisdiction Over Pilotage to be Taken Over Ahead of Schedule; Customs Strikers to be Re-examined and Re-employed

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over pilotage in this city, since the foreign pilots of the Customs went on strike and the Chinese pilots of the Tongsha Association requested that the Customs transfer the jurisdiction, originally scheduled for January 1 next year, to the Maritime Administration Bureau ahead of schedule, the Ministry of Transportation immediately consulted with the Ministry of Finance. After a meeting and discussion by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, it has been decided to hand over the jurisdiction ahead of schedule. The Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday with the following three instructions: 1. The Ministry of Finance has agreed that the Maritime Administration Bureau will take over jurisdiction over pilotage ahead of schedule. The date of the transfer will be decided after consultation between the Maritime Administration Bureau and the Customs. 2. The 22 Customs pilots who went on strike and wish to return to work will be individually reviewed by the Maritime Administration Bureau and re-employed as new employees. 3. The White Russian pilots temporarily employed by the Customs will be retained until the end of the year.

### Foreign Pilots Must Join Association

Yesterday, the person in charge of the Maritime Administration Bureau told reporters that the bureau would soon negotiate with the Customs about the handover, which is expected to be completed before the 20th of this month. The Customs currently has four large pilot boats, three small boats, and other pilotage equipment, which will all be handed over. After the Maritime Administration Bureau takes over, the pilotage affairs will be the responsibility of the Tongsha Pilot Association. The association currently has 18 Chinese pilots. Foreign pilots who wish to work in the future must also join the association and be subject to its control. The pilotage rights, which have been in the hands of foreigners for a century, can now be completely recovered. It is also learned that the pilotage fees may be increased after the Maritime Administration Bureau takes over.

### Taiwan Strives for Equal Treatment

Yesterday, this reporter interviewed the male and female representatives from the Taiwan Provincial Postal District. Taiwan Province still uses the joint postal and telecommunications system from the Japanese occupation period. There are currently more than 7,000 postal and telecommunications employees. Under the Japanese colonial policy, Taiwanese employees were not allowed to form unions, their treatment was extremely low, and they were all assigned to positions below the intermediate level. Under the current price situation in Taiwan, their income is insufficient to provide personal sustenance. Therefore, many postal workers engage in side jobs such as pulling rickshaws and selling cigarettes in their spare time. Therefore, the most important task of the Taiwanese representatives this time is to strive for equal treatment, request "reclassification," hold qualification examinations, and employ and pay salaries according to the domestic system. The plight of Taiwanese postal workers has received widespread sympathy at the congress. Representative Zhang Mei Wang told this reporter: Returning to the motherland for the first time is like returning to the embrace of parents. Our domestic brothers and sisters are treating us so well.

### Two Major Drug Trafficking Cases Cracked, Several Police Officers Involved Receive Commendations

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the 30th of last month, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Bureau cracked down on a drug manufacturing operation at No. 12, Ruihua Fang, Jianguo Middle Road, arresting Li Linsheng (also known as Peng) and Hu Kunlin (also known as Mao Kun) on the spot, and confiscating two catties and five liang of heroin. Afterwards, officers were dispatched to guard the location and arrested Wang Changjun, Zheng Shunhai, Wang Zhang Ezhen, Liu Wenying, Wang Jin'e, Li Amao, and six others. Based on their confessions, they arrested accomplices Xie Yizhong, Kong Deyao, and Xu Fuxing at No. 34 of the same lane, and confiscated two liang of caffeine and two qian of heroin. According to their confessions, the source of the drugs was transported from Tianjin by sea and air. The usual contact point was at a certain law firm at No. 308, Shude Lane, Yunnan South Road. The police bureau, as the criminals have confessed to producing and selling drugs, has scheduled to transfer them to the court for interrogation today. The police officers involved in this operation, including Chief Zhu Mengwei, officers Chen Xianrong, Ma Feimu, and staff member Ding Wenyang, have been ordered by Director Yu to receive commendations. Furthermore, the Lao Zha Volunteer Criminal Brigade of the Volunteer Criminal Corps received a tip at 5 PM on the 9th that a large number of illegal drug traffickers were hiding in Room 19 of the Xin Risheng Hotel on Wuhu Road. They immediately reported to Branch Director Shi Si, who ordered Team Leader Jiang Shangpei and Huang Zheng, the internal team leader, to lead officers together with Tang Zhiliang, an officer from the Second Section, to rush to the address around 11 PM that day. They entered Room 19 and searched, finally discovering about 50 liang of heroin inside a specially made vest worn by Ding Hexuan.

### Municipal Relief Sculpture of Fuzhou

[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou 6th Dispatch] Fuzhou is a port in southern China. From an economic and geographical standpoint, Fuzhou has almost become a hub for the inflow and outflow of goods from more than a dozen prosperous counties along the Min River. Imports are mainly cotton cloth, flour, and rice, followed by paper, cotton yarn, fertilizer, and vegetable oil, and then followed by soybean cakes, hardware, and electrical appliances, and beans. Exports are mainly tea, wood, and paper, followed by sugar, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts, and fresh and dried fruits, followed by paper umbrellas, lacquerware, horn combs, fish and seafood. Imports are mostly agricultural products and daily necessities for urban dwellers, while exports are mainly special products. From wartime to the post-war period, according to Customs reports, the trade balance has almost always been in a deficit. Although there was a brief trade surplus in June and July of this year, the trade situation has not been reversed.

Port Trade

The trend of prosperous trade in Fuzhou largely depends on the smooth flow of port transportation. Fujian still has no railway line extending into the interior, which is a major reason why Fuzhou Port is too weak. Secondly, the lack of timely dredging and embankment treatment of the Min River hinders the smooth flow of shipping. The section of the Min River from Nanping to Shuikou is full of reefs, and there are more than twenty dangerous areas. In the lower reaches, silt and sand accumulate, and the riverbed rises daily. Before the war, giant ships of several thousand tons could directly reach the Taijiang city area. Now, because the water is shallow, they are blocked at the Mazhou Star Pagoda. Cargoes are transferred to small boats for loading and unloading, which greatly increases labor costs. Such transportation only increases the cost of imports and exports. To prosper Fuzhou, it is necessary to improve the current state of stagnation in port transportation. The Ministry of Transportation is already planning to build the Min-Gan Railway. Dredging the downstream waterways of the Min River is an urgent task. It is heard that the Provincial Government is raising funds to purchase dredging equipment and build new-style wharves and warehouses. All of these are important policies for the prosperity of the Fuzhou commercial port and are sufficient to affect the prosperity or decline of the Fuzhou economy. In his industrialization plan, President Sun Yat-sen designated Fuzhou as a second-class port and planned to regulate the downstream waters of the Min River to a depth of 30 feet so that 10,000-ton ships could pass through smoothly, which is sufficient to demonstrate the value of Fuzhou Port.

Industry, Commerce, and Agriculture

Fuzhou's industry is still in the handicraft stage and can be divided into two major sectors: special product processing and technical works. The former includes sawing wood, milling rice, papermaking, and tea picking, while the latter includes lacquerware, paper umbrellas, horn combs, carvings, and daily necessities such as weaving and leather. The only heavy industry is the Fudien Iron Factory. The transportation and sale of special products from northwestern Fujian is an important part of Fuzhou's commerce. Before the war, merchants gathered from all over and the scene was quite prosperous. After the war, due to difficulties in transportation and sales, rising labor costs, and a sharp increase in costs, coupled with the turbulent situation and sluggish sales, the financial market tightened and high-interest loans became popular. The Fujian Agricultural and Forestry Company, which is known for its special product operations, suffered operational losses due to difficulty in exporting, which is indicative of the situation.

Regarding agricultural production, Fuzhou City only has 3,000 municipal acres of cultivated land, and the output of agricultural crops is very small. The city has a population of more than 330,000, and its daily food requirement is more than 2,000 shi, mostly relying on imports from other ports. According to official reports, last year, 264,000 municipal shi of rice, 528,000 municipal shi of rice, and 48,000 municipal dan of wheat flour were imported. Fuzhou can hardly do without external assistance for a day.

Public Utilities

Electricity is the largest public utility in Fuzhou. The Fuzhou Electric Company has four generators with a capacity of less than 5,000 kilowatts. Because the equipment of the Electric Company has passed its expiration date, it is often damaged. Electricity cannot be supplied during the day, and power outages often occur in different areas at night. Fuzhou still has no tap water equipment. Residents rely on wells for drinking water. Every spring and summer, floods cause disasters. Ditch water flows back, and the well water becomes turbid. As a result, epidemics are bound to be prevalent every year. "Water" is a major problem for Fuzhou's municipal engineering. The Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company previously had a plan to invest in establishing a Fuzhou water plant, but the funds required were too large, and this matter is still pending. The temporary solution lies in disinfecting drinking water. The Municipal Government and the General Branch of the Union Bank jointly run seven drinking water disinfection supply stations, one of which has been completed, using new water purification machines to provide clean water for citizens.

The traffic in Fuzhou City is mainly based on buses. There are only 30 buses in the city, running on three lines. The vehicles are not sufficient for distribution. After the South Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company took over the Fuzhou Public Bus Company, it is heard that they plan to expand to smooth out the traffic in the city area.

Municipal Problems

The financial problem is actually an economic problem. After the war, Fuzhou's industry and commerce declined, and the economic situation was very different from the past. Under this depressed situation, the city government's tax revenue has not improved despite repeated reorganizations. Financial constraints make it difficult to cook without rice. How can we talk about innovation while holding on to the old ways?

Food is the most difficult issue for the city government to deal with. Fuzhou is a purely consuming place. Rice and grain are entirely reliant on aid from northern Fujian or overseas. The city government does not have the financial resources to purchase large quantities of food from the producing areas to supply the fair-price market, while grain merchants have the financial resources to manipulate grain prices and confront the city government. Seasonal fluctuations in grain prices are like a "malignant disease" plaguing the municipal authorities. Mayor Yan Lingfeng is a municipal worker with魄力 and confidence. When he often discusses general municipal issues in Fuzhou with reporters, he always looks forward to the future of Fuzhou with optimism. His attitude is sincere and 겸충, and he has a sincere dedication to serving his hometown. He integrates local and 情 with no intervals.

Fuzhou is a very promising city. It has the Min River, which acts as a 교통動맥, a warm climate, a natural good harbor, and widespread education. If the transportation situation can be gradually improved, then prosperity can be expected, and the responsibility to revive its commercial status in South China lies with the municipal authorities and requires continuous effort from the municipal authorities.

### "Soldiers" Illegally Set Up Radio Station in Zhenjiang's Xinhe Hou Street; Arrested for Suspicious Behavior

### Minister Ying Qianli of the Ministry of Education's Social Education Department Discusses Educational Film Plans: 22 Films to Be Produced This Year to Improve Social Education in Border Areas

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 10th] Minister Ying Qianli of the Ministry of Education's Social Education Department, speaking to reporters on the 10th about the future plans of the Central Educational Film Studio, stated: (A) Construction: It is planned to expand offices and technical rooms, and build staff dormitories to facilitate work. (B) Equipment: Building an indoor scene stage, improving sound recording and film processing equipment, and installing water and electrical equipment. Equipment already purchased in the United States includes the latest model of high-quality 16mm cameras, which have not yet been seen in China and are not widely used even in American factories. The entire set of equipment and accessories is complete. The entire set of sound recording equipment is also the newest and most complete product from the United States, with all parts in stock. Film processing equipment has been purchased in the United States. It is automatic and has photosensitive testing equipment (to determine the scientific standards for film production and processing), as well as photosensitive materials. Some of the above equipment and materials have already arrived in Shanghai, and most are en route.

Sixteen Millimeter Film

(C) Future Productions: It is planned to focus on producing 16mm films because the current trend is to use 16mm projectors more than 35mm projectors, and this will be even more so in the future. Moreover, the equipment for producing 16mm films is lighter and more convenient than 35mm equipment, and 16mm film is less flammable, making it easier to promote. 35mm film is inherently a gunpowder, posing a great danger. The reason why 16mm films were not widely promoted in the past was that the quality was inferior and the technology was not yet perfect. Now, after mutual improvements by various manufacturers, the weight of a 16mm film projector is only 20 pounds, the light source can reach 1000 watts, and the sound can reach 10 watts. Future production standards will focus on popularizing them among schools and community groups at all levels, with 16mm films being the main focus. 35mm films will be aimed at theaters, with only one film of greater value being produced each year. It is also planned to organize a strong screenwriting department to write meaningful scripts for other film studios each year to alleviate the shortage of script drafts in domestic film studios. In addition, it is planned to produce a large number of still films, including still roll films and still single films, to improve the knowledge level of all national schools and farmers across the country. The technique of still films is quite similar to comic strips, and each time a film is produced, a comic book will also be released for public education.

Subject Matter Divided into Three Parts

(D) The subject matter of the films can be divided into three parts: extracurricular education, including the current situation in China and the global situation; materials to complement courses and levels of education; and general publicity reports and dramas. Although the studio has several years of history, during the Anti-Japanese War, it was limited by equipment, and its film production technology was naturally immature, and its understanding of and connection with educational undertakings was also far from ideal. Now that it has moved east to Nanjing, it is striving to enrich and improve itself. In the future, it hopes that the press will provide more guidance to the studio, and especially hopes that the academic and educational circles will cooperate more. As for various business organizations, it would be sincerely welcomed if they wish to jointly produce related films with the studio. The studio's biggest task this year is to improve social education in the border areas, remake ten existing educational films, and specially produce twelve more, totaling twenty-two films, for use in the border areas. The content includes China's "History and Geography," "Industry," "Transportation," "National Defense," etc., and will be dubbed in Mandarin, Uyghur, Mongolian, and Tibetan to help border residents recognize them.

### Former President of Fudan University, Li Denghui, Praised by the National Government

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 10th] The National Government has issued an order praising former Fudan University President Li Denghui. The original text is as follows: "Li Denghui, former President of Fudan University, lived overseas from a young age, caring about the motherland and aspiring to restore it. Later, he entered Yale University in the United States, studying literature, philosophy, and other subjects. He believed in revitalizing customs and promoting education first. After returning to China, he founded the World's Chinese Students' Federation and Fudan University, taking the promotion of culture and the training of future generations as his mission. Throughout his life, he firmly believed in religion, integrating Chinese and Western scholarship and returning to it. He cultivated himself and established others, indifferent to official advancement. The government repeatedly tried to recruit him, but ultimately could not. His students are spread throughout the country, each with their own achievements. In the midst of repeated major changes and various dangers, his virtue of integrity and his upright conduct remained unchanged. He bore the heavy expectations of the contemporary era and was admired by scholars for more than forty years. Just as we hoped that the country would have experienced leaders and always have models to emulate, we heard of his sudden illness and passing away. Recalling his venerable virtue, we are deeply saddened. He should be praised by a clear order, and his life's deeds should be sent to the National History Museum to highlight his integrity and to show future generations. This order!"

### First Battle of Ziqi (Transportation Corps) A Narrow Victory Over Renyu by Three Points: Result 46 to 43: Comeback in the Last Four Minutes

[Our Dispatch] The basketball team of the 16th Transportation Corps showed their skills last night, narrowly defeating Renyu by a score of 46 to 43. Ziqi lagged behind all the way. In the last four minutes, they were still down 36 to 41. Captain Jia Zhijun turned the tide, scoring ten consecutive points and reversing the defeat. The audience of 2,000 made the Municipal Gymnasium quite lively. In the first half, Renyu led 24 to 22 by two points. Ziqi captain Jia Zhijun was the soul of the team, and Yu Ruizhang's assistance was very helpful. The team still lacked short passes and moves under the basket during the game. Xu Zhongji and Yao Wen[blank] of Renyu were the most outstanding. The battle situation was as follows: The starting lineup for the 16th Transportation Corps was Yu Ruizhang, Liao Dihang, Jia Zhijun, Wang Shixuan, and Liu Zhengjun. Renyu's lineup was Wu Xinyun, Yao Wen[blank], Xu Zhongji, Sun Guozheng, and Shen [blank].

In less than a minute, Xu and Shen of Renyu followed, and [blank] Dihang scored a basket, tying the score at 4. The score remained level at 6.

In the second half, Zheng Dagang and Gan Rongwu of Ziqi replaced [blank] Liu, and the situation remained difficult to contend with. At 32 to 27, Ziqi saw that the situation was not good.

[blank] committed a foul and graduated. Gan Rongwu played again, and Shen Pengju scored a free throw, tying the score at 35.

### First Impression of the Sixteenth Transportation Corps: Simple and Unpretentious Style

[Special Article] The sixteenth Transportation Corps basketball team created a miracle in their first game in Shanghai: narrowly winning over Renyu despite being at a disadvantage throughout the game.

The visiting team, apart from borrowing Yu Ruizhang and Liu Zhengjun from "Zhenshu," only fielded: Wang Shixuan, Jia Zhijun, Zheng Dagang, [blank] Dihang, and Gan Rongwu. Jia Zhijun was the only one who could be called an all-around player. Zheng Dagang had surprising speed and quick shots, and Wang Shixuan relied solely on experience.

Renyu has many talented shooters and flashy moves to trick their opponents. The visiting team was initially at a loss. The Sixteenth Transportation Corps' tactics were simple and unpretentious, and their passing skills were far inferior to the home team. In the first half, many passes were intercepted by Renyu.

The visiting team's reason for reversing the defeat was only two points: In the second half, no one guarded Jia Zhijun's offense, and Renyu's stamina was not as good as the visiting team's. Sun Guozheng was fouled out, and the situation changed from being controlled by Renyu to being balanced. The visiting team took the opportunity to use quick shots to seize victory.

For the next few games, unless there are special reasons, in my personal opinion, the Sixteenth Transportation Corps still needs to work hard. (Changnian)

### After the Issuance of Large Denomination Notes: Credit Tightening, Strict Prevention: Minimal Price Fluctuations: Financial Circles Express Need to Pay Attention to the Lunar New Year Period

[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank issued large denomination notes of 1,000 and 2,000 Customs Gold yesterday, and the market situation was very stable. Prices of securities and some goods even fell. Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun hosted reporters yesterday afternoon and stated that there were no price fluctuations after the issuance of large denomination notes. The Financial Management Bureau will be formally established today and will resolutely and strictly inspect and crack down on speculation. National banks are also tightening credit. Yesterday, the difference in intake reached over 100 billion, and today the goods tax alone will add another 40 billion yuan. 43,000 tons of rice and a large amount of flour will arrive at ports soon and will be distributed and sold separately. In addition, remittance restrictions are in place. The Four Banks Joint Treasury has temporarily completely stopped lending. Therefore, the future of finance and prices is considered to be worry-free.

[Our Dispatch] After the issuance of 1,000 and 2,000 Customs Gold notes yesterday, market prices rose sharply in the morning due to popular sentiment, and the market was slightly chaotic, but quickly fell back, not far from the prices of the previous day. Taking the stock market as an example, the opening was high. Yongsha's off-exchange price reached 440, and the on-exchange price also reached 427, but short sellers took advantage of the high price to sell, causing the selling price to plummet, falling to the 400 mark by the noon closing. The foreign exchange market also fluctuated in the morning, but by noon, it was very little different from the previous day.

Price Curve Moving Upward, Prevention Cannot Be Relaxed

According to the analysis of financial circles, the reason why prices did not fluctuate greatly after the issuance of large denomination notes is due to the government's strict prevention in all aspects. In addition to tightening credit, it is also strictly monitoring hoarding. At the same time, the current number of large denomination notes issued is very small, so its impact is not very significant. However, what we must pay attention to is that the price curve is always moving upward, and all measures only have the effect of delaying. It is expected that the large-scale issuance of these two new Customs Gold notes will not be today but around the Lunar New Year to meet the needs of year-end bonuses and other needs. At that time, if there is no appropriate prevention, prices will change dramatically, and the full impact of large denomination notes can be estimated at that time. In addition, the percentage increase in various prices yesterday is difficult to accurately measure because everything is still in a state of flux, and various commodities are not uniform. It is generally believed that it will take two or three days for everything to return to a stable state before an estimate can be made.

National Banks Convene Meeting to Suspend Payment of Various Loans

[Our Dispatch] Central Bank Vice President Liu, in view of the issuance of large denomination notes, believed that emergency measures should be taken for the business of national banks. Therefore, he specially convened the heads of various banks yesterday morning to hold a temporary meeting. After discussing it, it was decided: All items that should not be paid will be temporarily suspended. All loans will be completely stopped, including important loans such as cotton and flour. For public agencies and state-owned enterprises with deposits of over 200 million yuan, the maximum daily payment is limited to 200 million. Remittances of over 200 million yuan from various places will also be temporarily suspended, and the source of the remittances will be investigated. It is reported that the decision is purely to cooperate with the government's policy in order to tighten credit and stabilize prices.

### Government Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Slightly Recover

Public bonds were bought yesterday, stimulated by the issuance of large denomination notes. Unified Bond C opened in the morning at 25,700 yuan, from 25,250 yuan, gradually rising to around 28,000 yuan and then stabilizing slightly. A and B rose from 17,000 yuan to 18,500 yuan and then also stabilized. Compared with the previous closing, A and B rose by 1,900, C rose by 2,300, D rose by 1,700, and E also improved by 1,600.

Foreign stocks slightly recovered after preparation. Hong Kong [blank] fell, and off-exchange black market prices fell sharply after a high. After active buying, the market was eventually forced down due to excessive inventory. Yisha saw over 400,000 off-exchange at the morning opening, and English League reached a high of over 550,000, then fell back to a low of 385,000 yuan and then stabilized, compared with the previous closing. Telephone and Tramway were still flat, rubber stocks fell by 10%, Jardine Matheson, beer, paper, shipping, and steel each fell by 5%, Yisha and English League fell slightly, and Xiangtai rose slightly.

Six Types of Government Bonds Drawn Yesterday

The Ministry of Finance drew lots yesterday morning in Shanghai for the redemption of six types of government bonds, including Unified E, Relief, and Construction. 1. Eighteen Unified Government Bond E tickets were drawn, totaling 4.68 million yuan. 2. Twelve Republic of China 27th Year Relief Government Bond tickets were drawn, totaling 360,000 yuan. 3.

### Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Suggests Two Points to the Textile Regulation Committee

[Our Dispatch] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association held its 95th executive committee meeting yesterday. Important reports included the association's issuance of notices and forms for inventory cotton and production reports, instructing all colleagues to fill them out immediately and send them to the association within this week for compilation and submission to the Textile Regulation Committee.

Association Chairman Wang Qiyu and executive directors Liu Jingji and Rong Yixin visited Textile Regulation Committee Chairman Yuan Liang yesterday. Wang and others suggested two points: The supply of raw cotton should be timed, quantitative, and qualitative to avoid production interruptions. Regarding the new policy on cotton yarn and cloth, the government should be reasonable and fair and not hinder agricultural and industrial production. It is reported that Yuan said that he would do his best to be reasonable and fair, but the raw cotton supply method is still being planned.

The association will hold a tea party this Saturday afternoon to invite Chairman Yuan to listen to opinions on the control of cotton yarn.

### Sugar Prices Recover

The association's price list for 24 coarse white stack orders was 1.21 million yuan, and spot big bags were 1.23 million yuan. 20 medium sand white was 1.12 million yuan, Taiwanese red [blank] was 1.15 million yuan, Shantou [blank] was 920,000 yuan, secondary [blank] was 880,000 yuan, [blank] Zhuang was 1.13 million yuan, Xing Red was 1.07 to 1.1 million yuan, and Diao Qing was 840,000 yuan, totaling thousands of pieces opened.

### Solid Export Tea

Domestic tea remains active all day due to unabated demand, similar to the previous day. As for the foreign tea market, sellers continue to hold out for higher prices, while exporters, though interested, are reluctant to offer high bids. Consequently, negotiations are difficult, resulting in fewer transactions, but the market sentiment remains firm.

### Large Supply of Yarn from the China Textile Construction Corporation and the Textile Adjustment Committee - Gauze Prices Initially High, Then Decline - Cloth Prices Rise, Raw Cotton Transactions Scarce

[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, due to the initial issuance of the new Customs Gold Unit notes, the China Textile Construction Corporation and the Textile Adjustment Committee sold large quantities of yarn to stabilize the silk gauze market. The China Textile Construction Corporation sold a total of 17,122 bales of yarn of various counts, equivalent to 2,802.5 bales of 20-count yarn. In addition to allocating yarn to local weaving businesses, it also allocated it to weaving businesses in various counties outside the city. The price, based on 20-count yarn, remained at 28.11 million yuan.

In addition, the Textile Adjustment Committee opened yarn sales in the cotton yarn market, resulting in the sale of 1,623 bales, equivalent to 2,126 bales of 20-count yarn. The prices were 15.4 million yuan for 6-count yarn, 30.5 million yuan for 20-count yarn, 39.5 million yuan for 32-count yarn, 42.5 million yuan for 42-count yarn, and 48.5 million yuan for 42-count doubled yarn.

Furthermore, the cotton yarn market yesterday initially saw optimistic sentiment due to the issuance of large denomination banknotes, and prices generally rose. Subsequently, because the China Textile Construction Corporation kept its allocated yarn prices unchanged and increased the quantity, the money supply in the market tightened, leading to widespread selling. Scatter sales were more common than bundled sales, and the market showed a slight softening. However, at the close of the afternoon session, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose by 500,000 yuan from the previous day to 49.2 million yuan, while other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. The cotton cloth market opened with positive sentiment in the morning, which then became very active, and market prices were generally raised. Around 10:30 AM, market supervisors arrived to monitor trading, and transactions became scarce. As the money supply tightened, prices fell from their highs. However, the final prices of 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloth yarns were still 20,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Throughout the day, 190 Shilin cloth rose by 50,000 to 150,000 yuan due to dye and factory prices, while bleached cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, and raw cloth were absorbed by buyers, rising by 120,000-130,000 to 500,000-600,000 yuan. Only jige and straight weave fabrics remained stable.

Yesterday, raw cotton transactions were scarce, with sellers holding out for high prices and buyers adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Asking prices were very high, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to agree, resulting in a quiet market with only 300 bales traded.

### A Glimpse of Commodity Prices in Various Regions

Wuxi [Special Dispatch from Wuxi, 10th] Commodity prices here have been affected by the large denomination banknotes. White japonica rice sells for 840,000 yuan, an increase of 40,000-50,000 yuan; wheat for 790,000 yuan, an increase of 40,000 yuan; military provision flour for 3.1 million yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan; bran is in high demand at 280,000 yuan per bag; cooking oil for 1.93 million yuan, a sharp increase of 100,000 yuan. All other commodities are also soaring in price.

Suzhou [Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 10th] Prices of all goods here are rising rapidly. The price of white rice broke the 800,000 yuan barrier yesterday, setting a new record. At noon today, it rose to 870,000 yuan, and in the afternoon, it broke the 900,000 yuan barrier, reaching 910,000 yuan. The county government summoned the head of the social affairs section, Li Jiefu, in the afternoon, ordering him to make every effort to suppress this artificial price increase, strictly investigate and prohibit merchants from taking the opportunity to raise prices, and impose severe punishments.

Chongqing [Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 10th] The issuance of large denomination banknotes is causing market fluctuations. Cloth prices are soaring, and disputes are arising over orders placed yesterday for which there are no stock receipts. There is no market for yarn. US dollar bonds are at 78,000 yuan. The Sichuan Silk Company has raised silk prices, with 22-grade white silk at 90 million yuan and yellow silk at 89 million yuan.

Chengdu [Special Dispatch from Chengdu, 10th] Upon hearing of the issuance of large denomination banknotes, commodity prices rose. Rice is at 1.08 million yuan per double dan, setting a new record for the year. Four-ply yarn is at 34.2 million yuan per bale, and Meiting Indanthrene cloth is at 3.2 million yuan per bolt. Fragrant yellow goods, general merchandise, and grains are all soaring in price, but the money supply remains tight.

### Large Banknote Stimulation is Slight - Shanghai Stocks Rise Initially, Then Decline Sharply

Shanghai stocks rose initially yesterday, then declined sharply. The stimulus from the large denomination banknotes only caused some initial buying interest. Government authorities released large quantities of various materials, tightening the money supply. Guangdong, Nanjing, and securities groups sold heavily, leading to low volume at the close. In the morning, Changli was very active, and Yong Yarn opened high, rising half a percentage point. Datong, China Textile, and underwear stocks traded at 424 yuan for immediate delivery, 427 yuan for forward delivery, 432 yuan for immediate delivery bought, and 43 yuan for forward delivery at a high price. Many people were eager to sell. The interest rate outside the market opened at 22.5 fen and 27 fen, and with strict line-cutting work, the price gradually fell to around 415 yuan. After slight selling, it reached 412 yuan and 413 yuan. Although there was a slight rebound afterwards, the tight money supply caused widespread panic, and there were rumors of borrowing. All parties were extremely cautious. Forward delivery stocks broke the 400 yuan barrier in the afternoon, falling to 398 yuan, and forward delivery stocks saw a low of 401 yuan. The afternoon close was 401 yuan and 403 yuan, with asking prices remaining low after the close. As a result, apart from miscellaneous stocks with sluggish trading, all stocks felt bleak and dim, with immediate delivery stocks falling by a total of one-tenth compared to the previous close. Zhabei, Jingfu, Qinxing, French, Xinhua, Match, and Mountain Silk stocks each fell by half a percentage point. China Rise, New Light, Xinyu, Meiya, Yonggong, and Zhongxing stocks remained flat, while the rest fell slightly. Among forward delivery stocks, Huayi and Qinxing fell by half a percentage point, while the rest fell slightly.

In the after-market, only immediate delivery trades were conducted. The market was initially stable, then retreated from 406 yuan to 401 yuan. Although it briefly rose to 414 yuan, there was a significant difference in the government's advance, and there was a large amount of cutting long positions outside the market. Major securities firms sold heavily, breaking the 400 yuan barrier again and falling to 397 yuan. The closing price was 397 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Huayi and China Silk stocks each rose by about half a percentage point, Liana fell by half a percentage point, Jingfu, Xin'guang, Xinhua, Jinglun, Match, and Tongyi remained flat, Zhabei, Qinxing, French, New Asia, Guohuo, and Rongfeng rose slightly, and Yong Yarn, Gai Xin, Xinyu, Meiya, Yonggong, Underwear, and China Textile fell slightly. Outside the market, old stocks such as Huashang Electric and Xinxin rose again by half a percentage point, while the rest remained stable.

### Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Rise in Concert - White Japonica Rice Nears 900,000 Yuan - Social Bureau Schedules Meeting with Merchants Today to Discuss

[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, the rice market was affected by the issuance of large denomination banknotes, with the highest price for white japonica rice reaching 880,000 yuan. In addition to actively promoting rice distribution to poor households, the Social Bureau has scheduled a meeting with rice merchants today to discuss ways to increase supply and suppress grain prices.

Furthermore, yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of 13,200 dan of rice and grain. The market continued to surge, with japonica and indica rice rising in concert, jumping by 50,000-60,000 yuan. At noon, the authorities ordered that prices not exceed the 800,000 yuan barrier, and sentiment softened slightly. The close was relatively weak. Flour digestion was active, continuing to jump by over 10,000 yuan. Bran rose again by over 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was sluggish in the North, with slow turnover, but prices of all goods rose, leading to an increase of 10,000-20,000 yuan. Confidential Beiyang rice was readily accepted, surging by 30,000-40,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were heavily purchased by the Guangdong group, causing a sharp increase of 70,000-80,000 yuan. Sesame oil factories collected, causing a surge of 50,000-60,000 yuan in milk. Black sesame also rose by 10,000-20,000 yuan, and white sesame followed suit, rising by 20,000-30,000 yuan.

Yesterday, oil factories jointly allocated and sold oil to various retailers, five dan per retailer, totaling 2,500 dan, with prices increasing by 80,000 yuan per day.

Imported Rice Arrives in Shanghai

[Special Dispatch] Taikoo Company's Niuzhuang vessel, carrying 2,300 tons of imported rice from Bangkok, arrived in Shanghai today. It is learned that a large quantity will be transported in subsequent voyages. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haichen vessel has already arrived in Bangkok and will load 9,000 tons of imported rice to return to Shanghai. Furthermore, the company's Haixuan vessel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Siam next Wednesday (the 17th), also to load rice for return to the country. The above imported rice was entirely purchased by the China Trust Bureau.

12,000 Tons of Crude Oil Transported by Yonghong Arrives in Kaohsiung

China's first oil tanker, Yonghong, to sail to the Persian Gulf to transport crude oil, safely arrived in Kaohsiung yesterday morning (the 10th) at 9:00 AM, completing a round trip of 11,542 nautical miles. When reporters visited Mr. Li Yuncheng, general manager of China Oil Transportation Company, he said that Yonghong set sail from Shanghai on October 3, passing through Hong Kong, Singapore, and Colombo, and arrived in the Persian Gulf on November 6. It loaded 12,000 tons of crude oil and returned on the 8th, arriving in Kaohsiung the night before last (the 9th) at 9:00 PM. Yesterday morning (the 10th), it safely entered the port of Kaohsiung and docked at the China Petroleum Corporation wharf to begin unloading oil. It is expected to return to Shanghai by the 15th and, after staying for a few days, will sail to the Persian Gulf again.

### The Story of Civilization

— Traditional Pioneer

By Will Durant, The Story of Civilization, Simon and Schuster, New York, First Edition 1942, 1048 pages, US$6.00

Recently, I read two major works on world cultural history at home: one is British historian Toynbee's "A Study of History," and the other is American Durant's "The Story of Civilization." The former is a study of the philosophy of history, divided into thirteen parts, with six large volumes already published, only reaching the fifth part of the entire book. I plan to introduce it in another article. Durant's "The Story of Civilization" narrates world cultural history, divided into five parts, with only three large volumes published, only covering Eastern civilization and cultures before the Western classical era. This spirit of devoting all one's energy and concentration to a specific field of work is truly admirable and makes us feel ashamed. Chinese society does not cultivate research talents in specialized academic fields. On the contrary, it cripples them. The lack of a material foundation, the corruption of social customs, and the involvement of political factors cause many scholars to use their knowledge improperly, spending their days busy with many inexplicable things, ultimately achieving nothing and wasting their lives. I use this to criticize myself and also hope to encourage others.

Durant is known for "The Story of Philosophy." General readers often regard philosophical books as difficult and abstruse and dare not attempt to read them. However, Durant's "The Story of Philosophy" has clear and elegant writing and clear reasoning, elucidating theories from the life stories of philosophers, making it easy to understand. Therefore, that book still sells very well and is widely circulated. More than thirty years ago, the author wanted to start writing a "History of the Nineteenth Century," but he found that such work was impossible without thoroughly tracing back to the beginning of human history. So he planned to write a large world cultural history, which includes five parts:

Eastern Culture: Narrates the cultures of Egypt and the Near East until the fall of Alexandria; the cultures of India, China, and Japan up to the present. The introduction explains the nature and factors of culture.

Classical Culture: Narrates the cultures of Greece and Rome and the Near Eastern cultures under Greek and Roman rule.

Medieval Culture: Narrates European culture under Catholicism and feudalism, Byzantine culture, Islamic and Jewish culture in Asia, Africa, and Spain, and the Italian Renaissance.

European Culture: Narrates the cultural history of European countries from the Reformation to the French Revolution.

Modern Culture: Narrates the development of Europe in politics, science, philosophy, religion, morality, literature, and art since Napoleon's time.

The first part began in 1927 and was completed and published in 1935. By 1942, it had sold to the eighth edition. The edition I read is the eighth edition, and this article can only briefly introduce the contents of this book. In the preface to this book, the author says: "I want to describe as much as possible mankind's contributions to culture in the fewest possible words. We must trace the causes and consequences of all historical events, the progress of various inventions, the changes in economic organization, the changes in political systems, the upheavals in religious beliefs, the sudden creations in moral customs, the creations in literature and art, and the development of scientific philosophy." In the past, those who wrote cultural history always liked to divide it into economic history, political history, religious history, philosophical history, literary history, scientific history, etc., and then divide it into many eras. This inevitably leads to the drawbacks of fragmented branches. Human life is whole, so human cultural history should be a complete narrative, whether in breadth or depth. Of course, because the development of human life in various aspects is too complex and too specialized, if one person makes a comprehensive description, there will inevitably be biases, omissions, and errors. However, we cannot ignore the need for human beings to have a comprehensive and complete understanding of their own culture.

This book is exclusively about Eastern culture and is only one-fifth of "The Story of Civilization." This book is further divided into three volumes. It begins with an introduction, discussing "The Establishment of Culture," divided into six chapters: The Conditions of Culture (including the basic conditions of geology, geography, economy, race, and psychology); The Economic Factors of Culture (including 1. From nomadic to agricultural; 2. Industrial basis, 2. Economic organization)! The Political Factors of Culture - the origin of government, the state, law, family; The Moral Factors of Culture - relations between the sexes, social customs, religious beliefs; The Psychological Factors of Culture - language! Writing, science, art; The Origin of Prehistoric Culture.

The first volume is on Near Eastern culture, describing the economic life, political situation, religious morality, language and literature, and philosophical thought of Sumeria, Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Judah, Persia, and other countries.

The second volume is on the cultural history of India, divided into nine chapters: The Foundation of India; Buddha Shakyamuni; From Alexander to Aurangzeb! The Life of the Indian People (including its economic life, social organization, moral marriage, customs); The Divine Realm (explaining the divine realms of Hinduism, Buddhism, and various strange beliefs; Indian Schools of Thought; Indian Literature (including language, education, poetry, drama, etc.); Indian Art (including music, printing, sculpture, architecture, etc.), Christianity in India (which specifically mentions Tagore and Gandhi).

The third volume is on the culture of the Far East, including China and Japan. Regarding the Chinese part, he calls the Zhou Dynasty the era of thinkers, discussing the ancient culture of China and then talking about the philosophy of Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Yang Zhu. He calls the Qin, Han, and Tang Dynasties the era of poets, with Li Bai and Du Fu as representatives. He also calls the Song Dynasty and later the era of artists, discussing Chinese bronzes, ceramics, calligraphy, pagodas, and palaces. Then there are two chapters: one is a general discussion of the Chinese people and the state; the other is on China's revolution and rebirth. Regarding the Japanese part, he talks about the creators of Japan, the political and moral foundations of Japan, the traditional Japanese thought and art, and the last chapter talks about the reforms of new Japan in industry and culture since the Meiji Restoration, all the way to the relationship between the United States and Japan. The author wrote this book before the Pearl Harbor incident. He believes that the United States does not necessarily have to fight Japan. He said: "We have taught Japan the industrialized technology, enabling Japan to succeed in the East Asian economic competition. There is no need to worry about the power of the Japanese. The world is so big that the United States and Japan can coexist. The Pacific Ocean is so vast that there is plenty of room for peaceful coexistence." I wonder if Durant had a feeling of "If I don't destroy Japan, Japan will destroy me" when the Pearl Harbor incident suddenly broke out on December 8th?

Regarding the rebirth of China, the author offers much encouragement, which deeply benefits Chinese readers. He says: "Military and economic victories cannot permanently control China. When the invaders are exhausted, this oriental essence will remain undamaged. Foreign rule will be assimilated by it in a century. China will soon be familiar with everything called modern industry. Transportation roads will make her unified; economic thrift will make her wealthy; a strong government will make her peaceful. All the chaos is a transitional phenomenon... Revolution is the death of decay. Revolution occurs because many things should be eliminated. How many times has China died, but how many times has she been reborn!" Reading this passage and recalling Weidmaier's severe criticism of China's current situation is truly laughable.

The author, Dr. Durant, studied philosophy under Dewey at Columbia University and taught at his alma mater. His English is fluent, and his reasoning is rich in literary flavor. Even a book of more than a thousand pages does not tire the reader. I very much hope that someone from Chinese academic and ideological circles will translate it, which will be beneficial to the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures.

### Taiwan's Industry is Developing

— Binzhi

Taiwan, which was lost for fifty-one years, has returned to the embrace of the motherland. This returning child not only brings the warmth of human feelings but also brings a large amount of property. As the motherland has undergone eight years of war, and everywhere is devastated, this property is very valuable. It is generally believed that the construction of Taiwan is an unexpected gain for us. In fact, this was not left by the Japanese, but is the result of the fifty-one years of sweat and blood of the Taiwanese people, and we must cherish it all the more.

Taiwan spans the tropical and subtropical latitudes, with a mild climate, abundant rainfall, fertile land, and abundant products. Rice can be harvested twice a year, and in the early Qing Dynasty, there was surplus grain that could be transported to the mainland. In addition, sugar, tea, aquatic products, and camphor and other products were also transported back to the motherland. Therefore, trade between Taiwan and the motherland was quite prosperous in the early years. After the Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was ceded to Japan. The Japanese, seeing that Taiwan was fertile and had more than three million Taiwanese people who could be driven by them, actively developed it. Within a few years, the results were quite impressive, and it became Japan's outer province, allowing it to be exploited and squeezed without end.

When the Japanese managed Taiwan, they always adopted a policy of agriculture in Taiwan and industry in Japan, so industry was not highly developed. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to the needs of Japanese military affairs and Taiwan itself, various industries gradually arose. Even heavy industries such as metallurgy, steelmaking, aluminum manufacturing, and refining factories were established one after another. Taiwan's economy gradually moved from agriculture to industry.

The recovery of Taiwan is indeed of great help to our country's economy, and it also increases our country's burden. We must cherish the sweat and blood shed by the Taiwanese people in the past, not only to maintain the existing industries, but also to further develop them. Especially in the later stages of the war, Taiwan's major industries suffered a lot of damage and loss, and recovery will not be an easy task. Although many of Taiwan's industries have recovered in the past two years, they have not yet reached their former glory, which still requires our efforts.

To restore Taiwan's industry and further develop Taiwan's production, we must first understand the situation of Taiwan's industry. The book "Taiwan's Industrial Circle" is a good reference. Mr. Jiang Zixin has lived in Taiwan for many years and has a deep understanding of the situation in Taiwan's industrial circle. It can be said that the whole book is a general view of Taiwan's industrial circle.

The whole book is divided into twelve chapters, focusing on Taiwan's production enterprises. All aspects of agriculture, forestry, aquatic products, minerals, and industry are described in detail. The sugar industry is established in a separate chapter to show its importance. In addition, the book describes Taiwan's land, climate, population, commerce, transportation, trade, and other items related to industry in detail. The Japanese management of Taiwan in the past, such as the financial system, the monopoly system, and other issues, are also discussed, and the statistical data of Taiwan before the recovery are even more valuable. The history of the Japanese management of Taiwan in the past fifty-one years can serve as a reference for our country's future development.

Taiwan and Hainan Island are the eyes of our country's coast, and their positions are very important. Taiwan has been managed by the Japanese for half a century and has entered the path of industrialization, but most of Hainan Island has not been developed to this day, except for the coastal area. In fact, the area of Hainan Island is larger than that of Taiwan, and the resources it contains are richer than those of Taiwan, and the conditions for development are more favorable. At this time, the call for the development of Hainan Island is becoming more and more loud, and it is gradually revealed that the similar environment and the situation of managing Taiwan can also serve as a reference for the development of Hainan Island. Therefore, the author specially placed the chapter "Taiwan's Development and Hainan Island's Development" at the end of the whole book, so that the remote desert island in the South China Sea will be transformed from wilderness into fertile land and will compete with Taiwan in the near future.

### New Concepts of Matter

— Zhonghuan

(By C.G. Darwin, translated by [omitted],

Published by Commercial Press, one of the Little Natural Science Library)

Commercial Press has two good little libraries. One is the Little Mathematics Library, and the other is the Little Natural Science Library. These two little libraries are very suitable for young people to refer to and study, and they are two extremely valuable reading materials. We have to give credit to the efforts of Commercial Press.

"New Concepts of Matter" is adapted from a manuscript of a lecture given by Professor C.G. Darwin at the Lowell Institute in Boston. It is new in that its organization is based on a thematic layout, divided into eight chapters of roughly equal length, so it is slightly different from other books.

The purpose of this book is to explain the concepts that make up the basic components of matter, so the first chapter of this book includes the definition of atoms, electrons, protons, photons, etc., and the structure of atoms, which is described simply and clearly, much more clearly than the description in ordinary textbooks. After completing the structure of the atom, the following then discusses waves, diffraction, the uncertainty principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, polarization, collisions, etc., to provide a systematic introduction to the concepts that make up the basic components of the physical world.

Because this book was originally lectured to the Lowell Institute, it is a little too difficult for young people with high school level. Therefore, when reading it, you must not treat it like an ordinary science textbook. You should concentrate and grasp the main points in the book.

The book is accompanied by [number] illustrations, which are all drawn in a "simple", "clear" and "understandable" manner, making it a lot easier for us to read at any time. Especially valuable are the pictures, which all give a concrete impression of the experiment.

The whole book is best read after completing the optics of advanced physics, especially the second and third chapters, which discuss the waves and the diffraction of matter in more detail and very concisely.

Finally, in terms of translation, the translator Mr. Yang [omitted] is a famous scholar in China, and he translated it extremely well. However, I think there is a shortcoming, which is a shortcoming shared by the Little Natural Science Library and the Little Mathematics Library, that is, this book is written in classical Chinese. Scientific books are already deep and difficult to read, and now they are translated into classical Chinese, which makes them even more profound and obscure. I hope that the wise Commercial Press will improve this, and it is better to use vernacular so that young people will not reduce their interest in this type of book because of classical Chinese, so that young people can use their precious time to study.

### Kaiming English Grammar

— Zhu Fang

Written by Lin Yutang, published by Kaiming Bookstore

English grammar is often considered a boring and tasteless subject in schools. However, this is not the fault of English grammar itself, but really because of the poor organization of general old-fashioned grammar books and the dull rote memorization of rules by teachers.

This Kaiming English Grammar is a most forward-looking grammar book. It reverses the previous organizational method and focuses entirely on the ideas of English speakers (Notions) as the starting point, and discusses expression methods and the inherent thinking methods of the English based on psychology. However, the author does not focus solely on theory, because he wants to take into account practical aspects, so this book is also very suitable for use as a high school textbook.

Moreover, there are many interesting materials here, so even a student who hates grammar, I think he will not hate it after reading this book. If the English level is poor, and the translator also adds some annotations on the Chinese side that are not in the original book. This Chinese translation is also published by Kaiming.

The whole book is divided into sixteen chapters: "The Science of Expression", "Changes in the Tone and Function of Tunes", "The Mood of Sentences", "People and Things and Their Properties", "Number and Quantity", "Weight, Value, Volume, Distance, Shape, Position", "Representation", "Designation", "Modification", "Comparison and Grade", "Various Aspects of Action", "Subject and Object (External Action)", "Action Time", "Fact and Imagination", "Relationship", "The Economy of Expression". Finally, there is also a summary of formal grammar and an index.

### Reading Shi Tuo's "Marriage"

— Shen Lu

In the few years Shanghai was occupied – undoubtedly, this society, originally radiant and then fiercely heated, was bound to undergo profound and intense changes. The so-called confluence of clouds and opportunities encompassed the ups and downs of many figures, both major and minor, and tragedies and comedies were constantly being staged. However, regrettably, after the end of the war, very few literary works reflecting the social landscape and life of that period have appeared. Shi Tuo's novella "Marriage," which we are discussing here, can be considered one of those few.

"Marriage" is divided into two volumes, the first consisting of six letters written in epistolary form, while the second is divided into six chapters written in a purely fictional style. Throughout the book, the male protagonist, Hu Qu'e, whom the author strives to portray in detail, is an intellectual (a teacher) adrift in the sea of humanity. He possesses a kind nature but also exhibits the wavering and compromising tendencies characteristic of intellectuals in general. At the outset, the author depicts him as seeking to raise funds to marry his fiancée, a female intellectual named Pei Fang (actually also to make a living). In this turbulent and fluctuating society, he concludes that the only path is to engage in business. The six letters in the first volume are all written by the male protagonist, Hu Qu'e, to his fiancée, Pei Fang (brief excerpt: "My only loved one, Pei Fang, you finally left, leaving me behind, returning to our old home in the countryside! Shanghai is still a sea of people, squalid, chaotic, noisy, full of rumors, assassinations, and plunder; yet, in a gust of wind, you are gone, and my heart is swept clean. In Shanghai, with its millions of people, he is alone, like a ship with a severed cable, floating and sinking, tossed about. He is cold, hungry, sick, and dying, but who cares about him? Who thinks of him?"… "Money has tormented me and you, and while you hate it, you still have to love it. After you left, I kept thinking that if there had been no war, and I had saved a bit more money, we should have been married by now, according to our plan. That's why I said in my last letter that I wanted to do business. I could have kept it from you, but because I love you so much, I discussed it with you. I never expected you to object. You say we are all still young, and we can wait until the war is over. You say doing business is uncertain and not very noble. You also say that true happiness is not built on money… But, my little dreamer, please allow me to ask, if the war lasts a hundred years, must we wait a hundred years?"). From this, we naturally grasp the confession of a suffering soul struggling in the quagmire of reality.

The following contains even more poignant accusations: "…I think of your father, an old teacher of thirty years, who should have been enjoying his retirement at home, but he still has to struggle bitterly with poverty. It's not that he doesn't love us, but for the sake of integrity, for refusing to obey the Japanese and their collaborators, he would rather abandon his lifelong career, harden his heart, make you drop out of college, and let your younger brother lose his schooling, and go back to his hometown to open a general store. This is a satire of the nation, Pei Fang, and also tears, a pain that cannot be expressed with tears! Now you should believe that my desire to earn money is not only for ourselves, for you and me to have a simple and happy family in the future, but also for your father, mother, and brother. We cannot only wish for ourselves."

As the letters narrate the unfolding events, Hu Qu'e finally joins the circle of ignorant and incompetent offspring of old-fashioned bureaucratic families, typical young ruffians of Shanghai, speculative merchants, those who value vanity, but are actually fragile Shanghai misses, and pathetic creatures with glorious pasts, yet cold, arrogant, and conceited, and begins to engage in business.

The second volume, written in fictional style, uses the entanglements of these figures as a thread to fully depict the social scene in Shanghai during the occupation! In the end, our male protagonist, Hu Qu'e, having exhausted his beautiful dreams and suffered countless deceptions, has no choice but to resort to murder to vent his despair. Shanghai at that time was such a place (in fact, it is still like this now!): "Whether one is killed or kills, as long as it is not oneself who dies, people must continue to make a living, and it has nothing to do with anyone else. It is like throwing a stone into the sea; the stone is gone, but the sea remains unaffected." (See the ending of "Marriage.")

From "Marriage," we see the archetype of the intellectual in Hu Qu'e, how he struggles with life, and how he wavers and compromises! The process is described with clarity, and the author also implicitly conveys the social environment and the character's own weaknesses in this person's decline and disillusionment—it is truly a mirror for intellectuals, making one wary!

We know that Shi Tuo is also known as Lu Fen. Before the war, his short stories and essays were mostly elegant and readable. The author was adept at depicting rural life and small characters, with a simple and sincere style and deep emotion, which cannot be compared with the crude literary works that only consider political purposes and disregard artistic value. Now, having read "Marriage," I feel that the small figures in the metropolis that appear in his writing are equally vivid and prominent. The humorous and delicate touches between the lines are the author's successes, but also his flaws: because of this, works like "Marriage," strictly speaking, due to the disparity between the front and back forms, when we analyze its structure and focus on narrative techniques, we find some places that are loose and difficult to echo, and the weight of the writing also gives people a sense of "excess" and "deficiency." Overall, "Marriage" is still a work that expresses a fragment of the era and realistic characters. Reading it today still makes people feel familiar. Why is that? I think everyone who has read this book should feel that today's Shanghai society is not similar to what is depicted in the book?

### Wang Yitang and Jin Biwei

—

The trials of traitors in Peiping, the most noteworthy and talked about were one man and one woman: the man was Wang Yitang, whose impression given to the audience was "lazy and useless," like "Di Hulu" in the play "Five Martyrs"; the woman was Jin Biwei, whose impression was "fiery and unruly," like Grandma Ba Jiu in "Suan Yan Ridge."

Wang Yitang's courtesy name was Zhiyang, later changed to Geng, and he also used his courtesy name as his given name Yitang. He was also known as Yutang, Shi Gong, and the owner of Jin Chuan Shi Lou. People called him "Wang the Bearded." This old fellow has a long history and many strange stories. He is seventy years old this year, which can be considered a "rare grand celebration." Since his arrest, he has undergone many trials. His special secret is to pretend to be mute and deaf, feigning illness and acting foolish, "not answering ten questions out of ten." Asked about his birthplace? No answer. Asked about his name? No answer. Asked about his residence? No answer. Asked what he had done before? No answer. Asked what he meant by joining the puppet government? No answer. Asked about his acts of treason and flattering the enemy during his tenure as puppet chief? No answer at all. One trial after another, never answering. Such composure is worthy of ten years of meditation against a wall, with profound concentration ("Songzi" claims to be proficient in playing the zither). Occasionally, he mumbles a few words in a delirium, saying "can't hear" and "don't understand," which further enhances the effect.

At first, people thought that this old man was of such an old age, living behind bars, with a disordered mind and distressed spirit, or that it was the real situation. Unexpectedly, after his first sentencing, he unexpectedly "bit back" at Judge He in court! He complained to the higher authorities, claiming that He had served as the director of academic affairs in the judicial training institute under his administration as the chief, and was also a traitor. It was unreasonable and unwilling to have a small traitor judge a big traitor. Sure enough, the censor impeached He, removed him from his post, and investigated him. Wang the Bearded's move was highly effective. He seemed to have learned from Song Shijie in the play "Four Scholars," who, after being sentenced incorrectly by Judge Mao Peng in the last scene, had Yang Suzhen recognize that Mao Peng was the one who wrote the complaint in Songlin, so he went to court a second time and questioned Mao Peng, saying, "You are the chief culprit!" Sure enough, Mao Peng was caught by him, and had to step down and apologize carefully, even complimenting old Song as "an old gentleman who can't be said to be bad." So old Song was acquitted! However, that was just a play, not in accordance with the truth. Even if Judge He was a small traitor, Wang the Bearded could not be exempt from the crime of being a big traitor. But Judge He was eventually overthrown by Wang the Bearded, which is in line with what Lu Su said to Kong Ming in the play "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats": "I have to pull someone down with me when I die!" From this point of view, this old fox's illness and deafness are all pretenses, a true and utter "old cunning and treacherous" fellow!

Being carried from the hospital on a sickbed to the prison, and from the prison to the court for trial, over and over again, carrying him back and forth, the audience felt as if they were watching a play. An old man who came from the examination system, where is his dignity! Although Wang Kemin was a traitorous ringleader, his death was clean and neat, surpassing Wang Yitang.

Jin Biwei, also known as Bihui, also called Kawashima Yoshiko, was known as "Commander Jin." In the past, her biological father (former Prince Su of the Qing Dynasty) and her Japanese father Kawashima Naniwa did many thrilling and bizarre things. After the restoration, she was arrested, and during the grand trial, she performed strange tunes and phrases that no other male or female traitor had ever done in court. With a loud shout, she was like King Xiang Yu of Chu, scattering a thousand men! When the judge asked questions, she always turned to the offensive. If she was asked one question, she would ask two back; if she was asked two questions, she would ask three back. When asked if she liked riding horses, sword dancing, playing ball, and other acrobatics, she asked in return if these were also illegal? You don't ask proper questions, but idle chatter! For a prisoner to teach those in court, it was truly unheard of, and bowing to the portrait of President Sun Yat-sen hanging in the court and calling him "Uncle Sun" was even more absurd. Four years ago, when Wang Jingwei inspected the old capital as the puppet chairman, she used her Japanese connections to discuss the friendship between their fathers with Wang (when Wang assassinated the Qing Prince Regent, Prince Su had tried to prevent him from being sentenced to death and imprisonment), calling Wang "Uncle." It can be seen that she has a habit of calling people "Uncle" casually.

When she was a commander, she was very rude to the Japanese military police. Gao Jiyi (director of the Beining Railway Bureau during Zhang Xueliang's time) was arrested by the Japanese, and she rescued him, even beating and scolding the Japanese soldiers. This matter was quite satisfying and should not be dismissed because of her other actions.

### Avoiding Strengths in Calligraphy and Painting

— Wang Baili

Competition is a good phenomenon. Only when everyone has a competitive spirit can society progress, and this is especially true for calligraphy. However, people have different talents, so their achievements also vary. If one is determined to become famous in future generations, one must change direction and strive to engage in other areas, and the result can also achieve different qualities with the same beauty. Otherwise, your name will only always be below others, obscured and not prominent. Therefore, if competition is not possible, retreating and avoiding strengths is also a wise move. History says that Zhang Changshi and Yan Lugong initially studied regular script together. Zhang knew that he was inferior to Yan, so he turned to cursive script, and his name became greatly famous. Also, in the Records of Zhonghao, it is said that Yang Huizhi initially studied painting as well. Seeing that Wu Daozi was superior, he turned to sculpture, and his name also dominated the world. As for Gu Xuepo and Xu Tieshan of Changshu in the early Qing Dynasty, they originally painted landscapes together with Wang Shigu when they were young. Later, Wang Shigu traveled with Wang Yanke and Wang Yuanzhao of Taicang, and saw genuine works of the Song and Yuan dynasties, and his knowledge progressed day by day. Xuepo and Tieshan knew that they could not surpass him, so one went to paint bamboo, and the other went to paint horses, and both achieved great accomplishments (as seen in the Liunan Notes). It can be seen that jealousy is the most undesirable thing, and avoiding strengths is not a bad thing.

### Statistics

— Tian

General Smuts, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, not long after taking office, was preparing to deliver an important policy speech to Parliament. He called his secretary and instructed him to carefully check the files, because several places in the speech required precise statistical data for explanation.

Seven hours later, his secretary came to report: "General, the statistical material you need would take at least five years to sort out, and no one can find it at present."

The next day, Smuts attended Parliament on time and delivered a very moving speech, with detailed statistical figures supplementing each key point. The MPs were greatly moved, and Smuts' secretary was even more admired. When Smuts returned to the office, the secretary asked him: "Your statistical material today was so rich and accurate, may I ask who found it for you?"

General Smuts said: "Didn't you say yesterday that no one could find these statistics within five years? So, I just made up my own statistics. Anyway, who would spend five years to check whether my statistics are correct!"

### Children's Biography Literature

— Wen Jie

Biography literature in our country has not yet been developed. Even if there is, it is limited to a few so-called biographies of famous people or autobiographies of great people. I once heard an editor say: To write about someone, that person must be limited to famous or great people. This may have "business" reasons. As far as the "literary" standpoint is concerned, there is no need for biographies to be limited to famous or great people. For example, Zhang Dian's "Biography of Unusual People." This book has quite literary value, but the content is not entirely about famous and great people, and what is written is quite worthy of being passed on.

Moreover, as I see it, when famous and great people write their biographies or autobiographies, they must have an "immortal" idea in their hearts. In the writing process, they inevitably cover up a bit, or even fabricate facts, or fabricate facts, and it is not easy to achieve the point of frank narration. If they truly record how they engage in corruption and how they accept bribes, and pass on their scandals and secrets, although it is still a true biography, the "famous" and "great" people will lose their "fame" and "greatness." Accordingly, rather than valuing the biographies of the so-called "giants," we should shift our attention and pay attention to the actions of the "little ones." By "little ones," I mean children.

In our daily lives, what we are concerned about all day long are military and national affairs, as well as the oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar that are closely related to military and national affairs. But when we meet with friends, what we talk about is nothing more than the above two major items. And who doesn't have children, but except for the necessary formalities, there is little exchange of information about each other's children. This shows that we lack attention to children. Although it is said that life is difficult, so we have no time for this, why don't the general writers and writers, in addition to paying attention to important people and things, divert their energy to our children?

Even with novels, most Chinese and foreign works, ancient and modern, are aimed at adults, and even if children appear, they are mostly supporting roles. Novels that are purely aimed at children are probably not very common even in Europe and America. Novels that purely depict children, such as Amicis' "Education of Love" and Alcott Louisa's "Little Women" and "Little Men," are also rare works in the West. In China, as far as I know, there is probably only one work that belongs to this category: Lao She's "Xiao Po's Birthday." And the first half of Lao She's work is written very well, while the second half is not written very well.

Since we all have our own children, if the editor of this journal does not object, why not host a "My Child" essay contest? George Crabbe has a saying: "Anyone who has feelings always feels interested in the chattering of children, and parents feel supremely happy when they hear it." "Supreme happiness" is indeed not limited to children's words, but also includes actions. We might as well exchange our "supreme happiness" with each other.

Chapter 3 On Stage and Off Stage

Seeing that he was just staring blankly, listening intently, he elbowed him and said, "The play is almost over, aren't you leaving?" Zhuzhai then came back to his senses and saw that the guests in the theater were already sitting up one after another. His heart still greedily yearned for the play on the stage, but it was inconvenient not to leave. He had already stood up, but still wanted to watch for a while. Unable to resist Yunqing's constant tugging at his sleeve, urging him to leave quickly, fearing that it would be crowded, he had to support Yunqing and escorted her to the door like a bodyguard before finding a car to send her back. When they arrived at Yunqing's door, Zhuzhai was unwilling to go in because it was too late, and he was about to go back when Yunqing called him to stop: "I have one sentence that I forgot to ask you. Who gave you the tickets for the play today?" Zhuzhai's heart skipped a beat, and he blurted out, "My colleagues at the bank gave them to me." Yunqing said, "Wasn't it Qihuan?" Saying that, she smiled, and without waiting for Zhuzhai to answer, she went straight in. Zhuzhai was very sad when he heard this, and he sat in the car and went back with a heavy heart.

The next morning, it was only a little after ten o'clock when Qihuan called Zhuzhai soon after he arrived at the bank and asked him to go there. Zhuzhai told her that he had to wait until after work to go. Qihuan complained on the phone: "It's not okay to take a little time off to come here and say a few words to me! I have something important to tell you." Zhuzhai's heart had already been pounding when he heard Qihuan's call, and when he heard that she had something important to tell him, how could he not go? He immediately agreed, put the headset down, entrusted his colleagues to take care of things, and rushed to Qihuan's house. When he asked Little Wang's mother, she said that Qihuan hadn't gotten up yet, and Zhuzhai was very hesitant. Just as he was in trouble, Qihuan heard the sound of the two of them talking in the bedroom and asked, "Is that Mr. Xu? Please come in." Zhuzhai walked in and saw Qihuan lying in bed with her beautiful hair loose on the pillow. A quilt only covered her chest, revealing her bright red soft satin pajamas, and her two curved arms were exposed. She smiled slightly at Zhuzhai and said "I'm sorry," pointing to a chair in front of the bed and asking him to sit down. Zhuzhai saw that Qihuan's face still had the remains of last night's rouge and powder, and her skin was as white as snow. After sleeping, her face had a kind of radiant beauty, and he couldn't help but be stunned. Then he heard Qihuan say, "I'm an impatient person, and I can't hide anything in my heart. I want to ask you, was the woman sitting with you watching the play yesterday your wife?" Zhuzhai didn't expect Qihuan to ask him this question. He thought that she had asked him to come this morning just to discuss how the play was performed yesterday. Qihuan's question caught him by surprise, and he quickly replied, "No, no." Qihuan said, "Then, who is she to you?" Zhuzhai said, "She's my cousin." Qihuan said, "Ah, your cousin! Why didn't your wife go?" Zhuzhai said, "She doesn't understand opera." Qihuan said, "If she doesn't understand opera, then your cousin must be an expert." Zhuzhai said, "She graduated from Yuren University and specializes in studying lyrics and music. She is also very interested in Peking Opera." Qihuan said, "Ordinary people understand Peking Opera, and it doesn't necessarily require a specialist in lyrics and music. I gave you two tickets yesterday, originally planning for you to go with your wife. Tonight's play is Yutang Chun. I hope you and your wife can go together." Zhuzhai felt very embarrassed when he heard this. He thought to himself, how could he bring his wife, who doesn't look good, to the stage! Seeing Zhuzhai hesitating and not speaking, Qihuan said again, "Today, your wife must do me the honor of coming. If she doesn't go, it means she looks down on me."

### The American Way of Thinking

— Dao Xian

Thomas H. Wolf, a reporter for the American magazine Collier's, recently completed a trip across the American continent by bus, from New York to Seattle. The purpose of his trip was solely to meet many ordinary Americans – those who travel by bus – to inquire about the issues they think about on a daily basis, what they talk about, and what troubles and worries they have.

During the nine-day trip, over a distance of three thousand miles, Wolf encountered Americans of various occupations, religious beliefs, and ages. Most of them were starting their vacations or returning after their vacations were over, and many others were visiting relatives and friends. These people came from half of America.

Wolf waited until he had talked to all thirty or forty passengers on each bus before getting off and waiting for the next bus to come. He continued his interviews in this way. He only asked one question: "Where you are, what are the things that people are talking about and thinking about lately?" If the answer didn't provide much material, he would ask some more specific questions, such as prices, the housing shortage, domestic politics, the world situation, foreign loans, isolationism, and the United Nations, etc.

By summarizing and categorizing the many answers, Wolf obtained the current American view of themselves and the world.

The things that Americans care about the most are personal, purely local issues. People in all places are most concerned about high prices, high rents, and the lack of housing. At the same time, because prices are high, many mothers are also going out to work, and children lack maternal education. Moreover, due to the housing shortage, families are crowded together, and children are running into the streets to loaf, creating serious juvenile delinquency problems, which many people are worried about.

Most Americans do not worry that there will be an economic depression in America, but many people feel confused and dissatisfied.

Regarding other things in the United States, whether it is politics, taxes, or labor issues, people in general don't seem to pay much attention to or care about them.

In addition to the problems of prices and housing, what Americans care about most is the world situation, mainly the Soviet Union problem. Americans everywhere are paying attention to international issues, and what people talk about the most is the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Americans are constantly seeking international knowledge. They listen to the radio, and read newspapers and magazines more than before.

People in the eastern United States talk about war more; after arriving on the western plains, this topic is reduced. Although many Americans say that World War III is inevitable – and they estimate the time when the war will break out from six months to twenty-five years – most people do not truly feel that the war is coming soon. And almost everyone does not worry about the war in the future.

Wolf did not encounter anyone talking about or considering isolationism, but this does not mean that all non-isolationists agree with lending to Europe. Most Americans agree with lending to Europe, but mostly for humanitarian reasons, and on the basis of first relieving the situation in America.

This is the conclusion of Wolf's interviews. From this, we can know that the people of the United States and China are both worried about the two major problems of prices and the housing shortage. But we can also see that today, there is a very large distance between the interest that Chinese people have in the United States, and the concern that American people have for China. In Wolf's three thousand-mile interview, not a single American mentioned China!

Like Chongqing Storytelling

### Test Driving and Examining "Tickets"

— Bai Wuwen, Long Sheng Hua

It cannot be denied that Chongqing, no longer a major political and economic center, has two "mores": one is people wearing Western suits, although most look like what "Russian Three" wears, the wearers are more numerous than in Shanghai. The other is cars, although cars cannot drive down the steepest slopes in Chongqing, there are still so many cars that they seem to intentionally incline on the slopes to show off.

Confucius said: "Since I have followed after the great officers, I cannot walk on foot." It seems that cars were specially prepared for officials; Chongqing is not entirely like that. As far as I know, often sitting in the cars are a regimental commander from the Liu Xiang era, the owner of an old goods store (auction house), an unemployed dancer, a gold bill broker, etc. It seems necessary to go through the "narrative" of these people.

When cars gradually increased in number, it was in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). At that time, passionate news reporters were indignant. They would go to the front of theaters to copy down license plate numbers, and the next day publish a long article in the newspaper, also issuing a list of car owners, marked with a title saying: "A drop of gasoline is a drop of blood, squandered amidst pleasant songs and beautiful dances!"

Today, Chongqing has many more Jeeps, painted in various colors. The foreigners have all left, replaced by Chinese people, but in order to be stylish, it is necessary to carry one or several young women, "having women in the same car." It is necessary to drink enough betel nut to strike a pose, driving as if chasing a train or fleeing a moving car, otherwise it won't be like Gary Cooper. More than once, not only have they hit several rickshaws, but they have also overturned pavilions, and sped away. Because of this, the police can only stare blankly. If you add a barrier, they will simply run you over like a tank. The newspaper has already grown accustomed to seeing this.

These cars generally not only lack driving licenses, but also lack license plates. Sometimes a price tag is pasted on the glass, with the words "Test Drive" written on it. The meaning is: The car is still being tested, and we are not responsible for killing people. Who told you to come and provide me with a "test"?

When I encounter this kind of car, I don't act like a hero at all, I quickly dodge to the sidewalk, and I don't curse it as a "city tiger" or anything like that. It is said that people who encounter tigers just need to climb a tree, but who has seen a tiger knock down a big tree or a power pole? After eating people, tigers would never plausibly shirk responsibility onto the victim for crossing the center of the road, proving that they deserved to die: "accidental falls"—under the wheels.

Even if you avoid it by going to the sidewalk, if it is a rainy day, the mud on Chongqing's special asphalt road, after being impacted at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour, will spray up like a dragon spitting mist, in fan-shaped flowing arrows.

If the wronged souls who die and are injured every year in Chongqing under these circumstances are counted, it will definitely not be fewer than the heads of a demobilized brigade. This can be asserted. Addendum: Some of the drivers who caused the disaster do not run away, but stop the car, do not get out, turn around and hand the police an invoice, as if saying: "Please examine the soul-reaping ticket of the deceased!" Then they reverse the car, and open up the crowd of onlookers, taking advantage of the situation to speed away. People can only blink at its receding car.

Social Services, Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation

### Bullying the Elderly and Seizing a Will, Nephew Attempts to Seize Property

Wang Hanming asks: I have a legal question, please answer it in the newspaper. My relative, Mr. So-and-so, has one son and three daughters. My relative and one son and two daughters have all passed away. Only his wife and one married daughter remain. His wife, because of her old age, prepared a will in advance, stipulating that all houses, fields, and other fields would be inherited by her daughter, and that she would be responsible for funeral matters. Unexpectedly, this will was taken.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] Your wife's will, which was held by her nephew, can be invalidated by making a new will later. Publishing it in the newspaper and obtaining proof should be properly handled.
