Both proposals have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan and will soon complete legislative procedures.

### The Third Plenary Session Approved the Full Text of the Economic Reform Plan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Third Plenary Session, in its general meeting on the afternoon of the 24th, revised and approved the economic reform plan submitted by the Economic Review Committee. The full text is as follows:

(A) Review of the Past

Our country's economy today faces a severe crisis, which is undeniable. Upon careful examination, the greatest cause of this situation is the destructive consumption of the long-term war, which has utterly destroyed the construction projects painstakingly built in the years before the war. Moreover, our inherently weak country rose up to resist the war and struggled for eight years. Although it was fortunate enough to win, it was indeed exhausted. Our country was originally an agricultural nation. Since the Tang and Song Dynasties, scholars and officials have been accustomed to writing articles and competing for official careers. As for today's environment, although ideals have changed, the mentality and skills of most intellectuals still cannot adapt to the great era of scientific production. All constructions are waiting to be rebuilt, and the heart may be willing, but the strength is insufficient. After the victory of the War of Resistance, reconstruction became the top priority. The vitality had been damaged, and the people's strength had not recovered. Rest and recuperation were urgently needed. However, the Communist Party deliberately created chaos, benefiting the country's disintegration and social unrest, using the destruction of people's livelihood as a means and seizing political power as the goal, regarding the interests of its own party as higher than everything else, ignoring the country's survival, disregarding the people's suffering, plotting secretly, and using force to seize power by any means. This has made the current reconstruction work doubly difficult, and the glimmer of hope for recovery has been aggravated.

The above-mentioned may be inherent defects or unexpected man-made disasters. Our party, leading the revolution, has always tried to remedy its defects and overcome its difficulties in the midst of internal and external troubles. However, it has ultimately fallen short of its abilities, resulting in government measures that have not only failed to achieve significant results but have also frequently revealed shortcomings. These are described as follows:

(1) The Principle of People's Livelihood is the fundamental guideline for nation-building, and its success depends on the implementation of industrial plans. If all economic policies can be based on principles and plans to solve the people's livelihood, they will surely be effective day by day, and eventually, they can achieve the goals of "making the best use of people's talents, making the best use of land, making the best use of things, and making the best use of goods", to achieve the goal of socialization. In the past, economic measures failed to effectively implement the principles of the People's Livelihood. This is the first point.

(2) Among the factors of production, labor always comes first. China has a large population, and human resources are its advantage. Past measures have neglected the development of human resources and the utilization of materials. There was no thorough plan for how to calculate materials, how to calculate human resources, and how to guide human resources to participate in production. It failed to create an economic foundation where production exceeds consumption. This is the second point.

(3) Governance should be based on credibility. In the past, economic, financial, and monetary measures were often hastily decided and changed frequently, which reduced the people's trust in the government. This is the third point.

(4) The focus of economic policy was unclear, the financial and monetary system was not established, state-owned and private enterprises were unevenly weighted, what should be retained and what should be discarded, which should be prioritized and which should be delayed. There was a lack of clear demarcation and firm decision-making. Domestic and foreign capital observed and remained isolated, and production and construction were affected. This is the fourth point.

(5) The people's wealth leads to sufficient finances; the people's poverty leads to financial exhaustion. Therefore, the solution to financial problems should start with increasing production and enriching the national economy to be effective. In the past, there was only the illusion of a balanced budget, but the actual budget could not be balanced, and currency had to be issued. Furthermore, it was mistakenly believed that funds truly used for production were also inflation, which failed to support production with the strength of the state, and the surplus capital of the people could not be led by government plans into the right path of production and construction. Instead, it concentrated in cities, becoming speculative hot money, engaging in speculation, and hindering production. This is the fifth point.

(6) Financial policies were divorced from the needs of the vast majority of people's lives and failed to closely cooperate with economic policies to support agriculture and industry and encourage production. Most policies focused on commerce, pursuing short-term profits, resulting in the pathological state of "neglecting agriculture, perfunctorily dealing with industry, and deteriorating commerce." This is the sixth point.

(7) Selling old gold was originally intended to contract the currency and stabilize prices, but it was misused, causing gold to lead prices upward, creating market chaos. This is the seventh point.

(8) There was a lack of long-term planning and overall plans, abandoning fundamentals and pursuing trivialities, responding to emergencies in a piecemeal fashion, resulting in the depletion of the inland economy and the concentration of funds in one corner, creating an unbalanced and unstable situation. This is the eighth point. The above is an honest review. How to solve the current difficulties and how to cultivate the foundation for the future must be addressed with the right medicine and effective countermeasures must be determined.

(B) Future Strategies

China has abundant human resources and vast land. As a victorious nation, it is undertaking reconstruction work. Judging from the current economic situation, the destruction and sabotage of the Communist Party is indeed an important reason for increasing difficulties, but the hardship should not be as severe as it is today. The problem lies in whether the government has appropriate policies to increase production and cultivate people's strength. If it can handle all economic problems according to the spirit of the People's Livelihood and its principles of socialization, it should not be difficult to obtain appropriate solutions. Although the Principle of People's Livelihood has the ideal of regulating capital, in the current stage, production and construction must first seek to have it. Private wealth leads to national wealth, and abundant production leads to sufficient wealth. Therefore, state capital should be the center, leading the activity of private capital, with state-owned enterprises taking on difficult tasks and assisting private enterprises in easy tasks. Regarding attracting foreign investment and encouraging private enterprises, how to solve their difficulties and how to protect their profits, the government should clearly decide to guide and encourage them. The government should especially make a great determination and show it with facts that all measures related to finance, economy, and currency should focus on the long-term interests of the country, be cautious at the beginning, and once decided and promulgated, should not be easily changed. Special attention should be paid to enforcing the rule of law, severely punishing corruption and dereliction of duty, and cracking down on manipulation and monopolies to protect the people's rights. In this way, the government's credibility can be consolidated, and future economic policies will not be difficult to implement to the fullest extent. The main points of the strategies are briefly described as follows:

(1) Develop human resources and increase production. First, provide protection to existing production enterprises to stabilize employment and prevent unemployment. Second, gradually increase new production and construction projects with effective plans, guiding idle and unproductive human resources to participate in production. Third, encourage scientific inventions, promote labor service, to transform the social atmosphere and encourage the spirit of creating enterprises. Fourth, coordinate education with planned economy, so that the cultivation of talents and the construction of production are integrated.

(2) Increase the production of materials and stabilize prices. First, the government should issue agricultural production loans or adopt a fixed purchase method to promote the production of major agricultural raw materials such as rice, wheat, cotton, and beans, and utilize part or most of them. Second, the government must supply raw materials to manufacturers, or provide industrial production loans, or adopt a fixed purchase method to promote the production of flour, cloth, oil, sugar, fuel, and other daily necessities, and utilize part or most of them. Third, the government should issue export loans or adopt a fixed purchase method to promote the production and export of raw silk, sand, tung oil, wool, leather, tea leaves, and pig bristles to replenish foreign exchange reserves. Fourth, the government should first make planned supplies of daily necessities for the people's livelihood to officers, soldiers, public educators, and workers in production factories. In addition, surplus materials should be used to stabilize prices in urban areas so that hoarders cannot profit from scarcity, to achieve the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihood.

(3) Stabilize the currency value. First, quickly dispose of enterprises that do not need to be operated by the state, sell enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials, and consolidate tax revenues to make up for the financial shortfall in the short term and prevent currency inflation. Second, the government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the monetary system to gradually restore normalcy. Third, the monetary systems of Northeast China, Taiwan, and Xinjiang should be reorganized at the same time to make them consistent.

(4) Reform the financial system. The reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the country's economic policies, with increasing agricultural and industrial production as its main purpose. Financial institutions should have their own major specialized businesses to eliminate the phenomenon of general commercialization. Public and private banks must also be systematically distributed throughout the country to form a systematic financial network that is not concentrated in a few coastal cities, especially Shanghai. The methods are: First, the county should be the basic-level institution of the financial system, supporting the establishment of county banks to facilitate construction and cooperate with the promotion of local autonomy. County banks should follow the principle of one bank per county. In the initial stage, the county should hold 40% of the capital, and the central government 60%. When the work of county autonomy is gradually completed, the central government's capital should gradually decrease, eventually reaching a ratio of 70% for the local government and 30% for the central government. The central government should also provide specialized personnel to provide business guidance. Third, banks should be backed by the Farmers Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China, depending on the type and needs of their business. Fourth, land finance is a long-term issue. The government must designate special funds and issue land bonds to solve the problem. At an appropriate time, a special bank should be established to manage it. During the transition period, the Farmers Bank of China's land finance funds should be replenished, and business should be expanded through county banks. Fifth, the Farmers Bank of China should specialize in operating farmland water conservancy, agricultural product warehousing, transportation, processing, and land loans to facilitate farmers and support rural prosperity. Sixth, the Bank of Communications should specialize in operating industrial, mining, and transportation loans to develop industries. Seventh, the Bank of China should specialize in operating domestic and foreign trade loans and international remittance business (including overseas remittances). Eighth, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau should absorb people's savings deposits, handle small remittances, and cooperate with cooperative banks according to the principle of taking profits from the countryside and using them in the countryside to develop the rural economy.

If they need to continue to use the real estate, they should negotiate a lease agreement with the owner.

The Chinese government and people have always sympathized with the efforts of nations that have not yet achieved autonomy to seek freedom and independence. The wisdom and statesmanship shown by the leaders of the Netherlands and Indonesia in this agreement are worthy of our praise. After this agreement is fully implemented, its impact will not only be limited to the parties involved.

We sincerely expect that the conclusion of this agreement will create a new era for Indonesia, so that all parties concerned will be responsible for guaranteeing the safety of these overseas Chinese and improving their welfare. For hundreds of years, Chinese in Indonesia have made great contributions to the development of Indonesia. I would now like to urge our 300,000 compatriots in Indonesia to continue and redouble their efforts to contribute to the prosperity of the new Indonesian Republic.

### Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Welfare Meeting Approves Measures for Sending Back Refugees; Four Principles Determined for Work Relief Projects

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) and United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Social Welfare Work Conference yesterday reviewed the proposals of various subcommittee meetings in the morning and held a prescreening committee approval meeting. In the afternoon, subcommittee meetings discussed work relief projects and the repatriation of refugees and overseas Chinese. As a result, motions were put forward and passed at the plenary session held in the afternoon. The details are recorded below:

Work Relief Issues

(A) Regarding work relief issues: (A) Four principles were decided: (1) In the future, work relief methods should be used as much as possible to relieve unemployment; (2) Wages should be resolved through work relief; (3) The purpose of relief is not only to provide employment for the unemployed, but also to solve problems for refugees, and wages should be replaced with food, not because there is a shortage of food in the area, but to meet needs. (B) Two suggestions were made: (1) In the future, when using work relief methods, make as much use as possible of those who should accept work relief (referring to refugees), (2) Wages should be paid in kind or cash according to local needs.

Repatriation of Refugees

(B) Regarding the repatriation of refugees: Refugees currently in Asia are divided into five types: ordinary refugees, flood area refugees, overseas Chinese who wish to return to their original places of residence, overseas Chinese who wish to return to their homeland, and European refugees, totaling approximately 500,000. They are described separately as follows: (1) Ordinary refugees are distributed throughout China, especially in North China. In the future, after the work of CRRRA and UNRRA ends, due to various political reasons, the problem of domestic refugees will still exist. CRRRA cannot continue to be responsible, so it is proposed that the Ministry of Social Affairs cooperate with other relevant government agencies to develop in a planned manner. Due to the above reasons, the General Assembly passed a motion requesting CRRRA to cooperate with the Ministry of Social Affairs immediately to prepare for the handover in the future. (2) Flood area disaster victims: These refer to the disaster victims in the Yellow River flood area and the areas of northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanxi, especially the refugees in the Yellow River flood area, which are the most problematic, and some have been displaced for more than a year. Because the creation of the aforementioned disaster victims is related to political issues, negotiations have been conducted by CRRRA, the government, and the Chinese Communist Party, so the General Assembly did not discuss it further, but suggested that the relevant parties cooperate with CRRRA to solve this problem. (3) Overseas Chinese waiting to return to their country, UNRRA has gradually repatriated these refugees, but UNRRA must end by the end of July of this year, and this work must be completed. Therefore, the General Assembly passed a motion requesting CRRRA to jointly ask the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request the government to reconsider participating in the International Refugee Organization (the Chinese government had previously decided not to participate temporarily because the agency's funding was too large) in order to assist UNRRA in completing its work. If the government fails to participate, or the agency has not been completed when UNRRA ends (the International Refugee Agency is organized by the United Nations and has not yet been formally established), then please UNRRA continue to undertake it, or hand it over to CRRRA or other agencies to complete it. (4) Overseas Chinese who wish to return to their original places of residence, of these overseas Chinese, 15,000 wish to return to Burma and 6,000 wish to return to the Philippines, but they have not been able to do so due to various difficulties imposed by the governments of the Philippines and Burma. The General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue to negotiate with the above two governments, and UNRRA will also do its best to assist. (5) The repatriation of European refugees. The total number of European refugees is 16,000. UNRRA has repatriated 4,000, and 12,000 are still waiting to be repatriated. After UNRRA ends, it will become a problem. The General Assembly hopes that: (A) The Chinese government will join the International Refugee Organization to assist in the repatriation work and complete it, (B) The UNRRA Establishment Committee should conduct a thorough discussion.

Editorial

### A Review of the Pawnbroking Problem

Reforming the financial system is one of the key points of the Economic Reform Plan of the Third Plenary Session. This issue is extremely broad in scope. Here, we intend to raise a relatively unnoticed but crucial issue, namely the pawnbroking problem, for everyone to explore.

Pawnbroking is an old-fashioned financial institution for the common people. Those who do not qualify to deal with banks and money shops can only rely on pawnbroking as a means of providing financing for emergencies. Now that cooperatives are gradually being promoted, credit cooperatives, while also undertaking deposit and lending tasks, only lend to members according to regulations. Their limits, collateral, procedures, etc., are also quite strict, which is not welcomed by ordinary people who are accustomed to convenience. Therefore, in the current stage of society, the pawnbroking system is undoubtedly still needed by the masses. Local social affairs agencies are currently promoting the public pawnbroking system. Article 25 of the Ministry-promulgated Pawnbroking Industry Regulations also stipulates incentive measures for legally operating pawnbrokers, which proves the importance of the pawnbroking position.

So, how should these pawnbrokers be improved? We believe that the first key point should be to reduce the interest rate and change high-interest loans to low-interest loans. Taking Shanghai as an example, pre-war pawnbroking was roughly divided into two types: (1) Mortgages, which had a larger scope, with interest rates of no more than 2%, and a term of up to eighteen months; (2) Pledges, which had a smaller scope, higher interest rates, and shorter terms. The high-interest loans commonly referred to as usurious exploitation refer to this type.

During the late period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, these high-interest loans had risen to as high as 5 jiao and 6.5 li, and the term was shortened to one month. After the victory, it was extended to two months. The monthly interest rate was still 5 jiao and 6.5 li for the first month, and 4 jiao and 3.65 li for the second month. Because the handling fee of 0.15% was usually collected in advance together with the first month, and had to be added to the principal, the interest was compounded. Later, after repeated supervision by the local competent authorities to reduce the interest rate, and after some members of the Municipal Council proposed urging this, it was only finalized after several months. It was implemented from January of this year, and the term is still two months, with a uniform monthly interest rate reduced to 3 jiao and 6 fen, including a monthly interest rate of 2 jiao and 5 fen, a warehouse rent of 4 fen, and a handling fee of 7 fen. This handling fee is not included in the principal.

When the interbank lending rate in the industrial and commercial sectors reached around 2 jiao, everyone already felt that the burden was too heavy and collectively requested relief. The government and financial authorities also felt that it was inappropriate to sit idly by, and actively undertook various low-interest loans to provide relief. However, the general public still has to pay high-interest loans of 3 jiao and 6 fen per month, which is certainly a very unreasonable thing. It is heard that the municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to further supervise the reduction of pawnbroking interest rates. The Pawnbroking Industry Management Regulations also stipulate that the warehouse rent fee is only allowed to be charged at 0.2% per month, and the insurance fee is also 0.2%, and all other irregular fees are strictly prohibited. As for the pawnbroking interest rates charged, the local trade associations are responsible for drafting them themselves, submitting them to the competent authorities for approval, and reporting them to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. The supervision is quite strict. For the sake of the welfare of the general public, we naturally hope that it will be realized soon.

The question is, to what extent can the pawnbroking interest rate actually be reduced in practice? This is a matter of fact, not something that can be solved by empty words. Because the boundaries between mortgages and pledges have long been eliminated. Their capital is usually only a few million yuan. Of the more than 700 pawnbrokers in the city, it is said that only one-tenth have dealings with banks and money shops. The remaining working capital is nothing more than borrowing and absorbing deposits, and the monthly interest rate often has to be as high as around 2 jiao. Coupled with all the expenses, taxes, profits, etc., in order to barely maintain and avoid losses, their request for a pawnbroking interest rate of 3 jiao and 6 fen is certainly reasonable to some extent.

Therefore, to improve the people's finance and reduce their burden, the most important thing is to raise funds for them and reduce the interest rate on their loans. Because, according to their own calculations, this pawnbroking interest rate of 3 jiao and 6 fen includes a borrowing interest rate of 2 jiao and 5 fen, a warehouse rent of 4 fen, and a handling fee of 7 fen. If the borrowing interest rate can be reduced by some means, then the pawnbroking interest rate can naturally be reduced proportionally. For example, the municipal public pawnbroker only charges an interest rate of 2 fen, and the term is as long as six months. However, it is a public welfare nature, not a profit-making nature. On the one hand, it can subsidize expenses, and on the other hand, it obtains low-interest overdrafts from the Municipal Bank, so it can support itself. Commercial pawnbrokers, however, are profit-making in nature, and of course it is not appropriate to force them to lose money. Therefore, providing low-interest financing is the only effective way to reduce pawnbroking interest rates and benefit the people.

So, from where should these low-interest funds be provided? The City Council has passed a resolution urging the Municipal Bank to take on this responsibility. The Municipal Bank is a bank owned by the city, and it should naturally take on this responsibility for the welfare of the citizens. Even if there are surplus state-owned banks and money shops, after undertaking low-interest loans for industry and commerce, we also hope that they will share some of the profits and allow the general public to get some benefits. There are currently only more than 700 pawnbrokers in the city. If half of them apply for overdrafts, with an overdraft amount of 10 million yuan per household, the total amount would only be more than 3.5 billion yuan, which is not even as much as the loan amount of a large company. Moreover, the overdraft of the pawnbroking industry is gradually withdrawn on a daily basis, which is different from the general commercial firms that take the entire batch to buy goods. Therefore, the burden on the banking side does not seem to be severe. The problem is that the pawnbroking industry originally belongs to small-scale operations and cannot come up with reliable collateral, and it is not easy to find commercial firms to act as guarantors. All the goods in stock have to be sold to the suppliers when they are due, which is not convenient for assigning as collateral. All the account books are also mostly old-fashioned, and it is also felt to be very inconvenient during the audit. The bank may consider these conditions to be too unsuitable. However, these conditions are ultimately technical problems and do not seem difficult to overcome. For example, group joint guarantees, sharing the responsibility of repayment, also seems to be a way.

The main purpose of our raising this issue is, of course, to facilitate the people and reduce their burden. Once the people's finance is loosened, it will also affect the general interest rate and ease the momentum of high-interest loans. In the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, there are also the following sentences: "The goal of the Principle of the People's Livelihood is to improve the living standards of the majority of the people and enable the people of the whole country to enjoy an adequate livelihood. Therefore, all economic policies of the government must be targeted at the majority of the people." The so-called majority of the people naturally refers to the general public. They are currently groaning under high-interest loans. Leaving aside how their living standards should be improved, the pain they suffer from the exploitation of heavy interest is undoubtedly something that should be relieved. Otherwise, "financial policy is divorced from the living needs of the vast majority of the people" would not be the main theme of the Third Plenary Session's Economic Reform Plan.

### Peace Conference with Germany Should Be Convened by the Five Great Powers; Marshall Makes a Suggestion; All German People Have the Obligation to Fulfill the Peace Treaty

[US News Agency, Moscow, 26th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall made a suggestion to the Council of Foreign Ministers today that the four major powers plus China invite all the Allied countries that previously "fought against Germany" to hold a peace conference on the German issue before the final draft of the peace treaty with Germany is completed. Marshall proposed to the Council of Foreign Ministers that such countries be invited to participate in the conference as soon as the preparatory work has "made sufficient progress," and that all countries be given the opportunity to freely express their opinions on the German issue. He also suggested that "responsible representatives of Germany should also be given the opportunity to present their views at the conference." He said that the four major powers would draft the text of the peace treaty with Germany based on the recommendations passed by a two-thirds majority vote at the conference, and then submit the finally drafted treaty text to the countries that previously fought against Germany for signature.

Marshall also suggested that the German Constitution should include a clause "expressly stipulating that all powers in the Constitution should be followed and implemented in accordance with the peace treaty." If so, "then in addition to adopting the Constitution, this clause would often make the German people have the obligation to accept the peace treaty, and all German people should have the obligation to fulfill the peace treaty."

The Council of Foreign Ministers did not reach a general agreement on Marshall's suggestion. Bevin and Bidault both supported China as one of the signatory countries of the peace treaty with Germany. Molotov has agreed to consider this opinion. Bidault agreed with Marshall's constitutional clause suggestion, but Bevin expressed doubts about whether this move was legal. He also did not express support for convening a peace conference with Germany as soon as possible. Molotov believed that the peace treaty with Germany should be signed by a German government, otherwise the strength of the treaty would inevitably be weakened. Molotov agreed to allow German representatives to attend the peace conference with Germany to provide opinions, but Bidault firmly opposed it.

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: The US Secretary of State recently categorically denied the Soviet Union's accusation that Britain and the United States had enriched themselves by obtaining 10 billion yuan in German reparations. Marshall presented official documents to the Council of Foreign Ministers, proving that the total amount of reparations that the United States had obtained was less than 275 million yuan. According to reports, a week ago, Molotov accused Britain and the United States of opposing the Soviet Union's demand for 10 billion yuan in reparations, while they themselves had obtained more than 10 billion yuan.

[French News Agency, Moscow, 25th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers also discussed the issue of Albania's participation in the Advisory Committee and the Intelligence Committee at today's meeting. France and the Soviet Union still advocated that Albania should participate in these committees, while Britain and the United States still expressed their objections. The Soviet representative emphasized that Albania has the right to obtain German reparations. The US representative proposed that countries such as Iraq and South America, which had declared war on Germany but did not actually fight, should also participate in these committees. The four foreign ministers did not reach an agreement on this issue and then accepted Foreign Minister Bidault's suggestion to return it to the four foreign ministers' meeting for discussion.

[French News Agency, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has notified the Italian government that the Soviet government supports Italian representatives attending the Council of Foreign Ministers to explain their opinions on the peace treaty with Germany. According to well-informed sources, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza expressed his satisfaction after receiving the note from Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, but has not yet decided on the manner in which Italy should participate in the Council of Foreign Ministers.

### Key Clauses of the German Peace Treaty: US and Soviet Union to Make Concessions, US Considers Reducing Occupation Troops in Germany

[United Press International, Moscow, 26th] According to reliable sources, the United States and the Soviet Union appear to be willing to make significant concessions regarding the key clauses of the German peace treaty. However, officials are uncertain whether these concessions will be substantial enough for the current Foreign Ministers' conference to reach an agreement on major disputes. It is reported that the US is considering allowing the Soviet Union to extract substantial reparations from Germany's current industrial production for several years, provided that it does not increase the tax burden on American citizens. Western diplomats believe that continuing to receive reparations is the Soviet Union's primary objective. If their desire can be adequately satisfied in this regard, they will likely be willing to modify their other demands. There are currently no specific indications of possible Soviet concessions. However, British Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed considerable optimism about the situation after a private meeting with Soviet Premier Stalin yesterday, which is quite significant.

[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] It is understood that the US delegation to the Foreign Ministers' conference will submit a formal resolution instructing the Berlin Allied Control Council to reduce the number of occupation troops in the four sectors. The intention is to reduce the consumption of local resources by the occupation troops, allowing Germany to have more goods available for export and to achieve self-sufficiency as soon as possible. The US suggests that the Allied Control Council determine how many occupation troops are needed to maintain the security of the four sectors for one year, starting from July 1, 1947. The Allied Control Council should submit an investigation report to the current Foreign Ministers' conference by June 1st. In addition, Marshall will present a memorandum on German democratization and German industry at today's meeting. The memorandum on German industry clearly states that investments in any German war industry cannot expect to yield returns, while only investments in German peaceful industries can be rewarded. The submission of this memorandum is intended to respond to criticism of American capitalist investment in Germany.

### US Definition of Democracy Under Close Scrutiny in Moscow

[United Press International, Moscow Airmail] US Secretary of State Marshall gave a definition of the American concept of democracy at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, causing this ancient Greek word to be closely examined in Moscow. Some advocate that the Soviet Union should also provide a definition, believing that the key to making peace lies in being able to accept a definition. If a Soviet citizen and an American citizen, such as the key figures of Marshall and Molotov in the Foreign Ministers Conference, lived in the same room and discussed democracy, it could be discovered that although they spoke the same language, what they were talking about might be completely different. According to Marshall, a society where law-abiding citizens are denied the right to work or have their lives, liberty, and happiness deprived is not considered free. Marshall also strongly advocated for freedom of elections, freedom of labor unions, freedom of the press, radio, film, theater, and music, and civic freedom, considering them extremely important in the American concept of a democratic society. For two consecutive days, Soviet newspapers mildly attacked Marshall's definition, citing the situation in Greece and the status of African Americans to demonstrate the shortcomings of the American way of practicing democracy.

### UN Observes Anniversary in the US, Truman Sends Congratulations to Lie, Reaffirms US Confidence in UN Organization

[Our Paper Report] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: President Truman announced at a press conference today that the aid package for Greece and Turkey is expected to be quickly passed by Congress. Detailed information will be released by US representative Austin at the Security Council.

### Significant Progress Made in Discussions on Austrian Peace Treaty

[United Press International, Moscow, 25th] The progress made in today's discussions on the Austrian issue at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference was greater than in previous meetings. A drafting committee has been formed to finalize the form of the peace treaty so that it can be submitted to the four powers for discussion on Saturday. It was also agreed to discuss difficult economic clauses tomorrow, and the Soviet Union has agreed to submit its proposals regarding the refugees in Austria. According to Gusev of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's proposal on this issue is divided into two parts: one concerns the withdrawal of Germans from Austria, and the second concerns the complete withdrawal of its refugees within six months after the implementation of the peace treaty.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers met today to discuss the Austrian peace treaty and immediately decided to establish a four-power expert committee, with one member from each country, to draft a report on the military clauses of the Austrian peace treaty for submission to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. In addition, the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers have completed drafting a report on economic issues.

### Security Council Vetoes British-Albanian Dispute, Soviet Union Exercises Veto Power, Britain Plans to Submit Case to International Court

[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] The Soviet Union suddenly exercised its veto power today when the United Nations Security Council voted by a majority to support Britain's accusation against Albania for laying mines. This is the first time the council has used its veto power since September 20 last year when the Soviet Union overturned the US's initial proposal to conduct an on-site investigation of the Balkan situation. The amended resolution proposed by Britain demanded recognition that laying mines in peacetime without notifying other countries is "inhumane" and that Albania had prior knowledge of the mines. During the voting, the case was passed by a vote of seven to two, with Australia abstaining and Britain unable to vote due to its status as the plaintiff. The opposing votes came from the Soviet Union and Poland. However, with the Soviet Union having exercised its veto power, the Albanian incident is likely to be shelved in the Security Council. According to British sources, Britain is now planning to propose that the case be transferred to the International Court of Justice for handling.

### Guerrilla Infighting Erupts During Greek Independence Day Celebrations

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 25th] Guerrilla infighting erupted in the Lidochki region today as the Greek people celebrated their 126th Independence Day. Some guerrillas wanted to surrender to government forces, resulting in a conflict with another group, which resulted in twenty deaths. Athens celebrated Independence Day today with a twenty-one-gun salute, national flags flying everywhere, military bands marching through the streets, King George II inspecting the troops, and Archbishop Damaskinos delivering a speech, calling on the people to unite and safeguard national interests and beliefs.

### Trusteeship Council Formally Inaugurated, US and Soviet Union Brewing New Differences, Lie Delivers Important Political Speech

[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] At the opening of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, UN Secretary-General Lie delivered a speech with very solemn wording. In addition to implicitly referring to the US aid plan for Greece and Turkey as hindering the UN's position, he stated that the UN will "soon" discuss the Palestinian issue. He revealed that the US will explain its anti-communist policy of aiding Greece and Turkey when the Security Council convenes on Friday, and the Soviet Union may also take the opportunity to formally criticize the US's motives for the first time. After briefly outlining the organization of the Trusteeship Council, Lie stated, "New Guinea, Ruanda-Urundi, Tanganyika, French Cameroon, Western Samoa, British Togoland and Cameroon are all now under the Trusteeship System. Certain League of Nations Mandated Territories such as Nauru, Southwest Africa, Palestine, and the Former Japanese Mandated Islands in the Pacific, have not yet been placed under the Trusteeship System."

[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations is preparing to cope with new differences between the United States and the Soviet Union again today, and it is possible that the Soviet Union will make its first formal criticism of the United States' aid program for Greece and Turkey. The Soviet Union's attention is drawn for many reasons, due to the fact that the United States has long been preparing for the following major developments. First, the United States is preparing to explain to the Security Council why it provides $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey as a means of preventing communism, without notifying the United Nations. Second, when United Nations Secretary-General Lie establishes the Trusteeship Council, he plans to deliver an opening speech criticizing the United States' obstructive actions towards the United Nations. Third, until the last moment, the Soviet Union still makes other members of the United Nations uncertain whether it will participate in the Trusteeship Council, one of the major organs of the world organization. Lie, heeding the advice of some of his assistants, plans to speak in moderate terms when the Trusteeship Committee meets, and in advance he will largely publicize his opening speech as an "important political speech." According to sources close to the United Nations, Lie's original plan to use the US policy toward Greece and Turkey as the theme of his speech has been replaced by indirect remarks. However, United Nations Secretary-General Lie has not completely abandoned his established position, that is, emphasizing that the United Nations will have no hope of success unless all its member states submit all international problems to it for resolution. The Soviet Union is the only one of the ten countries on the Trusteeship Council that has not pre-designated its representative. It will open its United Nations to the world, promising to bring a new plan to nearly 25.9 million un-independent people. The Soviet Union's refusal to participate will undoubtedly severely harm the United Nations' overly ambitious trusteeship plan.

### Atomic Energy Commission Meeting Ends Without Result

[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a closed meeting on the 25th to draft a detailed plan to control atomic energy, but disputes immediately arose when discussing how to proceed. The United States believes that various countries have been subjected to some interference from within and demanded that the commission begin drafting an agreement to stipulate the powers of the international control organization. Soviet representative Gromyko objected, insisting that his thirteen amendments to the "Baruch Plan" should be discussed first. Gromyko's amendments advocate restricting the powers of international regulatory agencies and reserving the veto power for the five powers on the matter of punishing violations. Syria supported the Soviet Union's position, while Australia supported the US view. After three hours of heated debate, the original Energy Commission adjourned and scheduled to meet again on the 30th of this month. [Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 25th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet on the 28th of this month to discuss the issue of placing the islands formerly mandated to Japan in the Pacific Ocean under the sole trusteeship of the United States.

### Rumors of Bevin Considering Resignation to Take Charge of Economic Reconstruction

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] "The News Chronicle" reported today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is seriously considering resigning. If the resignation is realized, Prime Minister Attlee will likely ask Bevin to personally lead the government's economic recovery plan. At that time, Bevin will become the director of the economic plan, and his work will ensure that the plan is strictly implemented, regardless of any obstacles from labor and management. Bevin was the person who mobilized the country after the Dunkirk defeat, and there is no doubt that he has a plan in mind for the huge task of mobilizing in peacetime. The most likely successor to the Foreign Secretary is Finance Minister Dalton, and the vacancy of the Finance Minister will be filled by Commercial Minister Cripps.

[United Press International, London, 25th] It is widely rumored here today that the Attlee Labor Cabinet, facing a worsening economic crisis, is prepared to dissolve Parliament and order a re-election. This statement is mostly seen in conservative newspapers and has been denied by officials.

### Eisenhower Speaks, Says US Should Maintain Strength

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] US Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower said in a speech at the National Press Club today that no country dares to wantonly launch a world war at present, but this does not mean that war cannot break out. For example, the Venice Giulia incident occurred when drafting the Italian peace treaty, and this fact is enough to cause war. Therefore, you should support the United States in maintaining its current military strength.

### Comparison of US and Soviet Air Force Strengths

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] This question is often researched, and as a result of official and non-official records, it is known that the Soviet Union currently has more military aircraft than the Heavenly Kingdom. A comparison of the air forces of the United States and the Soviet Union is as follows: The Soviet Union has 16,000 aircraft of all types, most of which are fighter planes. The United States has 13,000 aircraft for combat, of which more than 5,000 belong to the Army Air Corps, and 3,000 are Navy or Marine Corps aircraft, carried on aircraft carriers or based on land. The strength of the Soviet Navy is still weak, and its naval air force only occupies an unimportant position. The above figures do not include reserve air forces. Although the preparedness of all reserve aircraft in the United States varies, the number is similar to that of regular air force fleets. The number of Soviet reserve air force is unknown. As for aircraft production, there is no way to compare due to the lack of information on the Soviet Union's current production capacity and goals. However, according to air force strategists, the Soviet Union has abandoned its plan to build a strong navy except for submarines, so it can transfer shipbuilding materials and manpower to aircraft production. This factor is very important and should be paid attention to.

### Greece Applies for Loan from International Bank

[Reuters, Athens, 28th] A Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed today that Greece has applied to the International Bank for a loan of $150 million to $200 million to help Greece's reconstruction.

### US Ambassador to Warsaw Resigns, Resignation Approved

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] The White House announced that US Ambassador to Poland Lane submitted his resignation, which has been approved by President Truman. The Polish government's disregard for its international obligations is the reason why Ambassador Lane resigned. The resignation reads: "I have tried my best to advise the Polish government to abide by the provisions stipulated in the Yalta Agreement, but the Polish general election is still not free, and the general election is made nominal with terror, violence, and threats. The Polish government's disregard for its international obligations can be seen from this. Under these circumstances, I am unable to promote US-Polish relations, so I request resignation."

### US Congressman Demands Recall of MacArthur for One Month

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] Republican Congressman Van Zandt introduced a bill in the House of Representatives today, requesting President Truman to recall MacArthur for at least one month to discuss the Far East situation at a joint session of the House and Senate. According to Van Zandt, MacArthur's opinions on issues such as "national security, foreign forces infiltrating, and moral decline" have the effect of stabilizing the American people.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 26th] Regarding the previous report that Washington will summon the military commander back to the country for consultations, sources familiar with the matter said today that the Allied Headquarters has not yet received this information and said that President Truman would not make this request. MacArthur himself has repeatedly stated that he hopes to stay in Tokyo until after the peace treaty is signed.

### The "Hai Min" Ship Arrives in Shanghai After Repairing Damage

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Hai Min" ship, which collided with the naval gunboat "Fu Bo" near Xiamen, causing the gunboat to sink, arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. It is now docked near the Santai Wharf in Dongjiadu. The "Hai Min" ship only had its bow water tank damaged, which was repaired in Xiamen. More than ten representatives from the First Naval Base Command in Shanghai, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Ministry of Transportation, and nautical experts boarded the ship after it docked. They summoned the captain and passenger representatives to investigate the incident. Our reporter also boarded the ship to interview Captain Dai Rulin, passenger Zheng Guiren, and Lieutenant Jiao Dexiao, the only surviving engineer from the "Fu Bo" gunboat.

Lieutenant Jiao is physically strong, but still appears exhausted. He floated in the water for four hours before being rescued. He recounted the incident as follows: On the night of the 18th and 19th, he heard a loud crash in his sleep. At first, he thought the ship had hit a reef. He quickly grabbed his life jacket, opened his cabin door, and ran to the deck. He saw the stern of the ship beginning to sink.

All Officers and Soldiers Tragically Drowned

At that time, all the officers and soldiers of the ship had gathered on the deck. The captain was signaling the "Hai Min" ship for help while starting to lower the lifeboats. The ship continued to sink rapidly. The stern was completely submerged within a minute, and the bow sank even faster. In an instant, the water was near the top of the ship. He tried to walk out from the bridge and jump into the sea, but the water had already covered the top. Fortunately, he was a skilled swimmer and struggled for a minute before floating to the surface. However, he had already swallowed two mouthfuls of water. The wind and waves were very strong, and there were many other officers and soldiers floating on the sea, calling for help. After about half an hour, the "Hai Min" ship shone a searchlight, but it was far away and did not immediately come to rescue them. He only saw it slowly moving, and it was unclear if it was trying to approach and rescue them. What was certain was that the ship did not move far away after that. After another half hour, a buoy floated next to him. This buoy was truly his savior. At that time, other officers and soldiers floating on the sea had succumbed to exhaustion and drowned. Finally, the "Hai Min" ship spotted him holding onto the buoy, and he was lucky to be the only survivor of the tragedy. The "Fu Bo" gunboat carried more than 160 officers and soldiers, including 20 cadets. These cadets were recently admitted high school graduates around the age of twenty. Their studies were not completed, and their lives were lost, which is truly unfortunate.

Passengers Expressed Dissatisfaction

The reporter then met with passenger Zheng Guiren, an employee of the Shanghai Materials Office of the Ministry of Transportation. He strongly criticized the "Hai Min" ship captain for his dereliction of duty. He claimed that the "Fu Bo" gunboat was clearly visible obstructing the path before the collision, even in the middle of the night, but the captain refused to stop the ship. After the collision, Zheng went to the bow and saw the warship being hit and tilting upwards, slowly sinking. However, the "Hai Min" ship did not immediately stop to rescue them, but continued to move forward and flee. When passengers asked why they were not rescuing them, they were told to mind their own business. It was not until 2:00 AM that they returned to the scene of the accident. They saw two or three people floating in the water calling for help, but the captain still refused to rescue them immediately, delaying the opportunity and only rescuing Jiao Dexiao. He concluded by saying that all the passengers on the ship were very dissatisfied with the captain. Moreover, the "Hai Min" ship could have arrived in Shanghai the day before, but it went off course when it was 120 degrees away from Shanghai, causing it to arrive only yesterday evening.

Captain's Written Report

Captain Dai Rulin looked dejected. When he met the reporter, he stammered and only showed the written report he submitted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which stated: "The 'Hai Min' ship was en route from Xiamen to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 18th. At 0:07 AM on the 19th, while passing the Ocksen Light Honse lighthouse at a true bearing of 58 degrees, we saw a ship's mast light and green sidelight at 40 degrees on the port side of our ship. At the time, our ship believed that the other ship was showing a green light and sailing from northwest to southeast. According to the maritime collision avoidance regulations, our ship had no responsibility to avoid the route. Therefore, we maintained our original course. At 0:12 AM, we saw that the other ship had not avoided the route and was getting closer. Therefore, our ship immediately sounded one whistle and steered hard to starboard while reversing the engine. Because the other ship still came head-on, it collided with the bow of our ship at 0:15 AM. The other ship was severely damaged and sank within minutes. Our ship immediately stopped and patrolled the area, making every effort to rescue them until 4:20 AM, rescuing the other ship's engineer, Jiao Dexiao. Our ship continued to search until 12:00 PM on the 19th. Because we felt that there was no discovery of any people or objects floating on the water in the surrounding area, and the water tank in the bow of our ship was broken, with water reaching over 17 feet, we decided to sail near Xiamen for temporary repairs for the safety of our ship. According to Jiao Dexiao, the rescued engineer of the other ship, the other ship was the Chinese Navy gunboat 'Fu Bo', sailing from Fuzhou to Taiwan shoal."

### Chairman of the Fuel Control Committee Discusses Coal Allocation Procedures: Coal for Factories and Civilian Use Was Reviewed by the Committee; No Response Planned Regarding Cases Reported in the Press

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Control Committee (FCC), met with a reporter from this newspaper yesterday to explain the FCC's coal allocation procedures. He stated that the FCC prioritizes coal allocation in five areas: (1) Railways. (2) Public utilities, in the following order: (a) Beijing and Shanghai, (b) the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou line, (c) Hankou, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo. (3) Ships, in the following order: (a) military and government, (b) commercial vessels. (4) Factories, (a) state-owned, (b) private. (5) Civilian coal use, allocated by the Coal Industry Association. The FCC has never interrupted the main coal allocations for the first three items under any circumstances. However, in the past two months, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, the Qinhuangdao port was frozen for over a month and a half, riots occurred in Taiwan, and the original Zichuan and Boyou mines in Qingdao were lost. Therefore, coal allocation in February and March relied on the FCC's reserves. He stated that the main reason for the establishment of the FCC was the shortage and uneven distribution of coal. Because of the reduced coal supply in the past two months, and the inability to reduce coal allocation for the first three priority items, the coal allocation for items four and five had to be reduced.

Association Responsible for Transportation and Investigation

Regarding the method of coal allocation, except for the first three main items which are directly allocated by the FCC, the FCC staff has never had direct contact with factories in the other coal allocation principles. The allocation method is that each coal-consuming industry association compiles the quantity requested by each factory, which is first reviewed and approved by each association and then sent to the FCC. The FCC then approves the allocated quantity based on the monthly coal supply. After approval, the quantity and price are notified to each association and the Coal Industry Association, which is responsible for transportation and for investigating and reporting on two points: (1) Whether the factory is using coal, and (2) Whether the factory is operating. If anything is not in compliance, the FCC will immediately stop the allocation upon notification from the Coal Industry Association. The cases reported in the press have not been finalized, and there are official documents to prove it, so the FCC does not intend to respond. However, the FCC is constantly striving to improve the procedures for coal allocation, and hopes that the Coal Industry Association will continue to assist with the coal allocation inspection responsibilities and provide guidance.

Increased Coal Supply Expected Next Month

He also stated that the coal supply in January was 110,000 tons, 70,000 tons in February, and 120,000 tons this month. However, the coal allocation for the first three priority items alone requires 180,000 tons per month. The coal supply in April is expected to improve, as Huludao in Northeast China has thawed, and it is estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 tons can be supplied each month. Order has also been restored in Taiwan, and a small amount of coal can be exported. Therefore, it is hoped that in the next month, some coal can be allocated to private factories and civilian use, and the allocation method will continue to be improved.

### Detailed Account of Central Bank Employees Purchasing Gold: 46 Employees in Total, the Largest Purchase Was 300 Taels

Regarding the purchase of gold by employees of the Central Bank during the gold rush, it is understood that after the gold rush incident, the Shanghai Economic Inspection Team confiscated the account books of the five gold shops that were allocated gold by the Central Bank. Among them, in the account book of Taikang Runjin Gold Shop, it was discovered that gold was purchased on behalf of Central Bank employees under the name of Wang Li, a total of ten times, totaling 97 bars. The bank's audit department reported this and summoned the manager of Taikang Runjin Gold Shop. It was found that Wang Li was an employee of Taikang Runjin, who was usually assigned to handle gold collection and payment at the Central Bank. Central Bank employees occasionally entrusted her to buy gold on their behalf. Because Wang Li handled the transactions, the account was listed under the name of Wang Li. The introduction was mostly done by Wang Yuanqing and Liu Maodi, deputy directors of the Cashier Department of the Central Bank's Business Bureau. Later, it was discovered that Wang Songtao, an agent of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, had purchased two gold bars in the account book of Tongfengyu. The quantity of gold purchased by other employees was listed separately by Taikang Runjin Gold Shop and the handlers, but most of them were small amounts of one or two taels and three or five taels. The largest purchase was 30 bars purchased by Huang Dafu, a clerk in the Business Bureau, on behalf of his relatives and friends. After verification, it was confirmed to be true. After the free purchase and sale of gold, the purchase of gold by Central Bank employees was no different from that of ordinary people and did not violate the law. However, because the bank had previously issued a notice stating that employees should not handle funds on behalf of others during office hours, Wang Songtao, Wang Yuanqing, Liu Maodi, Huang Dafu and other four people were deemed to have violated the bank's rules and were dismissed. Other employees were given warnings or demerits because the amounts were very small and were considered savings. Outsiders expressed admiration for President Zhang's determination to rectify the bank's discipline. However, most employees sympathized and regretted that Wang Songtao, Wang Yuanqing, and others had been serving the bank for many years, were known for their diligence, and had received severe punishment for purchasing gold on behalf of others.

It is also learned that the names and amounts of gold purchased by the bank's colleagues are as follows:

Wang Songtao (agent) 20 taels, Li Zhuo (self) 40 taels
Hu Yaozong (self) 10 taels, Cai Yanzhi (self) 20 taels

### First Person Executed for Drug Offenses: Xu Guanghe Executed by Firing Squad; Taken to the Execution Ground Yesterday Morning and Died with One Shot

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Local Court executed a drug offender named Xu Guanghe by firing squad at 9:00 AM yesterday. This is the first person to be executed for drug offenses in Shanghai since the victory.

On May 29 last year, the City Police Department cracked down on a drug den in Caishi Street, seized eight bags of heroin, and arrested five drug offenders, including Xu Guanghe, Ji Shenghua, Zhang Agen, Li Erdou, and Han Zhengxiang, who were sent to the Local Court for trial. Initially, Judge Shen Tianbao sentenced them to 12 years in prison. Xu Guanghe and the other four appealed to the High Court. After deliberation, the High Court ruled that Xu Guanghe was selling drugs and changed the sentence to death in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium and Drug Prohibition. The sentences of the other three offenders, Ji Shenghua and others, were changed to three years in prison in accordance with Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the same regulations. The death sentence of Xu Guanghe was approved by the Ministry of Justice. On the 20th of this month, the Shanghai High Court received Execution Order No. 6452 from Beijing and ordered the Local Procuratorate to carry out the execution.

At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Prosecutor Fu Bang of the Criminal Execution Office of the Local Procuratorate, accompanied by bailiffs Huang Rongchang, Deputy Police Chief, and Squad Leader Xu Doulin, went to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison to retrieve Xu Guanghe. Prosecutor Fu verified his identity and informed him that he was ordered to be executed and asked if he had any last words. Xu changed his expression upon hearing that he was to be executed and replied: "I am a Shanghai native, 23 years old this year. My father, Xu Fushou, and my brother, Xu Guangliang, are at home. Please notify them to collect the body. I have nothing else to say." He was immediately escorted to the execution ground, where Deputy Squad Leader Wang Xingran executed him with one shot. He died instantly at 9:00 AM.

### Hongqiao Airport Will Become an International Civil Aviation Station; The Proposal to Build an Educational Zone Was Not Approved

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the proposal to use Hongqiao Airport to build a secondary education zone in Shanghai, named the Zhongzheng Cultural Zone, to commemorate the Chairman's 60th birthday, the City Council's first general meeting and the Council's Education Committee repeatedly passed resolutions urging the City Government to actively acquire land and begin construction. It is learned that the City Government has received a response from the Executive Yuan stating that it could not be approved. The Executive Yuan replied to the City Council, stating: According to the Ministry of Transportation, Shanghai has only two civil aviation airports, Longhua and Hongqiao. With the increasing development of civil aviation, Longhua Airport is insufficient to meet the needs of the Shanghai area. In addition, Hongqiao Airport is unobstructed on all sides, and all relevant parties believe that it is most suitable for use as an international civil aviation station. The Ministry of Transportation is currently planning to build it into an international civil aviation airport, and the Civil Aviation Administration will begin construction this year. There are four airports in Shanghai. Jiangwan and Dachang are for military use, Longhua is designated for civil use, and Hongqiao Airport is currently largely abandoned. The area covers 2,513 mu, of which 267 mu were requisitioned by the Shanghai County Government by order of the Provincial Government in 1921 to be used as an airport. 890 mu were requisitioned by the Shanghai Municipal Government in 1934 to expand the airport. Another 1,256 mu were occupied by the enemy army during the occupation and have not been formally requisitioned. Since the City Council decided to build a secondary education zone there, dozens of private secondary schools have requested to the Education Bureau to participate in the construction of school buildings in the zone. The high expectations of all parties can be imagined.

### Chen Bofan's Escape Case: Guarantors Re-examined; Deny Facilitating Escape; Defense Lawyers Number Twelve

[Our Newspaper's Report] The traitor Chen Bofan once served as a member of the puppet Central Executive Committee, director of the puppet Central Political Committee's Foreign Affairs Special Committee, and deputy director of the puppet Daily Necessities Control Association. He was previously sentenced by the High Court to one year and three months of imprisonment and has already been released after serving his sentence. When his sentence expired, the Chief Prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office ordered Chen to find two reputable business guarantors. Merchants Zhang Benda and Kong Runjiu provided bail to release Chen. Subsequently, the High Court discovered new evidence of Chen Bofan's crime in the case, and in February dispatched two bailiffs to Zhang Benda's residence to arrest Chen Bofan. Unexpectedly, Zhang delayed the bailiffs while notifying Chen's family. Chen's mother, Chen Songshi, his younger brother Chen Nairong, his uncle Chen Kang, and his girlfriend Shen Qi, among others, devised a plan to hide Chen. Chen Kang drove Chen away from Liu's residence at 18 Yongkang Road, and Chen Bofan disappeared without a trace. After the incident, the High Prosecutor's Office immediately launched an investigation. The results confirmed that Zhang Benda, Kong Runjiu, Dong Nai, Dong Weishi, Shen Qi, and the fugitive Chen Kang were suspected of violating Article 6 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, which prohibits concealing and facilitating the escape of traitors. Therefore, they were prosecuted according to the law. Yesterday morning, the High Court re-interrogated the five defendants, Zhang Benda, etc. The defendants hired as many as twelve lawyers, including Zhang Shiliu. The lawyers' seats were fully occupied. The defendants all denied having facilitated Chen Bofan's escape. The court hearing lasted for a long time, and the case was adjourned for further investigation.

### Central Pharmaceutical Experiment Center: UNRRA Equipment to Arrive in May

[Our Newspaper's Report] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) agreed last year to allocate pharmaceutical machinery, hygiene equipment, and penicillin manufacturing machines, with a total value of US$2.6 million, to the Central Biochemical Pharmaceutical Experiment Center. Due to the reduction of restrictions on the export of machinery from the United States, Director Yang Yongnian of the Center has gone to the United States to liaise with relevant parties to ensure that the allocated machinery is shipped to China as soon as possible.

A small amount of synthetic drugs and other special medicines are already available on the market. After the new equipment donated by UNRRA arrives, the Center's scale will be further improved.

### Youth Arrested Confesses to Plotting Railway Sabotage

The Police Department of the Two Roads Bureau (referring to the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways) has repeatedly received confidential reports that communists have infiltrated the two roads and plan to destroy the railways and cut off transportation lines.

[Reported by this newspaper from Tianjin] The Northeast basketball elite, Changchun North Qing Team, arrived in Tianjin on the 6th and competed against strong teams from both the Chinese and Western communities. In nine matches, except for one win and one loss against the American soldiers, and the last match against Heping United, the Chinese basketball team won every game, and the generals in Beiping and Tianjin were all subdued. The team stayed in Tianjin for nearly half a month and showed excellent sportsmanship. The team of ten completed all the matches in Tianjin and returned to Changchun by train on the morning of the 22nd, led by Zou Renjun. The Pinglian basketball team also gained a lot from this trip to Tianjin and returned to Ping on the 21st.

Battle with Heping United

North Qing and Ping Lian met again in their last battle in Tianjin. Before 6 o'clock, the audience filled the Yuehua Gymnasium. The entire competition lacked tension slightly, but exciting moments were still discovered from time to time. Most of the North Qing team members were injured and tired, which inevitably affected their strength. The score was close in the first half, with North Qing always leading by one or two goals. The result was 20 to 16. In the second half, North Qing saw that the situation was not good, and Liu Jianhua and Tian He struggled to appear, which indeed showed improvement. However, Ping Lian fought with all their strength, and the battle was tense, resulting in a 26-28 tie. At the end of the third quarter, North Qing relied on Tian He's exploration under the basket to take the lead by one point with a score of 33 to 32. In the morning quarter, they first achieved a 33-33 situation. After entering, the fight became more intense, and Ping Lian forced the situation greatly. After a 42-42 tie, Zhen Mian scored two consecutive goals. Ma Chunxiang saved a goal, and with five seconds left in the game, Tian He finally tied the score with a final shot of 46 to 46, turning defeat into a tie. It was also considered lucky.

China Wins Suffers a Setback

Huasheng and American soldiers then opened fire, and national player Wang Yuzeng helped out, and the momentum suddenly increased. However, the Huasheng team lacked formal tactics, and Xu Zhaoxiong was too fat and slow in his movements. In the first quarter, they lost to the American soldiers 7 to 13. Wang Yuzeng made two long-range shots, and his skills were still good, but he had not practiced for a long time, and his strength was insufficient, so he did not play again in the second quarter and was replaced by Liu Baocheng. In the first half, they lost 18 to 25. At the beginning of the second half, the American soldiers were still very sharp. Only Liu Xuezhu performed well for Huasheng. The forward missed nine out of ten shots, and finally lost to the American soldiers 34 to 49.

Revenge on the American Soldiers

On the 10th, North Qing and the American soldiers met again. Referee Li Qingan Pai Kesi also adopted an eight-minute quarter system. In the center circle jump ball, the ball was passed back to Ma Di. Liu Jianhua was waiting under the basket, and the ball went into the net. After a 5-5 tie, Jianhua passed the ball cleverly, and Tian He scored. Jianhua was trapped in the enemy's formation, and Ma Chunhe hit a short throw, leading the American soldiers 13 to 7. The audience exclaimed, and in the first quarter, the American soldiers lost to North Qing 9 to 15. In the second quarter, the two armies were engaged in close combat, and each had their own wins and losses. At the end of the first half, North Ken led 29 to 22. At the start of the second half, Liu Jianhua once again took the field, and the audience cheered, with high expectations for him. He also left one of the deepest impressions on the Tianjin fans. In the third quarter, the score was 39 to 28, and the American soldiers were retreating steadily. In the fourth quarter, North Qing played steadily and surely, with the score at 36 to 42, and the situation was tense. Liu Jianhua lived up to expectations and made three appearances. The morale of the entire army was like a rainbow. Ma Qinghe scored a goal, and the American soldiers' penalty throw rose by three points. Jianhua's penalty period expired and he was forced to step down. With 25 seconds left on the field, the final whistle sounded, and North Qing defeated the stubborn enemy 44 to 39, completing its undefeated ambition in Tianjin. Before the game, in the battle between Ping Lian and Hua Team, Ping Lian luckily won against Hua Team 39 to 37, with a score of 16 to 14 in the first half, only two points apart.

Wins Over China Textile Again

On the 19th, North Qing played against China Textile again. Because North Qing's team was incomplete, they lightly defeated the China Textile United Team 29 to 19. In the first half, North Qing led by one goal with a score of 16 to 14. At one point, they were defeated 5 to 12. The China Textile United Team's killing skills were fierce, and North Qing was timid and avoided the important and took the light, which almost led to a repeat of the mistakes. However, Mao's performance on the China Textile team was quite good, and he will soon join Huasheng to seek mutual learning. In the decisive battle, Ping Lian was also not in good shape and lost to the American soldiers 20 to 34.

Because prices are currently stable, hoarding has decreased, and there is plenty of money in the banking and financial industries, there is spare capacity to purchase the bonds. As for the promotion, Mr. Xu advocated focusing on broad participation to make it universal, and not limiting it to the banking and financial industries, so that the benefits in the future will be more extensive. Regarding whether the future tightening of credit will affect prices, Mr. Xu believes that it is impossible.

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the National Defense Council passed the issuance of bonds totaling 400 million US dollars. The reporter specifically asked an observer for his opinion on this matter. He said: Since the government promulgated the new economic plan, gold and banknote transactions have been suspended, and floating funds in the market have become increasingly rampant, while prices have been relatively stable. It can be seen that floating funds are hesitant and looking for a way out. If these large floating funds are not absorbed, they will eventually cause trouble in prices. The government's issuance of huge US dollar bonds is a good way to absorb floating funds. If the bonds can be promoted to the fullest extent, it is predicted that future price trends will fall further.

### Foreign Exchange Received for Consignment Sales Must Be Sold Within 60 Days

[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank issued Circular No. 91 on the 25th to designated banks, stating that for consigned sales goods that have been shipped to the United States before February 17th of this year but have not yet been sold, and whose foreign exchange has not yet been sold, it is now stipulated that the foreign exchange can be sold to designated banks at the current exchange rate, but is limited to the following two conditions: (1) Within 60 days from the 25th of this month, the consigned sales goods must be sold, and the foreign exchange must be sold to the designated bank. (2) If the consignment seller cannot sell the goods within the above time limit, they must authorize the designated bank to transfer to its approved agent to sell the goods at a good price. In order to fulfill the item terms, from the 25th of this month, the consignment seller must provide the designated bank with a written guarantee within three days, proving that the authority has been given to the designated bank. The Central Bank does not intend to consider extending the above time limit. In the future, if the foreign market price is low, resulting in changes in the foreign exchange positions that can be sold, the Central Bank will consider and approve in advance on a case-by-case basis. If exporters do not follow the above methods, the Central Bank will require each exporter to sell their foreign exchange at the foreign exchange rate set in Circular No. 86. In addition, according to Shao Zhenhua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, the consigned sales goods have been in the United States for a long time, and the Central Bank has also stipulated that the sales goods must be sold within 90 days, but the merchants have not followed it. And according to the regulations, its foreign exchange must be sold to the designated bank at an exchange rate of 3,350 yuan. And this time, the Central Bank is lenient again and sells it at the current exchange rate. The sale of the goods will also be extended by another 60 days at the request of the exporters. Therefore, the Central Bank has given all possible convenience to the exporters.

### Pound Exchange Rate Will Not Change

Since the Central Bank officially set the exchange rate for the pound at 40,000 yuan and sold it at 48,000 yuan, exporters generally believe that they are suffering significant losses in exporting goods to the UK and hope that the Central Bank will make adjustments. According to a reporter from the United Credit Information Service who inquired with the Central Bank, the current regulation of the pound exchange rate is extremely reasonable and is not likely to change in the near future. This is because the official exchange rate of the pound is determined based on the ratio between the US dollar and the pound. At that time, the US dollar was set at 12,000 yuan in national currency, and the actual value of converting legal tender into pounds was at most 40,000 yuan. Unless the US dollar fluctuates, the pound will not change independently. As for exporters buying at 48,000 yuan, this is their cost price, and adding a legitimate profit should not result in losses.

### Import Control Committee Approves Rubber Import Quota, Approves an Additional 900 Tons as a Temporary Supply

Since the International Rubber Regulation Committee was dissolved, rubber products from Singapore, Java, Malaya, Saigon, and other places have been eagerly purchased by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries for shipment back home. The raw materials for China's rubber industry mainly rely on imports due to climate conditions, with only Hainan Island and Qiongzhou having some production. Based on actual needs, the 72 factories in Shanghai require 1,800 tons of rubber per month. In addition, factories in Guangzhou, Taiwan, Qingdao, Chongqing, Shenyang, Andong, and other places require a total of 2,000 tons per month. The total national demand is 3,800 tons per month. Since the establishment of the Import Control Committee, the import of rubber has been strictly restricted. Therefore, no new orders have been imported this year, and only last year's inventory is being used. After the industry's request, the Import Control Committee approved a temporary import of 400 tons last month. According to the person in charge of the industry, these 400 tons have been ordered from abroad and are expected to arrive in Shanghai within half a month. This month, another 500 tons have been approved, which will be reviewed and distributed by the industry association according to the machinery capacity of each factory. The distribution will be completed within days. At the end of this month, the Import Control Committee will issue the permits, allowing orders to be placed abroad. The industry is urgently hoping that the approved rubber can be imported as soon as possible to maintain production.

In addition, the government has approved a rubber import quota of US$1.1 million for the first quarter (February, March, April) of this year, to be jointly allocated by the rubber industry and the product industry. Yesterday, the industry association decided that the rubber industry would receive US$750,000 and the product industry would receive US$350,000. The current price of American rubber is US$500 per ton.

### For Spring Fashion, Spring Fashion Special Issue, Shanghai Ladies Use Their Brains, 1947 Modern Styles Emerge

The season of bright spring has arrived. Ladies are taking off their bulky winter clothes and planning to make the most fashionable and newest spring coats, which will make them look rich, majestic, and dignified, giving people a comfortable feeling.

In recent days, we have spent a lot of effort interviewing many fashion experts to inquire about the styles of ladies' spring coats this year. They or she are all based on the new styles of women's clothing from New York or Paris last month to make precise designs. This new style of spring coat has now been released.

Compared with last year, the biggest difference in this year's spring coat style is in the sleeves. The styles are ball sleeves, umbrella sleeves, and double-petal sleeves that have not been seen for many years. The sides are changed to wide and comfortable square sleeves, the arms are cylindrical, and the wrists are tight. These points are the most eye-catching. As for the front, there is not much change. The back is very wide, with three or four waves, fluttering in the wind, like a fairy. The collar still does not occupy an important position. The full length of the coat is about forty inches, forming a Spor Fashion, and the thirty-six-inch three-quarter coat (see picture) is also very suitable. Other decorations, such as buttons and belts, should be neat and generous. In terms of color, light colors are the main ones, such as light yellow, beige, light gray, and silver white, lined with dark underwear. The material should be thick, light, and soft. From the above styles, it can be seen that this year's fashion is not like in previous years, only increasing or decreasing in length and width, but the entire style has undergone a major reform.

Talking about Shanghai's fashion is actually very simple. At present, the general situation is that everyone, in addition to racking their brains on spring coats, the styles of other clothing are still quite poor. As for the appearance of the spring coats currently popular in Shanghai, most of them are still derived from American clothing. Although the styles of spring clothing in Europe and the United States may not be so simple, to cater to the tastes of general Shanghai ladies, then there must be considerable differences and trade-offs.

Western-style Pants and Short Jackets are Light and Lively

As for the Western-style pants and short jackets currently popular in Shanghai, according to a fashion expert, they are indeed very suitable for wearing at home, light and not cumbersome. As for whether they can "enter the hall of elegance," it is considered unlikely. So the conclusion is: the future fate of long pants and short jackets can only be limited to the home, at most becoming a popular "casual wear." If you want to talk about walking around in social circles or running around at banquets, then you have to think of something else. The main reason is that a short jacket is too ordinary. At the same time, the figure of Chinese ladies is limited by nature. Strictly from the perspective of beauty, it is probably difficult to find one or two suitable people to wear short clothes among ten thousand people.

The Style of Cheongsam is Not Likely to Change

Cheongsam is still the most suitable clothing for Chinese ladies. It is expected that the style of cheongsam will not change this year, but according to another expert, the most suitable length of a cheongsam should still be two or three inches below the knee. Too long is certainly out of date; too short, from an aesthetic point of view, if a pair of knees are exposed, it will damage the overall body posture.

Although British Fabrics Are Good, Domestic Products Are Also Improving

Speaking of clothing materials, of course, the best is still British goods, and the next best is American goods. As for the current Chinese wool fabrics, the quality and exquisiteness of the goods are really not inferior to American goods. According to the experience of a fashion expert, the progress of Chinese wool fabrics is very different from ten years ago.

The current price of popular coats in Shanghai ranges from 300,000 yuan to 1.5 million yuan. Among them, those costing 500,000 to 600,000 yuan can be made from American goods and high-quality Chinese goods. The market price of British goods is as high as 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan.

Generally speaking, the situation in the fashion industry this year is still quite developed. Spring has arrived, which is the time for Shanghai ladies to use their brains to change seasons. It is also the busiest season for fashion companies. As for leather bags and leather shoes outside of fashion, they can also affect the whole body the most. The popular leather bags this year are long rectangular styles with straps, with three or two very deep lines on each side. The kind of annoying shiny glass leather bags will be sent to the museum for display, and no one will ask about them anymore. The style of leather shoes is smooth, with a soft cork thick sole that reveals the big toe.

### "Buddha Needs Gold Clothing, People Need Clothes" How to Choose Your Clothing Material

Spring is here. The willows have been dyed with new green, the flowers are beginning to bud, and the grass, caressed by the wind, looks vibrant. Birds are lively on the branches, playing the song of welcoming spring. The quiet garden everywhere shows excitement and freshness. If nature is like this, why should humans be any different? The little girl in the countryside is lively, innocent, but not glamorous, and does not attract people's attention because she only has a natural posture.

Selection of Materials

Beautiful clothing materials are also like the scenery of nature, vying for beauty and splendor. The azure blue seems like a clear sky after rain, the tender green is like rippling blue waves, the red is like bright roses, and the apricot yellow is like delicate wooden clogs. Often stepping into a large silk and satin company, the five colors are dazzling, and the variety of patterns is as complex and ever-changing as summer clouds. It is indeed painstaking to choose.

"Buddha needs gold clothing, people need clothes." Beautiful clothes will reduce a woman's age by ten years. Clothes have such great magic, so women want to borrow some. However, the beauty of clothes is not absolute. It depends on whether they are worn appropriately, whether the patterns match, and whether they can enhance her charm. It is a question of becoming a matter. Blindly imitating Dong Shi will only expose the ugliness. Women spend a lot of time going out to buy clothing materials. They will pick and choose in the store for two or three hours, but when they get home, they still feel that the material they bought is not right. They know that clothes are very important in modification, so they are not willing to waste a lot of time, but if they don't know the selection criteria, isn't all this time wasted?

Personality

Choosing clothing materials should be centered on yourself, with showing your personality as the main thing. This is not to be unconventional, but you cannot blindly follow the crowd without your own opinions. So, to choose clothes, you must first understand your own characteristics. It is best to show your advantages and hide your disadvantages. A person's characteristics are not easy to analyze. Generally speaking, there are differences in height, fatness, and thinness in appearance, and there are also differences in the depth of skin color. In terms of inner self, some people are active, showing a lively attitude, while others are quiet, with a reserved personality. It is not far off to choose clothing materials based on these points!

What is your figure like? What is your personality like?

Color

After you understand yourself, I will tell you the selection method. First, is the color of the clothes. Colors have differences in coldness and heat. So-called cold colors are light colors such as blue, green, and white. Conversely, deep colors such as red, orange, purple, and brown are warm colors. A full-figured person is suitable for cold colors, and a slender figure is more suitable for wearing warm colors. The depth of the skin color is the opposite of the color of the clothes. Fair skin can wear dark-colored clothes, and dark skin may choose lighter colors, but the intensity cannot be too far apart. Doesn't a black person wearing pure white clothes make black and white even more distinct? In terms of personality: lively people wear light colors well, and reserved people are more suitable for dark colors.

Pattern

Secondly, is the choice of patterns. Hasn't the large pattern material been popular recently? Wearing such a large number of patterns is like a tiger. It is suitable for tall and slender people. If a short and fat person still chooses simple small patterns, large patterns will show their plumpness. Striped materials are the easiest to show a person's fatness and thinness. Slender people should wear straight stripes, and plump people are suitable for horizontal stripes. The texture of the clothing material has soft and hard options. The essence of silk is mostly soft, while satin is relatively hard. Brocade, which was very popular in the past, is also hard. Plump bodies or lively personalities are suitable for wearing soft materials, while hard materials are suitable for thin people or people with calm personalities.

There are also differences in the style of tailoring. In terms of length, sometimes long styles are popular, with the hem almost covering the instep, and short styles are popular, short to the knees. Fashionable women, of course, have to do the latest styles, but they also have to ask themselves, don't do it too fashionable. Too short clothes are suitable for tall people, and can also appear more lively, so short people, or people with calm personalities, even when short styles are popular, should not be too short. The width of the cuffs also changes with the times. People who are tall and wear wide cuffs look slender. Short or full people can hide it a little by wearing narrow cuffs.

Wearing clothes changes with the seasons. However, it is most difficult to determine in this not cold and not hot, yet cold and hot spring. As the saying goes: "In February and August, people dress randomly." So this point can be slightly ignored in the spring. If it is summer or winter, you have to pay special attention.

There are three motives for wearing clothes: (1) to protect the body, (2) to cover shame, and (3) to decorate. Because it has a decorative effect, many changes have taken place in the form.

The style of clothing can be divided into seven categories: (1) placement of trophies, (2) intimidating effect, (3) sexual seduction, (4) occupational representation, (5) gender representation, (6) regional characteristics, (7) religious beliefs. Analyzing women's fashion, the third category has the most components.

### Spring Fashion Tidbits

Clothing contains dualistic effects: (1) making the body taller, such as wearing high heels and high hats. (2) Enlarging or shrinking the body, such as wide sleeves, wide skirts, waist binding, and breast binding. (3) Indicating special parts of the body, such as wearing rings or other decorations on the nose, hands, feet, neck, and waist. (3) Describing the movements of a certain part of the body, such as ribbons and bells.

Originally, in the animal kingdom, the attraction between the sexes often utilizes color. Peacocks display their beautiful plumage, and butterflies flutter their wings, mostly to show their beautiful colors to the opposite sex. People in primitive times had the custom of tattooing, which was considered to increase beauty. After clothing was invented, tattooing was no longer needed. Similarly, the styles, colors, and patterns of clothes are more changeable than tattooing. But tattooing has not been completely abolished, but is only limited to the face. Powdering, applying rouge, dabbing lips, drawing eyebrows, and even dyeing nails are variations of tattooing.

Wearing clothes is a link in social life and is closely related to the changes in social politics and economy. Generally speaking, women's clothing changes faster than men's clothing. In the past 30 years, women's clothing has been changing rapidly, which shows that women's lives have suddenly changed in the past 30 years. They have been liberated from the deep chambers of secluded boudoirs, stepped into society, and are engaged in occupations, so there should naturally be a major revolution in clothing.

### Knitted Wool Coat

Knitted wool fabrics are now considered very ordinary clothing, but it has only been popular in China for more than 50 years. At first, the use of early wool rope was only for tying hair. After the invention of knitting technology, the sales of wool rope were promoted. But at that time, the things woven from wool rope were only hats, gloves, scarves and other items. It was later that vests and clothes were woven from wool rope.

Wool vests or clothes were mostly lined at first, and were very popular because they were light, thin and warm. Later, the wool clothes were moved from the inside to the outside, and there were more things to do, because wearing them on the outside, you had to take into account the beauty, so many new patterns were turned over.

The first thing worn on the outside was a wool vest, which replaced the long cheongsam waistcoat. When coats became popular, wool vests were abandoned by fashionable women.

After the short-sleeved cheongsam became popular, in the chilly spring, the two sections of jade arms were exposed outside, and it seemed a little cold, so someone tried to make a short wool shirt to cover the cheongsam. This not only reduced the monotony of the long cheongsam, but also increased the slenderness of the figure. A pair of jade arms covered in the wool shirt were not cold. Later, the sleeves of the wool shirt worn outside the cheongsam went from long to short, and short to nothing. At that time, the two arms were liberated from the wool again. At this point, the wool clothing became purely a decoration outside the cheongsam, with no meaning of keeping warm. In recent years, the wool shirt worn outside the cheongsam has been changed again, from short to the breast, extended to the hips, and the sleeves have been lengthened again. In this way, it is not a short wool shirt, but a wool coat.

Of course, leather or camel hair coats cannot be worn at home. Even if they are woolen coats, they don't look good when worn at home, and they are not convenient for doing things. Wool coats have the name of a coat, but without the burden of a coat, they can be worn at home without hindering work. At the same time, wool fabrics can be disassembled, washed and re-knitted if they are stained with grease. Wool coats are not as luxurious as leather coats or as elegant as woolen coats, but wearing them outside a cheongsam can also avoid the monotony of color.

Since the Tianjin Ram wool yarn factory in Shanghai launched a sound conference in 1933 and publicly taught knitting methods, the knitting styles have been constantly updated. The wool coat that is popular today has more ingenious patterns. In addition to knitting skills, there are also many flower embroidery on it, which increases the beauty.

Knitting is a very simple needlework, and can be done almost anywhere. Many female employees often bring wool to the office, and when there is no official business to do, they take it out of the drawer and knit for a while. In the classrooms of girls' schools, many female students listen to lectures and knit at the same time. They are already skilled and do not need to think about it.

Paris, is the art capital of the world. Parisian fashion, tempts all the mothers and daughters around the world with fascination. Someone wants to ask, how do Parisian fashion experts tailor this year's new clothes? How does this new style become popular in every big city in the world? In fact, the so-called new clothes are just slightly changing the old styles, or adding some small patterns with ingenuity, which is considered a new style. The trend of the times is constantly fluctuating, and women's clothing is also changing from time totime, with the waves behind pushing the waves ahead. After a period of time, perhaps the old patterns will still become popular. As for whether a new pattern can be promoted to the world, it is entirely the magic of fashion experts, an incomprehensible mystery.

When the 1947 Paris fashion is being performed today, there are thousands of clothes and thousands of coats. From the style point of view, they are mostly the same and can be called "Manteau Style." In more common terms, it can be said to be "Romantic Style." A tight-fitting top paired with a longer skirt shows a precarious look, fully expressing the slender figure of a morbidly beautiful woman. This style is gradually returning to the style of 1920.

Leather has become the main decoration on clothes. Collars, cuffs, and hems are all inlaid with leather, and the neck is hidden in the leather collar. Wide-brimmed hats, plus two or three beautiful feathers, are also new patterns this year. Women who wear their hair on top and wear this hat can be proud of their companions on the streets of Paris.

New York fashion is very different from Paris. Wear a narrow top with a round collar opening to the chest and small sleeves that reach the elbows. The skirt below is a half-length skirt that covers the knees, but the hem is much wider than before. Walking in it gives it a fluttering look.

The thinking of women in the New World is the newest. In addition to a few places on their bodies that are attention-grabbing, the rest are liberated as much as possible. The evening gowns that have been popular have only a pair of breasts on the upper body, and the rest is completely naked. The so-called bra is not the one that was tied with a strap and hidden in the clothes in the past. Now that it has been exposed on the outside, using a strap seems to be unable to keep up with the times, so there are only two semi-circular wire rings covering the breasts.

### Review of "Yuan Ci Lü"

— Cai Zhenghua

Compiled by Wang Yuzhang, published by The Commercial Press. Volumes 1 to 4 have been released; Volumes 5 to 10 are in printing.

When discussing Yuan opera today, we inevitably engage in armchair theorizing. Since we cannot resurrect the Yuan people from the earth, how can we know their singing styles? Regarding the rules of opera, from "Taihe Zheng Yin Pu" to "Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu," no matter how precise they are, we only know how things are, not why they are so. Disputes often arise, and there is no consensus. However, we are fortunate to have these books, which allow us to understand the norms of the Yuan people to some extent. "Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu" is good, but it still has omissions. The so-called "words and phrases are not fixed and can be added or subtracted" sometimes leaves us wondering which phrases are added and which are subtracted.

Using the methods of studying the classics and history to study opera is a recent development. By using scientific methods to summarize, we have gained a deeper understanding of the northern opera scores. When Wu Qu'an lectured at Southeast University, he wrote a "Simplified Northern and Southern Opera Score," which collected the strengths of various theories. It was a carefully crafted work, but it was only a simplified score. Following this was Wang Yuzhang's "Yuan Ci Jiao Lü." This book was published by The Commercial Press in the 25th year of the Republic of China, with only four volumes. The first volume is Huangzhong Palace, the second volume is Zheng Palace, the third volume is Dashi Tune, and the fourth volume is Xianlü Palace, forming the upper part. It took three years to complete the draft. Soon after, the Japanese invaders caused trouble, and the author sought refuge in Sichuan, which delayed the work for a long time. The first draft of the lower part was kept in Shanghai, and fortunately, it was not lost during the war. Recently, the author completed it with day and night efforts. The fifth volume is Zhonglü Palace, the sixth volume is Nanlü Palace, the seventh volume is Shuang Tune, the eighth volume is Yue Tune, the ninth volume is Shang Tune, and the tenth volume is Banshe Tune, forming the lower part, which will also be published by The Commercial Press and will soon be available.

The compilation method of this book is to arrange all the operas in Zang Jinshu's "Diaochong Guan Qu Xuan" in order to compare and contrast them to find the standard. Since the attitude is very cautious, it is different from "Yingshu Yanshu." In all fairness, there is no other reliable way to study the music theory of the Yuan people today. Wu Qu'an wrote in the preface:

"From 'Taihe Zheng Yin Pu' downwards, 'Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu' is the best, but it still has the problem of being too dense with beat markings. It should be understood that northern opera has no fixed beat, and the density of the beat markings depends on the number of words, and the sound changes accordingly. Also, at the points where the beat changes, the singer raises and lowers their voice, showcasing the beauty of the sound and text. This is also determined by the momentum of the opera's sound. Therefore, Xuan Yu's numerous beat markings should be deleted by those who write lyrics and create scores. This is precisely the strength of 'Guang Zheng Pu,' but it is also the source of disputes. Wang Yuzhang's book does not mark the beat at all. It only explores the reason for the commonality of words and phrases, and also provides collateral evidence and analysis of the differences in added phrases, formats, and ending tunes, resolving the disputes of various schools and enlightening the confusion of later learners. Its contribution to the artistic community is not small."

He also said: "Some say that the sentence patterns of northern opera are not fixed. For example, the first two phrases of 'Jishengcao' have three words, but Bai Renfu's 'Chang Zui Hou He Fang'ai, Bu Xing Shi You Shen Si' has six words. The first two phrases of 'Chao Tianzi' have two words, but Wang Yuanheng's 'Ronghua Meng Yi Chang, Gongming Zhi Ban Zhang' has five words. If the beat can be added and the phrases are not fixed, then there is no way to set an example for the predecessors or show anything to future generations. What harm is there if there is no score? They do not know that the writer adds words to express the changes of the mind, and the music theorist sets the score to establish the correctness of the lyrical method. If the differences in phrase structure are not used to understand the root cause, then it will inevitably be chaotic and disordered. Labeling a piece as a certain tune does not conform to the style of that tune. This is what Tang Ruoshi called 'twisting the voice.' How can Wang Yuzhang's efforts be lacking?"

Then, with this book, we can have some basis for disputes over music theory. However, we must also say that according to the author's introductory remarks: "The selection of tunes in each volume is determined by whether or not they are recorded in Zang's collection. Zang's collection of Yuan operas is the richest, and no one in later generations can match it. If we use Zang's collection as the standard and the rhythm of this book as the model, then writing and performing operas will be easy. Why seek anything else? Therefore, the complete works and miscellaneous dramas of ancient and modern times, as well as the Yuan operas collected by Shemotazhi, are not included." This was said in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Yuan and Ming miscellaneous dramas collected by Yeeshi Garden were suddenly discovered at sea. The entire collection consists of seventy-two volumes, totaling two hundred and sixty-nine types, with eight volumes missing, totaling twenty-seven types. Excluding the ninety-four types that have already been seen in Yuan Qu Xuan and recent printed editions, and the four duplicate copies, there are one hundred and fourteen types that have never been seen before. The "Yuan Ci Jiao Lü" is based on Zang's selection, which, including the six types from the early Ming Dynasty, is no more than one hundred types. In terms of the total number of Yuan operas that exist today, it is less than half. Since the compilation method is based on comparing and classifying, it is necessary to seek comprehensiveness in order to facilitate induction. At that time, since they had not seen the Yeeshi Garden collection, there was naturally no way to compare. From this, we can see that in the study of knowledge, later generations may have many advantages over their predecessors.

Fortunately, the introductory remarks also say: "There are only about twenty types of Yuan Dynasty lyrical poems that have been passed down to this day, and the various records of Qunzhu Qunyu are not included. In the future, we plan to create a separate collection, so this book does not involve this data." Then, the newly discovered Yuan operas can also be created as a separate collection in the future, or it would be best to combine them together, so that the differences can be seen at a glance, and the evidence obtained will be stronger.

### Collation and Bibliography

— Hesheng

Book Title: "Essentials of Collation, Bibliography, and Learning"

Author: Jiang Boqian

Publisher: Zhengzhong Book Company

Publication Date: December, 35th year of the Republic of China

Tong Zhixuan said in the preface to Ma Daoyuan's "Bibliography" (Commercial Press edition, 23rd year of the Republic of China): "In ancient times, knotted ropes were used for governance. Later, writing was invented, then bamboo tablets, then silk, then paper. Then woodblock printing was invented. With the rise of printing, the use of books became more widespread. The Seven Summaries and the Four Treasuries are vast as the sea. They are either divided into categories to clarify the examples, or they are interpreted and researched to elaborate on the evaluations. Thus, there is the study of bibliography. Over time, errors and omissions arose. There were misplaced slips, redundant words, or even mistakes due to similar characters. Thus, there is the study of collation. The Stone Classics of the Han Dynasty, the Buddhist scriptures carved in the Tang Dynasty, the Song Dynasty editions, the Yuan Dynasty editions, the palace editions, and the commercial editions were compared based on their binding or distinguished based on their format. Thus, there is the study of bibliography."

It can be seen that bibliography, collation, and bibliography are closely related and gradually emerged according to historical needs. However, each has its own responsibilities and boundaries, and they cannot be mixed together. Ordinary researchers of bibliography have always regarded the two tasks of "collation" and "bibliography" as consistent and inseparable. Now, according to Tong's statement, "collation" and "bibliography" are clearly two different things, and "bibliography" is also one thing. It can be seen that the scope of bibliography is undoubtedly broad. There are actually two perspectives on the study of bibliography, one narrow and one broad. In the narrow sense, collation refers to the collation of the words, chapters, and volumes of books, and bibliography refers to the compilation of the contents of a book, or the compilation of a category of books, or even the bibliography of various categories of books. In the broad sense, collation actually includes bibliography. Since the theories of Zheng Qiao and Zhang Xuecheng became popular, broad collation not only includes bibliography, but also believes that emphasis should be placed on the study of bibliography, and even includes bibliography. Over time, bibliography and bibliography gradually emerged from narrow collation as separate disciplines, which is what modern people have described as broad collation.

This book aims to compile the essentials of broad collation. However, in order to make it easier for readers to understand the scope of what is being described, it is named after "collation" and "bibliography." In other words, it describes the two tasks of collation and cataloging, and also touches on bibliography. The book is divided into two parts, upper and lower, totaling 204 pages. The upper part describes the history of collation and cataloging, divided into official collation, private collation, historical and geographical bibliographies, specialized bibliographies, religious bibliographies, and other special bibliographies. The lower part describes the content of collation and bibliography, divided into seeking out books, correcting words, determining chapters, writing prefaces, identifying authenticity, collecting lost texts, classifying and cataloging, and so on.

There are many books on collation. In the past, there was Liu Xiang's collation in the Han Dynasty, Zheng Qiao's "Brief Collation" in the Song Dynasty (one of the twenty summaries of the Tongzhi), Zhang Xuecheng's "General Meaning of Collation" in the Qing Dynasty (Zhang's posthumous works), and in modern times, there was Du Dingyou's "New Meaning of Collation" (typeset and printed in the 19th year of the Republic of China), Hu Pu'an and Hu Daojing's "Collation" (Commercial Press, typeset and printed in the 20th year of the Republic of China), Fu Zhenlun's "New Theory of Collation" (published in the second issue of the fifth volume of the Journal of Library Science, June, 20th year of the Republic of China), Jiang Yuanqing's "History of Collation" (Commercial Press, 24th year of the Republic of China), and so on.

Collation has always been regarded as the study of managing books, the basic work for studying knowledge, and an important work for researchers. The object of managing books is books, and books are an indispensable tool for researchers. Therefore, researchers must understand the study of managing books in both the narrow and broad senses. Since researchers use books as the basis, the study of collation cannot be ignored. Since collation is so important, narrow collation cannot fulfill the responsibility of managing books completely. It must include narrow collation, bibliography, and bibliography. In other words, the study of managing books is broad collation.

In recent times, library undertakings have become increasingly widespread, and the number of people studying library science has increased. However, in reality, there are many people engaged in library undertakings, but few study bibliography, and even fewer study collation and bibliography. Since collation is the study of managing books, researchers of library science and those engaged in library undertakings must also study bibliography and collation, and must also study bibliography. Then, they can explore the origins and be said to have exhausted the way of managing books. Today, those who run libraries attach great importance to classification and cataloging, but often neglect collation and bibliographic research. As a result, they have not fully researched the way of studying knowledge in the entire field of library science. Now, reading Jiang's "Essentials of Collation, Bibliography, and Learning" can be said to have grasped the essentials of the method of managing books. I would like to introduce it to researchers of library science and bibliography.

### Solutions to Physics Calculation Problems

— Co-edited by Wang Weilian and Wang Zhishan, published by Zhonghua Book Company

Physics is a science that requires calculation, but general physics textbooks ignore this point. They often provide superficial introductions to some advanced theories, while lacking practical discussions of many basic principles. Therefore, many students, after completing high school and university courses, still have a vague impression of physics and do not really understand it. It is truly like climbing a tree to catch a fish to expect such students to be able to further study academics and make discoveries. I believe that if we want Chinese scholars to be able to contribute to science, it is not so much about sending people abroad to study or buying more foreign journals and new books as references, but about enabling Chinese students to have a deep understanding and comprehension of various basic principles. Only when the foundation is solid can the branches flourish. The domestic scientific atmosphere can gradually become thicker, keeping pace with other countries in the world. After years of searching, I finally discovered this wonderful book—"Solutions to Physics Calculation Problems" co-authored by Wang Weilian and Wang Zhishan, published by Zhonghua Book Company.

In this book, there are no irrelevant theories, no captivating rhetoric, only one problem after another, and line after line of numbers. It is divided into two volumes, twelve chapters, with thousands of problems of various types.

Any student who can fully understand this book can be said to have thought through more than half of the applications and exercises of various basic principles in physics. That's why I say this book is a wonderful book.

Especially in China, where general authors and translators like to create mysteries, translate obscure masterpieces, and describe irrelevant theories to show off to others, the value of this book is even more worthy of attention because it is engaged in basic work. If the Chinese scientific community can achieve something in physics in ten years, this book is the seed of that achievement.

After reading this book, on the one hand, I feel that it is a wonderful book, and on the other hand, I also feel a little insufficient. Science is constantly advancing and changing with each passing day. It seems necessary to revise this book, which has been published for many years.

The study of all problems has a certain path, which is to "understand the principle, master the method, and exhaust the changes." This book can enable general students to reach the stage of "understanding the principle" in consultation with textbooks, but it cannot enable general students to 100% reach the stage of "mastering the method." I hope that the compilation of the book can be slightly modified to adopt the example problem-exercise problem system. In the original book, many problems can be summarized into one category. An example problem should be given for each category. For example, in the original book's chapter on expansion, problems 41, 43, 45, 46, 50, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64 can all be solved using the formula P1V1/T1 = . Therefore, it seems that only the problem should be listed, without providing the solution, so that students can solve it themselves. This is more likely to achieve the effect of mastering the method. Also, in the original book's chapter on expansion, problems 39, 74, 75, 56, 79 have many changes and should be converted into formula problems. Each problem should be attached with exercise problems, ranging from four or five to more than ten, or even hundreds, for students to calculate. Also, in the original book's chapter on specific heat, problem 44 can be used as an example problem, and problems 41, 42, 43 of the same chapter can be attached below as exercise problems. This makes it easier for students to have a clear impression of various phenomena. The author tried to do this in his early years, but was unable to complete it due to limited academic ability and other tasks. If the two gentlemen do not abandon this idea, I will write another article detailing the method to inform them and ask for their correction.

The creation of example problems is relatively difficult because general books do not publish them, and they are rarely seen in difficult journals. Therefore, it all depends on the author's personal efforts to classify the problems they have seen on weekdays. The exercise problems attached to each example problem should, in principle, be taken from the entrance examination questions and regular test questions of universities and middle schools in China, and the figures of famous experiments, and the correct answers and their sources should be noted at the end of each problem, so that they can be used for both purposes.

Many problems have several solutions. For example, the calculation of falling bodies can be solved using the falling body formula, or it can be solved using the relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy. The book should specifically point this out, and use different solutions for the same problem to arouse students' interest.

For many formulas, special attention should be paid to their units. Many operations are prone to errors, and special attention should be paid to them. It seems that the method of side notes should be adopted to note them one by one, so that students can reduce learning errors caused by occasional negligence.

I also have a hope that the book can have the opportunity to be revised and become an exercise lecture for students studying in school and a good guide for self-study students, giving physics learners a way to enter the door and giving those who have studied physics a commonly used handbook.

Although this book is not 100% good, in today's lack of Chinese science books, every young person with lofty ideals in science and engineering should have one copy. At the same time, I hope that Mr. Wang Weikang and Wang Zhishan have the responsibility to revise the book to make it more perfect, extensive, and clear.

### Publication News

The International Publishing House recently published "The Constitution of the Republic of China in Chinese-English Translation," with the implementation preparation procedures, the organizational regulations of the Constitutional Promotion Association, and a comparison of the revised constitutional draft and the May 5th constitutional draft, which is very convenient for reference. Each copy costs 10,000 yuan and is available at the Art Institute, 7 Qinghai Road, Shanghai.

### "Reading Guidance"

— Compiled by Huang Weilian and Li Bojia, a total of three series, published by The Commercial Press

The Commercial Press, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, on the one hand, to increase readers' interest, and on the other hand, to meet the needs of the times, opened a new guideline for those who advocated the reading movement at that time, and solved the problem of how to read books. It specially added a "Reading Guidance" column in the "Publishing Weekly" of the museum, and widely invited domestic scientific and academic experts to write various scientific research methods, which were published in each issue, and were well received by readers. Later, the disclosed texts were compiled into a single volume to facilitate readers and spread the price. It can be seen that the way to read books cannot be started casually. To know that reading books requires a method, so that you can save time and get considerable results.

This book collects the articles published in the "Reading Guidance" column of the "Publishing Weekly" published by The Commercial Press in the past ten years. Three series have been published before and after, with a total of ninety-six research methods from various disciplines. The subjects covered include thirty-six categories, divided into general, library science, classics, philosophy, psychology, ethics, Buddhism, society, astronomy, chemistry, physics, geology, biology, botany, industry, medicine, physiology, engineering, mineralogy, agriculture, home economics, art, literature, history, geography, and archeology. There are many categories that are similar in the three series, but the titles of each article are not repeated. The authors of each article are all well-known experts in their respective fields in China. They use simple words and thorough theories to integrate the research methods used by scholars at home and abroad, and their own experiences, to open up new paths for readers. Not only can readers obtain the gateway to research in the shortest time for advanced academics, but also can guide beginners to make precise explorations in theory and practice, so as to easily obtain the mysteries of science and academics.

Here are a few examples of the published articles: In the field of philosophical research, there are Zhang Dongsun's "How to Study Philosophy" and Feng Youlan's "How to Study the History of Chinese Philosophy"; in the field of politics, there is Yang Youjiong's "How to Study Political Science"; in the field of economics, there are Tang Qingzeng's "Economic Research Methods," Li Quanshi's "Financial Research Methods," and Pan Xulun's "How to Study Accounting"; in the field of education, there is Ai Wei's "How to Study Educational Psychology"; in the field of science, there are Li Yan's "How to Study the History of Chinese Mathematics" and Wang's "Chemical Research Methods"; in the field of engineering, there is Zhao Zengjue's "How to Research and Select Engineering"; in the field of language, there is Li Jinxi's "How to Study the National Language"; in the field of literature, there are Zhang Ziping's "Fiction Research" and Wu Lifu's "How to Study Western Literature"; in the field of history, there is Lu Simian's "How to Continue Chinese History," and so on. In modern times, science is prosperous and changing with each passing day, and the books and sayings of various sciences and academics are as vast as the sea. It is also impossible to browse the army collection. Moreover, everything is precious to get its way. Once there is a way, you can devote yourself to research and get twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, to enable scholars to obtain the most appropriate guidance, so as not to waste precious time and obtain considerable satisfactory results, is an urgent need.

At the end of each series, there are also resumes of the authors, so that readers can have a deeper understanding of their academic qualifications. Mr. Cai Yuanpei said in the preface to the first series that this book is like the finger of Lu Xian Dongbin, which can turn stones into gold. Its characteristics are that it is convenient for self-study, convenient for reference, and convenient for increasing common sense. It can be truly called the compass for reading guidance. I hope that we can continue to publish books in the future, so that it can become an encyclopedia guidance book.

### Reading "Crime and Punishment"

— Dongyuan

Authored by Dostoevsky, Translated by Wei Congwu, Printed by Shanghai Wenguang Bookstore

The new, fully translated edition of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic, in two volumes,

is priced at $16,000.

(I)

This work by Dostoevsky can be said to be his most important novel, and it has been welcomed by a wide readership around the world. China is no exception, and there are several translations available. Among these translations, Mr. Wei Congwu's translation is considered the best.

Wei's complete translation also has its own history. The translator states clearly in the preface to the latest edition that this book was printed five times in the seven years before the war, which is certainly a sign of progress among Chinese readers. Even from the publisher's perspective, it transitioned from the "Weiming" edition to the "Kaiming" edition, after which it was discontinued for nine years due to the war. Until recently, it transitioned from the "Kaiming" edition to the "Jiaoguang" edition, appearing before readers with a new look.

In today's environment, where publishing conditions are so difficult, many literary masterpieces can be reprinted, such as "Jean-Christophe," "War and Peace," and this "Crime and Punishment," etc. This is indeed a welcome phenomenon in publishing, which the reading community hopes to maintain and develop.

What we are reading now is, of course, the new Wenguang edition. Under the author's authentic writing style, I seized every free moment to quickly finish reading this work, not wanting to miss any opportunity to read it. Frankly speaking: it is the vivid and realistic story that captivated me.

(II)

This work centers on the tragic and impoverished youth, Rodion Raskolnikov. The author uses compelling writing to depict his miserable life and the harsh treatment he receives from society.

Raskolnikov (Raskolnikov for short) originally made a living teaching, but he recently lost his job. His family is declining and very poor, relying entirely on a pension for sustenance with only his mother and sister. After losing his job, Raskolnikov's financial difficulties increased daily. Helpless, he had no choice but to pawn his belongings to an old woman who specialized in usury. She was a notorious exploiter who not only charged high interest but also confiscated pawned items as soon as they expired, accumulating a considerable fortune. Raskolnikov even pawned the watch left by his father to her. His inner resentment was profound.

When Raskolnikov went to a tavern, trying to alleviate his sorrow with alcohol, he found that the other drinkers were there for the same reason: to escape their inner suffering. In particular, the poor clerk, Marmeladov, poured out his many grievances to Raskolnikov.

In every way, Raskolnikov's anger and sorrow increased. The next day, he received a letter from his sister, saying that she was willing to marry a wealthy old merchant for the sake of her brother's future happiness. After reading this letter, Raskolnikov's heart was filled with turmoil. A limitless anger surged within him. He hated the cruelty of the world, and the more he hated it, the more his anger rose. As a result, he harbored murderous thoughts and desperately wanted to vent.

Driven by this thought, he went home, took a sharp axe, and went to the pawnbroker he had long resented. Upon arriving, he quickly killed her with several blows of the axe. As he was about to take her money, the old woman's sister came in. In a panic, he killed her as well. Then, someone knocked on the door, and he hurriedly grabbed her money bag and fled.

After he fled home, his pure conscience was burdened with heavy chains. He became delirious and suffered from a feverish illness for many days.

Later, at the urging of a newly acquainted lover, the prostitute Sonya, he went to confess his crime. Although Sonya had fallen into prostitution, her soul was pure. After urging Raskolnikov to confess, the psychologist certified that he was given a light sentence of only eight years.

During these eight years, although he was exiled to Siberia to perform hard labor, he realized the truth in the work, saw a new path, cherished hope for their new future, embraced Christianity, and was given new hope!

I cannot describe the entire outline here. The above is the main part of this work, which is presented with this as its theme. (111)

This work depicts all the protagonists from the lower classes, who are considered lowly by some writers, but it portrays them justly and shows that, despite their seemingly lowly appearance, their hearts are pure and their souls are clean.

The author himself had always been in the midst of suffering and hardship. He had been sentenced to death and had also been sent to Siberia to perform hard labor. Therefore, the author's own rich experiences made what he wrote a reflection of reality, a vivid performance of life.

The author never had a happy day in his life, but in his painful life, he produced many indelible masterpieces. We can easily name a few: "Poor People," "The Insulted and Injured," "Dead Souls," "The Idiot," and so on. "Crime and Punishment" is also one of the main ones. His achievements cannot be denied, and the whole world cannot deny them, because his works are forged from the blood and flesh of real life.

Some say that Dostoevsky's work is not as meticulous as Turgenev's, and that is true. Precisely because he did not have as much time as Turgenev to carefully revise, he was waiting for his works to exchange for life. However, this does not obscure his achievements. Although the form is not as refined as Turgenev's, the value of the content is very high.

As for his often leading the protagonist to the name of Christ, this is his religious belief. However, he is different from the general preacher, because he gives people a new path to goodness. The translator also has an explanation in the introduction.

In short, in his writing, he wrote about the painful situation of the oppressed—the insulted and injured, revealing the truth with great sympathy!

### Random Talks in Dubo

— Wang Cong

Gold pounds may influence history, but they cannot guarantee that honor will be attributed to oneself.

People are naturally inclined to sympathize with those who have suffered misfortune. However, paradoxically, people often enjoy creating misfortune for others besides themselves.

Gold pounds can buy the activity of the body, but not necessarily the activity of the soul.

An unfortunate actress later became a wealthy man's concubine. Every day, apart from fawning over her master, she abused another hapless maid.

Once, she went to see a play and saw a maid being abused on stage. She was moved to tears. But when she returned home, she forgot again and continued to whip her maid.

When she had nothing to do, she would ask a fortune teller to tell her fortune, but she forgot to look in her mirror—the maid she whipped every day. Or else, she would go to the temple and burn incense respectfully, praying that everything would be good for herself and that others would die sooner. However, she never thought about what she was living for.

A hideous person discovered his ugliness. So he devised a scheme to destroy all the mirrors in the world.

However, this ugly person did not become beautiful because of it.

One day, the ugly person discovered his ugly reflection in his own urine, so he hated his urine as much as he hated mirrors, vowing not to urinate.

The ugly person eventually died, suffering from a strange urinary disease.

An ugly person who can recognize his own ugliness is a remarkable hero among all ugly people. As for his aesthetic psychology, it is also a good trend. Moths die for fire, ugly people die for beauty, becoming glorious miracles of insects and humans.

After a moth dies, it should be posthumously named General of Fire Virtue Yanhai; after an ugly person dies, he should be posthumously named Duke Meizhong.

Chekhov once questioned Tolstoy about whether he liked his plays.

"I don't like them, they're worse than Shakespeare's!" Tolstoy said bluntly.

Clearly, this stubborn and opinionated old man was afraid of seeing his own shadow in Chekhov's plays.

### Irregular Climate and Seasonal Diseases

— Qilou

Recently, news of the spread of seasonal diseases, such as smallpox, diphtheria, and even meningitis, has often appeared in the newspapers. These are all things that can be fatal, so seeing such news inevitably makes one shudder and feel the fear and worry that life can be lost at any time.

The cause of these seasonal diseases is often attributed to the irregularity of the climate, as if the heavens are deliberately opposing us. And looking at the climate, it is suddenly cold and suddenly hot, suddenly windy and suddenly rainy, which seems really abnormal. When a group of people meet on weekdays, they always fail to learn the cultivation skills of "Today's weather, haha," and they invariably complain about the heavens. According to our ideals, it seems that the cold, heat, rain, and snow of the four seasons should have a fixed time and a fixed progress, just like sunset and sunrise. Especially the temperature of the climate should slowly climb up the thermometer from spring to summer, and then climb down from autumn to winter, with no other advances or retreats in between, and especially the current kind of wild throwing and giant immersion, large ups and downs, should be absolutely prohibited.

Unfortunately, the heavens are not so rigid. At the same time, according to geographers, the temperate zone in which we live is precisely because of this kind of sudden warming and sudden cooling that stimulates mankind and produces civilizations that cannot be achieved in other zones. That is to say, under this climate that refuses to be normal, it can produce both a high degree of civilization and terrible plagues. Civilization or plague depends on our own choices, because the mercury on the thermometer cannot manufacture these things. When Xiang Yu was surrounded in Dongcheng, he sighed, "This is the heavens that are destroying me, not the fault of war." We are really not qualified to laugh at this ancient man today.

Smallpox, diphtheria, and meningitis, etc., always come to visit at this time of year. If these epidemics had a spirit, they would definitely curse the climate with us in unison:

"Irregular things! Look at us, we never miss a point every year, how normal we are!"

### The "Greening" Movement

— Qingwen

After the war, Japan, due to the great reduction in its area (in fact, it has not decreased compared to the Japanese territory of seventy years ago, because what it has reduced now is what it has gained from past invasions), and the industry has been restricted, and it has to pay reparations, how to deal with various economic problems is a big headache.

Now it is said that Japan has decided to become the "Switzerland of Asia." Recently, it has also launched a "greening movement." The greening movement is to turn the whole country into a "garden country" in order to attract foreign tourists to visit and exchange for foreign exchange. For this greening movement, Emperor Hirohito even allocated tens of thousands of saplings from his "imperial garden" to promote it.

We are not opposed to Japan becoming the "Switzerland of Asia," if Japan can really become as peaceful as Switzerland in the future; and "greening" is even better, because between the "whitening" of the New World and the "reddening" of the Soviet Union, letting Japan's "greening" be the bridge will be of considerable help to world peace. However, we do not hope that Japan will use the "greening" movement as a cover to attempt to revive its old dreams amidst the confrontation between "whitening" and "reddening."

### "The Merry Widow" – A New Biographical Film

— Bi

Helen Stephens Marksey was born in 1840 and died in 1916. He was a great inventor of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He applied for registration of 192 patents for his inventions. The first patent application was in 1866. He improved the method of making iron, bending thick iron into a circle for making bombs. The last time was in 1916, when he succeeded in researching hydrocarbons, which contributed greatly to the manufacture of aircraft.

Although he was a scientist, Marksey was not as serious, calm, and inhuman as people imagined. Naturally, he was very serious and calm when he was doing research, but in his family life, he was a very humorous person, creating ten times more jokes than his inventions. For example, he would take his son to shoot the police with bean bullets, or conduct hypnosis experiments on a group of chicks.

Marksey's story has now been made into a movie by Universal Pictures. In the past, biographical films have focused on scientific inventions, but this one only takes his love and family stories. Here, he is not a great inventor but a faithful husband and a humorous father. Hollywood's standard dad, Don Americanchi, and standard wife, Mouna Loa, play Marksey's husband and wife, and child star Bobbed Lystco plays their son. Don't think that turning a great inventor into a clown is something out of nothing. The story of this film is completely based on the memoirs "AGenius In The Family" written by Marksey's son, Pansey, and its authenticity is 100%.

The translated title of this film is "The Merry Widow," which is scheduled to be released at the Majestic Theater on the 27th. It is a unique comedy biographical film.

New Knowledge

### Refrigerant

— Baigao

Sheldon, an amateur chemist in New York City, USA, was engaged in amateur chemical research when he lived in Brazil ten years ago. He felt that his import and export industry needed a powder that could be used immediately, such as a refrigerant, so he started experimenting and soon discovered that hundreds of chemicals could absorb heat during the reaction. However, these chemicals could not meet the three conditions that are necessary for general application, namely: cheap, harmless, and chemically stable. Then, whenever he had time, he continued his gentle analysis, watching and testing in his home laboratory in Reno de Janeiro. This lasted for eight years, and a total of more than 250 chemicals that were considered useless were discarded. As a result, he solved two of the three major problems: he made several non-toxic and inexpensive cooling substances, but these substances could not remain intact when exposed to air.

Once, he experimented until almost dawn before leaving the laboratory and going to bed. He didn't even bother to put away the product made in this experiment—a cup of mixed powder—but let it slowly absorb moisture from the air and turn into a useless paste. Four hours later, when his spirit and ambition were restored, he walked into the laboratory again, ready to "reorganize." When he reached out to pour out the cup of chemicals, he suddenly found that the contents of the cup were as hard as bones, and he was very excited. He added some water, and the solution became extremely cold!

After calming down a little, Sheldon happened to look at the medicine rack above the experiment table and found traces of a small amount of powdered medicine sprinkled from the top shelf onto the cup on the table. After paying a little attention, he also found that the bottle containing this powder had fallen on the shelf, and the stopper had come off. Obviously, this bottle was knocked over, but who did it? Sleeping soundly near the bottle was his pet monkey, which had unintentionally helped its owner achieve a great purpose. This powdered medicine, which had not been tried before, actually completed his prescription.

Then Sheldon sent samples of his invention to friends all over the world to test its impact under various climates. The results were very satisfactory, and his cooling powder is now on sale in the market. But the author does not know whether it is available in China.

### News Summary

— Tieyun

It is said that the $10,000 big bill has been decided not to be issued. There are two possible views on this: (1) The US$500 million loan may be available immediately, and the currency can be tightened; (2) After the implementation of the emergency economic measures, prices will tend to fall.

Which one is right? We can't guess.

A fake inspector general nominated himself to be called "Forgiveness." When he was on trial, he shouted "Forgiveness" to the judge. It can be seen that this person's conscience has not been completely lost. However, there are too many people whose "treachery" has not been exposed, but who have already been "forgiven."

"Second landlords" are now the "Mayor of Greater Shanghai." The "gold bar" law they have set, even the mayor dare not say "no"!

The second landlord at No. 8, Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, forced the third tenant to jump into the Huangpu River. These are tragedies created by the "gold bar" law. Even the chief bandit knows to celebrate his mother's birthday. His "banditry" also has a "way." Excuse me! Excuse me! However, it is said that Huang Jiayin and his gang of robbers are all members of the "Zhonghe Party." I don't know if they have received any training. They are so disobedient to party discipline and party program.

More than a dozen cars of the latest model, and the roads are already too crowded to walk, the order prohibiting the import of cars has been issued. This is what is called "control."

A military officer said: Now, those running solo on the streets are all "major generals" and "colonels." He also said that many military wives are setting up stalls. The torment of life is terrifying this year!

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Guan wanted to follow, but Xiao Shen stopped her, and Rong'er, who was less than five years old, also cried and pushed away Jin Aili's hand, wanting her mother to hold him. At this time, the tense emotions expressed by everyone had also aroused a kind of premonitory fear in his little mind.

"Come! Little brother, I'll hold you!" Xiao Shen put on a smiling face, trying to tease Rong'er. He always felt a little uncomfortable and sour in his heart when he heard the intimate address that Old Zhu used for the young woman when he left just now. Now he wanted to take advantage of this gap as much as possible and compete with Old Zhu. But Rong'er refused to cooperate, only hugging his mother tightly, not even turning his head back.

Lan picked him up herself and gave Xiao Shen a look as if to thank him.

"Mrs. Hu, let's go! I'll lead the way for you! Japanese planes are really coming!" Xiao Shen pointed to the sky. Sure enough, the sound of the plane was getting louder and louder, and it seemed that there were more than a dozen of them.

The red-nosed old man had been looking at Jin Aili with a sly look for a long time. When Lan really followed Xiao Shen out of the long glass window, he gave her a knowing smile, and regardless of whether the other party responded, he rushed forward and grabbed her hand, rushing out.

"Miss Jin, let's go too!" he said in a low voice, feeling very excited inside.

Jin Aili did not dare to offend him, only struggled to break free of her hand, and then silently followed him out. Xu Shaoming and A Shi, who were rolling like a ball, caught up behind him. Old Xu was carrying an extremely fat briefcase in his left hand, and was wiping the sweat on his face and neck with a towel in his right hand. A Shi was carrying a not-so-small leather suitcase on his shoulder, and the weight seemed very heavy. Behind A Shi was also a Cantonese maid with long braids and wooden clogs.

The air-raid shelter was not far away. After five or six minutes, Xu's family had all gathered inside. Xiao Shen worked very hard to grab a long bench by the wall, and wiped it for a long time with his white hands before he carefully helped the young woman over, letting her and Rong'er sit comfortably, and then hurriedly took out a very delicate cigarette case from his pocket and carefully handed over a cigarette.

"I'm sorry, I don't smoke!" Lan smiled reluctantly. She was only thinking about Fei Fei in her heart, and did not pay attention to the dishonest air that was floating on Xiao Shen's face.

Xiao Shen put the cigarette on the corner of his mouth and smoked it, while also secretly looking at that pretty face that had turned pale with anxiety. Fatty Xu was the last one to step into the air-raid shelter. Seeing that there were no seats elsewhere, he glanced over and sat to the left of Xiao Rong. (2) (6)

### Cheering for the Soldiers

— Mengbo

Second Time Affairs Couplet

The newspaper reported that Chief Chen mentioned morale, soldier treatment, and strengthening conscription at the Third Plenary Session, saying that if treatment could be improved immediately, morale would be boosted. Deputy Minister Gu said that the people should also implement general mobilization to help combat. Today, I will pick up the main points and compose them into a couplet:

Treatment urgently needs adjustment, at a time when salaries are like cassia and rice like pearls, no wonder soldiers' morale is still full of worries;

Conscription still needs to be strengthened, in this time of war and chaos, it is pitiful that the people's hearts have not been mobilized.
