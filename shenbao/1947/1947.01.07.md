### Special Envoy Marshall to Return Home to Report; Met with Chairman and Ambassador Stuart Yesterday; Decision on Whether to Return to China Will Be Made After Arriving in the United States

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Special Envoy Marshall has recovered from his severe cold. He visited Ambassador Stuart at 11:30 AM on the 6th for lunch and a lengthy conversation. At 5:30 PM, he visited Chairman Chiang again, departing after a half-hour discussion. According to general observation, Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Marshall on the 5th preceded Marshall's visits to Stuart and Chiang on the 6th, and the true implications are not difficult to surmise. Additionally, Nankai University President Zhang Boling visited Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 6th for a meeting.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] United Press reported from Washington that Special Envoy Marshall will soon return to the United States to report to President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes on the situation in China. Whether Marshall will return to China after his trip to the United States will be decided after the three-way meeting. The reporter specially visited the American Embassy spokesman, Connors, to inquire whether this was true. Connors stated, "Nothing is yet known."

[United Press, Washington, 5th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshall, barring unforeseen developments, will immediately return to the country to report to President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes. Whether Marshall will conclude his thirteen-month diplomatic mission at this point or will still return to China to make new efforts to mediate the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists depends on the outcome of consultations upon his return. Whether the situation is still salvageable depends especially on Marshall's own decision. However, most well-informed sources in Washington believe that Marshall's chances of returning to China are slim. If this is the case, it will raise the question of a U.S. Ambassador to China, as the diplomatic community believes that after Marshall's retirement, his close colleague, Ambassador Stuart, will also resign. In addition, there are two other possible developments after Marshall's return: (1) Political observers predict that as soon as there are signs that Marshall will stay in the country for a long time, his illustrious name will become a talking point for the 1948 presidential election. (2) Marshall will return home to rest. His friends believe that this 66-year-old military diplomat will retire to a farm in Virginia, but officials predict that Truman will still keep him in an important position. Regarding this, officials have discussed the possibility of Marshall replacing Admiral Leahy as the President's Chief of Staff. Leahy is 71 years old and has held this position since the beginning of the war. He may retire in the future or take on a diplomatic position.

[Our Newspaper] Since arriving in Shanghai, Lei Zhen has been extremely busy. On the evening of the 5th, he had a long talk with Zhang Junmai, who introduced Lei to the standing committee members of the China Democratic Socialist Party. According to Xu Fulin, the party's propaganda minister, the meeting between Lei and Zhang was only for exchanging opinions and no decisions were made. Within the Democratic Socialist Party, opinions on whether to join the government are still divided. Xu pointed out that the statements made by some members of the Democratic Socialist Party regarding participation in the government as reported in the newspapers were "personal opinions" because the party's stance had not yet been decided. Xu had attempted to meet with Wu Tiecheng, but was unsuccessful due to Wu's illness. It is generally believed here that the internal divisions within the Democratic Socialist Party, which emerged when deciding whether to participate in the National Assembly, seem even more serious this time during the dispute over the government reorganization, and there is a significant possibility of a split.

### General Budget Fully Audited; Participating Committee Compiles Report

More than 20 people, including Fu Sinian, attended.

The budget was 800 billion, but there are currently remaining houses that cannot be sold (such as the Broadway Building in Shanghai). Yin Shuxian and others frequently raised questions, stating that the detailed quantities of remaining items were not listed within the budget amount. They stated that the specific types of remaining materials should be listed. Hu replied that the remaining items were all land and houses. Attendees successively raised many questions about the problems of receiving materials. Then, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu reported on the budget situation of the China Textile Corporation, hoping to increase income and strive to increase production this year. This year's budgeted income is 400 billion. If production can be increased, it will be profitable, but it must be coordinated with financial policy. Subsequently, councilors raised questions, expressing dissatisfaction that the control of cotton yarn and cloth and the black market had not been improved, and discussed the issue of surplus U.S. military materials. Finally, the amendments to the review opinions of the first group were passed.

Zhang Lan delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, the main points of which were as follows: (1) Regarding the political system, the China Democratic League advocates a parliamentary system with universal suffrage and a bicameral system. For the highest administrative organ of the state, it adopts a cabinet system. The League advocates the implementation of constitutional government and the rule of law, but does not recognize that having a constitution equates to constitutional government, and therefore argues that no individual or political party should be above the law. (2) The League's future goals are twofold: to gain sympathy and to strengthen organization. (3) League members must maintain their independence and not abandon their own views casually, echoing the views of others. They should not seek temporary expediency and overlook long-term and greater plans.

### Zhao Chen Discusses the Lei Qilin Case; Nanjing High Court Has the Right to Hear the Case

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Zhao Chen, President of the Nanjing High Court, told our reporter on the 6th that regarding the request from Lei Qilin, a National Assembly representative from Ningxia, for a transfer of jurisdiction after his arrest, he had instructed the court's procuratorate to submit a request for review. Zhao stated that although the "crime" and the place of prosecution in Lei's case were both in Ningxia, the defendant was in Nanjing, and the charge against him was "suspicion of internal rebellion." According to law, the High Court should be the court of first instance. In order to ensure a fair trial, it is appropriate to transfer jurisdiction. The Nanjing High Court has the right to hear this case, but this "suspicion of internal rebellion" case has not yet gone through the investigation process, so it should be handled by the High Procuratorate first.

### Frequent Accidents Involving Two Civil Aviation Companies; Ministry of Communications Decides to Start Rectification; Convenes Relevant Parties to Begin Thorough Investigation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Due to the serious situation of frequent accidents involving civil aviation aircraft, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the two airlines to suspend flights for a week starting from the 6th, and has scheduled a meeting at the Ministry on the 6th, convening the general managers and heads of flight groups of the two companies to discuss rectification matters. Responsible personnel from the Ministry of Communications will also attend.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Starting from the 7th, both civil aviation companies will suspend the sale of passenger tickets in compliance with the order, except for mail, which will continue to fly as usual. Shen Desie and Chen Zhuolin, the general managers of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, respectively, will come to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 7th to consult with the Ministry of Communications on the aftermath.

### Civil Aviation Administration to Revise Takeoff Weather Standards

[Our Newspaper] Due to unfavorable weather and insufficient flight equipment, four passenger planes have unfortunately crashed in the past twelve days, with a total of 113 passengers and crew members killed. It is truly unfortunate that accidents have occurred continuously at a time when the civil aviation industry is waiting to develop. The plane that crashed the night before was China National Aviation Corporation's AC-46 type aircraft number 121, which departed from Shanghai for Beijing at 5:10 AM on the 5th, with the entire journey scheduled to take five hours. However, two and a half hours after leaving Shanghai, the plane intended to land at the U.S. Marine Corps' seaside airfield in Qingdao, but due to adverse weather and poor visibility, it crashed into a mountain and was burned. After the plane crashed, the China National Aviation Corporation immediately dispatched two planes to the accident site to search. It is now known that one of the pilots was Mr. Kellogg. The search results were immediately reported to Qingdao, stating that the plane had been severely damaged and no surviving passengers were seen. At this time, the Qingdao office of the China National Aviation Corporation immediately organized a rescue team to venture into the area controlled by the CCP where the accident occurred. In the early morning, they discovered the wreckage of the plane, and all passengers and crew members had died. It is reported that the Qingdao seaside airfield has radar equipment and is used by the U.S. Marine Corps Aviation, and its communications equipment is rarely seen anywhere else in the country, but the plane did not make contact with ground radar, and ultimately crashed into a mountain and burned in weather with only 800 feet of visibility, which is also a tragic event!

Shen Desie, the general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, Tweed, the American director, and Gao Dajing, the business director, were summoned to Beijing yesterday, but were unable to travel in the morning due to adverse weather. The company also planned to send a special plane to Qingdao yesterday to rush to handle the aftermath, but it was unsuccessful due to weather conditions.

It is reported that the Ministry of Communications was very concerned after hearing about this and will revise the takeoff weather standards to improve the safety of passengers in the future. After the suspension order was implemented, according to statistics from the Ministry of Communications, 77 civil aviation aircraft will be suspended, including 40 belonging to the China National Aviation Corporation (23 C-47, DC-3, C-53 types, 20 C-46s, and 6 DC-4s), and 28 belonging to the Central Air Transport Corporation (16 C-47, DC-3, C-53 types, and 12 C-46s). The number of aircraft deployed by the two companies each day is approximately 30. According to Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, during the suspension period, takeoff weather standards will be revised. The takeoff weather standards for Shanghai Airport are still satisfactory, but Qingdao, Beijing, Guangzhou and other places need to be revised more strictly. At the same time, experts will meet with the heads of the two companies during this period to review the equipment of each company, and the Ministry of Communications will also send personnel to participate when necessary.

### American Plane Ventures Out; Confirms Plane Crash

U.S. Military Releases Details of Handling

[Our Newspaper] The American Navy authorities in this city released a statement late last night regarding the details of the U.S. military's handling of the crash of China National Aviation Corporation's Flight 121 in Qingdao. According to the American spokesperson, although the China National Aviation Corporation did not notify the U.S. side in advance that a plane was landing in Qingdao on the morning of the 5th, in accordance with past practice, the U.S. Navy's landing equipment was fully supplied for use. The U.S. Navy initially received a telegram from the China National Aviation Corporation stating that "a plane was overdue and had not arrived" at 12:10 PM. Although the weather was extremely bad at the time, the Navy still dispatched a seaplane to venture out to search and rescue. Shortly after the plane departed, the pilot, E.C. Smith, received a report from the China National Aviation Corporation that the wreckage of the crashed plane had been found at the foot of a 1,100-foot-high mountain five miles northeast of Qingdao Airport. Pilot Smith flew to the location and confirmed that the report was true. Colonel McIntyre, the commander of Qingdao Airport, immediately dispatched a search and rescue team to the accident site, accompanied by representatives of the China National Aviation Corporation. It was discovered at the time that the plane had been completely destroyed and no passengers or flight personnel had survived.

Therefore, the company specially requested the Ministry of Communications to suspend passenger transport but not freight and mail transport. The Ministry of Communications replied by telegram on the afternoon of the 6th, approving the request. As for the China National Aviation Corporation, the company in Beijing has also requested the Ministry of Communications to do the same. According to a person in charge of the Post Office, all airmail will still be accepted.

### Nanjing Area Implements Amnesty Decree; District Court Has Released More Than 30 Prisoners; Courts in Beijing Study Release Procedures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] After the National Government issued the amnesty decree, the Capital Area was ordered to implement it after the publication of the decree on New Year's Day. In recent days, both the Capital High Court and District Court have been extremely busy. The High Court, in addition to ruling all cases where the most severe sentence already handed down was imprisonment for a definite period or less to be dismissed for those who have applied for reconsideration and appealed, in accordance with Article 194, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Chief Justice Zhao Chen also met with Hu Taifu, the head of the prison section of the court on the 6th to give detailed instructions on the work of releasing prisoners, which will be implemented soon. The District Court began implementation on the 4th, and has released more than 30 prisoners in the past two days. Currently, the prisoners in the ordinary cells of Tiger Bridge Prison are discussing this topic every day, calculating how they will be pardoned or have their sentences reduced, and are extremely happy and excited. However, the group of traitors in the "cell" is quite uneasy and is brewing a request for clemency,妄想妄想 to escape punishment.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The amnesty decree has arrived in Beiping, and the Hebei High Court and District Court in Beiping are investigating prisoners and studying release procedures. According to investigations, among the more than 1,800 prisoners held in the First Prison, excluding more than 600 traitors, about half of the remaining prisoners may have their sentences reduced or be pardoned. Among the more than 1,800 prisoners in the Second Prison, about three-fifths meet the requirements of the amnesty decree.

### Peking University Will Act as Guardian to Assist Violated Female Student; Hu Shi Hosts Reporters to Release Statement

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Hu Shi hosted reporters at 7:00 PM today to discuss the rape of a Peking University female student, Ms. Shen, by an American soldier. Mr. Hu first denied the rumors that Ms. Shen had gone to Shanghai, saying that Shen was still in Beiping and maintained contact with the school and other relevant parties every day. The claim that Shen had lost her freedom was even more absurd, because Shen had no relatives in Beiping, and Peking University, acting as her guardian, hired three law professors from Peking University, Yan Shutang and Fei Qing, and Tsinghua University Professor Cai Shujing, as her legal advisors to provide assistance. In addition, Disctrict Court Prosecutor Ji Yuan is also collecting evidence. Shen suffered six injuries at the time due to the American soldier's violent behavior, and two still remain.

### Li Shifang Dies in Plane Crash; Dr. Mei Mourns His Prize Pupil, Unable to Sleep; Yao Yufu Sighs That His Beloved Son-in-Law's Fate Was Sealed

[Our Newspaper's Report] Among the passengers who perished in this disaster was the famous Peking opera star "Little Mei Lanfang," Li Shifang (see picture).

Li was one of Mei Lanfang's favorite disciples. He had been staying at Mei's residence in Shanghai for more than half a year. Recently, under the personal guidance of his teacher Mei, he learned many "skills" and "movements," and his artistry became even more refined. Mei Lanfang was also deeply satisfied. Two days before the accident (i.e., the evening of the 2nd of this month), he even performed "Jinshan Temple" with his teacher Mei Lanfang at the China Theater. Unexpectedly, this performance became his swan song. At a time when Peking opera talents are dwindling, it is truly regrettable!

When Mei Lanfang received the news of the plane crash at around 10 o'clock the night before, he was heartbroken and could not sleep all night, becoming like a "tearful person." Until yesterday, he was listless and unable to eat. He even considered canceling the last performance of "Feng Huan Chao," but after persuasion from all sides, he reluctantly appeared on stage with sorrow.

However, when Mei Lanfang went to the "China" backstage last night, his eyes were still red and swollen, and his "eyebrows" were furrowed as he sat blankly in the dressing room, silently looking at the mirror. His wife was by his side, her eyes also filled with tears, unable to bear the grief. At this time, the gongs and drums were loud, but Mei seemed unmoved, his mind in turmoil, feeling at a loss as to what to do.

According to Yao Yufu, Li Shifang's father-in-law, Li was an only son, only 26 years old, and had been married for four years, with three daughters. His youngest daughter had not even had the chance to see him. The entire family currently resides in Peiping. Before the trip, Mei Lanfang, knowing that plane crashes happened repeatedly, advised him to postpone his trip and take a sea vessel instead, but in the end, he thought that such a coincidence would not happen, and resolutely departed. Unexpectedly, this trip became a permanent farewell. Yao sighed deeply and said, "What else can I say? I can only attribute it to fate!"

The Co-Pilot Wan Hanguang Was Also Studying at Guanghua University

[Our Newspaper's Report] Co-pilot Wan Hanguang, a native of Hunan, was 26 years old. He lived at No. 29 Minde Lane, Huangdu Road, Sichuan Road. He was amiable and graduated from the first class of the Civil Aviation Driving Training Program in Labehe, China. In addition to working as a co-pilot at China National Aviation Corporation, he was also a sophomore in the Department of Biology at Guanghua University in this city (student number 7703). He had a girlfriend, Xiong Lanying, who was studying at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. During the New Year holiday, she came to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 5th, he left Shanghai Tower to go to Hangzhou to take the final exam, but he did not know that his beloved would die in the disaster. Before the flight, Wan Hanguang had left a leave application for the Guanghua University Student Guidance Group. The application had not been sent out when this misfortune occurred. Because he usually hid the fact that he was studying and working at the same time, the authorities at Guanghua University may not yet know the full story. (The picture is of Wan Hanguang.)

Flying Tiger Pilot, Sharkey, Also Perished

The American pilot of the crashed plane, Charles Joseph Sharkey, was originally scheduled to resign from the company in two or three months and return to the United States with his Russian wife, Lydia. Unexpectedly, the flight to Peiping became a permanent farewell. His wife was originally scheduled to go to the United States before Christmas, but she stayed in Shanghai waiting for Sharkey to go with her. Late last night, Lydia asked friends to call various newspapers to inquire about Sharkey's whereabouts.

According to reports, Sharkey used to be under the command of General Chennault's Flying Tigers. The first group of seven members of the team flew over the Hump to supply China. Six of them had already passed away, and Mr. Sharkey was the last surviving one. Mr. Sharkey had received a medal from the Chinese government.

British businessman James J. Ross served in the police station during the concession era and was one of the people in charge of the Jingnv Temple area. He had many friends in Shanghai.

In addition, Zhang Ruyan, an editor of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, was transferred to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao as an editor by order of the newspaper. Unfortunately, he encountered this catastrophe and died on the coast of Qingdao. This is indeed a great loss of a talented editor for the Ta Kung Pao, and also a loss of a strong general in the journalistic field. Before Mr. Zhang left Shanghai, he was in a "hot love" period, and the date of his engagement was not far away, but now he has "left forever," which is also sad! According to reports, Mr. Zhang graduated from the Department of Journalism at Yanjing University in Chengdu in 1944.

### Communist Party of China Obstructs Dike-Closing Project; Xue Dubi Protests; Hopes for a Solid Guarantee That No More Acts of Destruction Will Occur

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 6th] Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, sent a letter to the delegation of the Communist Party of China on the 6th regarding the Yellow River management issue, protesting the destruction of the Luwang Dike Quarry by the Communist troops during the construction period and the disappearance of more than 200 workers. He also hoped that the Communist Party of China would guarantee that no similar incidents would occur in the future and release the captured workers. The full text of his letter is as follows: "Dear Sirs: The Luwang Dike Quarry in Xinxiang was destroyed by the Communist army in May last year. Later, Mr. Zhou Enlai of your party replied in a letter on June 11, stating: 'In addition to ordering the escort of the 15 captured workers back to work, the responsible authorities have been ordered to severely punish the perpetrators and ensure that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and to cooperate fully in accordance with the river management agreement,' etc. However, in December, this commission received telegrams from the Yellow River Dike-Closing and Restoration Project Bureau, stating that on December 9, at 12:00 PM, more than 600 bandits suddenly entered the Luwang Dike Quarry, destroying three mountain-opening machines, one bulldozer, and auxiliary tools such as ten large trucks, one large jeep, and auxiliary tool parts, burning 88 large barrels of gasoline, and kidnapping six workers from the quarry, seven guards, and six rifles. It was later found that this was done by the 51st Regiment of Huang Xinru's unit in the Fourth Sub-District of the Taihang Military Region. At the same time, this commission also received telegrams from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the Hebei and Shandong Flood Prevention Offices of the commission, stating that Communist troops harassed the vicinity of a section of the construction site south of Changyuan County, Hebei Province, and kidnapped two workers, etc. In May last year, this commission, together with the representatives of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and your party, discussed and agreed on the implementation plan in Beijing. This commission has always followed this agreement and carried out the project accordingly. However, your party not only did not act in accordance with the agreement, but repeatedly violated its promises, even ordering the army to plunder the stone quarry and kidnap the workers. It is extremely obvious that this was a planned act of sabotage. It is hoped that your party will ensure that no similar incidents will occur in the future, and immediately order the release of the kidnapped quarry workers and guards to facilitate the work. I hope to receive a reply. Respectfully, To the Delegation of the Communist Party of China."

### Mr. Xue Discusses the Status of the Dike-Closing Construction with Reporters

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 6th] On the 6th, a reporter visited Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, who explained the recent construction situation of the Huayuankou Dike-Closing Project as follows: (1) Current Status of the Dike-Closing Project: The old line caisson of the dike entrance was connected on December 11. The current width of the dike entrance is about 200 meters, and the depth varies from about 2 to 3 meters. After continuous rock throwing, the water level gradually rose. From December 27, a portion of the water has flowed into the old channel, and as of New Year's Day, the canal head has reached the territory of Kaifeng County; (2) Dike Restoration Project: The dike section on our side has been completed successively, only approaching the Communist area, the construction is difficult, and it is difficult to complete on schedule. As for the restoration of the dike section in the Communist area, it is far from the originally planned standard, and it is rumored that the entire dike section has been leveled, completely losing its flood prevention effectiveness. Once the water is officially released, the danger is worrying; (3) Dike-Closing Project: Due to the flood season, it was once suspended, and work was resumed in September after the major flood. However, due to the deep scouring of the dike entrance during the flood season, the water level rose from time to time after the flood, the difficulty of building a new line and transporting stone materials, the planned project progress has not been achieved. It is estimated that the completion of the dike will take place in mid-to-late January of this year. We are now working hard to overcome all difficulties and work day and night; (4) Communist Party of China's Dissent During the Dike-Closing Process: During the negotiations in Beijing, Shanghai, Bian, and Xin, the Communist Party of China expressed its support in principle for the dike-closing and restoration project, but it declared two or three times that the issues of dike-closing, dike restoration, and relocation of residents in the old riverbed must be considered and addressed comprehensively. In the past six months, the other party has repeatedly protested against the dike-closing and stone-throwing and digging of diversion canals in Huayuankou, firstly claiming that there was a shortage of engineering flour and the dike restoration could not be completed, and secondly claiming that they had not yet received the relocation fees and the residents in the riverbed could not be relocated. Their excuses for delaying and obstructing have not stopped at all; (5) Impact of Closing the Dike and Releasing Water on the Dike Section in the Communist Party Area: Before the restoration of the dike and the relocation of residents in the Communist Party area downstream are completed, once the dike is closed and water is released, no one can predict the situation that will occur under the direction of the Communist Party of China. Even if an agreement is reached again and work is rushed, it will take a considerable amount of time.

### Relief Funds for Relocating Riverbed Residents to Be Disbursed Soon; UNRRA Corrects Dong Biwu's Protests

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 6th] UNRRA and representatives of the Communist Party of China have been negotiating a plan to provide relief to riverbed residents in Shanghai for several days and have now reached an agreement. Relief funds will be transported and disbursed soon.

[Our City] News: Yesterday, Mr. Dong Biwu, the representative of the Communist Party of China, suddenly issued a protest letter in Beijing to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Water Conservancy Commission. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter visited the spokesman of UNRRA, who gave the following statement:

"The protest letter issued by Mr. Dong Biwu is broad, and the issue of water release at Huayuankou belongs to the scope of the project. This office has not yet received a report and is investigating. However, the section on the riverbed residents' relief fund mentioned by Mr. Dong involves the business of this office and must be explained in order to clarify the truth to all parties: After the riverbed residents' relief fund was submitted to the government for approval in November last year, Director Huo of this office immediately invited representatives of the Communist Party of China, General Egerton of UNRRA, and the person in charge of the Water Conservancy Commission to discuss the implementation plan. They unanimously agreed that two-thirds of the total amount would be issued on January 5 of this year, and the remainder would be issued at the end of January of this year. Once the principle was established, the specific implementation plan was discussed. Since November 23 of last year, six meetings have been held, but unexpectedly, difficulties have been encountered each time, and new problems have been constantly raised, so that this office's hope to solve the problem of relieving the riverbed residents has not yet been realized. Representatives from UNRRA attended each of the above six meetings and knew the crux of the matter like the back of their hands. No matter how many side issues arose, this office always sought compromise in order to benefit the disaster victims. During the negotiation process, the basic position of this office was based on the principle agreed upon in the past by former Director Jiang Yanfu and Mr. Zhou Enlai (that is, relief materials and funds must be directly given to the people in need of relief by this office). Other than this, nothing is impossible to concede...

The above is the actual situation of the negotiation process. Mr. Dong's protest letter states that 'UNRRA is using side issues to delay the riverbed relief fund until now,' which is obviously inconsistent with the actual situation. The government has already allocated the first phase of funds for the relief of riverbed residents to this office long ago. According to the person in charge, negotiations have largely agreed, and if no new problems arise, the disbursement will begin soon. I only hope to sympathize with the suffering of the people and facilitate the smooth completion of the relief plan."

### Huang Hua Returns to Peiping from Handan; Says the Water Release Issue Is Serious

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Peiping, 6th] A member of the Communist Party of China's military delegation in Handan returned to Peiping yesterday. According to reports, after the Yellow River returned to its old course and water was released from the Second Diversion River on the 28th of last month, it has formed another serious problem. If the government does not allow the Communist Party's request (that is, closing the Diversion River mouth and reissuing 15 billion yuan for the relocation of riverbed residents and the remaining 4 billion yuan for dike repair), and postpones the dike closure for five months, the Communist Party will take appropriate action. It was also stated that the water flow is not fast, with an average depth of about one meter and a maximum width of about 20 li. There are about 600,000 residents in the riverbed in the Communist area, and more than 7 million residents on both sides. Shi Shushi, Zhou Enlai's representative, went to the front line from Handan on the 3rd at the call of Liu Bocheng to discuss countermeasures. Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the 18th Army Group, is currently in Handan.

### To Regulate Civilian Needs and Balance Grain Prices, The Northeast Decides to Establish Ever-Normal Granaries

Purchasing Agricultural Grain at Market Prices to Avoid Low Grain Prices Harming Farmers

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] Commodity prices in the Northeast have been rising frequently recently. However, the prices of agricultural products, which are the source of livelihood for farmers, have not kept pace with general prices, making farmers' livelihoods increasingly difficult. In the past, one stone of grain could be exchanged for three bolts of cloth, but today, one bolt of cloth can be exchanged for one stone of grain. The phenomenon of low grain prices harming farmers has become a serious threat to the rural Northeast. With this in mind, the economic authorities in the Northeast plan to establish ever-normal granaries in the near future to regulate civilian needs and balance grain prices. According to Liang Jingzheng, Director of the Field and Grain Department of the Economic Commission: The establishment of ever-normal granaries is not for fiscal purposes, but purely for economic purposes. The government has absolutely no intention of profiting from it. In the future, the purchase of grain will not be handled by local governments to avoid mismanagement that harms farmers, or to repeat the Japanese era's collection system that exploited farmers, nor will it be purchased by large companies. The ever-normal granary method is to purchase at market prices, allowing farmers to store grain, and to sell it at fair prices during times of shortage to suppress grain prices. If managed properly, it will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood in profound and far-reaching ways.

### Rescue Airplanes! Rescue Lives!

— Huang Xiaqian

The unfortunate incidents in China's aviation industry last year occurred one after another, which was indeed too serious. As early as the beginning of spring last year, General Dai Li died in a plane crash. Before and after this incident, two other airline planes and one transport plane of the Aeronautical Affairs Commission crashed. After a plane of the Central Company crashed in Changxing County on December 14, another plane of the Central Company and two planes of the China Company were destroyed in this city on Christmas Day, resulting in more than 80 casualties. Only a few days into this year, and on the morning of the 5th, another China Company Shanghai-Ping Plane crashed near Qingdao, killing all 43 crew members and passengers. Reports said, "The flesh and blood were blurred and unrecognizable," and the tragic situation can be imagined. One airplane after another crashes, piles upon piles of dead people appear, and batches upon batches of property are lost. How can this not be shocking! China's airplanes are already few in number, and purchasing more is also very expensive. If such losses continue, won't we be depleted? China's aviation industry is just beginning. The appearance of piles upon piles of dead people will surely make those who intend to fly retreat. If an even more important figure in the country also dies in a plane crash, wouldn't that be a loss that the country and the nation can never compensate for? Therefore, after the repeated plane crashes today, we cannot but shout loudly: "Quickly rescue the airplanes! Rescue the lives!"

Rescuing airplanes is not difficult. Just analyze the causes of the plane crashes, and it will be easily understood. The causes of several plane crashes in China last year have been recorded in the newspapers. In summary, it is nothing more than bad weather. The cause of the crash of the China Company Shanghai-Ping Plane in Qingdao the other day was still due to weather (fog). It can be seen that if we want to rescue airplanes that have not yet crashed and the lives of people who have not yet died, we can only pay attention to the weather. Although the weather cannot be created by human power, nor is it easy to change by human power, it can be investigated by human power and can be predicted by human power. The accuracy of prediction has already reached more than 90%. Except for minor details, the changes in weather that can affect flight safety can be completely predicted. Just imagine, if before the airplane takes off, the weather conditions along the way and at the destination can be known clearly, where would there be a foolish pilot like a "moth to a flame"?

In recent years, most of the airplane crashes in the United States have been due to weather conditions. Therefore, they seek safety in navigation by paying attention to the weather. Each airline company has meteorological personnel who are specially responsible for weather observation and forecasting. Before each airplane takes off, they must go to the meteorological personnel's office to check the weather map and listen to the meteorological personnel's explanation of the weather and instructions for the flight, so that the pilot knows the weather conditions along the way and at the destination clearly before taking off. Recently, the dispatchers of various airports in the United States (i.e., the personnel who control whether airplanes take off or not) have also been replaced by meteorological personnel to increase the authority of the meteorological personnel so that they can control whether airplanes take off or not based on the weather conditions. As for these few recent airplane crashes, although they were due to poor weather, this kind of weather was neither sudden nor something that the meteorological aspect could not pay attention to. Take the matter on Christmas Day as an example: the Meteorological General Station of the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense had already said in the radio weather forecast on the 24th that the visibility was only one mile. The broadcast forecast at 11:00 AM on the 25th even clearly stated that the visibility would drop to half a mile and three-sixteenths of a mile, making landing very difficult. The heavy fog in Qingdao the other day is a common phenomenon in the morning of winter. It is very easy to dissipate when the sun rises for a long time. Unfortunately, the aviation companies in our country have not yet earnestly carried out meteorological work, let alone the various measures before the airplanes take off in the United States. Therefore, in addition to the harm caused by darkness and poor visibility, morning fog can also cause accidents. Without talking about the past, the transportation authorities should learn from the lessons of the previous airplane crashes, urge the aviation companies to pay close attention to the weather and carry out meteorological work, rescue the airplanes that have not crashed, and rescue the lives that have not been sacrificed. Even if it slightly increases the expenses, it is better than losing 2.5 billion yuan at a time and also losing dozens of lives!

### Review of Shanghai's Municipal Health Administration

— Zhou Li

From the first meeting of the Municipal Council to now, half a year has passed in a flash. During these six months, the various measures of the municipal authorities have had commendable aspects and disappointing aspects. Now, let's explore the health aspects. Our overall impression of the city's health administration is that there are many words and few actions, and in practice, there are more changes in organization and personnel and less progress in business.

Health work is the most practical work, and there is no need for "many words." We believe that the person in charge of the Health Bureau will not build castles in the air when facing the countless practical problems of Shanghai. However, the plan proposed to us by the Health Bureau is a "Twenty-Five Year Plan." Twenty-five years is a long time. In this era of drastic changes, for many factors related to the plan itself, not to mention being unable to control, it is also impossible to grasp. Therefore, saying that the plan will last for twenty-five years is really unimaginable.

Looking back at reality. First, in terms of pharmaceutical management, for example, the control of hospitals and clinics. There are clear regulations in the central government's laws and regulations: what is a clinic, what is a hospital. Many so-called hospitals in Shanghai can only be called clinics in terms of equipment and conditions. According to the law, the Health Bureau must review and correct this. And this is a very easy thing to do. However, as far as we know, some hospitals that are not hospitals have been approved and registered by the Health Bureau under their original names. Just look at the list of hospitals published in the newspaper that are treating opium addicts, and you can know this fact. In terms of drug management, the central government also stipulates in laws and regulations that finished medicines without a license are not allowed to be sold. The responsibility for inspection and crackdown also belongs to the local health authorities. There are many unqualified drugs sold in Shanghai, but the Health Bureau does not interfere. The best thing is that drug advertisements must be checked by the Health Bureau before they can be published in the newspaper, but the Health Bureau also lightly passes drugs that have not obtained a license. The so-called "Setapyrine," a special drug for treating tuberculosis, is an example. It was not until later, when the pharmaceutical industry made trouble and there were severe criticisms from the public, that the Health Bureau began to register and announce that it would implement drug management. From these two things, we can see the slow pace of the Health Bureau's actions.

Shanghai's public medical undertakings, at the beginning of the victory, used the institutions left over from the enemy and puppet era as a foundation and reorganized and enriched them, which had already possessed a considerable scale. However, in the past six months, almost all of these municipal hospitals, maternity hospitals, sanatoriums, etc., have had personnel problems and funding problems, especially the economic difficulties that have forced these undertakings to falter. Originally, the Health Bureau adopted a mandatory "self-sufficiency" policy for all of these medical institutions. The so-called "self-sufficiency" means that the Health Bureau does not give money, and each hospital must find its own way to find money in order to maintain survival. This decision made the hospital authorities heartache, and especially the general public heartache. On the one hand, we heard the Health Bureau's plan to add hospitals and increase beds. On the other hand, we saw the Health Bureau wanting patients to bear the expenses of the municipal hospitals. On the one hand, we heard the people in charge of health administration constantly saying that they wanted to implement a public medical system. On the other hand, we only saw them using the principle of "self-sufficiency" to tell the hospitals to close their doors to the poor! In addition, the health authorities have not been able to make proper use of relief materials; for example, for the enemy-operated pharmacies that have been taken over, we knew in the past that there was a drug supply office that used the houses and drugs to serve the citizens for a while. Now, the drug supply office has been canceled, and those houses are said to have mostly been used as staff dormitories, and some are still closed, along with the original materials, piled up with dust.

Second, in terms of health care and disease prevention, we know that the health authorities have paid great attention to disease prevention work in the past six months. When it comes to disease prevention achievements, they seem to be very proud of themselves, so let's start with disease prevention. We cannot deny that when cholera occurred in Shanghai last year, the disease prevention personnel of the Health Bureau worked day and night and did a lot of hard work, and it is obvious that the epidemic did not expand because of the containment efforts, most importantly, there was considerable preparation at the beginning. We would like to offer two suggestions here: 1. There should be a regular plan for disease prevention, and it should not only be a temporary response. 2. Various disease prevention facilities should be maintained as needed. Under the principle of hospitals being "self-sufficient," it is absolutely unreasonable to ask the two infectious disease hospitals to be self-sufficient as well.

Third, in terms of environmental hygiene: for example, the cleanliness of streets and alleys has not been resolved half a year ago, it has not been resolved half a year later, and it seems to be more serious, even without a solution. It is not that the sanitation workers are unwilling to serve diligently, but we have never seen them exert the greatest work efficiency for the public. The Health Bureau has recently come up with a method called "Cleanliness Zone Control," trying to marry this responsibility to the poorly organized Pao-Chia heads. We think that "Cleanliness Zone Control" is an interesting concept, but if it is implemented, because the Pao-Chia themselves are not healthy enough, I am afraid that the cleaning work will only get worse and worse. Not to say that such a new system of "Cleanliness Zone Control" is difficult to implement, even calling for building a trash can in every neighborhood, after mobilizing for so many days, has not been completed. However, we think that building trash cans is not too difficult, the difference seems to be that the municipal authorities are not督促 enough. From the trash cans, we think of public toilets. Shanghai is a vast urban area, and the number of public toilets is insufficient. To this end, the municipal government has allocated huge sums of money to the Health Bureau, ordering it to choose a location to add public toilets. We know that the Health Bureau has already received this special fund, but it has not been used on public toilets. It is said that it was used for disease prevention work, and it is also said that it was transferred to purchase garbage trucks. No matter where it is used, we always feel that adding public toilets is really necessary, and this measure of the municipal government is correct. The Health Bureau did not follow the original plan to implement, and it is wrong to transfer funds for designated purposes to other uses.

Then there is the collection and transportation of feces. The Health Bureau has not made any progress in this regard in the past six months. The extortion of the night soil carriers is still the same, and the leakage of the night soil trucks is still the same. Fundamentally, the Health Bureau has been hesitant about whether to maintain the city's management of this business or solicit business to contract it out in the past six months. In the past, Shanghai's night soil business has always been contracted out to merchants. Because there were many drawbacks in business, after the victory, the Health Bureau resolutely took it over for self-management, which was indeed a wise measure. However, once the head of the Health Bureau changed, the merchants' discussion followed, and later this discussion suddenly stopped; but recently, I heard that it was decided to change it to commercial management. The Health Bureau is continuing to run it itself, and then it wants to solicit merchants to contract it out. I don't know why it has changed so many times?

### Suzhou Holds First Public Trial of Prominent Figure for Extortion Case; Defendant Completely Reverses Previous Confession; Witnesses Suspected of Colluding in Fraud

[Report from our Suzhou Office, 6th] The notorious case of celebrity Fan Junbo extorting a huge sum of money from an illegal underground bank, after being investigated twice by the Wu County District Procuratorate and found to be true, the District Court's Criminal Division held its first public trial this afternoon at 2:00 PM after indicting Fan Junbo on charges of fraud. The defendant, Fan Junbo, and witnesses Wang Yizhi, Lu Tiesun, and Wu Bingzhang, all reported on time for questioning. However, it seemed that they had colluded beforehand and completely overturned their original confessions in the City Defense Department and the District Procuratorate, claiming that Fan had borrowed from Wang Yangzhi and the other two in a private capacity, etc., causing Judge Wang Xiuqing presiding over the trial to become extremely angry. In addition to refuting Fan's testimony one by one, he also warned the three witnesses, Wang Yangzhi, Lu Tiesun, and Wu Bingzhang, that they were suspected of colluding in fraud. As a result, the court ordered that related parties such as the Li Zhenji Clothing Store be summoned for questioning, and adjourned the trial until a later date. The defendant Fan Junbo was still released on bail by the original three shop guarantors, and the others were ordered to return and await summons.

[Report from our Suzhou Office, 6th] In recent days, the prices of rice and flour in Suzhou have skyrocketed. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the lives of the poor are difficult to imagine. Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has received a report and specifically telegraphed the local county government today, ordering it to immediately convene the Rice and Grain Trade Association and relevant agencies upon receipt of the telegram to earnestly discuss effective suppression methods, strictly prohibit hoarding and speculation, strengthen control, and the county government, upon receiving the telegram, convened an emergency meeting of the Price Evaluation Committee this afternoon and decided on various emergency measures.

### Training Technical Personnel to Use Hydraulic Machinery; The Water Conservancy Commission Will Establish a Training Class in Haining

[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will ship a large number of hydraulic engineering machinery to China this year, most of which will be allocated to the Yellow River, followed by the Qiantang River, and then the Pearl River, Yangtze River, and Huai River. If they can be used well, they will play a major role in the history of construction engineering in China, leading us out of the naive era of manual construction and into the mechanical era. Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, therefore specifically suggested that the Water Conservancy Commission establish a technical personnel training class in Haining. Chairman Xue Yuyu agreed to allocate additional funds. According to Wang's words to the reporter, there is no problem with funds and teachers. The school site is decided to be located beside the Sea God Temple, with the repair workshop of the Seawall Engineering Bureau as the laboratory, and mobile houses as dormitories, specializing in training machinery driving and young engineers, so as to cultivate technical talents and build a new China of machinery.

[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] The quarrying project of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau in Tangshan, Fuyang is progressing smoothly. Two transport ships have already been allocated for transportation today, and 15 barges, and trucks are also not a big problem. It is also reported from Tangshan that iron ore was discovered during quarrying, but the ore layer is still thin. If a large number of ore deposits are encountered in the future, it will be possible to find a way to mine them, which is an unexpected harvest.

### Wenling Borrows and Sells Tax Grain to Pay Civil Servants' Salary Arrears

[Report from our Wenling Office] The living expenses of the employees of the various agencies affiliated to the Wenling County Government have been delayed due to the difficult local finances, causing the employees to repeatedly urge the county government to issue them. It is now learned that the county government, in order to cope with urgent needs, plans to allocate 900 shi of field tax grain, divided into six districts: Wenjiao, Taiping, Zeguo, Panlang, Zhuhong, and Xinhe, each allocating 150 shi, to be sold and converted into money to pay salaries. The price of the public sale was assessed at 18,900 yuan per shi, and the public bidding and sale will be held on January 6.

### Changshu has 920,000 People, 16,000 Conscripts

[Report from our Changshu Office] The county government has completed the annual household registration statistics for the entire county at the end of the year, with a total of 82 townships, 994 pao, 15,075 chia, 307,281 households, 464,747 males, 456,902 females, totaling 921,649 people, including 16,267 conscripts.

### Rebuilding Tianmu Mountain

[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] West Tianmu Mountain in Zhejiang Province runs across Lin'an and Yuqian and is a famous scenic spot in the country. However, it was a guerrilla area during the Anti-Japanese War, and there are still many scars and the scenery is greatly diminished. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is planning to reorganize East and West Tianmu Mountain, restore the original forests, protect the existing forests, repair tourist routes, and build hostels in West Tianmu Mountain, designating the mountain as a protected forest area. The Construction Department is preparing detailed plans.

### Suzhou Tenant Farmers Resist Rent; Landlords Request Relief

[Report from our Suzhou Office] More than a thousand landlords in Suzhou recently sent a telegram to the Provisional Council in the joint names of Shen Yizhuang and Fan Yizhuang, stating that since the collection of rent began on November 11 last year, it has been 50 days. However, due to the tenant farmers' united resistance to payment, the average collection rate across the county is only about 20%, making promotion difficult and causing deep anxiety. Furthermore, most landlords rely on winter rent for their daily needs, and some even live beyond their means, borrowing to make ends meet. Now the year is coming to an end, and the collection of grain taxes is very urgent. However, taxes come from rent, and rent comes from land. If there is no relief, it will not only affect the payment of grain taxes, but also have serious direct and indirect consequences for the survival of landlords and the adjustment of the entire social economy. The request is that the council quickly consult with the county government to strengthen the mediation mechanism and implement compulsory rent collection in order to maintain rent and taxes.

### Zhejiang Province Strengthens Fisheries Protection; Under the Unified Coordination of the Water Police Bureau

[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 6th] In order to strengthen maritime security and protect the livelihoods of fishermen in Zhejiang Province, fishing protection vessels are being purchased and allocated to the Water Police Bureau for application. Personnel and weapons are also under the unified coordination and allocation of the Bureau. With the exception of the Wenzhou and Taizhou areas, where the aftermath of the fishing protection team still exists and there are still special forces, the fishing protection teams in other counties are not established. The fishing protection teams organized by the counties approved by the Seventh and Eighth District Commissioners are planned to be temporarily set up, referring to the Wenling example, and will still be under the unified management of the Water Police Bureau, and will be supervised and directed by the District Commissioners and the Fisheries Bureau, and the expenses will be the responsibility of the Fishermen's Association.

### Wuxi Land Registration to be Completed in Four Months

[Report from our Wuxi Office] The Land Consolidation Office of this county is handling land registration in 21 townships in the urban area. In addition to issuing ownership certificates in Zhongyi, Zhonger, Zhongsanyi, and Zhongsiyi towns, the rest are still in the public announcement period. However, the land administration in Wuxi was largely destroyed during the enemy and puppet period, resulting in more than a thousand land dispute cases, which are currently being mediated separately. The Provincial Land Administration Bureau specifically stipulated that the registration period in this county is four months, which will be the end, and then land registration in the four townships will be handled.

### Bao Shan and Jia Ding Counties Urge the Establishment of Public Opinion Organizations

[Report from our Bao Shan correspondent] The county government has repeatedly ordered various townships and towns in this county to complete the establishment of public opinion organizations within a set deadline and report back. It is now learned that the county government, considering that the deadline has passed and that repeated directives have been received from higher authorities, cannot delay any further. Therefore, separate telegrams have been sent to the heads of various townships and towns, setting a deadline of January 10 for the completion of the establishment of public opinion organizations.

[Report from our Jia Ding correspondent] The list of candidates for Type A and Type B public positions in this county has recently been submitted by the county government to the provincial government for approval and promulgation. The list includes 307 candidates for Type A positions, such as Gao Xiao-da, and 2298 candidates for Type B positions, such as Wu Bao-zhen. The county government has been dispatching personnel to various township and town people's representative conferences in recent days to actively supervise and guide the legal election of representatives. The deadline for completion is January 10, in order to continue the election of county councilors and formally establish a democratically elected county council.

### Shanghai County's Land Tax to Impose Late Payment Surcharges

[Report from our Min Hang correspondent] Regarding the Shanghai County land tax for the 35th year of the Republic, the county government began collecting it as early as September 15th of last year. However, although more than three months have passed, only two-fifths of the total tax amount for the entire county has been paid. It is now learned that the county government, according to provincial government regulations, will impose a 5% late payment surcharge on all land taxes paid from now until the end of this month. If payment is still not made after the deadline, a 10% late payment surcharge will be imposed. If payment is not made within two months of the deadline, a 20% late payment surcharge will be imposed. In order to facilitate tax payments for farmers, the county government has decided to temporarily postpone the closure of land tax offices in Min Hang, Bei Qiao, Qiao Qiao, San Lin, Chen Hang, and other places.

### Nan Chang to Po Yang and Le Ping Shipping Routes to Use Shallow-Draft Steamers

[Report from our Wu Yuan correspondent] The shipping route from Nan Chang to Po Yang, Le Ping has recently been experiencing difficulties due to the shallow waters of the lake. In order to facilitate water transportation, shipping companies have jointly formed a company to create more than a dozen shallow-draft steamers and new-style wooden barges to exclusively operate on this route. The cost of building each steam barge is estimated to be over 20 million yuan. Shipping from Jing De Zhen and Wu Yuan to Rao Zhou is also experiencing delays due to the low water levels in the winter river. Freight charges have increased by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per shi (unit of weight), and many boatmen have suspended operations due to frequent official duties along the way.

### Chairman Wang Mao Gong Continues to Inspect Northern Jiangsu

[Report from our Yang Zhou correspondent on the 6th] Wang Mao Gong did not return to Zhen on the 4th. Instead, he went from Yang Zhou to Gao You, where he inspected the self-defense forces in Xian Nv Miao despite the rain. On the morning of the 5th, he went from You to Xing Hua and will return south to inspect Yi Zheng, Liu He, and Chang Heng.

### Ancient Coins Unearthed in Nan Zhao - A Jar of Coins with Brilliant Green Patina - Workers Get a Windfall and Grab Everything

[Report from our Kai Feng correspondent] Nan Zhao County in Henan Province decided to repair its old and dilapidated city walls and deepen the city moat to prepare for emergencies. Recently, more than a hundred workers were excavating the city moat in the south of the eastern gate when they suddenly discovered an ancient magnetic jar about six feet deep in the soil. The jar was filled with ancient coins, with a brilliant green patina that was dazzling to the eye. At that moment, the workers, considering this a sudden windfall, rushed to grab the coins. In an instant, the entire jar of ancient coins was emptied. The ancient coins were covered in seal script inscriptions and a magnificent rust patina. Some said they were ancient coins from the Han Dynasty, while others claimed they were coins from the time of Cheng Yao Jin during the Tang Dynasty. Opinions varied, and no one could agree. However, it is a pity that these ancient artifacts have been scattered into the hands of workers. It is hoped that archaeologists will investigate and appraise them.

### Anhui Provincial Assembly Concludes - All 117 Proposals Passed

[Report from our He Fei correspondent on the 6th] The second session of the Anhui Provincial Assembly closed on the afternoon of the 5th. The session lasted a total of 17 days. In addition to listening to reports on the administration of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government, a total of 204 proposals were submitted, which were discussed and merged into 117 proposals, all of which were passed and sent to relevant parties for implementation. The closing ceremony was presided over by Speaker Jiang Wei. After delivering the closing remarks, Provincial Chairman Li Pin Xian delivered a speech, followed by Liu Zhen Ru, chairman of the provincial party headquarters (represented by Fan Chun Yang). Finally, Councilor Jin Wei Nong delivered a reply. The policy inquiries and proposal debates of the past seventeen days came to a successful conclusion.

### Rice Prices Skyrocket - Increase of 10,000 Yuan at Once

[Report from our Ru Gao correspondent] Amid rising prices everywhere, rice prices in Ru Gao have also recently skyrocketed. Ordinary rice has increased from 40,000 to 50,000, a jump of 10,000 yuan at once. Previously, rice prices in the city fluctuated, but only by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. This sudden jump of 10,000 yuan is due to the stimulation of other high prices. The situation is that the price of goods from other places has generally increased, and the rice price ratio has fallen sharply. Many farmers are unwilling to sell at this time and speculators are vying to hoard, resulting in a very scarce supply from the river in recent days. Merchants from Nan Tong and Bai Pu are eagerly purchasing, creating an unprecedented price surge, which is unlikely to fall in the short term.

### Merchants and Residents of Tun Xi Donate Funds to Help Dispersed Soldiers Return Home

[Report from our Tun Xi correspondent] The Seventh District Commissioner's Office is handling the repatriation of dispersed officers and soldiers. The number of registered individuals has reached 180. Since the 19th of last month, vehicles have been dispatched to send them to Wu Hu, and then transferred to Han Kou. The travel expenses provided are being donated by local businesses, who have pledged 1 million yuan, and wealthy households in townships and towns, who have pledged 500,000 yuan. In addition to free transportation from Tun Xi to Wu Hu, each person is provided with 3,000 yuan per day for travel expenses for adults and 2,000 yuan for children.

### Allocation of Loans for Each County in the Tenth District of Zhejiang Province

[Report from our Hai Ning correspondent] The provincial government previously allocated 10 million yuan in small-scale water conservancy loans to the counties in the Tenth District. The Tenth District Commissioner's Office has allocated the loan amounts based on the actual needs of each county. The allocations have now been announced. The allocations are as follows: Hai Ning 3 million yuan, Jia Shan and Chong De 2.5 million yuan each, Tong Xiang 2 million yuan. The loans have been approved and issued by the Hangzhou branch of the China Farmers Bank.

### Feng Xian County Orphanage Performs a Play to Raise Funds

[Report from our Feng Xian correspondent] The Feng Xian County Orphanage was reorganized from an orphanage and houses more than 40 orphaned children. However, due to limited funding, it is difficult to maintain. Therefore, the orphanage requested the Mu Xian Reclamation Opera Troupe to perform famous plays on the 3rd and 4th to raise funds. Tickets are priced at 10,000 and 5,000 yuan.

### Many Cigarette Factories Suspend Operations - Impacting Tax Revenue

[Report from our Kai Feng correspondent] The tax revenue in Henan Province for the first ten months of the 35th year of the Republic should have been 16,899,887,905 yuan according to the budget, but the actual revenue was only 14,418,520,189.91 yuan. This is a shortfall of 1,481,367,715.09 yuan. According to the person in charge of the tax bureau, cigarette tax is the main source of tax revenue in the province. Recently, due to the influx of British and American tobacco into the mainland, monopolizing the market, the domestic tobacco industry has been greatly affected. Currently, more than one-third of the cigarette factories in Henan Province have suspended operations, so tax revenue has also decreased accordingly. As for mining taxes in Henan Province, the coal mine taxes from Liu He Gou and Jiao Zuo are the largest. However, these two places were only recently recovered, and the mining taxes are still being organized.

[Poverty-Stricken People Should Get a Price Reduction for Quitting Smoking]

Recently, my relative received a notice from the police station stating that registered smokers must apply to designated public and private hospitals for examination within the year; otherwise, they will be severely punished. My relative immediately inquired about the prices at public and private hospitals, which generally charged as much as 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. While there are many wealthy smokers, there are also many poor and unemployed smokers. Moreover, with the Lunar New Year approaching, prices are soaring, and people are struggling to meet their basic needs, so how can they afford this heavy burden? The ruling authorities should be thorough in eliminating evil, and should act swiftly. However, the economic capacity of the common people should also be taken into account. Therefore, I would like to request that the authorities quickly establish measures to assist poor smokers, and require all hospitals to comply, so as to urge those who are unable to afford it to quit smoking in a timely manner, which will benefit the prohibition policy and is not insignificant. (Wu Mei-weng)

[How Can Poor Teachers Get Through the Lunar New Year?]

We are a group of poor teachers, and our monthly income is only over 100,000 yuan. With the high prices of everything today, we are really suffering. We are very concerned about the news of salary adjustments and hope that they can be implemented soon!

However, every time salary adjustments are announced, we have to wait one or two months before we can receive the increased salary. How much of a discount will this be against the soaring prices? The loss is on our shoulders again, and we can only endure it. Especially now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, we need a sum of money even more. Therefore, we hope that we can get an emergency loan before we receive the new standard salary, so that we can barely get through this Lunar New Year. This is what we ask of the education authorities. (A Group of Poor Teachers)

[Please Improve the Transportation on Qi Pu Road]

Qi Pu Road in this city was blockaded and severely damaged by the enemy during the war. It was reopened after victory last year, but the road surface is uneven and muddy after rain, making it difficult to pass. Also, because the Zhejiang Road Bridge restricts vehicles from passing, they must go around Qi Pu Road, creating a situation where the road is narrow and cars are crowded, which is very dangerous for pedestrians. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to this and quickly improve it to facilitate transportation. (Feng Wu-qing)

[Request to Sell Surplus Materials]

I previously read in the newspaper that the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau, in order to facilitate the purchase of surplus daily necessities by the people in various districts nearby, entrusted various stores to sell them, which is truly a blessing for the people. Our cooperative is located in the Ti Lan Qiao area and has many members. We sent a letter to the bureau requesting to sell the materials, but we were rejected, which surprised us greatly. We think that cooperatives are also organizations that seek the welfare of the people, so why do they not have the right to sell? Therefore, we are taking this opportunity to appeal to the authorities to answer our questions and dispel the doubts of the group. At the same time, we hope that cooperatives in every district of Shanghai can enjoy the right to sell surplus materials, so as to resist the black market. Then the people will be very fortunate. (The Eighteenth District Cooperative)

### Developing Highway Transportation in Northern Jiangsu

— Report from Ru Gao, by our correspondent Wang Han-ou

"Adversity builds a nation" - this is an old saying. Despite the many difficulties, the highway business in Northern Jiangsu is developing in a new and different way. This is a miracle. Ever since the National Army troops marched and stationed themselves in various counties in Northern Jiangsu, the thing that many people were most concerned about was the transportation issue of Northern Jiangsu. It's because the transportation business in Northern Jiangsu was already less developed than in the Jiangnan area before the war. After two times of unrest, boats were almost all destroyed, and highways were dug up into a scattered mess. Restoring water and land transportation was truly not an easy thing to do. Who knew that the reality was contrary to what was imagined? Due to the efforts of military and political authorities overcoming the difficulties, and along with the enthusiastic help of people from various places, highway lines were laid out like stars in the sky in all directions everywhere where the National Army stationed.

[Highways Reach in All Directions]

Currently, from Yangzhou and Nantong downward, the main trunk roads that have already been restored, the Yang Qing line and the Tong Yang line, are fully open to traffic. The Tong Yu line goes all the way to Yancheng. If the National Army troops in the eastern section of the Long Hai railway can join forces, then the highway traffic to Ganyu should be fully restored. Apart from that, branches connecting the three trunk lines, dozens of large and small ones, too many to count, for example, the short-distance highways that run from this county to the border of Jingtai, from Taixian to the riverfront of the port, from Donghe, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong to the beaches, are just like the harbor channels in Northern Jiangsu's inland rivers, branching and reaching in all directions.

Although some of these highways lack vehicles, so not all of them have commercial vehicles running, most of them already have passenger cars running. This is extremely convenient for merchants and travelers, creating a transportation development phenomenon exceeding what it was before the war. There are several reasons for this: first, people inside the pacified districts, are afraid that there might be instability along the way, so they all hope to take advantage of quick transportation tools - cars - to get there early. Second, many of the unemployed, squeezed out by the chaos of war, have all taken the road of running single errands, constantly washing and flowing. Third, those who were previously eating from the Jiangnan transportation and transit business, taking advantage of these many newly opened roads, have moved to Northern Jiangsu, hoping to find gold in this barren land.

[The Communist Army Cannot Destroy Them]

Although the Communist Army has the notorious name of "digging roads," their success in digging roads in Northern Jiangsu this time has proven to be an unusual failure. People are not like they were during the Anti-Japanese War, bravely helping the Communist Army destroy the highways. On the contrary, people have organized self-defense teams to help the government and the National Army protect the highways, and driven out the few Communist Army members and political workers who were waging guerilla warfare and setting up ambushes away from the sides of the highway. From this, one can see the longing for stability and aversion to chaos in the minds of the people of Northern Jiangsu, and the Communist Army's signs of military and political defeat in Northern Jiangsu. Up until now, many highways have watchtowers for guard posts along the way, which are faithfully guarded by the stationed troops and local self-defense teams. The phenomenon of highway bridges being destroyed and broken is even more non-existent.

The development of the highway business has indeed solved the livelihood problems of a large group of people, and at the same time it has also made many places abnormally prosperous. Currently, the most prosperous places in Northern Jiangsu are Sanzhou (Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou) and Haian town in Taixian, all these places are highway intersections. Rugao County was also a gathering point for highways in the past, but recently, because the Ru Xin (Xinsheng port road), and the Ru Li (Libao) roads have not been opened and not smooth, the train station south of the city has not been able to show its bustle. But there is already a large group of train station teahouse staff, employees, vendors, porters... who earn their daily income.

[Full of 'Wild Chicken' Cars]

There are so many big and small car companies on these highways, up to several hundred. The companies that are relatively better equipped are Yangzhou and Zhenyang, etc. Recently, they have been planning to organize intermodal transportation with the Jiangnan Nanjing and Shanghai Railway lines for the convenience of travelers. Next is the Nantong Central Company, etc. Inside the cars, there might still be a few seats. As for the rest, almost all of them are cargo trucks. People and goods are crammed together like piglets. Not only can't they sit down, sometimes they can't even stand steadily. There aren't even tarpaulins on top of the cars. When the wind blows and the rain falls, you just have to suffer enough. Sitting on them is far worse than the condemned fourth-class train in Jiangnan, but the price of a ride is often several times the price of a first-class ticket on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway.

This is because the management of the Northern Jiangsu Highway authorities is not strict enough. There are too many "wild chicken" car companies who don't abide by the traffic regulations and the official mileage fares. Some "wild chicken" 'companies' only have one car. They are all put together by a few empty-handed friends and unemployed car drivers. They rent an old truck from Shanghai for a monthly rent of one or two million yuan. But it is said that just by loading people and goods on a round trip from Nantong to Dongtai, they can earn a hundred or a few hundred million yuan. They only know how to desperately load people and goods, and earn more money. As for the load-bearing weight of the car body and highway bridges, and the safety of passengers, they don't care about anything. Recently, just on the Tong Yang line alone, there have been cases of bridges being broken, and car crashes and people being crushed.

[The Activity of 'Scalpers']

The order in some stations is especially chaotic. The power of the "scalpers" is even more fierce than in front of the Shanghai theaters. Originally, the stations for those wild chicken companies were all open air. The scalpers became the station masters, ticket sellers, and customer service tea house staff for the open-air companies. Foreign travelers who have not been to these places, as soon as you step onto those car concentration points in the small towns, someone will immediately come and ask you where you want to go. If you tell them where you are going, they will immediately say: "The car will leave in five minutes, the fare is so and so, please bring it here!" You give them the money for the ticket, but where is the ticket? He, the scalper, is the ticket. You have to follow him running here and there, until he takes you to a wild chicken car that is about to leave, and faces the car to settle the account, then you can climb into the car with peace of mind. Otherwise, you will definitely be taught to pay the car fare a second time.

Next, there is another problem worth noting: the highways in Northern Jiangsu are not as well maintained as those in Jiangnan. Eighty or ninety percent of them are dirt road surfaces. When it rains, there is simply no way to deal with it. Considering the current state of highway traffic development in Northern Jiangsu, the income from road maintenance fees must not be low. The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Authority had better start from now and seriously pay attention to improving the highway traffic in Northern Jiangsu, and first convert the main highways into gravel road surfaces. Apart from that, the management system of the stations, the mileage fares for passenger and cargo vehicles, and the departure times of passenger vehicles at each station must be strictly regulated. Alternatively, the highway authorities can send more passenger cars to operate on the various lines in Northern Jiangsu, and strictly prohibit scalpers from demanding and causing trouble, so that merchants and travelers can obtain ideal convenience.

Developed transportation promotes the advancement of civilization and culture. Closed-off and backward Northern Jiangsu truly needs to be transformed and developed after this chaos. Improving highway transportation is also one of the important administrative measures for developing Northern Jiangsu. In the future, it is hoped that the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the highway authorities can pay more attention to this issue. (December 27th)

### Truman Addresses Congress - Elaborates on Outline of This Year's Administration - Urges Republican Party to Cooperate on Legislative Plans

[Report from our source] San Francisco, broadcast on the 6th: President Truman addressed the joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives this afternoon, presenting an outline of this year's administration, involving as many as fifteen domestic and foreign issues. The President asked the two chambers for cooperation, otherwise national security would be jeopardized. The President pointed out the close relationship between the United States' domestic and foreign policies, saying: "The success of our domestic policies is closely linked to foreign measures. Given the fact that the United States leads the world, our work to maintain a sound and prosperous economy and improve people's livelihoods has greater significance. What we can and cannot do domestically is not only related to ourselves, but will also affect the whole world. If we want to accomplish our mission for ourselves and other nations, we must ensure that the United States is sound in terms of economics, society, and politics. Only in this way can we help create peaceful factors in other countries, factors which are political stability, and economic and social progress.

The peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary are ready, and these treaties will be signed in Paris next month, after which they will be submitted to the US Senate for approval. Our government believes that these treaties are not entirely satisfactory, but whatever their shortcomings, we are very willing for our wartime allies to reach an agreement, because any delay will endanger the political stability of the countries involved."

Regarding domestic issues, the main points are as follows: (1) Submit a labor law to the two chambers to prohibit strikes and establish a committee to investigate labor-management relations. (2) The new budget balances revenue and expenditure, recommending that wartime tax rules continue to be implemented after they expire on June 30. (3) Submit a new economic plan to the two chambers, requesting continued restrictions on patents and unfair business practices.

[Maintain Strong Military Force to Defend Against Lightning Strikes]

Regarding disarmament and world collective security, President Truman said: "We must maintain a strong military force until collective security under the United Nations is established. After that, the United States can lead the way in collective disarmament. But before this is achieved, the United States should not weaken its military force, lest it be attacked by other countries. In 1946, we completed the demobilization of wartime military forces, and now we only maintain a military force sufficient to defend ourselves and fulfill our international obligations. If countries with heavy responsibilities abandon their responsibilities, the stability of the world will be destroyed. In the current period, unpredictable attacks can come at unprecedented speed. We must have sufficient power to defeat such possible attacks. Therefore, we must ensure that our troops have excellent equipment and training, and mobilize all manpower in times of emergency. Before July 1, the number of army personnel will be reduced to 1.07 million, and the navy will be reduced to 571,000. The occupation forces stationed abroad are now only able to carry out the tasks required by our diplomatic policy. In any case, the responsibility for maintaining a sufficient military force lies with Congress."

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Some observers believe that President Truman's speech has departed from the left-wing New Deal system led by Wallace and is increasingly closer to the right-wing conservative system led by Byrnes. When President Roosevelt was alive, Byrnes was a great help to Roosevelt in domestic affairs. Some people close to the President say that the President's domestic opinions are very similar to those of the moderate faction of the Republican Party. Therefore, it can be proved after the President's speech today that although the government and the parliament belong to different parties, cooperation in domestic affairs is still fully possible.

### U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton Issues Statement: Fully Supports Bipartisan Foreign Policy; U.S.-Soviet Relations Will Depend on the Soviet Union

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 4th] Congressman Eaton, the newly appointed chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently stated that he fully supports bipartisan foreign policy. He said that the House Foreign Affairs Committee is the body that creates important foreign policy legislation, and therefore should not have "political bias." Eaton, a Republican Congressman from New Jersey, recently filled the vacancy left by New York Democratic Congressman Bloom, becoming the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He told reporters last Friday that the United States should continue to pay close attention to affairs in Europe, Latin America, and the Far East, as everything in the aforementioned regions is enough to affect human management. He expressed his support for Byrnes, saying that the Secretary of State's steadfast and outstanding spirit in the most special circumstances has greatly improved U.S.-Soviet relations over the past year. Eaton continued: "I fully support Byrnes, and I have always been the strongest supporter of the current government's foreign policy. The House Foreign Affairs Committee should not have political bias." Eaton also said that future U.S.-Soviet relations will directly depend on the Soviet Union. He concluded, "We will deal with our friends and enemies based on the principle of 'repaying kindness with kindness and resentment with resentment.' If they treat us with friendship, we will reciprocate with friendship. If they treat us as enemies, we will reciprocate with hostility."

### International Economic Cooperation: U.S. Hopes for Soviet Participation

No Two-Nation Trade World Allowed

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 5th] Wilcox, Director of the Office of International Trade Policy at the State Department, recently stated forcefully: "Political cooperation mechanisms are of little significance unless countries also cooperate economically." He outlined the progress of economic cooperation through international trade organizations and described the world economic ailments caused by economic isolationism. Wilcox spoke on a national radio question-and-answer program, first mentioning that the purpose of international trade organizations is to strive to eliminate the various restrictions and discriminations caused by the First and Second World Wars, such as import quotas, foreign exchange controls, and priority rights. All of these reduce trade, reduce labor productivity, and lower living standards. The focus of the discussion was on the recent meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Eighteen Nations in London, which was established to arrange the International Trade and Employment Conference to consider the establishment of an International Trade Organization. Another task of the committee is to draft the organizational law of the World Trade Organization, which will be prepared for the second meeting in Geneva in April. Regarding the work of the London conference, Wilcox said: "We have unanimously reached an agreement on about nine-tenths of the revised charter, including some of the clauses that some people consider most important. However, the drafting work will still not be completed before the committee resumes its meeting in Geneva in April." Another question was, "Do you think the Soviet Union will join the International Trade Organization?" Wilcox replied: "I don't know. But I think the Soviet Union must participate. The door to the organization is open, and the Soviet Union's participation will have great benefits and no losses." The question was, "If there is no Soviet Union, will there be any problems in establishing an international trade organization?" Wilcox replied: "There are indeed problems. The Soviet Union controls very little in world trade, not even five percent. But what we are seeking is of course a trade world, not a two-nation trade world."

### Austin's Speech: Enumerates UN Achievements

[United Press, New York, 5th] Austin, the chief representative of the United States to the United Nations organization, gave a radio speech today, stating briefly that Britain and the Soviet Union have increased mutual understanding in the recent UN General Assembly.

### British Parliamentary Delegation Report: Advocates Early Withdrawal of British Troops from Greece; Greek People Fear Communism

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The British parliamentary delegation visited Greece in August of last year at the invitation of the Greek government and returned home early. It recently released a report stating: "This delegation believes that it is highly possible for British troops to withdraw from Greece at an early date. The Greek government should take the opportunity of King George II's return to the country to adopt a completely new policy, and with British support, recruit all parties and factions to form a coalition government. However, extreme leftists may be excluded. The new government should adopt a lenient policy towards government political prisoners. Its main task is to restore national order and the freedom that the people should enjoy in accordance with the constitution. British troops should be withdrawn at an early date unless unforeseen circumstances occur. The Greek referendum clearly showed that the majority of citizens supported King George II's return to the country for three reasons: (1) The Greek people hope for peace and order; (2) The Greek people believe that voting against the king is equivalent to voting against Britain and supporting the Soviet Union; (3) The Greek people all fear communism."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The United Nations Security Council will organize a committee to conduct an on-site investigation of the situation in Greece. According to an official British announcement, the British government has appointed Winterton, the leader of the British parliamentary delegation to Greece in August of last year, as its representative.

Antarctica

### New Continent of the 20th Century: U.S. Wants to Divide One Million Square Miles

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Officials here revealed that the United States intends to request a large portion of the six million square miles of the Antarctic continent. The strategy for obtaining this territory will be decided after Rear Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expedition returns. Officials in charge of Antarctic policy told an interviewer today that various meetings will be held next spring to discuss: (1) The date when the United States formally requests Antarctic ice land territory. (2) The proposal to submit international hostile demands to the United Nations for handling to avoid endless disputes. (3) The nature of future American surveys after the current naval expedition, and the efforts of occupation, and the immediate departure of a smaller expedition team under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ronne. Byrd, a major Antarctic explorer, is currently taking the aircraft carrier "Philippine Sea" to Antarctica to join the expeditionary force. The team is scheduled to return home in four months. The United States' territorial claims are largely based on the northwest region of the ice land, the area visited by explorers Ellsworth and Byrd. After surveying from 1939 to 1941, the two declared: The United States can at least claim one million square miles of the Antarctic continent, or even eight hundred thousand square miles more. The government's policy, based on the demands of American private explorers and surveyors, does not recognize the demands of Britain, France, Chile, Norway and other countries. This layer was reiterated by Undersecretary of State Acheson last week. One of the areas of direct dispute is in the area of ​​Magawright Bay, south of Cape Horn, where a British expedition has been excavating at the site of Byrd's early camp since 1943. Chile also intends to acquire the area, and Ronne's expedition team is targeting the area.

As for the entire issue of submitting it to the International Court of Justice for arbitration or to the United Nations for handling, it has been proposed by several parties. As of now, officials have unofficially stated that this is only under normal circumstances. The purpose of the countries involved in the Antarctic dispute is largely to use expedition teams for surveying and occupation to strengthen their territorial claims. Ronne's expedition team plans to stay at its destination for fourteen to eighteen months, or it will offset the effect of the British Meteorological expansion occupying the Magawright Bay base. After Byrd returns, he will participate in meetings to discuss whether to request Congress to allocate funds for exploration, which will be carried out according to a permanent military road plan, so as to establish permanent equipment to some extent. Future Pearl Harbor policy is based on this plan.

[United Press, Sydney, Australia, 5th] The "Sydney Sun" reported today that Australia has requested to acquire one-third of the Antarctic continent and will oppose any proposal to place the Antarctic region under the management of the United Nations. The United Nations management of Antarctica was recently proposed by the "Washington Post". Australia is now sending patrols to the Antarctic region, followed by a larger expedition team, in order to claim approximately 2.5 million square miles of territory.

### Japan's Reparations Problem (Part 1)

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Nanjing, Chuan Junyi

The Potsdam Proclamation stipulates that in-kind reparations are one of the obligations that Japan should fulfill. Regarding the Japanese reparations policy, American reparations envoy Pauley released an interim report on December 6th of last year, stipulating that the materials to be removed as reparations targets are:

(1) Machine tool manufacturing capacity should be reduced by half (approximately 350,000 to 400,000 units). All equipment from army and navy arsenals, aircraft manufacturing plants, steel ball, axle factories, and aircraft engine factories should be removed.

(2) Steel plants with an annual output of more than 250 tons should be removed (currently producing 11 million tons).

(3) Twenty shipyards.

(4) Half of the thermal power generation capacity.

(5) Twenty out of the 41 newest caustic soda plants should be removed.

The Far Eastern Commission in Washington also released a plan on August 20th. At the same time, the Allied Supreme Commander had already issued management orders in January of this year for 682 Japanese military-related factories, research institutes, and aircraft factories, designating them as reparations targets. Subsequently, on August 24th, an additional 25 shipyards, 275 private military factories, 9 machine tool factories, 20 steel ball factories, 24 steel plants, 1 alkali ash factory, 18 caustic soda factories, and 20 thermal power plants, a total of 505 factories, were designated as reparations factories. At the same time, two aircraft factories previously designated were added and 32 were removed. The total number of factories designated in the two rounds was 1,002. The designation was revised again on November 6th, and factories that did not meet the reparations standards were removed, reducing the number to 953 factories. A third revision was made on the 7th of this month. In addition to removing 12 from sulfuric acid, machine tool, precision steel ball factories, private military factories, two factories were added. The number of reparations currently designated is as follows:

Aircraft factories, army and navy arsenals, research and experimental institutes, 466.

Precision bearing factories, 31.

Shipyards, 24.

Sulfur factories, 41.

Sulfuric acid factories, 23.

Machine tool factories, 85.

Power plants, 20.

Private military factories, 230.

Steel manufacturing plants, 21.

Total, 943

According to the analysis of the "Gold Drill" economic magazine, the impact on Japanese industry after removing these nearly one thousand factories as reparations is that it will push Japan's economic level back more than ten years (Showa 12, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out).

The final Pauley plan released on November 28th is more detailed than the previous interim report, especially in the machinery, tools, iron and steel, railway vehicles, and chemical industries. In Pauley's previous report, only half of the existing machine tools were planned to be removed, totaling 350,000 to 400,000 units. In the final plan, 600,000 units are planned to be removed, leaving only 155,000 units. The steelmaking capacity of open-hearth furnaces will be reduced by 6 million tons, and the steelmaking capacity of electric furnaces will be reduced by 3 million tons. In Showa 19 (1944), the production capacity of open-hearth furnaces was 8 million tons, and the capacity of electric furnaces was 3 million tons. As a result, the annual production of steel ingots will be reduced to 2.25 million tons. In Showa 9 (1934), the consumption of steel materials was 3.155 million tons. According to Pauley's proposal, Japan's minimum consumption after this will be 3 million tons. As a result, Japan must import 1 million tons of steel materials from various Asian countries every year. In the railway vehicle sector, 970 locomotives and 30,000 freight cars will be distributed by the United Nations. After the war, Japan has 5,566 locomotives and 119,760 freight cars. Regarding the textile industry, the final report limits it to 3 million spindles. Before the war, Japan had approximately 12 million spindles of textile equipment, with 8 million spindles actually in operation. According to the estimates of the Toyo Keizai magazine, 6.5 million spindles are currently needed to maintain domestic needs and pay for imported raw cotton.

The following is a comparison of the Pauley plan released on December 28th, the Far Eastern Committee plan of August 20th, Showa 12 (1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out), and Japan's total production capacity in October of this year, as shown in the following table:

### Polish Elections Approaching: Assassinations Occur Frequently; Democratic Group Issues Declaration

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 6th] Poland will hold general elections on the 19th of this month. Assassinations occur frequently. The chairman of the Krakow District Election Committee was assassinated by terrorists yesterday, and five policemen guarding the committee's office were also killed.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 5th] The Democratic Group of Poland, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, and the anti-Mikolajczyk faction, issued an election declaration today, promising to make Poland's new constitution a great charter guaranteeing personal freedom, freedom of speech and publication, freedom of religion, and the equality of all citizens under the law. The declaration also accused Mikolajczyk's Farmers' Party of colluding with bandits and stated that the Democratic Group will eliminate fascists and establish peace and order. In terms of diplomacy, the Democratic Group will establish close friendship with the Soviet Union, strengthen traditional relations with France, and establish good relations with democratic countries such as Britain and the United States.

### 阿族同盟決定　參加倫敦會議

Palestinian Arabs Express Surprise

[United Press London, 5th] The Secretary-General of the Arab League announced in Cairo today that "the Arab League countries will send representatives to the Palestine problem conference to be held in London on the 21st of this month. At that time, the Arab representatives will oppose the partition plan of Palestine or the continued immigration of Jews into the area. We will once again demand the independence of Palestine and the establishment of an Arab government. If the conference fails, we will appeal to the United Nations organizations," he said.

[Agence France-Presse Jerusalem, 6th] News from Cairo states that the decision of the Arab governments to send their own representatives to London to participate in the Palestine conference, regardless of the wishes of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, has surprised al-Husseini, the Vice-Chairman of the Higher Committee. It is reported that several senior members of the committee in Palestine are about to rush to Cairo to discuss the matter, and will launch a propaganda campaign in Palestine in an attempt to impose sanctions through public opinion.

英美加初步交換意見
Preliminary Exchange of Views Between Britain, America, and Canada

[Reuters London, 5th] British officials confirmed that Britain, the United States, and Canada have begun preliminary exchange of views on mutually reducing tariffs.

Mr. Gray, who is in charge of the Oriental antiquities section of the museum, expressed great excitement about this gift, but due to limited space, these treasures cannot be publicly displayed for the time being. Among the artworks awaiting exhibition, the most noteworthy is a statue of the Tathagata Buddha, over 1,300 years old, which was donated to the British Museum by the Chinese government in 1935. At the same time, a portion of Chinese pottery, jade, bronzes, and various carvings have been on display for several months, the most important of which are bronzes and jades from the Shang and Yin dynasties, a calligraphy board personally inscribed by Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, and some of the finest Chinese pottery ever produced. An unparalleled lacquer box from the Han Dynasty has never been exhibited before. To solve the problem of space limitations, the exhibits are rotated every year or eighteen months. The British Museum also plans to open an art room in the near future to exhibit the best of Chinese paintings. In addition, the Victoria and Albert Museum also houses a large collection of Oriental pottery, mostly from China.

### 參議會二次大會　隆重舉行開幕禮
Solemn Opening Ceremony of the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council

出席議員一四七人　今日會議中對警教等局將提質詢
147 Councilors Present, Questions to be Raised to Police and Education Bureaus in Today's Meeting

[This Newspaper] The First Session of the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council opened at 9:30 am yesterday at Zhengshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road. The venue was far from the central district, and the weather was rainy and muddy yesterday, but the councilors showed great spirit. A total of 167 councilors registered for this session, with 147 attending yesterday. In addition, over twenty general managers and editors-in-chief of various newspapers, as well as prominent figures in society, were invited to attend, and the directors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government were also present. Before the opening of the assembly, a memorial week was held, with speeches delivered successively by Speaker Pan, Mayor Wu, Director Fang, and Supervising Commissioner Cheng. After a ten-minute recess, Mayor Wu reported on the administration, which lasted for an hour. Councilors then raised questions one after another. The Mayor first made a brief overall reply, and detailed information will be answered separately by the directors of each bureau. The first meeting of the assembly adjourned at 12:45 pm.

潘議長開幕詞　希望完成責任
Speaker Pan's Opening Remarks, Hope to Fulfill Responsibilities

The memorial week was presided over by Speaker Pan. After performing the rituals, he delivered the opening remarks, stating: "It has been more than three months since the adjournment of the First General Assembly of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Government has been gradually implementing the resolutions proposed by the assembly. Today, the Second General Assembly opens in the new year, which is of great significance. As the saying goes, 'The plan for a year lies in the spring,' and the work for the year should be planned and decided at this time. Although the agenda of this meeting is only one week, its task is no less than that of the previous assembly. In addition to first discussing the central work plan proposed by the Municipal Government, the budget for the 36th year is particularly important. I hope that all colleagues will represent the opinions of all parties, considering both the burden on the people and the difficulties of the Municipal Government's administration, and fulfill the responsibilities that representatives should fulfill in this assembly. I would like to offer my personal opinions simply at the opening, and at the same time, I would like to ask the Mayor for more guidance so that it can be used as a reference during the meeting."

市長希望二點　達到繁榮市面
Mayor Hopes for Two Points, to Achieve Prosperous City

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, stating that he had two thoughts: "(1) When writing the history of Shanghai in the 35th year in the future, one will definitely think of the establishment and success of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council is a true institution, and all resolutions have been carefully reviewed and decided. The Municipal Government will also implement its work based on the opinions of the assembly. (2) The 36th year will be the most difficult and arduous year in the history of Shanghai. As the person in charge of administration, I feel that there are many difficulties. I hope that the Municipal Council will continue to provide guidance and assistance with the spirit of the previous assembly, so that the hope of stability and prosperity in Shanghai can be achieved."

方主委詞
Director Fang's Remarks

Director Fang then delivered a speech, stating: "The municipal councilors were elected by four million citizens of the city, and the citizens must be shouting behind them, 'Be sure to speak for the people.' Therefore, I hope that all councilors will give full play to their abilities, but I also hope that they can fully understand the government. The mayor is like a car driver, and the citizens are like sitting in the car. To make the car run well, there must be cooperation."

程監使詞
Supervising Commissioner Cheng's Remarks

Supervising Commissioner Cangbo Cheng also expressed his thoughts and congratulations, saying: "The 36th year is the year when China's democratic constitutional government begins, and the opening of Shanghai's public opinion organs in the new year symbolizes democracy. However, the country currently has two opposing trends: (1) Peaceful, unified democracy, and (2) Destruction of peaceful, unified democracy. Shanghai cannot be stable under the siege of various social ills. However, to stabilize China, Shanghai must be stabilized. Therefore, the responsibility of the Municipal Council is not only to discuss proposals, but also to put forth a lot of effort to stabilize Shanghai, so that many unfair things in society can be eliminated and the suffering of the people can be reduced. For example, in the hawker incident, the councilors did not avoid danger and went to investigate in person. This kind of spirit is admirable and should continue. This is a manifestation of stabilizing Shanghai. In addition, the chairman once indicated that Shanghai is extravagant and dissolute, and the social atmosphere is corrupt. Whenever officials and dignitaries encounter weddings and funerals, they are extravagant. This is not the glory of Shanghai but a shame. If it can be improved and the atmosphere can be changed, Shanghai can also be stabilized."

[Also News] The Second General Assembly of the First Shanghai Municipal Council is scheduled to hold its second meeting from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm today, to raise questions to the police, social welfare, and education bureaus. Before the meeting, the representatives attending the National Assembly will make a report.

吳市長作施政報告　檢討工作認為未盡滿意
Mayor Wu Makes Administrative Report, Reviews Work and Finds It Unsatisfactory

After a ten-minute break, Mayor Wu continued to make his administrative report, which lasted for an hour, stating that he had done his best to accommodate the various resolutions of the Municipal Council's First General Assembly regarding municipal facilities. After three months, he reviewed the administration and found it unsatisfactory, especially regarding the issues of commodity prices, social order, hawker incidents, and the recent student unrest. He deeply felt that he had let down the Municipal Council and the citizens of Shanghai, but the various bureaus had made their best efforts within the realm of possibility. This should be specially mentioned before the report.

戶籍調查準確
Accurate Household Registration Survey

Regarding civil affairs: (1) Regarding the autonomous portion, there are currently 30 districts, 1,056 bao, and 24,963 jia in the baojia organization. Adjusting the district boundaries and surveying the boundaries between Jiangsu Province and this city, the police, education, health, and various sub-district divisions were coordinated with the autonomous district divisions. The various districts were ordered to establish district mediation committees to mediate civil and criminal disputes, build district office buildings, establish baojia regulations, and prepare for the election of district heads by the people. (2) Regarding household administration, the initial household registration and regular household registration were carried out. (3) Regarding military service, the implementation methods for the survey of young men in the 35th year, the preferential treatment of military dependents, and the establishment of military service sections and affiliated district bao teams were drafted. He had personally visited various districts, such as slums and shantytowns, and personally surveyed household registration. The results can be said to be 100% accurate. This is of great importance to the handling of grassroots organizations of local autonomy and is gratifying.

警政較前進步
Police Administration More Progressive Than Before

Regarding police administration: Actively promoting the inspection of civilian guns, the prevention and arrest of bandits, the rectification of prostitutes, the elimination of opium, the management of traffic, the improvement of the city appearance, the management of household registration, the management of special businesses, the organization of volunteer police, the establishment of criminal police brigades, the strengthening of new police training, the implementation of the police district system, the addition of fire-fighting equipment, and the strengthening of rescue work. The salaries of police officers are meager. Although they have been adjusted, they are still very low. The monthly salary of a policeman is less than 150,000 yuan, which is the most difficult problem for supervisors. In the past three months, the police bureau has listed detailed tables in the report on cracking theft and extortion cases. Not only were the cases that occurred in this city quickly solved; but also, many cases that occurred in other ports were solved locally. This situation is more progressive than in the previous concession period.

希望增加警察人數
Hope to Increase the Number of Police Officers

Shanghai currently has 16,160 police officers, and the budgeted number of police officers is 22,831. London has the most well-managed police administration in the world, with one police officer for about 500 residents. New York City in the United States has one police officer for every 200 residents. Shanghai currently has a total population of over 4 million. If social stability is required, according to the ratio of one police officer for every 200 residents in New York, more than 20,000 people are needed. A batch of police officers are trained every three months, so I hope that the city council can approve the budget to achieve the number of more than 20,000 police officers in Shanghai.

社會工作不易見功
Social Work Not Easy to See Results

Regarding society: The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for many affairs, which are easy to see faults but not easy to see achievements. Such as the mediation of labor-management disputes, the assessment of commodity prices, the promotion of labor welfare facilities, the promotion of full-scale work, the organization and training of various groups, the measurement of weights and measures, the establishment of relief institutions, the handling of winter relief, the relief of unemployed workers, agricultural extension, and the registration of farms. Labor unrest decreased slightly in July, August, and September, but has recently increased again, especially as the end of the lunar year approaches. It takes a lot of effort to mediate various labor unrest. Regarding the year-end bonus issue, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau and Director Zhao of the Labor Department have made their best efforts to minimize labor unrest.

教職員增加千餘人
More Than a Thousand Teachers and Staff Added

Regarding education: (1) Secondary education: Reorganizing and supporting private middle schools, improving teacher salaries and enriching school equipment, improving teacher qualifications, and reorganizing student status. (2) National education: Increasing schools, repairing school buildings, reorganizing and maintaining private elementary schools, promoting the counseling system, and promoting health education. (3) Social education: Actively eliminating illiteracy, promoting social education, carrying out social education activities, and adjusting social education institutions. (4) Supervision: Implementing district supervision, planning specialized supervision, holding symposiums, and handling emergencies. The Municipal Government increased education funding based on the resolution of the First General Assembly of the Municipal Council, and the number of school classes also increased. Details can be found in the written report. The Municipal Government laid off more than 900 employees, but because the education budget increased, the number of schools increased, and the number of classes also increased, the number of teachers and staff increased by about 1,000. This is a special situation.

工務
Public Works

Regarding public works: In these three months, two things should be specially reported: One is the seawall project. As a result of active implementation, the Pudong area has been spared from flooding during the autumn and winter tides. The other is the flood control project. After actively dredging the ditches, to improve the traffic problem in the central district, after two months of research, it was gradually implemented, so there was significant progress in September and October of last year. However, the situation in the central district has recently returned to the state before September of last year. Improving traffic in the central district is indeed a major current issue. After detailed review, it is neither due to poor execution nor to bad methods. There are two major reasons: First, the number of vehicles (including motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles) has increased from more than 190,000 to more than 220,000.

取締攤販　由於妨礙
Banning Hawkers Due to Obstruction

Second, hawkers obstruct traffic. Banning hawkers is not for the purpose of improving the city appearance, but entirely for the traffic in the central district. If it is for the purpose of improving the city appearance, strict bans should be enforced throughout the city. The reason why it is only limited to the Huangpu and Old Bund districts is because the traffic in these two districts is too congested. Regarding this matter, the Municipal Government has specially drafted a proposal and sent it to the Municipal Council for detailed guidance. (5) Water transportation: Establishing the Municipal Ferry Company and opening up municipal ferry routes. (6) Wharf warehouses: Preparing to restore the Nanshi Wharf and preparing to establish the Nanshi Wharf Warehouse Company. (7) Warehouse telephone: Intensifying the installation of street lights and improving telephone facilities. (8) Others: Implementing the levy of additional donations for public utilities and adjusting the prices of public utilities.

地政方面
Land Administration

Regarding land administration: (1) Land registration is proceeding smoothly. Most of the land that had not been registered before has been registered with the Land Administration Bureau, ending the general land registration in the Huangpu and other main districts. Clearing foreign land rights and carrying out public land registration. (2) Levying land value tax, which is implemented in accordance with the resolution of the First General Assembly of the Municipal Council. (3) Clearing land rights. (4) Clearing public land.

衛生
Hygiene

Regarding hygiene: (1) Improving cleaning and sanitation, enriching transportation tools, improving transportation methods, and strengthening management methods. (2) Improving epidemic prevention work. Cholera was prevalent last autumn, and the situation was extremely rampant. Based on the situation at that time, there was a deep fear that the epidemic would be more severe than in 1938. The Health Bureau mobilized all epidemic prevention personnel to work actively, and the results were remarkable. The epidemic was milder than in 1938, which was unexpected. Other measures such as preventing and controlling dysentery and typhoid fever, preventing diphtheria and meningitis, autumn and winter vaccinations, silkworm disinfection, mosquito reduction and malaria prevention, preventing and controlling rabies and venereal diseases, implementing fundamental epidemic prevention facilities, and storing epidemic prevention equipment are all being actively promoted. (3) Enriching medical equipment, expanding hospital beds, adjusting hospital distribution, opening suburban hospitals, adding clinics for the common people, adjusting hospital fees, and subsidizing emergency loans. (4) Expanding maternal and child health care, promoting safe childbirth, prenatal and postnatal care, expanding maternity bed facilities, adding infant care clinics, and piloting children's associations. (5) Strengthening school health. (6) Advocating health activities for children and youth. (7) Strictly managing medicine, banning medical advertisements, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, and conducting medical registration. (8) Reorganizing health management, removing accumulated coffins, organizing vegetable markets and inspecting meat products, organizing public cemeteries, and strengthening inspections.

財政方面
Finance

Regarding finance: Dividing into income, expenditure, the reorganization of various taxes and donations, and the reorganization of public property and public debt. The Municipal Government's collection of donations and taxes is based on the principle of not disturbing the people. The Finance Bureau, in accordance with the resolutions of the Municipal Council, reorganizes tax revenue on the one hand and takes into account the burden on the citizens on the other, and there has never been any disturbance to the people.

檢討市政設施
Review of Municipal Facilities

Generally reviewing all municipal facilities in the past three months, they are inferior to the general situation in July, August, and September of last year. The salaries of public school teachers and staff are meager, and they have been able to work hard in difficult circumstances, which can be said to be the best effort they have made. What everyone is worried about at present is the economic crisis, which has four factors: one is high interest rates, the second is high wages, the third is the dumping of foreign goods, and the fourth is the destruction of transportation. He came to Shanghai in May of last year and publicly stated to the entire council of the labor community that the economic crisis would arrive in six months, which was unfortunately confirmed. The government has launched production loans to reduce high interest rates for the industrial and commercial sectors. Regarding the general wage issue, it is believed that the short-sighted approach of killing the chicken to get the eggs should not be adopted, and it is hoped that the labor community will find a way to no longer raise wages. Regarding the dumping of foreign goods, the government has implemented import controls. As for the destruction of transportation, it is a nationwide problem and cannot be done by one place. In addition to the four factors of the economic crisis mentioned above, the central government has decided to stabilize national commodity prices with all its strength this year. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, and it is hoped that the representatives of public opinion organs will promote thrift and curb speculation; and it is hoped that the Municipal Council will organize a small committee in addition to the various committees to provide the Municipal Government with regular instructions on matters such as commodity prices, economy, and stabilizing social order.

市財政總預算已縮政策
The Municipal Financial Budget Has Been Reduced

As for the total municipal financial budget for the 36th year, at the beginning of the preparation, the expenses required by the Municipal Government and its various bureaus and offices were reduced from approximately 580 billion to 230.8 billion, intending to consider the needs of the citizens and at the same time take into account the burden on the citizens. The principle of preparing the total budget for the 36th year is to adopt a tight policy. Compared with the previous concession period and with cities such as Nanjing and Chongqing, the use of personnel and administration are not expanded. For example, there are currently more than 16,000 police officers, and it is planned to increase to more than 22,800 by October of this year. Another example is that the Education Bureau currently has 7,000 people (including teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools), and it is planned to increase to more than 9,000 this year. Furthermore, the Civil Affairs Office also needs to increase staff due to the handling of conscription. Because Shanghai is the model district designated by the central government for conscription, if each bao adds one bao team deputy and one assistant staff member, the number of staff in the Civil Affairs Office will increase from more than 2,000 to more than 4,000. Therefore, in the total budget, the total number of Municipal Government employees is listed as more than 50,000. In short, he has absolute confidence in the Municipal Council, and everything that is decided will be strictly implemented. In this year of arduous struggle in the 36th year, he hopes that the public opinion organs will provide instructions on the current economic crisis, and that the various councilors will regularly visit the various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government to conduct on-the-spot inspections and provide detailed guidance.

強佔校舍　迄未遷讓
Forcibly Occupied School Buildings Have Not Been Vacated

Councilor Feicheng Zhou also asked: If public and private schools are requisitioned by other agencies, what measures does the Municipal Government have to deal with them? The security team of the police bureau occupied the school building of the Municipal Shangwen Elementary School and has not yet moved out, but at the same time, it is handling the private Daren Middle School and Elementary School on the original site of the former French Concession police station on Jianguo West Road. What is the reason for this? If this precedent is set, there is a risk that a lot of publicly owned property will become private in the future. How should it be prevented? Councilor Jie Mei Pan said: The basic salary of the teachers of the municipal elementary schools in this city is too low, and life is very difficult. The Education Bureau had previously drafted a plan to increase the basic salary and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. The representatives of the municipal elementary school teachers and staff have also repeatedly requested a discretionary increase. Why has it not been approved so far? Councilor Liben Wang submitted a written inquiry: (1) The treatment of municipal school colleagues in this semester is still lower than that of private schools, causing panic among the teachers of municipal schools. What remedial measures does the Municipal Government have? (2) The cashiers of the municipal treasury are impolite to the municipal schools when withdrawing funds. Colleagues often endure in silence in order to save time. I wonder if the mayor can severely reprimand the authorities?

### Director Xuan's Resignation Intention Expected to be Dismissed [Report from this Newspaper] Police Chief Yi Tiewu submitted his resignation again a few days ago due to physical weakness. However, according to information obtained by reporters, after Mayor Wu's earnest retention, it is expected that the intention to resign will be dismissed.
Shanghai Middle School Students Organize Anti-Riot Association Opposition to Actions Exceeding Scope
After the incident of the rape of a woman by a U.S. soldier in Beiping, students in this city were indignant and advocated that the government lodge a protest. The purpose of this matter has already been achieved by the students' protest this time. Middle school students in this city believe that some students' behaviors, such as strikes and parades, have exceeded the scope and expressed their opposition. They specially organized the "Shanghai Middle School Students Anti-Riot Association," posted slogans, expanded publicity, consoled beaten teachers and students, and issued declarations.

Flour Mill Manager's Car Robbed at the Qiujiang Road Intersection [Report from this Newspaper] Gao Bingtai, the manager of the Sanxin Flour Mill, owned a black-plated car with license number 10530, driven by Xu Jinhua. At about six o'clock the night before, when Xu was driving the car to the Tonghai Automobile Company on North Sichuan Road for storage, a strong man suddenly appeared with a gun and jumped into the car at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road. Two more bandits jumped on the car midway. One bandit took over the driving. When they reached East Tiyu Hui Road, they drove Xu out of the car. As of midnight last night, the car had not been found. Afterwards, Xu Jinhua reported the incident to the North Sichuan Road Police Station and requested investigation.

Strengthening Administrative Efficiency is Not About Numerous Personnel Demanding Streamlined Government, Clear Laws, and Reduced Taxes Expressing Dissent on Most of the Budget [Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, some senators expressed dissent on the large municipal government budget for the 1947 fiscal year. The mayor's report mentioned that police personnel must be increased to improve public security. Senator Fei Shusheng said: (1) I "oppose" the mayor's budget for police personnel based on the urban population and professional prosperity, using a geometric progression ratio. The ratio should be lower than an algebraic progression. (2) There is no need to increase the number of police and civil servants in this city. Having more people does not necessarily mean things will be done well. We should strengthen administrative efficiency. Therefore, we demand that the municipal government achieve "streamlined government, clear laws," and "reduced taxes and levies." He also asked the mayor what concrete plan he had for stabilizing Shanghai and requested a report on the implementation of the previous conference's resolutions. Senator Zhang Xingbai also advocated that increasing administrative efficiency does not depend on increasing manpower, but on improving technology. Senator Jia Dechao said: Mayor Wu hopes that we, the representatives of the people, will uphold justice and improve the good social atmosphere. Indeed, we also hope that Mayor Wu can truly protect justice and crack down on illegal activities. In addition, many citizens say that Mayor Wu's entertainment expenses are quite large. I wonder if they are included in the city budget and whether they can be further reduced. I would like to hear the details to dispel the doubts of five million citizens. Senator Jiang Hao asked: At the first conference, the municipal government officials all said they had a plan to "reduce personnel and streamline government." How much has been reduced now? At the same time, regarding the reduction of personnel from the puppet regime and the prior employment of meritorious resistance personnel, has this been done? According to his personal informal investigation, the municipal government is still retaining 1,500 personnel from the puppet regime. Can you tell me the exact number of people hired? Also, how can the crisis in the city's industry and commerce be saved?

More People Doesn't Necessarily Mean Things Get Done Well Bargaining is Unacceptable Senator Lu Shidao also said that having more people does not necessarily mean things can be done well. It seems like the mayor has included unused personnel in the budget first, which smacks of bargaining and is really "unacceptable." Also, the crisis in industry and commerce is so serious, and local taxes are already too heavy, and there are many central taxes, such as the profit tax. Can you request a reduction? Senator Ye Ganwen also expressed the same opinion. Senator Ye Fenghu believes that the estimation standards for housing donations and municipal construction losses are unbalanced with the actual housing donations. Please pay attention. Senator Li Wenjie, after reviewing the Finance Bureau's report, found that the actual expenditure in November and December of the second half of last year was less than the approved budget. He asked: As of the end of December, what is the amount of accounts payable and receivable on both the expenditure and revenue sides? How much surplus will there be in the 1946 fiscal year? Please ask the Director of Finance and the Comptroller to prepare and submit a written report in advance.

President Song's Plan in Shanghai to Restore Steel and Cotton Production President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, left his residence at 8:00 yesterday morning and went straight to the Bank of China Building to work. He left around 1:00 in the afternoon. Among the events handled that day, two were most important: (1) Actively seeking to restore the operation of steel factories across the country, with the initial production target of reaching pre-war output. (2) Planning to improve national cotton production to reduce imports of American cotton, with an estimated production of 12.5 million dan of national cotton this year.

Charity Dinner Dance Great Enthusiasm in Participation from All Sectors End of a Song, Dancing Begins Exciting Balloon Release Program [Report from this Newspaper] The Charity Dinner Dance of the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee was held yesterday, the first day, at the Yiyuan Hotel. From 5:00 p.m. onwards, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Ji, Mayor Wu, Zhang Xiaosong, Wang Xianqing, and over 1,000 male and female guests arrived one after another. The traffic was heavy, causing congestion on the road. The venue was full of artistic slogans, with three large bunches of colorful balloons hanging in the middle, which were extremely bright and eye-catching. At 8:00 p.m., the venue was already packed. The General Secretary of the Committee, Wang Xianqing, first briefly described the meaning of the establishment of the Committee and the fundraising process in front of the music stand's loudspeaker. Then, Deputy Speaker Xu delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude to all the guests for their generous donations to benefit the refugees. Then the music began, and after the end of a song, the male and female guests began to dance. Before long, Mayor Wu arrived and briefly said a few words to the guests, expressing his deep gratitude. Other programs, such as releasing balloons and various dances, were performed successively. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 midnight. The committee temporarily sold more than 60 tickets yesterday. Movie stars, dance stars, and divas will continue to participate in the dance accompaniment in the next four nights. (The picture above shows Mayor Wu on the right and Deputy Speaker Xu on the left, taken by a reporter from this newspaper)

Glimpses of the Venue The venue was decorated with a Christmas tree more than a丈tall, placed in front of the ballroom. Santa Claus was still staying on the front wall of the dance floor, surrounded by a group of suffering people. Santa Claus pointed to the guests in the seats and said: Please, these kind men and women, give more help. Many elderly ladies and children at the venue only dined and did not dance. Speaker Pan arrived at the ballroom at 6:30 p.m., looked around for a week, and then left. Yang Hu and movie star Wang Xichun entered the venue together and sat in the guest seats. Soon, Fan Shaozeng and Mermaid Yang Xiuqiong also arrived one after another. Wang Xichun and Yang Xiuqiong sat side by side, and everyone's attention was immediately focused on them. Yang Xiuqiong wore a black velvet bare-armed evening dress. Wang Xichun did not take off her coat at first, giving people a feeling of winter and summer arriving at the same time. Xu Ji was busy greeting guests everywhere in the ballroom. He said that he had lived in Shanghai for 35 years, and yesterday was the first time he had entered a dance hall.

The Severity of the Housing Shortage Has Not Decreased Zhao Junhao Asks the Municipal Government to Announce the List of Housing Occupiers as Soon as Possible Following Mayor Wu's report on government work, Senator Gu Jingzhou was the first to raise questions. Regarding the improvement of traffic, he expressed his opinion, saying: In the past, the traffic order in the concessions was better. One reason was probably that the vehicle licenses in Nanshi and Zhabei were not unified, and vehicles could not be driven arbitrarily. The current traffic in the city is so congested. The solutions for improvement are: (1) Can a system of zoned driving licenses be implemented again? (2) Has the city overestimated the vehicle capacity of its streets, thus issuing more vehicle licenses? (3) In addition to cracking down on vendors and improving traffic, have the Public Security Bureau and the Second Police Bureau compared and studied the occupation of roads and the driving conditions of pedicabs and rickshaws? Senator Zhao Junhao said: The severity of the housing shortage has not decreased. At the last conference, the mayor expressed his determination to solve it and said: Some troops in this city are occupying civilian houses. As the saying goes, "Don't be afraid of officials, only be afraid of those in charge." I can negotiate with the superiors and promised to announce the list of those who illegally occupy houses in mid-September, but there has been no news so far. I would like to ask three questions: (1) Has the unfinished business of the Housing Allocation Committee been transferred to the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government? What is the progress now? (2) Has the number of housing occupants been thoroughly investigated? How many are there? (3) If so, please announce the list immediately. Senator Tao Baichuan raised questions regarding the city's public property, for which the municipal government has not yet taken concrete measures or provided a detailed report: (1) How much public property does the municipal government have? What is its value? Has there been any sale? Was there any sale during the puppet regime? Has there been any sale after the establishment of the municipal government? (2) How is the existing public property used? (3) What was the process of transferring public land during the 工部局era? If a survey report is not available this time, can it be prepared for the next conference? Senator Zhang Xuelian asked: Regarding the return of farmland forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppet regime, the municipal government officials at the last conference said they would handle it earnestly, but why has there been no progress to date? Also, you promised to temporarily exempt the land value tax, why haven't you done so?

Mayor's Response to Questions Illegal Housing Occupations Have Been Enforced According to Law The Method of Zoned Driving for Vehicles Will be Considered The mayor declared that, except for some matters beyond the scope of his authority, he would give a comprehensive answer to the various questions as follows: (1) The method of zoned driving for vehicles will be considered and submitted to the conference. (2) The central government has sought fundamental solutions to the economic crisis, and the local government should assist. (3) The matter of public property is being handled by the Public Property Clearance Committee of the Executive Yuan, and it is under discussion. (4) The municipal government's personnel reduction has been implemented in accordance with regulations. The new additions are education personnel. (5) Teachers and staff of municipal schools are civil servants. If the salary is increased according to the proportion of private schools, then the police and others can also make requests. The municipal government's disapproval is really unavoidable and should be planned by the central supervisory authority. (6) The municipal government has submitted a request to the central government for interpretation and instructions regarding the puppet personnel retained by the municipal government. (7) This time, the matter of winter uniforms was not handled directly by the municipal government. I sympathize with the fact that the winning merchant failed to complete the work on schedule. (8) The principle of frugality is followed in the use of personnel. The profit tax has been requested from the central government. (9) Regarding the issue of personal entertainment expenses, there are many international etiquettes in Shanghai that cannot be avoided. We have tried our best to save money. If there is wasteful spending on personal entertainment expenses, please ask Senator Jia to investigate. (10) Regarding the removal of accumulated coffins, we only hope that it can be done this way. Otherwise, we will hold another municipal meeting to discuss it at that time, and there will be a flexible solution. (11) Whether the municipal government's revenue and expenditure have a surplus will be reported after consulting the Finance Bureau for the figures. (12) The central government's interpretation of horse racing has been published in the newspaper. (13) Regarding the illegal occupation of houses, the occupants or institutions have been dealt with according to law. (14) Improving the management of the municipal government will be accepted.

Improving Civil Aviation Shi Bangfan and Others Make Three Suggestions [Report from this Newspaper] City Senator Shi Bangfan and others, in view of the three civil aviation aircraft that crashed in the Shanghai sky at the end of last year, specially proposed to the conference to forward to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Communications to improve civil aviation: (1) Strengthen the equipment of the Longhua Airport in this city (adopting the latest British and American equipment) for international flights. (2) Enrich the ground equipment of civil aviation stations (increase blind landing and night navigation equipment). (3) Enrich civil aviation aircraft equipment (supply safety umbrellas) to ensure safety and benefit civil aviation.

Four Groups Petition Outside Vendors in Xincheng District 2,000 People Shouting and Waving Flags Students Urge the Conference to Reconsider the Dismissal of Art Teachers and Students The Wine and Vegetable Industry Shouts Slogans to Support the New Tax Law [Report from this Newspaper] During the Second Conference of the First Municipal Senate yesterday, four groups petitioned the conference. The details of each situation are as follows: Students from the Municipal Art Normal School, dressed in Boy Scout uniforms, lined up in front of the venue early in the morning and distributed leaflets to the attendees, stating three reasons and urging the conference to reconsider the case of dismissing the Municipal Art Normal School. The named representatives of student parents were Ma Gongyu, Lang Jingshan, Pan Boying, Lü Baike, and He Tianjian, among others. When Mayor Wu was making his government report, about 300 people from the Wine and Vegetable Business Association and the Western Food and Coffee Business Association suddenly appeared in the audience seats on the second floor. They held large white cloth banners and small red and green paper flags and carried leaflets. Their slogans were: support the new banquet tax law, oppose the tiered collection of banquet tax, please the senators decide on a fair tax threshold, businesses with music equipment should not be subject to entertainment tax, we are reducing the burden for citizens, we are petitioning for our own survival, please the senators uphold justice. Senators Wang Xianqing and Liu Jingji represented the Senate in receiving the petitioners, claiming that they would leave it to the conference for discussion and would give a reasonable solution. When the conference adjourned, more than 2,000 petitioners from the outside vendors in the 11th district (Xincheng District) were in front of the Zhengshi Middle School, holding red and green paper flags and riding on four trucks to petition the conference. They claimed that they had been setting up stalls for more than ten years, and this time they were suddenly banned, and their livelihood was uncertain. Therefore, they requested the authorities to allow them to continue setting up stalls to maintain their livelihood. Senator Tang Shichang represented the Senate in receiving the petitioners and, after consultation with Yu Shuping, the acting police chief who attended the conference, promised to resolve the matter properly.

Small Scenes at the Conference Mayor's Apt Metaphor Speaker Wears a Coat The first senator to sign in yesterday was Huang Zhenshi, who was recently formally prosecuted by the High Procuratorate for allegedly being a traitor. The lighting equipment in the venue was very thorough. In addition to a row of lights in front of the stage and several large lights hanging on top, there were four exposure lights on each side of the walls, and four large mercury lamps on the second floor, illuminating the stage, much like a theatrical stage. Du Yuesheng, a senator who did not attend the last conference, also rushed to the meeting yesterday. His seat was number 151, in the third row from the back. Zhu Fuzhen and Shi Bangfan sat side by side at the previous conference, and it happened that they drew side by side again this time, believing that "they were destined in a previous life." Senator Zhu said that he sat to his left last time and to his right this time. Someone said he was "the left and right prime minister." Yesterday was overcast and rainy. Although there were four stoves in the venue, the place was too large, and it was still cold and damp. Senators Li Wenjie and Chen Baotai saw that Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang did not wear coats and were sitting on the stage, and they sympathized very much. They specially sent a proposal paper, which read: "It's too cold, the Speaker and Secretary-General should put on coats." Half an hour later, the Speaker did put on a leather-collared coat. Mayor Wu said during his report: On the one hand, we must take care of the needs of life, and on the other hand, we must take care of the burden of the people. The municipal government and the Municipal Senate are like a sandwich,夹in the middle. After the government report, when the emcee announced the start of the questioning of the municipal government, the atmosphere on the seats of the municipal government attendees suddenly became very tense. The mayor and the heads of various bureaus secretly discussed countermeasures. At the last conference, Mayor Wu's ashtray was always full of cigarette butts. Yesterday, it was suddenly seen that the mayor had changed his style and started smoking a pipe. However, the habit of nodding frequently when listening to the senators' questions remained the same. Senator Shao Yongsheng, No. 149, personally went to the rostrum to submit written questions. When speaking, he gritted his teeth, clenched his fists, and was overly excited, so that his speech exceeded the time limit and was warned as many as nine times. Afterwards, the rostrum was afraid that the bell was too small to be heard clearly, so they added two more bells. In this way, when the speaker exceeded the time, several bells rang together, and the momentum was greatly enhanced. The questioning ended at 12:25 p.m. Mayor Wu took the stage to answer one by one. After answering quickly, the senators, eager to go home for dinner, did not pursue the matter further and dispersed in a rush, giving the mayor a break.

Two court officers stepped forward to help him. However, by the time he was escorted back to prison, he had returned to normal. He bowed to the judge, the defense lawyer, and the audience, but the ruddy color of his face had turned pale. The date of Mi Cun's execution will be decided after reporting to the Ministry of National Defense for approval. According to the law, no appeal is allowed for this death sentence. However, Judge Li finally declared: "If the defendant has any statement to make, he may submit a statement of defense within ten days after the verdict is served, and the military court will forward it to the Ministry of National Defense for review."

Old Jew Collaborates with the Enemy The Court Orders Investigation and Retrial [Report from this Newspaper] Robert Peritz, 51 years old, is a stateless Jew. He was accused of colluding with the Japanese enemy. He was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon, and most of the audience were Jews. The defendant was burly, with gray hair, wearing a black suit. Standing in the defendant's column, he often showed impatience. He was accused of running for the enemy in 1940 when the enemy tried to control the administrative power of the Shanghai 工部局, fearing that the number of overseas Chinese votes was insufficient. He wooed German Jewish refugees to join the voting. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1942, the enemy stationed in the concession. The defendant was commissioned by the enemy navy to set up an organization at the Cathay Hotel. Under the command of the enemy, he secretly reviewed documents related to Britain and broadcast in German every day to publicize for the enemy. At the same time, he vigorously supported the pro-Japanese Shanghai Jewish newspaper and prevented the publication of other Jewish newspapers that were beneficial to our country. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been detained in a concentration camp by the enemy gendarmerie for five weeks. He claimed that the original informant, Stingle Hawthorne, sold black market goods in the concentration camp and was a public enemy of Jewish refugees. Then, an English Jewish Anming Staier came to court to testify. The court ordered that the investigation was still needed and rescheduled the retrial.

Bao Qihuang Ordered to Shanghai to Continue Interrogating Wang Renshan Since the Jiangwan Armory Explosion, after the head of the sub-warehouse, Wang Renshan, turned himself in, Bao Qihuang, the chief military judge of the Ministry of National Defense, was ordered to come to Shanghai again the day before yesterday to handle the continued interrogation of the case. It is learned that yesterday afternoon, Director Bao, together with Yan Zi, the deputy director of the Hudong Inspection Office of the Garrison Command, transferred the Wang Renshan case to the Military Court of the Garrison Command for interrogation. The interrogation lasted until 4:30 in the afternoon. Wang Renshan was still escorted back to the detention center of the First Supply Command. According to Director Bao, after the interrogation, he told reporters that Qin Decun, the president of the trial court in this case, was unable to come to Shanghai due to official duties. He was ordered to come to Shanghai to conduct the trial of this case. Today, he and Deputy Director Yan of the Inspection Office have conducted an interrogation.

Whether or not the sentence can be commuted will be decided by the trial judges in this case based on the actual situation after the joint trial.

More Than 2,000 Tons of Iron Estimated Value Exceeds 1 Billion Embezzled from Within Sun Zhuting Files a Secret Report in His Own Name Requests Investigation of Relevant Receivers [Report from this Newspaper] The investigation of the case of the Fuji Construction Factory hiding enemy assets has not yet ended. Unexpectedly, the District Procuratorate recently received a secret report signed by Sun Zhuting and co-signed by Cao Haishen and Zhu Shengyao, requesting the investigation of Lv Shishang, the former leader of the Investigation Team of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau and the person in charge of the Third Front Army Military Goods Receiving Committee, and Ding Guitang, the former deputy general tax officer of the Customs and former tax officer of the Jianghai Customs. The content roughly stated: On September 29, 1945, the secret report to the Military Goods Receiving Committee of the Third Front Army seized a large number of enemy assets hidden in No. 340 Deng脫Road, including coal, iron, oil, rice, wheat, etc. Among them, there were more than 2,100 tons of scrap iron and more than 26,000 strips of pig iron (i.e., white iron water pipes). The above-mentioned materials were transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau after the establishment of the Bureau on December 11 of the same year, and the Bureau handed them over to Jianghai Customs for receipt. The two items of scrap iron and pig iron were publicly auctioned by Jianghai Customs on December 23, entrusted to Da Zhong, Yi Zhong, Rui He, and Louis Mo 洋行. However, the Military Goods Receiving Committee of the Third Front Army did not transfer the original report file to the Processing Bureau, so the secret report bonus for this batch of materials has not yet been approved. After the original informants repeatedly urged Jianghai Customs, they recently replied that there were not more than 2,000 tons of scrap iron, only 900 tons, and only 400 tons were actually sold. There were still 250 tons of residual iron皮(iron皮). As for the number of 2,100 tons of scrap iron and 26,000 strips of pig iron at that time, some said "typo," some said "estimation error," and some said "the auction on December 23 was not the materials from Deng脫Road." However, Sun Zhuting and others have been able to confirm from various sources that the more than 2,000 tons of scrap iron and pig iron have been embezzled, and their estimated value should be more than 100 million yuan. Therefore, they submitted a document requesting an investigation into Lv Shishang, Ding Guitang, and the personnel who handled the receipt and auction, so that the truth would be revealed. Because the case is related to the case of the Fuji Construction Factory hiding enemy assets, it is still being handled by Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao. However, what Prosecutor Gu had previously investigated was only the enemy quality hidden in the warehouse on Yanping Road. This time, Deng脫Road is another case. Prosecutor Gu specially presented a reply first and then filed the case separately. The detention period of Shen Wenyuan, an important suspect in the previous case, was about to expire, so he should be prosecuted. Now, because of another school section, Prosecutor Gu has applied to the court to extend Shen's detention period to facilitate the investigation.

Central Cooperative Bank Shanghai Branch Opens The Shanghai Branch of the Central Cooperative Bank opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, presided over by General Manager Shou Miancheng. He gathered all the branch colleagues at 7:00 a.m. and gave a speech, encouraging them with the spirit of cooperation for the future development of the cooperative cause and mentioning the difficulties in establishing the Central Cooperative Bank and the Bank's business philosophy, with many warnings. The branch is divided into five groups: General Affairs, Business, Accounting, Treasury, and Guidance, providing financial guidance and assistance for various cooperative businesses in the area. The Central Cooperative Bank's main task is to restore and develop the cooperative economy in the pacification zone. However, Shanghai is the financial and economic center of the country, and its impact on the inland economy is profound and huge. All aspects, such as the transportation and sales of agricultural products, the supply of agricultural supplies, and the flow of urban capital to rural areas to support agriculture, must be closely linked with the city in order to be effective. The establishment of the Shanghai Branch is extremely important for the development of the Bank's cause.

Suspects in Vendor Case First Trial Yesterday All Allowed to Post Bail A Chorus of Thank You [Report from this Newspaper] Last year, when this newspaper selected the top ten news stories, the vendor incident was selected as the number one news story. The suspects detained in the case were Fang Daosheng, Liu Ouxiang, Lu Genlin, Lin Ajiang, Chen Abao, Xia Caigen, Ye Genfu, Si Huazhang, Qi Jiagu, Wu Changkang, Zhao Fuqing, Yu Quhua, Ni Shunxiang, Li Jinyuan, Wu Datou, Liu Cheng铮, Wang Yinyin, Xu Yuntao, Gu Lidao, Li Changgui, Zhang Rongqin, Gu Ermao, Liu Haiquan, Kang Zuyuan, Zhou Meilin, Qian Niulang, Ju Qiguang, Wu Hesheng, Ma Shulu, Yin Agen, Zhuang Gongmin, Zhang Xinfu, Sun Rongliang, Tang Youhua, Zhang Miaogen, Yan Yunbao, Chen Linsheng, Zu Shizi, Dong Xin竟, Sun Yuanchang, Zhou Mingde, Liu Xingfa, Han Akun, Zhang Amao, Ni Defu, and Wang Qichang.

Of the 46 defendants, 20 were in custody and 26 were out on bail. All the defendants except one were present in court, and Shi Enjian, the director of the Lao閘 Police Branch, and Jiang Shangpei, the judicial section chief, were called as witnesses.

Amnesty Order Not Received · Trial Proceeded as Usual Judge Xie Zhiying first called the names of the 45 defendants and inquired about their ages and native places.

However, now the National Government has issued an amnesty order, and all the defendants' crimes are within the scope of the amnesty. The defendants have requested bail, and the court is requested to grant bail in accordance with the law.

Before the trial, Judge Xie told the defendants in a very gentle manner: The City Government's crackdown on the拟版has to do with 生计, but 等等 should request relief through proper procedures. Gathering crowds to riot and obstruct order is not permitted by law. Although the amnesty order has been posted, this court will proceed with the trial as usual before the order is received. It is hoped that all will confess the facts truthfully to avoid further summons and questioning. He also announced: The defendants who have previously been released on bail can remain on their original bail, and those in custody will also be allowed to post bail and be available at any time. It is hoped that they will understand this intention, repent, and start anew.

Formal Vendors Only One Third After the announcement, individual trials began. The defendants all denied the crimes of destroying shops, inciting strikes, obstructing vehicles, and spreading rumors. The defendants were not all vendors. For example, the first defendant, Fang Zhesheng, confessed that he was a blacksmith, the second defendant, Liu Zhiqing, confessed that he was a handyman, the third defendant, Lu Genlin, confessed that he was a printing worker, and the fourth defendant, Lin Ajiang, confessed that he was a shoe shiner. Formal vendors accounted for less than one-third of the total. The trial continued until noon, and all 45 people had been questioned. Judge Xie announced that all were allowed to post bail. A chorus of thank you was heard in the courtroom, and everyone left happily. However, among them, Ye Gengshi, who was only 17 years old, had lost both parents, and no one could find bail for him.

Hong Kong in the Cold Season
December 28th, Hong Kong Shipping News

Following the departure of the British Trade Mission to China, well-informed sources in Hong Kong and China once widely speculated that President Song would soon come to Shanghai for inspection. Now, the facts have proven that the high-ranking financial officials from our side coming to Hong Kong are not President Song, but rather the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei Zuyi, along with the British financial advisor, Mr. Rogers, and other economic experts.

Bei Zuyi's Mysterious Mission to Hong Kong

Mr. Bei's mission to Hong Kong has now sparked various speculations. Some say it is related to the Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations, while others say it concerns the adjustment of the national currency exchange rate. Opinions vary, and no consensus has been reached. When Mr. Bei met with reporters, he only said that he was coming to Hong Kong for the Christmas holidays and had no other missions. Mr. Bei's vacation to Hong Kong is accompanied by as many as fifteen financial experts or important officials, which is no wonder the speculation from various quarters is intensifying. According to economic authorities, Mr. Bei's main tasks on this trip, in addition to inspecting the Central Bank's operations and rectifying the financial situation, are: (1) to promote export trade, (2) to prevent smuggling, and (3) to strengthen the management of overseas remittances.

Mr. Bei arrived in Hong Kong after 2:00 PM on the 21st. That evening, Hong Kong Governor Young hosted a dinner at Government House to welcome Mr. Bei. It is rumored that Mr. Bei will meet with the General Manager of HSBC, Mr. Morse, on the 23rd. The four major banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural) are scheduled to hold a grand cocktail party for Mr. Bei at the Gloucester Hotel on the 9th floor at 6:00 PM on the 22nd, to entertain the heads of local Chinese and other foreign banks, leaders of the business community, senior Hong Kong government officials, etc. Mr. Bei will stay in Hong Kong for a week.

Capital Flight to Hong Kong Continues to Increase Monthly

Capital flight from the mainland to Hong Kong has continued to increase in recent months. In the initial stage, the amount of capital fleeing to Hong Kong each month was estimated at 10 billion national currency, but recently it has increased to 30 billion national currency. The total amount of capital flight to Hong Kong in the second half of this year is estimated to be over 100 billion national currency. As the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei will naturally not ignore this serious problem. However, to thoroughly stop capital flight from the mainland to Hong Kong, it is necessary to obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government. Mr. Bei's long journey here is likely one of the reasons.

Our country's financial authorities often focus on Shanghai as the axis, while neglecting the special characteristics of Hong Kong. Hong Kong's economy shares the same origin as the mainland, but its direct control lies with the London government. Capital from the mainland can be converted into foreign exchange in Hong Kong. The mainland restricts the import of foreign goods, and Hong Kong becomes a smuggling center. The mainland bans the export of yarn, and the mainland controls foreign exchange, so overseas remittances are transferred to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong procures Japanese yarn for the market... Because of the existence of this kind of backlash, the longer the time, the greater the impact, and we have to urgently find remedies.

The Head of the Trade Mission Claims Japanese Yarn Will Be Shipped to Hong Kong

Sir Bowes, the head of the British Trade Mission to China, gave a speech to Hong Kong merchants, stating that Britain is determined to make its best efforts to supply Hong Kong and Chinese factories with industrial raw materials.

He claimed that as a result of the Hong Kong government taking over from the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo, a Japanese ship has already loaded 2 million pounds of Japanese yarn and set sail from Japan to Hong Kong, which is expected to arrive at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The more than 500 large and small weaving factories in Hong Kong require approximately 640,000 pounds of cotton yarn per month, so the first batch of Japanese yarn can supply three months' worth. The Hong Kong government has assured the weavers that it will continue to supply cotton yarn for at least six months. The cost of each bale of Japanese yarn is valued at 800,000 national currency, while Shanghai yarn is currently valued at over 2 million national currency. It is easy to imagine what impact that will have on the future of Shanghai yarn. Currently, the price of printed cotton cloth in Hong Kong and China has plummeted, selling for only 1.5 to 2.5 national currency per yard. After the arrival of Japanese yarn in Hong Kong, it will inevitably become even cheaper. At that time, the domestic market will be flooded with Hong Kong cotton products woven from Japanese yarn!

Looking to the Future, Hong Kong Merchants are Mostly Optimistic

Hong Kong business leaders are mostly optimistic about the prospects for 1947. According to their analysis, there are approximately the following points:

Ferry Carrying Cars Between Hong Kong and Kowloon
(Special Correspondent for this newspaper in Hong Kong, Zi Jian, took this photo)

(1) Because Hong Kong was occupied for several years, the source of foreign goods was interrupted, so after the victory, the first imported goods were snapped up and received unexpectedly large interest rates, but this is an abnormal state and cannot last.

(2) Some merchants thought they could make huge profits, so they rushed to place large orders, creating an imbalance between supply and demand, causing prices to fall daily.

(3) Because the transport ships after the war came and went irregularly, and labor strikes occurred frequently, the supply was intermittent, sometimes arriving in large quantities, and sometimes not arriving for a long time, making it impossible for importers and exporters to budget, and profits and losses were uncertain.

(4) This situation is an abnormal state after the war. In the future, prices will gradually tend to a reasonable level, and ship traffic will become more normal. Although merchants will not get windfall profits as in the past, business may have a budget and a certain interest rate. Business will be able to achieve soundness, and the future can naturally be optimistic.

(5) Although the mainland implements very strict import controls, its purpose is to prevent people's expenditures from increasing gradually, which is a countermeasure to stabilize the domestic financial economy. However, there are still many essential goods in the mainland that must rely on foreign imports...

However, pessimists also have their reasons: they cite the recent three months of Hong Kong import and export figures to prove that Hong Kong's trade has gradually declined:

In these three months, imports have decreased by 30 million yuan, and exports have decreased by 14 million yuan, making business in all industries increasingly dull.

Spring Lottery Tickets: Latecomers Miss Out

The market is as quiet as usual, and merchants can only pin their hopes on the future. The Hong Kong government's financial budget is also calling for economic downturn. After the Legislative Council passed the collection of food and beverage tax (one-tenth), increased tobacco and alcohol tax, and collected property sales tax, it was rumored that it was considering collecting dance tax. Therefore, not only merchants are eager for early prosperity, but the government is also eagerly hoping for early prosperity!

In the past few days, contrary to the general business firms, the Hong Kong Jockey Club's lottery ticket sales office has been exceptionally crowded. More than 300,000 tickets for the spring lottery, which is scheduled to be drawn on January 14th next year, have already been sold. Latecomers will miss out. Who doesn't want to be the winner in 1947! After this year, Hong Kong's reconstruction work has been mostly completed. The magnificent Peninsula Hotel, the cars in front of the door are again lined up, restoring the scene of the year. The ferry carrying cars has long been traveling between Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the ugly souvenir of the Japanese army, the "Loyal Souls Pagoda," has now been put out for tender for demolition. The two large bronze lions in front of the HSBC bank have also been shipped back from Japan to their original stone base. The external wounds of Hong Kong seem to have been largely washed away. Now, general attention is focused on how to get through its recession and turn to the road to prosperity.

Scenery of Fuzhou, an Eastern Garden City

December 28th, Flight News
Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Chen Zhengyu

The reporter flew from Shanghai to Fuzhou on the eve of Christmas. When the plane arrived at Fuzhou Airport, the aircraft wheel malfunctioned, almost causing a major disaster. It finally landed dangerously after circling several times in the air, suffering only a severe shock, fortunately without any accidents. The plane landed at Yiyu Airport, located in the suburbs of Fuzhou, more than ten miles from the urban area. Driving into the city on the rugged road, the reporter, having been away from his hometown for seven years of war, was not without emotion as he saw the elders and brothers of Minzhong (Fuzhou).

Social Economy

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Fuzhou fell twice, once in the 30th year and once in the 33rd year of the Republic [1941 and 1944]. Although the enemy's occupation time was very short, materials were plundered. In the 30th year, after the enemy withdrew from Fuzhou, the Taiwanese enemy radio broadcast that the enemy had not destroyed Fuzhou and withdrew voluntarily. In fact, the buildings in the Fuzhou urban area did not suffer any destruction. However, after the enemy left, Fuzhou suffered an unprecedented food panic, and starvation was everywhere. Fuzhou people still remember it vividly. Fuzhou was originally unable to supply its own food and relied on the assistance of northern Fujian and Nanyang (Southeast Asia) rice. In terms of industry, there was only the manufacture of handicrafts. Many daily necessities relied on imports from Shanghai. How could it withstand two sieges by the enemy and puppet regimes? Therefore, the current situation of material exhaustion has been formed.

After the provincial government returned to Fuzhou last November, the population of Fuzhou increased sharply, followed by soaring prices. Post-war coastal shipping has not yet returned to its pre-war state. Fuzhou's export trade is also somewhat restricted by transportation. Moreover, in today's dumping of foreign goods, the entire national industry is suffocated, and the trade deficit is becoming increasingly serious. How can this be limited to Fuzhou's export trade? Fuzhou's handicrafts, such as lacquerware, have always been famous at home and abroad and have won awards at the Chicago Exposition in the United States. Now, sales are also feeling difficult. Fuzhou does not have a stock exchange market, and there is no frenzied speculation by big capitalists. The price of gold and US dollars in Fuzhou does not lead the prices. Therefore, it is very clear that the rise in prices is entirely dominated by the law of supply and demand, and the situation is relatively simple compared to Shanghai. As soon as prices rise, the first to bear the brunt are public school teachers and staff with a fixed amount of currency income. Fuzhou is listed in the fourth grade according to the central salary standard (recently adjusted to the third grade). A-level public school teachers and staff only receive a salary of over 100,000 yuan. How can they support themselves and their families in the face of white rice at 80,000 yuan per dan?

When the reporter met with friends, they all bitterly talked about the pain of high prices and the oppression of life. However, the reporter, who had just arrived from Shanghai, felt a sense of relief. In any case, the price index of all goods (excluding foreign goods) is lower than that of Shanghai, and the cost of living is slightly higher than that of Shanghai.

Glimpse of Political Situation

First of all, let's talk about conscription: the general public in Fuzhou habitually do not say "conscription" but say "pulling strong men," which shows the psychology of the public. It is said that the Fuzhou Municipal Government has not yet formally issued an order to conscript strong men, but the district offices and even the Baojia heads have already started "forcibly pulling strong men," and even blood cases have been caused. Strong men were injured before they even went on an expedition, which became a topic of street gossip for the citizens of Fuzhou. The Fuzhou media has strongly criticized the authorities for this. It is heard that the district head of Daqiao District, where the blood case occurred, has been dismissed from his post for investigation, and the two injured strong men have been sent to public hospitals for treatment. The occurrence of this kind of incident is truly unfortunate and is enough to create difficulties for the conscription work. In addition, cases of impersonation are emerging one after another. The price of a strong man has broken through the one million yuan mark and can be compared with the status of a strong man in Guangzhou. It is heard that the Baojia heads also illegally apportioned resettlement expenses for the strong men to each household, and the amount was determined by the Baojia heads at their discretion to be given to the families of volunteers. It is heard that the municipal government authorities are paying attention to this matter. The policy of conscription has a very short history of implementation in our country, but malpractices are emerging one after another. When the public hears about conscription, they are all uneasy. The reason is nothing more than that the personnel handling military service have failed to fulfill their duties. They neither handle it in accordance with the "three equal principles" of military service nor can they provide the strong men who are conscripted into the camp with a comfortable life and treat their families well so that they have no worries. How can they blame the strong men for deserting?

Prostitution and dancing are still prohibited in Fuzhou under the current laws, but underground activities are rampant. Not long ago, the municipal government had a proposal to lift the ban, but it was rejected by the women's movement. However, relevant parties said that if prostitution and dancing are completely prohibited, the livelihoods of a large number of prostitutes and singers will be difficult to maintain, which will create social unrest. Moreover, the secret exploitation suffered by these people is even more serious. Rather than doing underground business, it is better to let them operate openly, and the municipal government can also obtain funds from dancers and patrons in the municipal financial autonomy, which is in dire straits—why not develop a reliable source of taxation? The reporter told a friend: In order to rectify the declining morals, it is not impossible for the government to ban prostitution and dancing. However, after the ban, where can she get food? The government does not have many production institutions for them to do direct production. Therefore, they still secretly engage in their old occupations.

"Severely punish corruption and rectify official norms." This is a unanimous requirement from all over the country. However, in the midst of shouting to report corruption, the corrupt officials still do their own thing. What does it have to do with you? Not long ago, Fuzhou had a grain corruption case that used power for personal gain. Gao Dengting, the director of civil affairs, and relevant officials stepped down, which was considered settled. Recently, two more corruption cases have occurred, which the Fuzhou media has exposed. One is the suspicion of corruption and dereliction of duty by Xu Yuanpei, the director of the Education Section of the Municipal Government. The matter originated from the fact that he accepted gifts from his subordinates for his father's funeral, which seemed to exceed the limits of friendship. It is said that the supervisory agency has sent personnel to investigate thoroughly. The other is the large-scale corruption case by the group headed by Yang Donglin, the director of the tax collection office of the municipal government. There are 6 million yuan without supporting evidence. There are still more than 10 million yuan in the investigation. The entire case has been thoroughly investigated by personnel sent by the municipal government.

Fuzhou Scenery

Approximately 400,000 people are concentrated in Fuzhou, this "Eastern Garden City." Fuzhou has a strong literary style, and children regard studying as the supreme honor. Education is also developed, with three colleges and numerous middle schools, and many are large in scale. On the way, you can see students in uniforms walking quickly to school in groups of three or five. The church has a great influence in Fuzhou. The more large-scale schools in Fuzhou are all church schools, such as the Union University, Yinghua, Gezhi, and Trinity Middle Schools, which have nurtured many talents. Fuzhou has six daily newspapers and three weekly newspapers. The magazines published by the Improvement Publishing House and the Provincial Research Institute are better. In general, secondary education in Fuzhou is very developed, and higher education needs to be expanded because many Fuzhou children go north or to Shanghai for further study after graduating from middle school. Culture is declining, and the literary world is poor. This may be because the life of literati is difficult and the publishing industry cannot rise due to high prices.

Fuzhou has beautiful scenery and pleasant scenery. The Min River runs through the front, surrounded by mountains on three sides, preserving a pure ancient style. The people of Fuzhou pass down bronze and stone calligraphy and paintings from generation to generation and regard them as treasures. Confucian classics and historical records are used as family textbooks. The Fuzhou dialect forms its own system. When outsiders first arrive in Fuzhou, the most uncomfortable thing is the language barrier. According to legend, the Fuzhou dialect is the earliest language in our country. Before the Song Dynasty, it was used in various parts of Jiangnan (the area south of the Yangtze River). Later, other branches of our Han nationality, Hokkien, and other ethnic groups occupied Fuzhou from the sea and infiltrated their languages into the Fuzhou language, forming the Fuzhou dialect today. This can be verified in historical records.

Fuzhou is located on the coast. Going out of the Min River estuary is the East China Sea. The waterway traffic can reach Shanghai in two and a half days to the north and Xiamen in one day to the south. The land route has the Fuxia Line, which can reach Xiamen in one day. This line was destroyed during the war and is now being repaired in stages. The export of wood, tea, shiitake mushrooms, fruits, paper, and bamboo shoots from northwestern Fujian and the import of Shanghai foreign goods all take Fuzhou as a port of entry and exit. The South Tai Surface in Fuzhou faces the Min River and is a trading center, just like the Bund in Shanghai.

Hong Kong Happy Valley Racecourse After the War, Golden Ounce is Intact (Special Reporter Zi Jian)
Taiwan East Travelogue (4) Hualien Port
Taipei News on the 23rd
Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Hualien Port - the first city in eastern Taiwan, a new emerging port city. Eastern Taiwan generally includes Taitung, Hualien Port, Suao, and Yilan. Taitung and Hualien Port are two counties. Suao, Luodong, and Yilan now belong to Taipei County. Local people in the northeastern part of the island are now brewing a restoration: restoring the county administration. In terms of Taitung and Hualien Port, Hualien Port is actually more prosperous and lively than Taitung. Taitung is a desolate city submerged in the desert. There is no one on the streets at dusk, and the torches for the lights emit a dim light. The sea breeze blows sand during the day, full of dust; Hualien Port looks like it is wearing the coat of a modern civilized city. Although the low houses retain the charm of 30 years ago, the prosperity of the port makes it directly bear the impact of the torrents from inside and outside the island. It is still young!

The local people will compare the desolate scene of 30 years ago (then named Zhuyang) with the present. At that time, it was a desolate hill on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, a sparse village of twenty or thirty households; 30 years later, it has the prototype of a city and is indeed the first city in eastern Taiwan. Hualien Port people can be proud of this.

Great Mountain Range

Reserves of Mountain Forest Minerals

County Magistrate Zhang Wencheng and the county's Inspectorate arranged a schedule and comfortable accommodation. There are more hostels in Hualien Port than in Taitung, and they still maintain a pure Japanese style, providing accommodation for passing travelers. When the Changgui VIP gasoline car drove into the station, we heard firecrackers, and a line of welcoming representatives lined up in the night streets to greet us. Among us, we all felt uneasy, really feeling like when Wilkie received a grand welcome in Chongqing.

County Magistrate Zhang said that because the telecommunications were not smooth, preparations were made as early as two days ago, so they were able to receive the news today. He told us in detail about the current situation of Hualien Port. He said that the biggest blow to the port was the bombing in the 33rd year [1944]. It is rich in placer gold, with a 50-foot deep gold-bearing layer underground, with mercury, asbestos, limestone, marble, without having to look for the coal mines in the west, with more than 80% of the forest area, inexhaustible lumber, and a sugar factory that is being rebuilt.

The county government, like Taitung, requires provincial assistance for 4/10 of the budget for the 36th year [1947], which is a reduction of 19 million compared to this year. The county magistrate hopes to cooperate with other departments to build farmland irrigation and water conservancy, and build transportation. He hopes that any business that the county can do will be handed over to the county to do, and any business that the county does not have the power to do will be done by the province.

There are 32 mountains with a height of several thousand feet behind the port, including Nanhu Mountain, Central Jianshan Mountain, North Hehuan Mountain, Zhilai Mountain, Nenggao Mountain, Andongjun Mountain, Yuanda Mountain, Xiuguluan Mountain, etc. The whole county has 140,000 people, and more than 50,000 Gaoshan people are scattered in the plains and mountains. These Gaoshan people scattered in the mountains like to burn mountains with wildfires, and the forests suffer, so Director Chen specially appointed the director with a hand-written order to strictly prohibit it. The county magistrate and we have the same view that eastern Taiwan is not an agricultural or commercial area but an industrial area with natural conditions.

Port of Call: Ports Need Urgent Repairs

The Japanese boasted that Hualien Port, located in the Milun Plain, was an unparalleled excavated port in the world. Before the construction of the Suhua Highway, the annual import and export cargo reached more than 80,000 tons. As a result, the Japanese government allocated 7.5 million in 1931 to start construction and completed it in October 1939. Later, the railway from Taitung to Hualien was also extended northward from Hualien City to the port, completing sea-land transportation, with annual import and export cargo reaching 200,000 tons. In 1940, it was decided to expand the port with a budget of 5 million. In 1945, it was affected by the war and fell into a standstill. This port is a small port completely artificially excavated, with a depth of 15 meters. The east and west breakwaters surround the outer port, and the inner port is rectangular, with a berthing area of 70,000 square meters. The water surface flow rate is 2,300 meters per hour. Because it has not been repaired for many years, it was originally used as a port of call and could berth ships of 3,000 tons. Now the Hualien Branch of the Keelung Port Bureau is planning to deepen the water depth from 6 meters to 7.5 meters, while repairing lighthouses, buoys, and purchasing a 30-ton crane to give it a loading and unloading capacity of 1 million tons. Currently, the bureau is focusing on repairing the east breakwater. When the parts impacted by typhoon waves in May this year were rushed to repair, they unexpectedly encountered a wind disaster again when they were completed. More than 70 meters of the dike body facing the most violent wind and waves was washed away. They have decided to make large concrete blocks and rush to repair the dike body as the central work for next year, requiring 6,000 tons of cement, totaling NT$10 million. The bureau solemnly pointed out that if it cannot be completed next year and is hit by a typhoon again, Hualien Port will be over like a dreamlike lotus!

The inspection team received the care of Xu Renshou, Director of Keelung Port Bureau, and Captain Tong Sun of Tang Shipping. We used the bureau's steamship to inspect the port for a week. It happened that the 2,700-ton L.S.T. from Japan was parked there, carrying more than 260 Japanese expatriates back to their country. The two points were fluttering, and the waves were raging. We left the ship and inspected the breakwater slightly. The scene of urgent repair was already visible.

Immigrant Village: Tour of the Demonstration Farm

The Japanese had such a plan 30 years ago to make Taiwan a Taiwan of the Japanese, and the Taiwanese who had lived and thrived for generations were transplanted to Nanyang and other places. The establishment of the government-run immigrant village in Taitung meant this. They used Taitung Hualien Port as a testing ground and expanded it to the central plains. They had already selected 15 villages as shelters.

The Japanese government gave them great convenience for this planned and purely aggressive immigration. A dedicated office was established in the government agencies to be responsible for supervising, encouraging, and autonomous training. The government gave them official land to cultivate, huge funds, and the villages were equipped with nurseries, schools, hospitals, halls, cooperatives, and an ideal residence, improving their lives and encouraging them to fish and collectivize self-cultivation farmers and immigrants, making management scientific and management rationalized. The four immigrant villages of Yoshino, Toyota, Hayashida, and Mizuho in the territory have achieved remarkable results, and Yoshino Village is even known as a model village. The total population of these four villages is 2,705 people, 585 households, with a total area of more than 41,900 acres, accounting for 10.2% of the county's area.

After the restoration, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry took them over and converted them into demonstration farms. Now they are planting successive crops of rice, rotating crops of sugar cane, tobacco, and sweet potatoes, and have sugar cane, coffee, processing plants, and rice mills. The total income of its agricultural products accounts for 10% of the county's output. The demonstration farm is now looking forward to adopting collective farming methods, because the cultivated land is flat, and the adoption of a large agricultural management system and the use of machine farming can increase production efficiency and is also suitable for extensive conditions.

Aluminum and Nickel Plants: Urgent Resumption of Work

There are several factories in Hualien, the more famous are the aluminum and nickel factories. What the local people are most concerned about at present is that the government wants to move these two factories away, and at the same time move the 76,000 K·W· power generation equipment that can only consume more than 2,000 now to Fujian. This power equipment was originally completely to supply the two factories, especially aluminum, which requires 36,000 K·W· of consumption during wartime industrial production.

The rain in the port has a chill. We still follow the planned plan to visit. The aluminum plant with a capital of 600 million yen is located on the edge of the port. In the past, the Japanese transported sand blocks from Manila to be refined into aluminum here and in Kaohsiung. One ton of aluminum sand can refine 40 kilograms of aluminum through electrical decomposition, and one aircraft city requires 1.5 tons of aluminum. It is said that the monthly output of the factory is 20,000 tons. The reporter took a cursory look at this factory, which was full of desolation and almost a scorched earth. The Allied radar had not let it go, and the electrolytic parts, cement, and charcoal blocks were scattered in a mess, soaked in rainwater. Transformers and large arc rectifiers were all blown to pieces. The Resources Committee has decided to cooperate with the Canadian aluminum plant and use all its strength to resume work at the Kaohsiung plant first, and Hualien Port is preparing to give up. The reporters all believed that the Hualien Port Water Products School, which is suitable for Hualien, is quite ideal because it faces the fishing port of the Pacific warm current.

Underground Objects: Iron Minerals are the Richest

Not long ago, there was a rumor in this province that coal was found in Taitung, which can be mined, but after the Geological Survey Institute of this province went to investigate, it proved that the so-called coal seam was only some pieces of wood that had been carbonized and buried in the gravel layer. Bi Qingchang, the director of the institute, told reporters about the underground resources of eastern Taiwan. He said that what is already known here are natural gas (gas), placer gold, and magnesium-containing minerals. The following is a brief report:

There are several natural gas leaks in the southern suburbs of Taitung County and the southern section of the Coastal Mountains. The rising gas has also created mud volcanoes. Natural gas itself is a fuel, but the reason why it can attract people's attention is actually because there is a possibility of discovering oil under it. There are many places in Taiwan that produce natural gas. According to years of exploration, the lower layer does not necessarily contain oil. Because eastern Taiwan is close to the Central Mountains made of metamorphic rocks that can never store oil, and to the east is the Pacific Ocean, and the structure of the Oceanic Mountains is very complex, the geological conditions are more unfavorable than the west. Although we cannot absolutely deny it now, it is a possible oil field, but if we say that we should pay attention to it, I am afraid it will be the last one in this province.

The placer gold in eastern Taiwan is mostly produced on the eastern slope of the Central Mountains, and it is relatively more abundant in the Central Mountains in Hualien Port County. Placer gold is usually produced in older terraces composed of gravel. These terraces are widely distributed in the mountains. Seven or eight years ago, a technician estimated an amazing amount of gold reserves based on the richer parts and inferred the whole, so this technician suddenly became a hero and became a guest of honor of Kobayashi Seizō, the former governor of Taiwan. But later it was found that not all of the terraces in the mountains contained a high gold content, almost making a big joke. Although a relatively accurate estimate has not been obtained since then, it can already be said to be at most an ordinary placer gold deposit. Because traffic is difficult at present, there is no possibility of development for the time being.

The magnesium-containing minerals in eastern Taiwan include serpentine, olivine, chlorite, dolomite, and asbestos. They are produced along the Central Mountains and Coastal Mountains from Suao to Taitung. The only one that already has economic value is the asbestos in Fengtian, Hualien County. Now, because magnesium is required in the process of manufacturing chemical fertilizers, and fertilizers are the most needed things in Taiwan in the future, serpentine and other things will also be useful things. The geological survey institute recently conducted a general survey of magnesium-containing minerals in Taiwan Island. The eastern Taiwan has the most reserves, which is sufficient to supply the needs of fertilizer manufacturing.

Ms. Zhou Xiaoyan's Recent Photo: Amazing Singing, Better Than an International Orator; Transforming into Thousands, Emitting Sounds in English, French, and German. Ms. Zhou Xiaoyan, a Visiting Singer and Scholar; A Famous Sister in the Parisian Student Community
December 21st, Parisian Aviation News
Special Correspondent Hong Yuan in Paris

The Parisian student community all praises Ms. Xiaoyan's singing ability. Because of the introduction of celebrities in the art world and leaders of social circles, an appointment was made to meet at her residence. At about 3:30, I rushed to her residence. Ms. Xiaoyan's temples were surrounded by dark clouds. She wore a black Western-style shirt and applied some vermilion color. It was even better than a good night's gathering with the addition of a short Chinese embroidered "Tuanhua Yan Hai" pattern cape. Ms. Xiaoyan grew up in Hubei (Hankou), and speaks both Beijing and Shanghai languages fluently. She is well versed in the languages and literature of France, England, Germany, and other countries. A portrait of Xiao Lingxiao's hidden wife is hung on the wall, which is lifelike and realistic. The sunlight is in the window, the aroma of tea fills the air, the clear words are refreshing, and wonderful thoughts are born.

Ms. Xiaoyan's father was originally a big banker, and now serves as the director of the United Relief Administration. He has always been fond of music and singing and has made great efforts to promote vocal music education. There are three sisters in the family in China, all who are accomplished. Two younger brothers, one remained in the province, and unfortunately, died in the war. Another accompanied her overseas and died in France. She said that her mother was very sad and always comforted herself with the thought that "all children without fathers are my children."

As for music, China has many talented people but very few opportunities. There are even fewer opportunities to hear good music in various parts of the country, unlike the countries bordering Europe, which are easy to learn from each other. She believes that there are three essential elements for pursuing knowledge in depth: one is talent, the second is environment, and the third is effort. The third element means that one should work hard to improve everything. Last year, on National Day in October, I went to Berlin to sing three times. The first time was a Chinese gathering, chaired by Miao Pei, a counselor from the Chinese Military Delegation in Germany. Since then, I held personal concerts twice at the Renaissance Theater, both of which were full. Germans are deeply fond of music. They would rather go hungry than lack this spiritual food. After that, I broadcasted once on the Berlin Radio Station, and then showed me the comments in the German newspapers, such as: "Ms. Xiao's singing deeply touched the hearts of the audience." Such as: "Ms. Xiao's pronunciation of songs in various languages is very accurate and clear, which is very commendable."

Talented Soprano with Clear Tone

I asked Ms. Xiao why she could sing the tunes in English, French, German, and Italian so perfectly. Ms. Xiao replied: Every time I learn a song in a certain language, I always ask a person from that country to be my teacher, and at the same time, I also teach language lessons and study the texts in the newspapers. For example, the Italian classical Western song, Italian title Chi vuol la Zirogarella, translated into Chinese means "Who Likes This Wandering Girl?" The European wandering ethnic group Tzingari live in no fixed place and mostly make a living by selling skills, similar to the Jianghu (wandering entertainers) in China. Another example is the English classical Western song Zymphs and Shepherds, which means water nymphs and shepherds. Another example is the German romantic Western song, which is a "style" of Schubert's famous work. The German title Wohinp is between them, which means "Where to Go?" Another example is the French new Western song Colibri, which means "Hummingbird" in Chinese. One by one, like counting family treasures, they were all able to explain their meaning and detail their origin. When singing, she transforms into thousands, emitting sounds in various languages, showing magic skillfully, and showing cunning skillfully, better than the first-class international orators. She is a natural propaganda fighter for China, not only showing the high talent of the Chinese people.

Clamshell Song Expresses Sadness

As for Xiao Zisheng's original French work, which was performed by the Russian A. Tcherepnine as a French classic, the clamshell spirit came down to earth, and the sorrow of separating from her husband for twenty years. The general idea is that a certain person is a farmer, has been a single man for a long time, is honest and hardworking, and always cooks his own meals. One day, when he returned home, the meal was cooked, as if someone had cooked it for him. The same was true the next day. He was surprised and traced it, only to know that every day there was a clamshell spirit who transformed into a young girl and sneaked into his room to do her job well, and he was happy and hid her shell. The clamshell spirit could not get through, so the king allowed her to temporarily marry this country man as his wife, an occasional marriage, limited to twenty years. The French song is performing, describing the situation of this pair of men and women who are full of green and want to say goodbye, so the words are sad and the voice is suppressed. Xiao Jun wrote this to promote the excellent nature of

### Cremation: Only Promotion, Not Coercion

Senator Tang Shichang believes that the city government's active cleanup measures are inappropriate and should be improved. He stated that the city government's proclamation on November 22nd stipulated that the tens of thousands of accumulated coffins in the city must all be moved for burial or transported back to their place of origin by the end of April; otherwise, they would be cremated. Regarding this point, he specifically asked the mayor to pay attention to the following: (1) Our country's old etiquette and moral teachings attach great importance to the ceremony of final arrangements. The city government can only promote cremation and cannot force cremation. (2) Our country's methods for preserving corpses are extremely thorough, and even those that have been coffined for decades do not pose a health hazard. (3) There are not many public cemeteries in the city, and the fees are extremely high. Moreover, transportation to the countryside is inconvenient, so relocating for burial or returning to one's place of origin are both difficult.

Senator Zhang Zhongyuan asked: Regarding the Social Bureau's assessment committee's adjudication of labor-management disputes, if either party has questions or disagrees after the adjudication: (1) Can a re-assessment be requested? (2) Can senators attend as observers? Also, what is the current progress regarding the mayor's previous statement about negotiating with the Race Club to reclaim the racecourse?

Rationing of Goods: Improvements Needed

Senator Xia expressed dissatisfaction with the measures for rationing goods to public and educational personnel: (1) Is the city government ultimately responsible for the rationing of goods? There are too many abuses. How can they be improved? (2) Items such as candy are not needed by public and educational personnel; they should not be distributed. (3) The procedures are too cumbersome. Can they be simplified? (4) Prices should not be too low to prevent resale on the black market, but appropriate preferential treatment should also be given. (5) Can rationing be scheduled regularly?
