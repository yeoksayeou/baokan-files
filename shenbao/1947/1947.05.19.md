### National Government Promulgates Temporary Measures: Stabilizing Society and Maintaining Order; Prohibiting Gatherings, Parades, and Bypassing Protocol for Petitions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The National Government issued an order on the 18th: "Recently, commodity prices have fluctuated, affecting people's livelihoods. The government is actively preparing effective solutions to stabilize the situation. Unexpectedly, in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, some students and a portion of industrial and commercial employees have gathered to petition, making excessive demands and engaging in disruptive actions, obstructing public affairs, and hindering transportation. This is clearly intended to incite unrest, disrupt social order, and undermine administrative measures. If this continues unchecked, it will only exacerbate the fluctuations in commodity prices, leading to chaos. It not only undermines the purpose of public welfare but also brings disaster to the nation and the people. This is something no wise person would tolerate, and the government cannot stand idly by. Investigations reveal that the criminal law and regulations for punishing violations of order and public affairs have clear sanctions. In addition to publicly announcing relevant legal provisions to serve as a warning, the first temporary meeting of the State Council, based on Article 10 of the policy guidelines, has passed the following six articles of temporary measures for maintaining social order, which will be promulgated and implemented from today: (1) If people's organizations or students have requests to make to the government, they should submit them to the local competent authorities. If the competent authorities cannot resolve the issue, they should wait for the competent authorities to submit the request to their superiors for review and approval. Bypassing protocol for petitions is prohibited. (2) When people's organizations or schools petition, they should send representatives to present their views to the competent authorities. The number of representatives shall be limited to ten. Gathering crowds to coerce is prohibited. Violators shall be disbanded in accordance with Article 149 of the Criminal Law. (3) If students in various schools engage in strikes, marches, demonstrations, or other activities that disrupt public safety, the relevant educational and administrative authorities shall take necessary measures or disband them.

### To Rectify Academic Morale and Uphold the Law, Chairman Chiang's Admonition to Students: Self-Love, Self-Respect, Do Not Fall for Treacherous Schemes

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Chairman Chiang, in order to rectify academic morale and uphold the law, issued the following statement:

"The way to establish a nation places primary importance on principles and discipline, and the foundation of nation-building lies entirely in education. It is essential that schools have a good academic atmosphere and society has a stable order. Only then can the nation have a foundation for construction and the people have the possibility of well-being. Our nation endured eight years of the War of Resistance, with heavy sacrifices. Post-war reconstruction has encountered numerous difficulties. We rely on all our compatriots to share the hardships, recognize the facts, abide by the law, emphasize discipline, and fulfill their respective duties in order to complete construction, realize democracy, alleviate the suffering of our compatriots, and build China into a modern nation. Only then will our youth not fail to be modern patriotic youth."

### Communist Party Incites Student Unrest; Disrupts Social Order

"However, recently, students in various places have frequently engaged in disruptive actions that go beyond the bounds of propriety, and demands that exceed reason. Abandoning studies and imitating each other has become a trend. Using the name of marches and petitions to disrupt public security, even seizing vehicles and hats, obstructing traffic, and disrupting order, such behavior violates laws and disrupts discipline. This is definitely not the work of our pure and patriotic young students, but is clearly instigated directly and indirectly by the anti-government Communist Party. The Communist Party is intensifying its armed rebellion in the north and is also intensifying its efforts to disrupt order and society in various places, creating a state of lawlessness and disorder, in order to achieve its attempt to seize political power and subvert the Republic of China. And those who are used as tools are primarily students in various schools."

### Students Should Reflect and Not Be Manipulated by Traitors

"On this year's Huanghuagang Revolution Memorial Day, I pointed out to the youth of the country the Communist Party's plot to undermine the country, obstruct construction, and disrupt society. I clearly told our youth the insidious intentions of the Communist Party to disrupt our order, stifle our vitality, and prevent students from studying and workers from working. Today, I want to raise the awareness of all our young students even further. It must be understood that the subversive elements lurking in various universities are using various guises and slogans to incite and expand student unrest in order to carry out their pre-planned conspiracy of sacrificing youth and disrupting order. Observing the bizarre and absurd nature of this student unrest, which is unprecedented in any past period, our young students should use their clear intellect to carefully examine it and not be coerced or manipulated by violent traitors, and willingly forfeit the life of the nation and their own future."

### Unreasonable Coercion Will Never Be Permitted by the Government

"The government cannot bear to allow innocent youth to be sacrificed for the Communist Party's conspiracy, and it certainly cannot allow the spread of illegal actions. The government, for the entire nation and all the people, has the responsibility to maintain public tranquility. All patriotic citizens have the obligation to respect national laws and discipline, and young students must cherish the nation and abide by order. If the actions of the people harm the interests of the public and the freedom of others, then their freedom will not be protected by law, but should be subject to the sanctions of the law. At this time when the nation's vitality has not yet recovered after the war, all speech and actions of young students and the general public must be based on law and facts, and especially on the premise of the interests of the entire nation and the people. Any action that disregards the nation's difficulties and strives for the interests of a few people, or even coerces the masses, incites riots, and uses illegal actions to make unreasonable demands, will definitely not be permitted by the government, nor will there be any leniency."

### Public Funds Are the Blood and Sweat of the People; Excessive Demands Should Not Be Made

"Recently, some students from National Central University and Jinling University, due to the issue of meals for publicly funded students, or due to minor issues within the schools themselves, went on strike and petitioned, even besieging government offices and obstructing public affairs, behaving like rioters, which has gone beyond the bounds of normalcy. It must be understood that the system of publicly funded students in universities was originally a temporary measure during the war. After the end of the war, it should have been stopped long ago. However, because the Communist Party is engaged in violent rebellion in various places and the economic order has not been restored, many students' families have difficulty providing support. The government could not bear to interrupt the education of young people, so it continued to provide it, so that those who felt sorry for poor students were able to put forth their best effort. Our young students must also know that the source of public funds is the ancestral tax of the blood and sweat of the people. Today, the situation of our ordinary poor compatriots, who are not fed and clothed, and are hungry and cold, is unbearable to hear. The monthly income of soldiers serving the country on the front lines is much lower than the cost of meals for publicly funded students. From the War of Resistance to the present, the government has always paid attention to the essential lives of young students and has planned for them in advance. Therefore, during these ten years, although the lives of the general public have been extremely difficult and the national finances have been extremely difficult, the government has not only spared most of our students from hunger but also allowed them to continue their studies. The government has exhausted its efforts. If our young students have any sense of reason, they should not regard themselves as a special class and make excessive and impossible demands."

### Decisive Action Will Be Taken Against Actions That Destroy the Law and Disrupt Discipline

"In short, the affairs of the nation are still extremely difficult today. Everyone should share the difficulties, endure hardship, and be self-reliant. Abiding by the law and emphasizing discipline is especially important. The dignity of national laws and discipline should be jointly upheld by all citizens. Schools are established to nurture young people and should be a model for the general public. The recent student actions have exceeded the scope permitted by national morality and national laws and are clearly directed directly or indirectly by the Communist Party. If this is allowed to continue, not only will the academic atmosphere be corrupted and laws and discipline will be destroyed, but the educational institutions that cultivate young people will inevitably become a source of destruction of the law and disruption of discipline. What is the value of such a school to the nation? And what is there to regret about such unrestrained and violent youth? In order to protect the life of the entire nation and the future of all young people, decisive action must be taken. I hereby offer these earnest admonitions, hoping that our patriotic youth will admire reason, understand propriety, know integrity, have self-love and self-respect, and not be harmed by the schemes of traitors. And the authorities of each school, who bear the responsibility of education, should all do their utmost to fulfill their duties, strictly enforce laws and discipline, and reverse the decline in order to preserve the vitality of the nation and maintain social tranquility."

### Ministry of Education Formulates Plan to Replenish Funding for Various Schools

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the replenishment of funding and equipment for various schools, according to Education Minister Zhu Jiahua, since the restoration, the Ministry has deeply understood the various difficulties within each school and has made every effort to seek solutions. As for routine expenses and equipment costs, every effort has been made to raise funds. However, due to the impact of commodity price fluctuations, the original funding received by each school has been far insufficient, further increasing the difficulties. Now, emergency measures and funding plans, including foreign exchange, have been formulated to solve the current difficulties of various schools. The government attaches great importance to this, and the Ministry will ensure that this plan is implemented in the shortest possible time.

### Fierce Fighting in the Taihang Mountains: Fu Zuoyi's Troops Sweep Westward, Heading Straight for Lingqiu; National Army in Northern Henan Recaptures Qixian

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 18th] The National Army under Fu Zuoyi is sweeping westward from Laiyuan, heading straight for Lingqiu, threatening Wutai, in order to relieve the siege of Taiyuan in one fell swoop. In the mountainous area southwest of Laiyuan, at Zoumayi and Chajianling, Communist troops are transporting supplies and ammunition day and night towards Pingxi. The National Army on the Pinghan Railway is actively deploying, preparing to coordinate with Fu's troops when necessary to complete the joint defense mission of Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi, and completely destroy the last base of the Communist troops in the Taihang Mountains.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] The remnants of the Hebei-Chahar Communist troops under Nie Rongzhen have mostly fled back to Wanxian and Tangxian. The headquarters of the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi Military Region has also moved from Pingshan to Pingxi. After the National Army around Baoding was redeployed, the Communist troops are now gathering again in Sizhen. The garrison troops launched an attack today to sweep through Dazhuangzhen on the western border of Gaoyang. More than a thousand remaining Communist troops retreated south to Zhangdengzhen. The National Army is expanding its victory.

[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 18th] The National Army, advancing north from Jixian, overcame the stubborn resistance of the Communist troops yesterday and recovered Hongxian at 11:00 AM on the 17th. The Communist troops fled westward in disarray towards the Taihang Mountains. The National Army continues to advance north of the Qi River.

### Communist Troops East of Mengyin Flee Northward: National Army Presses on Mingshui Station; Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming Flies to Xuzhou

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th] The offensive of the Communist troops, who invaded the eastern side of the Xintai-Mengyin-Qingtuosi highway in the Yimeng Mountain area, has begun to be frustrated. The Third Column of the Communist troops, which launched a counterattack against Aoyangzhen southeast of Xintai, has fled back to Gushenbanpo northeast of Xintai on the 18th. The First Column of the Communist troops, which invaded east and south of Mengyin and Taoxu, has retreated to Tanbu east of Mengyin. The National Army is following up in pursuit and is dividing its forces to encircle and suppress the area east of Duozhuang. There are no more traces of Communist troops near Heyangzhen and the north and south of Zuoquan.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] The Communist troops east of Mengyin suffered heavy casualties in a five-day attack by the National Army and fled north on the 18th.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 18th] The National Army under Wang Yaowu, which is sweeping eastward from Zaotuansi, had advanced to the vicinity of Mingshui Station by the 18th, and the station will soon be recovered. The National Army, which is sweeping eastward of Pingyin and west of Feicheng, recovered Pingyin City on the 17th, which had once again fallen into the hands of the Communist troops. The Communist troops suffered heavy casualties.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 18th] The main battle that the National Army has repeatedly sought is continuing in the four-corner area of Mengyin, Yishui, Juxian, and Tangtouzhen. The number of Communist troops concentrated in this area has increased to eight columns, about 200,000 men, accounting for four-fifths of the total force of the Shandong Communist troops.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 18th] According to military observers, Jiaodong is the second largest base area of the Shandong Communist troops, second only to the Yimeng Mountain area. The Communist troops have established large-scale military factories here, and they can obtain assistance from a certain side across the sea from Yantai. Therefore, it would be an exaggeration to assume that the Communist troops will flee north across the Yellow River after their defeat in the four-corner area of Yi, Ju, Meng, and Tang.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] The National Army under Wang Yaowu, which circled around Mengyin to the south, continued to sweep through the Yiqin Mountain area on the afternoon of the 18th and recovered Binshan Town, ten kilometers east of Mengyin, after a fierce battle.

### Student Anti-Strike Movement Unfolds in Capital Universities; Conflict Erupts Between Students and Soldiers

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 18th] A student anti-strike movement is currently unfolding in various universities in the capital, arguing that strike movements should clearly define their goals and motivations. Initiating a full-scale strike due to increased food costs and escalating the unrest is considered to be a departure from the spirit of student movements. This anti-strike movement is expanding. Coupled with Chairman Chiang's address on the 18th, urging the rectification of academic conduct, and the Provisional Measures for Maintaining Social Order passed by the State Council, it is hoped that the student unrest in the capital will subside in the near future.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] This afternoon at 4:00 PM, a faction of striking students from Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beiping, clashed with a group of young soldiers on leave who had entered the city, during a lecture and poster campaign in Xidan, due to differences of opinion. As a result, both sides sustained injuries. Upon hearing the news, Director Li of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, in addition to ordering Division Commander Wu of the youth army to investigate and punish the soldiers responsible, also sent personnel to express condolences to the injured students.

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] Today, Peking University students clashed with soldiers from the 208th Division while conducting an anti-civil war and anti-famine campaign in the streets. Striking students from Tsinghua University, Peking University, Beiyang University, and other schools, mobilized in teams today to deliver lectures and post slogans and cartoons throughout the city, shouting slogans such as "Oppose civil war" and "Oppose famine." Among them, a team of over a hundred students from Peking University arrived at Xidan Guai Bei at 5:00 PM, dividing into groups to lecture and post slogans. Suddenly, they received a report that several classmates in Xidan had been assaulted. The students immediately gathered, leading to another clash with dozens of uniformed personnel riding in trucks. The scene was extremely chaotic at the time, and the military police were unable to quell the situation. Several students were injured, the most seriously wounded being Zhang Qiliang, a freshman in the Department of Land and Trade at Peking University, who sustained a severe head injury. After the incident, Chen Xueping, the Dean of Students at Peking University, and Secretary-General Zheng Tianting rushed to the scene. Chen Xueping told the students that he would negotiate with the Beiping Executive Headquarters on their behalf. Zhang, who was seriously injured, was taken to Peking University Hospital for treatment. The exact number of those injured today has not yet been determined. In addition, during the melee, the driver of a streetcar parked nearby was also beaten, and a Tsinghua University school bus traveling near Xisi was attacked, with a passenger beaten and the bus vandalized.

He vowed to severely punish the perpetrators according to the law.

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] Hu Shi, the President of Peking University, was unwilling to express much opinion regarding the conflict between the university's students and the 208th Division, only saying that it was a truly unfortunate incident. Dean of Students Chen Xueping stated that the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] Students at the Beiping Railway Management Institute went on strike several days ago to demand the restoration of the Beiping Jiaotong University. The Beiping branch of Beiyang University also went on strike to protest the relocation to Tianjin. Tsinghua University students began a three-day strike on the 17th to support the demands of students at the Central University in the capital for increased food allowances and improved treatment. Peking University and Yenching University are both in the process of deliberations. In addition, the Beiping Normal College established a committee to restore the university on the 17th, and the Beiping Art College established a committee to recover school buildings, both with specific demands and actions. A spokesman for the Beiping Municipal Council issued a statement today, hoping that students would be rational, discerning right from wrong, and not overstep the bounds of the law. Director Li of the Council also invited the presidents and senior officials of various universities to discuss persuasive measures. The Peking University authorities convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and issued a public notice afterward, urging students to consider carefully and not lightly neglect their studies. The original text is as follows: "In light of the strike brewing among our school's students in recent days, we recognize our teaching responsibilities and feel compelled to say a few words to you all. We are always concerned about the lives of the students. Recently, prices have risen sharply, affecting everyone's meals. The school is always trying to find ways to allocate funds and advance them in advance. Now, the food allowance is being adjusted, and the calculation of grain prices is also being improved. We hope that we can achieve a reasonable solution in this difficult situation. We earnestly hope that students will not lightly sacrifice their studies for this issue. As for the faculty and staff, although their lives are extremely difficult, they would never bear to see young students sacrifice their studies for their livelihoods..."

### Taipei City Government Employee Commits Suicide by Jumping Off Train Due to Poverty and Illness; Suicide Note Says "Hope to Save Civil Servants"

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] On the eve of Chairman Wei Daoming's arrival in Taiwan to assume his new post, a tragic incident of a civil servant, Chen Boyin, committing suicide by jumping off a train occurred here.

Only after this newspaper received his suicide note yesterday afternoon did the truth become clear. In his lengthy suicide note, he explained that his suicide was due to the oppression of life. His monthly income was only NT$4,600, equivalent to 184,000 legal tender. Daily life was already extremely difficult. Last month, he suddenly suffered from chronic appendicitis and was unable to afford the cost of surgery. He only sought medication from a doctor. Over the past month, he has accumulated a lot of debt. Recently, he received a letter from his wife, informing him that there was no grain at home and that his young son was ill. As a result, his chronic appendicitis suddenly worsened. In grief, he decided to end his life by suicide. The suicide note also stated: "My suicide is a kind of resentment towards society. Today's society has deprived me of my right to survival. This is not just my tragedy, but the common tragedy faced by countless civil servants. Chairman Wei is coming to Taiwan tomorrow. I am unable to go to welcome him. I sincerely express my regret. However, I hope that Chairman Wei will save the civil servants of Taiwan. Farewell, friends in the world!"

### Resolution of the Hunan Grain Coupon Dispute

Government Orders Against Alternative Uses

[Special Dispatch from Changsha by this Newspaper, 18th] The Hunan grain coupon dispute, lasting over four months, saw the Provincial Assembly insisting on centralized use and opponents demanding return to the grain farmers.

Editorial

### The Way to Maintain Social Order

In recent days, student movements have been erupting one after another in various places, and the situation is extremely turbulent. If the students' petitions are for pure purposes, their actions do not overstep the bounds of normalcy, and are also reasonable, the people and public opinion throughout the country will naturally be happy to support them. Regarding the current educational problems, this newspaper has published articles pointing out: in addition to sympathizing with the legitimate purpose of student petitions, we deeply regret students' acts of violating laws and disrupting order. Unexpectedly, the student movements in various places have not only not subsided, but have intensified. The government is happy to accept and consider students' legitimate demands, originally to protect young people; but the recent trend has clearly overstepped the bounds of what is proper and reasonable. In Nanjing, there has been the launch of the so-called "Eat It All Up Movement," as well as organized marches and petitions, and even the meals of the administrative staff of the Executive Yuan have been "eaten up." Schools in various places have successively risen up in remote response, with class boycotts and petitions. People across the country cannot help but feel taken aback by all these actions. At this time of national difficulty, stability is paramount and has become the unanimous demand of the country; we must not allow this turbulent situation to continue to develop. In order to ensure social stability, this kind of decline must be stopped as soon as possible. Here, we have some things that we must say, which can be summarized as follows:

First, the maintenance of social order depends on the efforts of the masses. The class boycotts and petitions of students, if they overstep the bounds of normalcy, are naturally not tolerated by the people of the country. Other general people's organizations should also not gather crowds to threaten and disrupt public security. Today, petition movements are rising and falling in various places, with new tricks and patterns. They have already exceeded the proper bounds of petitioning. The purpose is very obvious: on the one hand, to make things difficult for the government, and on the other hand, to shake the hearts of the people. These actions are unworthy of mention. If the people have petitions to the government, there are proper channels to follow. Today's petitions rising and falling in various places are not so much petitions as "blackmail." Moreover, the actions taken violate laws and disrupt order. In nature, they have already violated criminal statutes and should bear criminal responsibility. Since it is "blackmail," we have long hoped that the government can take more severe measures to put out this declining trend. This trend must not be allowed to continue, for the sake of protecting the foundation of the country. We have long hoped that the government can take action.

Second, from a legal point of view, the people have the right to petition, as stated in the constitution, but petitioning also has a proper interpretation. Petitioning is definitely not blackmail, let alone riots. Using the name of marching and petitioning to disrupt public security is especially not allowed by national law. We must not think that because the constitution has provisions for the people's right to petition, we can abuse this right and even hold the national law in our own hands. For the dignity of national law, we must not adopt a policy of indulgence. Adopting this policy is tantamount to showing the government's incompetence.

Therefore, we feel gratified when we read President Chiang's proclamation issued yesterday. On the one hand, the proclamation shows how much the government cares for the people, with earnest exhortations. On the other hand, it clearly points out that the recent trends are a consistent conspiracy of the communists. It also indicates that the government will adopt strict policies to deal with these events in the future, to maintain law and order and to reverse the tide. This statement is in line with our long-held wishes. At the same time, the Provisional State Council of the National Government Committee yesterday also passed six articles of temporary measures to maintain social order, stipulating that people's organizations or school students should apply to the local competent authorities and may not petition over levels; in the event of a petition, they should send representatives to present their opinions to the competent authorities, with the number of people limited to ten, and they may not gather crowds to coerce, otherwise they will be punished according to law; if students boycott classes or other disturbances of public order occur, the competent authorities should take necessary measures or disband them; if people's organizations strike or other disturbances of public order occur, they should take necessary measures or disband them; if necessary, the local government should also take emergency measures. Judging from the above points, it can be seen that the nature of these measures is somewhat similar to the various emergency measures taken in the past. With the promulgation of these measures, we hope that they can be effectively implemented to achieve the practical effect of maintaining social order.

Here, we also have to point out that in order for these measures to be effective, everyone must rise up and assist in their respective positions. Young people are full of enthusiasm, and often their emotions fail to overcome their reason. The responsibility of the principal or the school lies in enlightening their reason, so that they do not act blindly. This is the responsibility of the principal to maintain social order. Parents also have the responsibility to teach their children, and they cannot completely push this responsibility to the school. As for the general society, it should also express its views and distinguish right from wrong. In times of turmoil, heavy penalties should be used, as the ancients have long said. Today, if we want to maintain social order, this point must not be ignored. It is in this sense that we believe that the temporary measures to maintain social order are a timely move. At a time when the country is facing many difficulties, the people of the whole country should especially uphold the government's good intentions and rise up together to assist, so that the maintenance of social order will not be an impossible task.

The rickshaw puller asked for an increase due to the hardship of life, which angered the judge. They argued and the judge started punching and kicking, injuring the rickshaw puller's scrotum, causing him to faint and lose consciousness. The rickshaw pullers in the market were outraged by this and went on strike unanimously.

Jingjiang

At about 10:00 p.m. on the 16th, a grenade suddenly flew from the northwest to the New Life Recreation Theater in the city and exploded in the southeast corner of the field, injuring two people with fragments. After the incident, the military police imposed a temporary curfew and hunted down the perpetrators. As a result, a security team soldier who was running away was captured outside the field, and all the security team members in the field were also arrested and sent to the command post for secret interrogation.

### Greece Determined to Cooperate Closely with Turkey to Prevent Aggression: Will Use U.S. Loan to Reorganize Army

[United Press, London, 17th] Greek Prime Minister Maximos, in response to written questions submitted by United Press today, stated in essence: Most of the loan granted to Greece by the United States will be used to reorganize the army. He remains concerned about Bulgaria's belligerent and aggressive attitude, but now that it has obtained U.S. military assistance, the Greek people can rest assured and devote themselves to peaceful work. Greece's future foreign policy will be based on cooperation with Turkey as a fundamental principle. At the same time, most of the U.S. assistance will also be used for post-war reconstruction. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

(Q) How does Greece plan to use the funds loaned by the United States? (A) In order to restore normalcy in the country and cope with foreign aggression, we must first strengthen our military strength. Therefore, most of the loan will be used to reorganize the army, add supply equipment, and modernize it, so that the Greek people can live and work in peace. At the same time, it will also be used to purchase urgently needed imported consumables, raw materials, and other materials... About 30 million U.S. dollars will be needed to purchase food to make up for the shortfall in this year's harvest.

(Q) Turkish President Inönü replied to my inquiry, saying that the principle of Turkish policy is to strengthen cooperation with Greece in many ways. I know that Your Excellency's past administrative policy is also the same. Please tell me about the future relationship with Turkey. (A) When Tsaldaris was the Foreign Minister, I signed an agreement with Turkey in 1934. Since then, Greek policy has been based on promoting friendly cooperation with Turkey in many ways. Greek public opinion has also always advocated eliminating old grievances, promoting friendly cooperation, and living together in peace. The principle of maintaining close cooperation between Greece and Turkey is not a partisan policy, but a consistent proposition of all political parties in the Greek parliament.

(Q) Greece's territorial demands on Albania and Bulgaria have not yet been realized. How will Your Excellency seek to achieve this? (A) Greece will never give up its demands on Northern Epirus. This territory has not yet been unified with Greece since it was liberated by the Greek army in 1940. The Greek people are extremely disappointed by this, and it is also regrettable that the significant bloodshed and sacrifices made in that territory have not won the recognition of Greece's allies. Now, the Greek-Bulgarian border must be slightly modified before it can be guaranteed against Bulgaria's new aggression. The country is belligerent by nature and has invaded Greece three times without cause in the past 30 years, and its current provocative attitude is likely to harbor future aggression.

### Turkey Receives U.S. Assistance to Build Modernized National Defense: Entire Plan Soon to be Implemented

[United Press, Istanbul, Turkey, 17th] The U.S. plan to assist Turkey in establishing a close-knit defense military structure will be implemented next week, emphasizing improvements to the transportation network to facilitate the rapid movement of modern troops. A U.S. spokesman said: The initial consideration will be to improve existing facilities and build new ports, highways, and railways. Currently, none of the facilities can meet modern military needs. For example, Istanbul is Turkey's largest port, but cargo ships cannot sail directly into the port and must be transported by barges from afar. Officials emphasized that the purpose of this assistance is to guide the Turkish army to develop into a purely defensive organization, not to launch attacks. The result may be a large-scale reduction in the number of troops, far fewer than the current 700,000. This will indirectly improve the country's economy and allow retired soldiers to engage in productive careers. Well-informed sources said that from an equipment perspective, Turkey most needs trucks, anti-aircraft guns, flat-shooting guns, and small defensive military equipment. As for whether aircraft will receive much attention in the plan, there is some doubt, as the allocated one hundred million U.S. dollars are not intended for this aspect.

Permitting U.S. Companies to Drill Oil Wells

[French New Open Agency, Ankara, 18th] The semi-official "Aksam" newspaper reported today that the Turkish government has authorized a U.S. company to drill oil wells in Turkey. However, if oil is discovered, the right to exploit it will not be transferred, as the Turkish government opposes transferring oil extraction rights to foreign companies. Well-informed sources said that the U.S. aid to Turkey plan cannot make Turkey change this policy. U.S. Vice President Byres recently criticized the government's aid to Greece and Turkey plan for coveting Middle Eastern oil resources.

### Turkish Government to Implement Purge of Extremists

[French News Agency, Ankara, 17th] The Turkish government is about to implement a purge to suppress communists and right-wing radicals, and will imitate the United States by organizing a "Anti-Turkish Activities" Investigation Committee to be in charge of this matter for a long time. According to semi-official sources, the government may first conduct individual indictments, and then implement legislative procedures for the entire political party.

### Greek Amnesty Issue: Proposing Two Counter-Proposals to the U.S.

[French News Agency, Athens, 17th] According to well-informed sources, the Greek government will submit two draft amnesty proposals: (1) Guerrillas who surrender to the government before the date stipulated by the government will be pardoned; (2) Those who committed crimes on Crete during the occupation period will also be pardoned.

[French News Agency, Athens, 17th] I have learned: U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Mai Wei, visited the Greek Foreign Minister Mr. Cai Erda Lisi yesterday morning and informed him that if the Greek government’s amnesty of the surrendered guerrillas is beneficial to the current situation, the United States is willing to consider it. After the meeting, Mr. Cai Erda Lisi went to visit the King and reported on the current stage of discussion on this issue, and then attended a cabinet meeting to discuss the same issue. It is heard that the opinions offered by the United States are that the Greek government should take effective measures to curb the cross-border activities of terrorists, but the suppression of the rebellion should be lenient. The U.S. side further suggested that Greece should invite neutral observers to monitor the implementation of the amnesty measures.

### Egyptian Military Delegation Visits the U.S. on a Mission

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Following the arrival of the Egyptian military delegation led by Egyptian Army Chief of Staff Attala in the United States, there are reports here that the United States will assist Egypt in establishing a modernized army. The most frequently heard report is that the Egyptian military delegation came to discuss loans with the U.S. side, while some informal sources say that closer military cooperation between the two countries, especially the defense of the Suez Canal, has been placed on the basis of this negotiation. Washington officials have not been able to confirm any of the aforementioned reports. Army officials stated that the Egyptian military delegation came only to inspect U.S. military equipment, study American training methods, and aerial combat techniques. In short, regardless of whether the Egyptian military delegation can obtain concrete assistance from the United States during this visit, the non-obvious benefits it will gain should be considerable.

### International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Plans to Issue Bonds

Aiming to Replenish the Bank's Funds

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th Special Dispatch] The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will sell $250 million in bonds to private investors in June or July to raise funds for lending to needy countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] A spokesman for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development confirmed today that French Finance Minister Schumann sent a letter to the bank's chairman, McCloy, on the 9th of this month, offering a promise that France would provide the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development with all conveniences to control the use of the $250 million lent to France. Schumann's letter was attached to the loan contract, and what it said was fully in line with the provisions of the Bretton Woods International Monetary Agreement. According to economic experts at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development: All countries that have signed the International Monetary Agreement and will obtain loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development must similarly provide the bank with all conveniences to control the use of the loans. The success of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development depends on its issuance of public bonds in the American market, so the above conditions are essential to gaining the confidence of American subscribers. This economic condition is purely technical in nature and should not be regarded as political interference in the internal affairs of the loan-receiving country.

### Train Derailment in Burma

Nearly One Hundred Passengers Killed or Injured

[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th Broadcast: A train derailed near Comilla in eastern Burma, killing 30 people and injuring 61, 20 of whom are in critical condition. According to unofficial sources: tools used to damage the tracks were found near the scene of the accident.

### Prohibition of Demonstrations by Korean People During the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission Meeting - Order Issued by the Chief Administrator of South Korea

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 17th, United Press] The Chief Civil Administrator of South Korea, Ahn Jae-hong, recently issued an order prohibiting all mass parades and demonstrations supporting or opposing trusteeship during the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission meeting. This move is clearly aimed at the "Anti-Trusteeship Association," as the association is scheduled to hold a mass protest demonstration tomorrow. The association is led by three close associates of Syngman Rhee. Although Syngman Rhee denies any formal relationship with the association, one of the leaders of the association was the head of a group that Rhee formed shortly before going to the United States last November. The group is extremely opposed to trusteeship. Rhee told reporters that Lieutenant General Liu Yu-chung, the military commander, invited him for a meeting this morning. General Liu Yu said that if Rhee could not cancel the anti-trusteeship demonstration scheduled for tomorrow, he would resign and return to the United States. Rhee told reporters that he has no formal relationship with the anti-trusteeship association. He told General Liu Yu that due to the general opposition of the Korean people to trusteeship, no leader has the power to stop it. Lieutenant General Hodge, Lieutenant General Liu Yu, Syngman Rhee, and other Korean political leaders will gather tomorrow to discuss the matter, at which time U.S. officials are expected to make a final effort to stop the aforementioned demonstration. When reporters later inquired about this matter with Lieutenant General Liu Yu, he confirmed the order issued by the Chief Civil Administrator but denied that he had expressed any intention to resign.

### The U.S. is in an Advantageous Position on the Korean Issue

[United Press, Seoul, 18th] Although the U.S. military authorities here are extremely willing to make some so-called "concessions" to the Soviet Union in order to expedite the independence of Korea, they believe they hold three trump cards: (1) The United States already has a concrete plan, namely the Truman Doctrine, and the United States' proposal for economic assistance to southern Korea makes the Soviet Union lose face in northern Korea; (2) The reconvening of the Joint Commission seems to have attracted worldwide attention, and the U.S. authorities acknowledge that the current trend of world opinion will provide the U.S. delegation with extremely favorable moral support; (3) The living conditions in northern Korea have gradually deteriorated over the past year, and the Soviet Union has clearly found its position difficult to maintain.

### Radioactive Cloud

Destructive Power Exceeds the Atomic Bomb

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] The famous American aircraft manufacturer Martin recently said that there is a new type of weapon whose destructive power far exceeds that of the atomic bomb, and it is currently being researched in the United States. This new weapon is a "radioactive cloud," which is released by an airplane at high altitude and does not cause any explosion. It is said that this "cloud" can be recovered after being released, just like the throwing weapons used by Australian aborigines.

### Mountbatten Departs for England to Attend Important Meeting to Discuss the Indian Situation

[Reuters, New Delhi, 18th] Indian Governor-General Mountbatten, along with his wife, staff, and Indian Reform Committee member Menon, departed for London today on a private plane and is expected to arrive on Tuesday. During Mountbatten's absence, Governor-General of Bengal Mookerjee will act on his behalf.

[Reuters, London, 17th] The important meeting between Indian Governor-General Mountbatten and British cabinet experts on Indian issues will be held at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence in Buckinghamshire, 40 miles outside London. Parliament will be on its customary break for Ascension Day, at which time Prime Minister Attlee will be able to concentrate on the study of the Indian issue, and Secretary of State for India Listowel, Minister of Commerce Cripps, Minister of Defense Alexander, Under-Secretary of State for India Henderson, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Addison, and Under-Secretary of State Bottomley, etc., cabinet experts on Indian issues, will also not need to participate in parliamentary debates, so they can devote themselves to the discussion of the Indian issue. Prime Minister Attlee will personally chair all the talks between the Governor-General and the Cabinet. Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on June 2nd, and the Governor-General is also scheduled to return to Delhi before that day to attend a meeting of Indian leaders, so the results of the London talks are expected to be announced simultaneously in London and New Delhi at that time.

Partition is Difficult to Avoid, Britain Makes a Final Effort

Observers believe that the Indian situation has gradually shown that partition cannot be avoided, but the British Cabinet will certainly still try to make a final effort to give the British Cabinet plan of May 16, 1946, a final chance. It is said that the Governor-General's report suggested that Britain withdraw from India earlier than June 1948, but this statement has not yet been confirmed. However, judging from the British formal declaration of February 22 this year, the date of withdrawal from India will not be later than June 1948 in any case, so an agreement on the method of transferring power must be reached within the next year. For this reason, the British Cabinet is paying great attention to the meeting of Indian leaders to be held in Delhi on June 2nd.

### Britain and the Soviet Union to Exchange Materials

[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th Broadcast: Conservative and left-wing newspapers here report that Britain will carry out large-scale barter trade with the Soviet Union in the next six months. The newspapers criticized American foreign policy, saying that Britain was forced to seek help from the Soviet Union.

### Stuart Yan-sheng and Others Arrive in San Francisco

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 17th] Advisor to our delegation to the United Nations, Stuart Yan-sheng, and other Chinese diplomats recently arrived here.

### Marshall Strongly Urges Countries to Establish a New Charter for International Trade - U.S. Hopes to Reduce Trade Barriers

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered today the opening address of the "International Trade [Conference]," urging countries to take a major step in establishing an agreement for the future international trade organization. Marshall said: Economic conflicts and trade wars inevitably lead to political divisions. Today, unity among nations is more important than at any time in history. Although the United States has created reduced trade barriers at the Geneva International Trade Conference and agreed to the final draft of the future World Trade Organization, the success of the great achievement depends on the full cooperation of all 18 countries participating in the conference. At the same time, the State Department released a report from Geneva, stating that the United States has begun trade negotiations with ten of the fifteen countries scheduled to participate. It is expected that by the end of this month, representatives of the countries at the Geneva Conference will conduct one hundred sets of individual negotiations.

[United Press, Geneva, 17th] U.S. Under Secretary of State Clayton declared on the eve of his return to Washington: He is very satisfied with the progress of the trade negotiations.

### German Secret Files Released - Planned to Sign Armistice Agreement with the Soviet Union - But This Treachery Ultimately Failed

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The U.S. and British navies today released captured German naval files. According to the files, Germany hoped to establish a secret armistice agreement with the Soviet Union in 1943, without the knowledge of the Western Allies, while the Soviet Union continued to obtain Lend-Lease materials from the United States. Fortunately, this conspiracy failed. The files also revealed two other truths: (1) Germany considered using high-speed, long-range, six-engine new aircraft to bomb the United States, but in July 1943, because "the number of this type of aircraft was small and the effect would be insignificant, but it would be enough to encourage the American people to resolve to resist," it finally gave up. (2) German Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz requested the use of "new air force weapons" (obviously referring to V-1 or V-2 rockets) to attack Allied ships in Gibraltar in the summer of 1943, but Hitler refused, and a dog-like air raid on Britain was launched that year.

It is unclear whether the plan to cease hostilities with the Soviet Union was ever delivered to the Soviet Union. The full text of the section is as follows: "We can only hope for victory if we stop consuming troops on the Eastern Front. So far, this has bothered Japan, fearing that if Japan fights in the north, the strength of the south will be weakened, and Japan may not be able to collect the necessary supplies for both lines. The million-strong Kwantung Army of Japan is standing by, and Japan clearly feels the need to step into Siberia. The Soviet Union is obtaining a large amount of materials through the Far East, so the question is whether Japan's threat to participate in the war against the Soviet Union can prompt the Soviet Union to accept the proposal of a silent armistice on the Eastern Front, and keep it secret, without the knowledge of Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union should still continue to obtain American Lend-Lease materials. This matter is worth sacrificing everything for. If it cannot, then an eastern defense line should be built as soon as possible."

### United Nations News Panel Meets Today in New York

U.S. Proposes Plan to Guarantee News Freedom

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] The United Nations Sub-Committee on Freedom of the Press and Publication will meet here on the 19th for two weeks to discuss the draft agenda for next year's International Conference on Freedom of the Press. The U.S. government has submitted a five-point plan to the subcommittee for consideration.

The U.S. plan will be discussed by the twelve-member subcommittee at the same time as a similar, but simpler, plan proposed by France.

### Franco Inspects the Barcelona Area

[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 18th] Regarding Franco's current inspection in Barcelona, Spanish politicians are speculating about the reasons for this. According to qualified sources: Franco's trip may be related to the recent labor strikes in the Basque Province, or in an attempt to prevent the separatist movement from extending to the Catalan Province. Other observers say: This trip may be the prelude to Franco's action to depict and eliminate unstable elements in the Teruel area southwest of Barcelona.

### Large Aluminum Mine Discovered in Soviet Territory

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 18th] Moscow Radio announced today that Soviet miners have discovered a rich aluminum mine in the Irkutsk region, and it is said that its reserves rank first in the world.

### U.S. Congress May Stop Economic Aid to Foreign Countries - Vandenberg Says in Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said today that after Congress approves the $350 million relief aid to war-torn countries this time, Congress may not approve other direct relief aid to foreign countries. He told reporters that he did not expect any other requests for foreign direct relief. However, observers said that President Truman may again request appropriations to assist countries most affected by war. Representatives of the House and Senate agreed yesterday that the amount of relief funds for war-torn countries would be $350 million, but with a recommendation that only $15 million of it be allocated to countries other than China, Poland, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and the Free Territory of Trieste. The case is still awaiting final approval by both houses.

### Internal Disputes in Japanese Socialist Party Cast a Shadow on the Future of Cabinet Formation

[International Press, Tokyo, 18th] The issue of the prime minister of the four-party coalition new cabinet of Japan, after arduous steps, was largely resolved on the 17th due to the Liberal Party's executive meeting's support for Katayama's appointment as prime minister and the Democratic Party's echoing. However, at the same time, another shadow has been cast on the future of the cabinet formation work, that is, the Liberal and Democratic parties' insistence on rejecting the entry of left-wing members of the Socialist Party into the cabinet as a prerequisite for the allocation of cabinet members, especially positions. For this reason, Suzuki and Kato, the party's left-wing representatives among the Socialist candidates for cabinet positions, publicly declared their separation from the Communist Party a few days ago in order to ease the opposition air of the Liberal and Democratic parties. Unexpectedly, the statements of the two caused a major problem at the Socialist Party's Central Executive Committee meeting on the 17th, and were severely criticized by both the left and right wings of the party. Therefore, the future of the cabinet formation work may become more complicated due to internal disputes in the Socialist Party. Currently, party leaders such as Katayama and Nishio are feeling unable to cope with this matter.

[Tokyo, 18th] The executive meeting of the Japanese Democratic Party was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 17th. After weighing the candidates for the party president, it unanimously nominated Ashida Hitoshi as the party president, Shidehara Kijuro as the honorary president, and Saito Takao as the chief advisor. According to the meeting, the party's entire membership authorized the meeting to make a full decision on the selection of the party president.

Japan Submits Request to Build Military Less Than Two Years After Surrender

[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] Only twenty-one months after Japan's defeat, it has actually submitted a request to establish an army and air force today. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official recently inquired of officials from various Allied countries about their attitude towards Japan's request to establish a 100,000-strong army to take over the tasks of the U.S. military and other Allied forces after the end of the occupation. The official insisted that this army was necessary to maintain internal order, especially to prevent labor strikes and smuggling. He pointed out that the general strike in February this year did not break out due to MacArthur's order. If the Japanese government had no troops, it would not be able to stop it. He also hinted that Japan also needs a small number of air force to patrol the Japanese coast to prevent smuggling. It is understood that the Allied governments have not yet responded to this request.

### Byrnes Delivers Speech, Discusses U.S.-Soviet Relations, Says People of Both Countries Do Not Want War

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said in a speech today: There is too much talk about war and too little about peace between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In fact, the people of both countries do not want war. Only the mistakes of politicians can cause another war. The U.S. and the Soviet Union should understand that neither can dictate peace terms and order people to "take it or leave it." This attitude has no place today. In this imperfect world, there is no perfect peace. Major countries should not be too stubborn, and the American people should not be too demanding. The United Nations should negotiate with each other on an equal footing. This does not mean sacrificing basic principles, but please make a wise decision on what is a matter of principle and what is a matter of policy. If war comes, it is not because the people want war, but because those who run the governments of various countries lack the ability. I do not believe that politicians will go bankrupt. I deny that conflict is inevitable. I believe we can create peace and maintain peace. I also understand the difficulty of this, but we can overcome it in the end.

### Rumors that the Soviet Union Has Already Formed a German Army of One Million - Stalin Can Order It to Enter Germany at Any Time

[Reuters, Stuttgart, 17th] Four-fifths of Germans believe that a strong German army exists in Soviet territory, waiting only for Stalin's order to enter Germany and establish a German Soviet state. It is widely rumored here that there are more than one million German troops organized by the Soviet Union somewhere in Soviet territory. They are still wearing German military uniforms and German symbols. Only the Swastika on the uniform has been replaced with the Soviet hammer and sickle symbol.

These troops are believed to be commanded by General Seydlitz and officers under Marshal Paulus, who surrendered to the Soviet army in Stalingrad. Their weapons and equipment are thought to be supplied by Soviet military factories in the Ural region. Every German believes that there were three million German troops in Soviet territory at the end of the war. The aforementioned number of one million is obtained by subtracting the German prisoners of war figures announced by the Soviet government from this number.

Since the end of the war, the general public's trust in rumors has been higher than in the news transmitted by newspapers and radio stations, so the previous rumors have been believed by most Germans to be true.

General Seydlitz's wife currently lives in Verden, a town 25 miles southeast of Bremen. Of course, she denied these rumors. A reporter from this agency recently visited Mrs. Seydlitz. According to her, she knows very little about her husband's recent situation. She only knows that he is currently in a prisoner of war camp for generals 40 miles from Moscow. Her husband sends letters regularly, and the stationery he uses is not the official postcard used by prisoners of war. Her husband's food supply is very good, and he can go out from time to time for sports games. He lives in the same place as Marshal Paulus and another senior German military officer who participated in the Free Germany Movement during the war. Mrs. Seydlitz also said: "My husband lives behind barbed wire and knows nothing about these rumors related to him. In fact, there is no army commanded by Seydlitz, or what the outside world says is that the German army that surrendered to the Soviet army at the end of the war participated in the Soviet side's operations. My husband is only the leader of the Free Germany Movement. He wanted to end the war as soon as possible, so he did propaganda on the radio."

In addition to believing that Seydlitz secretly organized troops in the Soviet Union, ordinary Germans also believe that he sent German officers trained by him to enter Germany with the Soviet army in 1945. These people have all held important positions in German administrative institutions and the Socialist Unity Party. Of course, this rumor cannot be confirmed, but it is known that there are indeed German prisoners of war who have returned from the Soviet Union in the German police in the Soviet zone.

### Canadian Prime Minister to Retire This Summer

Recently, the Prime Minister has rarely attended Parliament and is often represented by the Foreign Minister.

### Military Court Begins Investigating Crimes of Enemy Lieutenant General Fukuda - Hopes the Public Will Collect Evidence and Report as Much as Possible

[Report from this newspaper] Lieutenant General Fukuda Ryosaburo, an important Japanese war criminal who was escorted to Shanghai from Taiwan at the end of last month, has been sent to the military court of the First Pacification Zone, and the court has begun investigating his crimes. Lieutenant General Fukuda Ryosaburo, 59 years old, came to Shanghai on May 15, 1945, and served as the commander of the Chinese Fleet until the Japanese surrender. He was the highest commander of the Japanese navy in China. Under his jurisdiction were the Shanghai Base Fleet Command, the Hankou Base Fleet Command, the Qingdao Base Fleet Command, the South China Second China Fleet Command, the Hainan Defense Command, and the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force Command, etc. The fleet he commanded spanned the entire Chinese coastline. All of our soldiers and civilians who were sentenced to death by the Japanese naval military court had to ask him for instructions and approval before they could be executed. His high position and great power made him the greatest [criminal] among the war criminals who invaded China. The military court sincerely hopes that the public in various places who have suffered from the poison of the Japanese navy will collect evidence and report to the court so that he can be punished for his crimes.

### Collective Hunger Strike by Former Workers of the Hong Kong Branch of the China Bookstore - Requesting the Company Authorities to Resume Work

[Report from this newspaper] More than 280 iron-printing workers from the China Bookstore were sent to work at the Hong Kong branch by the company. In 1939, the company dismissed this group of workers due to the interruption of raw materials. Now, because the dismissed workers learned that the company authorities had recruited new workers, they gathered at the printing factory at 86 Macau Road in this city and requested the authorities to resume work. Because there was no result, they collectively went on a hunger strike for 48 hours starting on the 15th of this month, hoping to win the sympathy of all sectors of society, and decided that if they are still not allowed to resume work by noon this Wednesday, they will continue the hunger strike. It is reported that the company's general manager, Ji Shuming, returned to Shanghai yesterday and is discussing this issue with manager Gu Shusen and others.

### To Raise Labor Education Funds, Kong Xiangxi Holds Reception

Yesterday at 5 PM, Dr. Kong Xiangxi held a tea party at his residence to raise funds for the YMCA Labor Education Fund. Over fifty people from various sectors attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Song Hanzhang, Liu Gongyun, and Mei Lanfang. Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, passionately advocating for laborers and the common people, stating that there were two strange phenomena in Shanghai today: on the one hand, foreign-style buildings and gardens, and on the other, the foul and cramped slums. The inhumane lives of these kind common people were a disgrace to us, and efforts should be made to promote their welfare. The YMCA Labor Department's pilot programs of various technical training classes, such as carpentry, leatherworking, and metalworking, were highly suited to the practical needs of modern workers. He was extremely grateful for the permission of leaders in the arts to perform for charity and serve society. The tea party ended at 7 PM. It is reported that the date of the charity performance is tentatively set for the 29th, and all expenses for the charity performance will be donated by Yang Fusheng.

### Dacha District Residents Protest the Implementation of County Governance at Meeting

Since the victory, various administrative and educational facilities in Dacha District have been actively restored by the Shanghai Municipal Government. However, boundary disputes between the county and city have repeatedly arisen and have not been resolved despite both parties submitting requests to the Ministry of Interior for review. Disregarding the public opinion of Dacha, the Baoshan County Government organized a "Border Protection Committee" and decided to move the county government council and other agencies to the Saihua Temple in Dacha Town for office work in the near future. Upon hearing this, residents from all walks of life in Dacha District held a temporary mass meeting at the Dacha People's Education Center Square on May 18th at 10 AM, unanimously opposing county governance and posting slogans and telegrams to various agencies for support. They resolved that on the day the Baoshan County Government moves in, all shops in the town will cease business, and students from all schools will go on a one-day hunger strike to show their protest.

First, Vice Bishop Ge of the Shanghai Diocese read the Papal Bull, and Father Zhang Boda read the Chinese translation of the Bull.

Speech by the Papal Nuncio

The Papal Nuncio, in his speech, first expressed his gratitude, then pointed out the sharp decline in the number of students in seminaries across China, appealing to the Virgin Mary to seek more vocations for the Chinese people to enrich the Chinese clergy. He further stated that the coronation ceremony, presided over by Archbishop Yu and Bishop Hui, symbolized the sincere cooperation between native and foreign clergy, and its significance was profound. Subsequently, Archbishop Yu and Bishop Hui held aloft a gold major crown and a small crown, respectively, and ascended the stage to perform the coronation. Archbishop Yu placed the major crown on the Virgin Mary, while Bishop Hui placed the other crown on the Infant Jesus. Archbishop Yu delivered a speech elaborating on the reverence for the Virgin Mary. Finally, the Papal Nuncio announced the special pardon granted by the Holy See, and the entire procession entered the basilica for a mass celebrated by the Papal Nuncio. After the mass, Archbishop Mei of Hangzhou presided over the blessing.

Banquet for VIPs at Noon

From now on, Our Lady of Sheshan will reflect each other with Our Lady of Lourdes in the East and West. Therefore, the number of pilgrims to Sheshan this time is extremely large.)

### Representatives of Two Railway Lines Return to Shanghai, Expanded Propaganda Movement for Railway Protection

Employees of the two railway lines previously appealed for adjustments to fares and freight rates, as well as employee benefits, and have obtained over 10,000 signatures from sympathetic passengers. On the 16th of this month, the general union of the railway lines appointed three representatives, including Gao Qifu, to take fifteen signature books from passengers, along with a request for adjustments to benefits, to Beijing to report to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and to request a speedy investigation to adjust fares and increase employee benefits. Minister Yu personally met with them and promised to submit the matter for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday, and comforted the representatives to inform all employees to work with peace of mind and wait for the adjustment of fares to increase employee benefits. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Shanghai last night. The union held an emergency meeting of all directors yesterday and decided to continue the expanded propaganda movement for railway protection on the 19th and 20th, urging the government authorities to take effective measures quickly, and appealed that the benefits of the employees of the railway lines should be promptly adjusted to the same level as those of postal, telecommunications, aviation, and China Merchants institutions. However, they were determined to bear the pain and maintain the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) transportation, so as to realize this reasonable demand as soon as possible.

### The Courthouse is a Clock, The Bailiffs are the Gears, They are Intensifying Training to Become Good Assistants and Exert Their Effectiveness

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] These days, there seem to be especially many criminal cases. The detention centers are overcrowded, which is obvious. Everyone is planning to travel or has already returned from their travels. Only the judges and prosecutors in the courthouse are racking their brains because of the many lawsuits. In fact, the judicial police are even busier. Chief Judge Cha of the District Court put it well, saying, "The courthouse is like a clock. The judges and prosecutors are the long and short hands of the clock, and the judicial police are the gears inside. If one breaks, the whole thing will stop."

Shanghai is, after all, an international metropolis. Especially the judicial organs are at least more grand in scale than those in other places. Take the judicial police of the District Court in this city, for example. There are a total of one hundred people, divided into seven shifts, taking turns to handle all the work of the District Court on North Zhejiang Road and the District Prosecutor's Office on Xue Liuli Road. The work of the court is relatively simple and easy, while the work of the Prosecutor's Office is heavy and technical. In countries with a sound prosecution system, the power of the prosecutor is above all else, and the judicial police are the assistants of the prosecutor. They are responsible for probing, investigation, guarding, and execution. They are also the ones who specifically confront evil.

Since the Constitution was formulated, the Republic of China has embarked on the road of democracy. In order to protect human rights, the prosecution system has been established, and it is imperative to make efforts to train assistants for prosecutors. The judicial police of the District Court in this city are already stepping up this preparation. They take advantage of their spare time every day to desperately study criminal and civil procedure law, arrest law, and detective studies. A sound organization can exert a high degree of work efficiency. The judicial police of the District Prosecutor's Office alone have to deliver more than a thousand summons and disposition letters every day. However, with the efforts of division of labor and cooperation, they still have ample time to study academic subjects and organize soccer teams and basketball teams to temper their body and mind. At the same time, we also hope that the existing judicial police of the District Court will not be complacent with this. The future democratic and rule-of-law Republic of China still urgently needs you!

The judiciary has always been poor, and judicial police are of course no exception. Their current salary is 170,000 yuan, plus welfare benefits, subsidies, etc., which is only about 200,000 yuan per month, so most of the judicial police of the District Court are still "bachelors" and cannot afford a family.

### Speaker Inspects the Four Districts of Pudong

[Report from Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan, accompanied by Secretary-General Xiang and representatives from the Health and Public Works Bureaus, inspected the Tilanqiao, Yulin, Yangshupu, and Xinshijie districts yesterday, respectively in the morning and afternoon. When the Speaker visited each district, he was warmly welcomed by the district chiefs, the chairmen of the district people's representatives' assemblies, and the district councilors of each district.

When the Speaker went to Tilanqiao yesterday, he visited the Jewish refugee area there. At the same time, he hoped that the authorities could quickly repair the badly damaged road surface of Fair Road in the district. When visiting the shantytowns in the Yulin district, it was found that the residents of the shantytowns not only lived in extremely simple and crude environments and had no access to sanitation, but also lacked daily drinking water. Therefore, in addition to requesting the Health and Public Works Bureaus to pay special attention, he also asked the Public Utilities Bureau to provide convenient access to drinking water.

In Yangshupu, the Sports School there will be relocated, so it is hoped that a central primary school can be established at the original site. In addition, the Yinxiang Hospital has now been taken over by the China Textile Company, and the residents of the district have requested that the original hospital be returned to the local area for self-management.

It was also decided that the Speaker and others would inspect the Wusong and Jiangwan districts today.

The Conditions of Shantytowns Are Not Only Simple and Crude, There is Also a Lack of Daily Drinking Water

### Our Newspaper's Seventh Weekly Broadcast, Banking and Services, Expert Sun Ruihuang Speaks

[Report from Our Newspaper] Our newspaper held its seventh weekly special broadcast at the Hezhong Radio Station yesterday, inviting economic expert Sun Ruihuang, Deputy General Manager of Xinhua Bank, to speak on "Banking and Services." The following is a record of his speech: "What exactly is a bank? What is called a bank? The term bank, in its broadest scope, can include banks, native banks, trust companies, etc. The businesses they operate include: deposits, including current deposits, time deposits, savings deposits, and trust deposits; loans, including current overdrafts, mortgage loans, discount loans, and export negotiation loans; remittances, including domestic remittances and foreign remittances; investments, including buying and selling securities, and recruiting company stocks and bonds; safekeeping, including open safekeeping, sealed safekeeping, rental of safe deposit boxes and warehouses; and agency, including property management, insurance, and agency for money collection and payment. From the various businesses mentioned above, it seems that the business of banks is not only to accept people's credit and grant people's credit, but other businesses are equally important and mutually supportive and progressive. If a bank's business is not planned on a whole, and cannot be fully developed, the entire business will be affected. For example, if a bank can act as an agent for buying and selling securities, and it can operate remittances and various other businesses, customers who want to buy and sell securities and want to remit money will inevitably want to open an account at this bank. The bank's power to accept and grant credit will also increase invisibly. This increased power should be attributed to the service aspect of the bank, so a bank is also an institution that serves society.

Three Main Functions

Since a bank is an institution that serves society, its relationship with society is naturally very close, and the role it plays must be quite large. Now, let's summarize it into three points and talk about them separately: (1) In terms of social construction, society must prosper and must first go through a stage of construction. Construction requires huge amounts of funds. These huge amounts of funds can never be provided by private individuals. Even the government sometimes finds it difficult to cope with these huge expenses, so it must rely on banks to assist. (2) In terms of industry and commerce, industry and commerce are the main components of developing the social economy and have a considerable relationship with people's lives. Industry and commerce use their funds to increase the utility of goods, which can alleviate the threat of economic life, especially when raw materials and commodities are scarce now, it is even more necessary to ensure the smooth flow of industrial and commercial funds. The business of banks is aimed at industry and commerce, and they are constantly striving to regulate industrial and commercial funds. Industry and commerce rely on banks, and at the same time, banks also rely on industry and commerce. (3) In terms of daily economic life, banks also have a direct or indirect relationship with people's daily economic life. For example, their deposit and investment business is to find an outlet for people's funds, overdrafts and loans are to regulate the lack of funds, remittances are to communicate the availability of funds between people in two places, safekeeping and warehouses are to protect the safety of people's property, and the use of negotiable instruments and agency collection and payment are to reduce people's troubles in receiving and delivering money. All of the above are sufficient to help people deal with daily economic matters. Like banks in the United States, their services are especially thoughtful, such as handling real estate trusts and living trusts. As long as customers say they want a beautiful house, the bank can do it. If customers want to prepare for future monthly living expenses, the bank can also plan in advance. The relationship between banks and people's lives is even more intimate.

Taking Service as the Goal

As mentioned earlier, a bank is an institution that serves society, so its main task should of course be to serve society as its goal, relying on enhancing the effectiveness of services and expanding the area of services to promote banking business. The cost of business is, of course, necessary for its own survival, but it should not be too focused on private interests and neglect the principle of serving society. Sometimes, under certain circumstances, banks not only cannot make money from serving society, but even suffer losses. As long as it is beneficial to society, banks will not hesitate. Banks should conduct business with this spirit of service everywhere. I believe that unconsciously, they can gain the belief of society and the trust of customers, establish a good reputation, and business can gradually expand. Therefore, service first is the supreme creed for running a bank.

To Move Forward in a Standard Way

Banks evolve with economic development. The more the economy develops, the more developed the banking industry. As banks develop, the number of banks gradually increases, and competition is inevitable. In an environment of business competition, how can you win the belief of society? How can you achieve a noble position? It all depends on its contribution to society. Therefore, a bank must move forward in a standard way, starting with serving society. How can you be a bank that serves society? There are five things we need to recognize: (1) To be prudent in management, (2) To abide by laws and regulations, (3) To help production enterprises, (4) Not to seek immediate gains, (5) To treat customers as life.

Must Have Factual Performance

Banks serving society has become a slogan for running banks today, but this slogan is not just about advertising and publicity, it must have factual performance. This factual performance is not a matter of one day or one night, it must go through many years of struggle to be achieved. People in society should assist banks that are service-oriented, so that their service power can be strengthened and the scope of service can be expanded. How can this be called assistance? It is to recognize banks that truly serve society, and establish business relationships with them. At the same time, you can also ask banks that do not serve society to be aware and all embark on the road of serving society.

### Manager of Yongfeng North Goods Store Sued for Encroaching on Land Foundation

[Report from Our Newspaper] On January 1, 1946, eight people from Ningbo, including Li Xingkang, Li Xingshu, and Mei Zhongqi, jointly opened the Yongfeng Xinji North Goods Store at 55 Zhonghua Road. Li Xingshu was appointed as supervisor, Mei Zhongqi as manager, and Li Xingkang as accountant. Later, due to disagreements, the business was announced to close at the end of June of the same year, but Mei Zhongqi delayed settling the accounts until today. At the end of March, without the consent of the shareholders, he transferred the Yongfeng Xinji signboard at 55 Zhonghua Road and replaced it with the Renhehang signboard. Later, he moved all the clothes and other items in Li Xingkang's room to the corner of the stairs, forcing him to move out, and moved his own furniture in. Subsequently, while Li was out, he moved his luggage and other items to the Datong North Goods Store in Huacheng Lane on Yanghang Street without authorization. Li Xingkang reported this to the Yimiao Police Sub-bureau a few days ago. After the judicial section chief Zhou Nan ordered the police to summon Mei Zhongqi to the bureau for questioning, it was determined that he intended to encroach on the land foundation and moved other people's property without authorization, hindering others from exercising their rights. The case has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling a few days ago.

### Doctor Involved in Housing Lawsuit

Chu Linxun Ordered to Move Within Three Months

Chu Linxun, a doctor in this city who served as the director of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Hospital during the enemy and puppet period, rented the house at 1827 Linsen Middle Road from his fellow doctor Wu Tianmin during the war to open Chu Linxun Hospital. Because Wu said that the house was originally the site of his Xiafei Sanatorium established before the war, and Chu's lease period had long expired, Wu repeatedly asked to take it back to resume business, but was refused. Wu then filed a lawsuit. The case has been judged by the 10th Division of the District Court, which found that the lease relationship between the two parties had terminated and that the defendant Chu Linxun should move out within three months. Plaintiff Wu Tianmin was allowed to execute the judgment provisionally after providing security.

### Zhejiang University Continues Strike, Zhijiang Student Unrest Also Not Resolved

[Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 18th] The Zhejiang University strike continues, and petition representatives have all gone to Nanjing. The Zhijiang student unrest is also ongoing. The student assembly resolved to authorize the student union to refute the principal's true reasons for granting vacation in order to comfort parents, and to question Principal Li in Shanghai. Various normal schools in Zhejiang, due to unsuccessful petitions to the provincial government, have organized a normal school association and have scheduled school strikes from the 20th. Also, regarding the "eat everything" movement brewing at the Hangzhou Art School, the school's student union claims that this is not the case. [Report from our Newspaper in Nanjing, 18th] Student representatives from Jiaotong University's school protection group, Zhu Bao Bin, Zhang Gong Wei, Ding Zhong Yan, Xi Zu Gang, Tao Long, Cheng Liang He, Wu Zhen Dong, Luo Qi Sen, Hu Guo Ding, Cao Guo Xiang, Zhang Hai Wei, Ding Qi Zhong, Hu Qing Zheng, Wang Zhi Sui, Zhang Peng Bao, and others, totaling fifteen people, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 18th. After the Jiaotong University principal and professors arrive in Nanjing on the 19th, a final discussion will be held, and they will petition the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan on the 19th. They met with reporters at 4 PM on the 18th to report on the purpose of the petition and its reasons. According to them: (A) The purpose of this trip is based on the last item of Minister Zhu's five replies, believing that there are still outstanding issues, so representatives are sent to Nanjing for face-to-face consultations. Zhu's reply was in principle, and we hope for details, so the petition will be carried out on the 19th. (B) The origin of the school protection is that the Ministry of Education discriminates against Jiaotong University, and the facts are approximately: (1) The Ping and Tang sub-colleges were divided last year. (2) The College of Science was also ordered to be closed last year, and after vigorous efforts, the order was withdrawn. (3) The suspension of the marine engineering and navigation departments. (4) The hydraulic engineering and textile departments may also be suspended, and the handling of the chemical engineering department is still under consideration and is extremely difficult to approve. (5) The Ministry of Education intends to rename Jiaotong University. (6) The distribution of funds to various universities is uneven. Jiaotong University's monthly recurring expenses are only over 10.5 million, while expenditures are 50 million, with a deficit of 40 million. (7) The number of faculty and staff is too small. From August to December of the 35th year, calculated according to the number of classes opened, the number of faculty and staff should be 553, school workers 248, and technicians 40. However, the Ministry of Education only approved 373 faculty and staff, 120 school workers, and 1 technician. From January to July of this year, there were 423 faculty and staff, 205 school workers, and 1 technician, but the actual salaries paid were even less than the approved number. According to the approved 423 faculty and staff, only 307 were paid, and out of the 205 workers, only 125 were paid. Therefore, there is a monthly salary deficit of 30 million, plus the 40 million owed in recurring expenses, totaling 70 million. Fortunately, the donation from alumni to build the auditorium was used to cover the deficit. (8) The Ministry of Education has set up funds for improving equipment and expansion this year. Jiaotong University has 800 million, but only 300 million has been issued so far. Tongji has 1.8 billion, National Central University has 2 billion, and Zhejiang University has 5.2 billion. (9) There are too few faculty and staff. National Central University has 5,000 students and over 1,300 faculty and staff, while Jiaotong University has 3,000 students and 423 faculty and staff. (10) Comparison of the number of colleges in various universities: Jiaotong University has only three colleges; those with four colleges are Northwest University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Hunan University, Guizhou University, and Yingtu University; those with five colleges are Northeast University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Chung Cheng University, Fudan University, Chongqing University, Shandong University, and Lanzhou University; those with six colleges are Wuhan University, Changchun University, Henan University, and Taiwan University; those with seven colleges are Sun Yat-sen University and Zhejiang University. (10) (1) All schools have added departments, increased classes, and built new buildings, but Jiaotong University is the only one that has not.

### Fudan Launches School Protection Movement

[Central News Agency] Students from various national schools in this city mostly express sympathy for the demands of National Central University and Jinling University for increased public funding and supplementary food expenses, but believe that continuing strikes and responding to the so-called "eat everything" movement have other purposes and have risen up to oppose it. Fudan students have already begun signing their names yesterday to launch a school protection movement. They believe that all demands can be made through proper channels to the school authorities and the education authorities and should not continue to strike or use the "eat everything" movement as a threat. The signing students are scheduled to convene a meeting today to discuss the next steps and may decide to resume classes today.

### Datong University Students Hosted Reporters Yesterday, Claiming They Will Petition in Nanjing

[Report from our Newspaper] The Datong University Student Union, in order to demand reform of school administration, caused a strike that has lasted for two days. The school has still not sent anyone to take responsibility and seek a resolution. Yesterday morning, the student union sent the eight major demands and various detailed items in writing to the school board, demanding a reply within two days, otherwise, they will go to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Education and request that the school be converted into a national school. The union hosted reporters at the school at 10 AM yesterday to report on the strike process and the school's measures. It is said that the students in the school do not have publicly funded treatment, and most poor students rely on the economic cafeteria run by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to maintain themselves. Now that the economic cafeteria is about to be closed with the end of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, they decided to run a cooperative on their own two months ago to find a solution and submitted a request to the school for approval. However, the school has been delaying approval. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, the second general student representative meeting was convened. Because the school disregarded student welfare, and summarizing the school's various unreasonable facilities in peacetime, it was decided to put forward eight demands: (1) Request the school to accept the four demands put forward by the economic cafeteria: 1. Resolutely request the school to allow the establishment of a cooperative and provide a location for the cooperative, otherwise, subsidize the cafeteria's expenses. 2. Please provide the school with a kitchen and three cooks, stoves, and fuel. 3. Please do not unreasonably interfere with the administration of the economic cafeteria in the future. 4. Please reply immediately. (2) Request the school to abolish all unreasonable systems. (3) Notices and publications with names should not be torn down. (4) Abolish all unreasonable fees. (5) Guarantee students' freedom of thought and freedom of assembly. (6) Abolish the student organization registration system. (7) Improve all facilities. (8) Request the school to publicly recognize the current student union. The above points were requested to be answered by Acting President Hu within one day. However, there was still no response on the 16th, so the strike began on the afternoon of that day, and they collectively walked to President Hu's private residence to petition. Mr. Hu heard the news in advance and avoided meeting them. To this day, the school has not sent any person in charge to reply, so it was decided to send representatives to Nanjing to petition. It is reported that Datong University President Hu Gang Fu is currently lecturing in the United Kingdom and is being represented by his younger brother Hu Dun Fu.

### Shanghai University Professors' Association

Decides on New Method for Calculating Grades

The Shanghai University Student Union, a private university in this city, launched a strike some time ago to demand that the school abolish the grade point system.

After detailed research over the past few days, it was deemed that Chapter 7 of the Ministry of Education's "Regulations on Student Status in Specialist Schools and Universities" promulgated on March 27 of this year, regarding the calculation of grades, is quite complete. It was therefore formally recommended to the Professors' Association that starting this semester, the method of calculating students' academic grades should be handled in accordance with these regulations. The Professors' Association has accepted this recommendation. It is heard that after students received this news, they may attend classes today (the 19th).

Letter of Correction

I read in your newspaper on May 18 that the Sino-French Pharmaceutical strike was in response to the "eat everything movement," which is inconsistent with the facts. The Sino-French Pharmaceutical Department requests the Ministry of Education to set up a college of pharmacy for the future of pharmacy. Because the Ministry of Education did not give a concrete reply, the strike was to express the determination to strive for it. The goal is simple and there are no other intentions. Please correct it to avoid confusion. Student Union of the Private Sino-French University School of Pharmacy (May 18th)

### Expeditionary Force Sweeps All Before Them: Expeditionary Wheel Wins Three Out of Three, Shantou Team Suffers Another Defeat

The Fifty-Six This Thirty-Eight Guest Team’s Basketball Skills Advance Fiercely

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Expeditionary Army Luoyang Expeditionary Wheel basketball team is fighting more and more bravely. At 7 PM last night at the city gymnasium, they defeated Shantou Team with a score of 56 to 38, creating a record of three wins in three games after coming to Shanghai. The team's substantial strength and the remarkable progress in their skills are further proven here, which is admirable. There were over a thousand spectators, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.

The main reason for Expeditionary Wheel's victory is its strong strength. Tu Wenlong and Yu Ruizhang rarely miss their shots, regardless of position, angle, distance, or proximity. In addition to the five tigers in the official lineup, the performances of the other players are also not weak. Last night, players such as Cheng Fei and Ji Decheng also emerged prominently. Shantou Team suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Expeditionary Wheel last year, and they originally planned to take revenge last night. However, their play seemed overly aggressive. Chen Qingjiang was the most successful player yesterday, and the rest tried their best. The situation was quite balanced within the first ten minutes, and it was difficult to tell who would win. However, after a score of 19 to 15, Shantou Team declined sharply and got progressively worse. In the end, they could not resist and suffered another defeat.

Shantou Team Fights Hard

The game began between the two teams amidst applause. Captains Cai Zhongqiang and Ma Shuoxi presented each other with team flags. Referees Jin Jiabiao and Xuan Hegao blew the whistle to start the game. Expeditionary Wheel started with Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Yu Ruizhang, Liu Zhengjun, and Wang Binghuan, while Shantou Team started with Ma Canxi, Cai Yanxiong, Chen Qingjiang, Lin Weicong, and He Lide. After the initial contact, Zhongqiang committed a foul, and Cai Yanxiong scored a point on the free throw, opening the scoring. When Liu Zhengjun scored, Qingjiang and Lide also scored four points. Shantou Team took a 5-2 lead, followed by a 7-4 lead. Tu Wenlong scored one point on a free throw, tying the game at 7-7. Qingjiang and Yanxiong took charge, and Shantou Team raised its head again, but they were soon forced into an 11-11 tie. Zhongqiang made a close shot, and Expeditionary Wheel took the lead. Shantou Team called a timeout, but it was ineffective. At 19-15, Shantou Team called a second timeout, but they still couldn't stop their momentum. At the end of the first half, Expeditionary Wheel led with a score of 24-16, taking an eight-point lead.

Momentum Like Splitting Bamboo

After switching sides, Expeditionary Wheel used the same lineup, while Shantou Team substituted Chen Mingyi for Cai Yanxiong. He Lide scored on two free throws. Expeditionary Wheel's Wenlong, Zhongqiang, and Ruizhang each made contributions. Shantou Team called a timeout. Yanxiong re-entered, and Mingyi was taken off. Expeditionary Wheel continued its momentum like splitting bamboo, and the score difference widened. At 42-29, He Lide was disqualified for committing five fouls. Lin Ziren took his place. At this time, Lin Weiting was more active, but guest player Yu Ruizhang also got into the swing of things. At 46-32, Expeditionary Wheel captain Cai committed a foul and was disqualified. Cheng Fei entered the field, and Cheng scored two points immediately after coming on. In the last four minutes, Tu Wenlong was also disqualified for committing five fouls. De Zang was substituted. Shantou Team took the opportunity to rise and made a desperate attack, but unfortunately, they had lost too many points and could not turn the tide. When the bell rang, Expeditionary Wheel defeated Shantou Team with a score of 56-38, achieving three wins in three games.

### Hunan Province Strengthens Secondary Vocational School Association: Generous Allocation of Practice Consumption Fees. The Ministry of Education Believes It Is Essential and Orders All Provinces and Cities to Refer to It for Implementation.

### Securities Firm Changes to Paying with US Dollar Bonds: The Amended Method Proposed by the Economic Sector Has Been Discussed Favorably, and It Is Expected to Open as Usual Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, it was rumored that the Ministry of Finance had decided to maintain its original proposal regarding the provision that securities brokers' margin deposits be offset by US dollar bonds. A reporter specifically inquired about this matter with a spokesperson for the Securities Exchange. According to him, "I don't know on what basis that news is being said." He truthfully stated: "Since the Ministry of Finance and Economics jointly issued the order, the authorities supervising the Securities Exchange have been in contact with the central authorities in charge by long-distance telephone to discuss the situation of the stock market's response and the opinions of the brokers. The process went very well. The central authorities in charge are very aware of the situation in Shanghai and have not expressed any intention of insisting on the original proposal." Also, a responsible official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stationed in Shanghai also had a discussion with the Securities Exchange authorities once yesterday, and was particularly sympathetic to some of the factual difficulties. Therefore, the discussion went smoothly and satisfactorily. The spokesperson believed that the proposed improvement opinions submitted by the Securities Brokers Association this time took into account the facts and should be called reasonable. He stated: "The government and the Securities Exchange authorities ultimately seek to ensure that the implementation of any measures does not cause obstacles, and they will never want to ignore the facts and act arbitrarily. Since the Brokers Association has already prepared amended opinions for the Ministry, and the Ministry has expressed understanding and sympathy for the situation in the Shanghai market, it is believed that there must be a mitigated method for the payment of US dollar bonds to be promulgated. We are currently waiting quietly for the Ministry's order to be issued so that we can comply with it. Therefore, the rumors circulating outside that the two ministries insist on the original proposal are not factual."

Furthermore, the Standing Council of the Securities Exchange recently resolved to forward the opinions proposed by the Brokers Association to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for review. Before receiving instructions from the Ministry, everything will be handled in accordance with the old method. Therefore, from the perspective of the Securities Exchange, trading will open as usual this morning. At the meeting of the Brokers Association the day before yesterday, the issue of opening trading today was hotly debated. Although there were differences of opinion, the atmosphere at the meeting ultimately concluded that, for the sake of the overall situation, it was still hoped that trading would open.

### Difficulties in Exporting Chinese Tea Reemerge: The Export Industry Holds an Emergency Meeting, Plans to Formulate a Production and Sales Plan, and Hopes That the Central Agricultural Bank Will Adopt It

The Chinese Tea Export Industry Association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the association the day before yesterday. More than ten directors and supervisors, including Tang Jisan, attended the meeting to discuss important issues such as the disposal of old tea and the harsh and complicated regulations for tea loans handled by the Central Agricultural Bank.

(1) The negotiations with the financial authorities on the government's dismantling of funds to purchase old tea from last year did not end as desired. After discussing the future course of action, it was decided that after concentrating the 70,000 dan of tea from last year, the Tea Joint Company would jointly estimate the price with the industry today, abandon those that do not meet export standards, and the rest would be jointly exported by the Business Committee of the company. It is still planned to request the government to allocate as much of the deposit as possible. (2) The Central Agricultural Bank's 80 billion yuan tea loan this year has harsh and complicated regulations, which are difficult for tea merchants to accept. It has been decided to jointly formulate a national tea production and sales plan for this year with the Tea Joint Company and request the Agricultural Bank to revise this year's tea loan method in accordance with this plan. However, the Agricultural Bank argued that it was difficult to change, so all directors and supervisors unanimously decided to appeal to the public opinion community on the difficulties of exporting Chinese tea. A committee was also appointed to draft a letter to social figures and to host the press at the Bankers Association tomorrow.

According to sources, the trading conditions of export tea in the international market are deteriorating. Export merchants are eager for the government to provide assistance in various ways. Due to the inability to dispose of the old tea from last year, the profit is willing to be put aside for the time being. At least, tea merchants must be given some guarantee. Tea firms in various places are still hesitant to produce tea this year, and there is no hope for domestic sales of tea. The market is sluggish, and market prices have returned to mediocrity. At the beginning of tea production, they have encountered this unfavorable situation, and operators cannot help but be daunted.

According to Dai Shengli of the Central Agricultural Bank, the government has always been very concerned about export tea and has strongly supported it. Commodity prices in various places have fluctuated sharply in the past month, but the price of Chinese tea has not increased. This is because exports cannot be expanded. Tea merchants may have already suffered losses. Financial authorities can consider purchasing it, but it is proposed to limit it to Qimen, Ping Shui, and Wenzhou products. The tea loan method may be too strict, but this is because the handling of last year's tea loan was not good, and it had to be done this way. Chen, the new deputy director of the Wheelchair Association, served as the director of the Trade Commission during the Anti-Japanese War and handled the purchase of a large number of tea leaves, so Chen will definitely be able to do his best to solve the difficulties in exporting. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is scheduled to end in September, with only four months left. There are still a large number of relief supplies stipulated to be shipped to our country, which are being actively rushed. It is estimated that they will be shipped before September this year.

It is understood that agricultural and fishery materials are more common among them. For example, after 1,000 tons of cotton seeds arrive in China, they will be distributed to disaster-stricken farmers in various places at no cost. There are 225,000 tons of fertilizer, half of which will be sold and half of which will be distributed. There are 1,500 sets of tractors to help disaster-stricken farmers reclaim land. There are 1.3 million pieces of small farm implements, which are also prepared to be distributed to disaster-stricken farmers. There are 1,800 diesel engines, which will be sold to the Agricultural Reclamation Office at a price. Oil and water machines. 777 well drilling machines will also be sold to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Agricultural Reclamation Office at a price.

20 cotton gins, 20 flour machines, 20 oil presses, and 150 tons of small canning equipment will be distributed to various places. 3,127 tons of active prevention and control of diseases, insect pests, veterinary medicine, and machinery will be distributed to various places to prevent and control diseased livestock and epidemics. 164 fishing vessels and 90,000 tons of fishing gear will be sold to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Fishery Management Office at a price. There are also 1,000 water buffaloes, which will be sold publicly at a price. Currently, Chen Cun in various parts of our country needs these materials, so he is extremely eager for the UNRRA to ship them as soon as possible and distribute them for application.

### Japan's Foreign Trade Activities: Japanese Merchants Can Lend Goods to the Bureau of Commerce. The Bureau Will Approve the Re-export to Foreign Countries.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] According to diplomatic sources, the American Commercial Company was originally the agent of the Allied Headquarters for controlling Japanese trade. The company recently stated that, regarding Japanese foreign trade matters, except for cotton textiles, inquiries for other commodities can be directly contacted by Japanese merchants or the Japanese government's Bureau of Commerce, or the Allied Headquarters' Foreign Trade Group, from now on. However, for transaction procedures, Japanese merchants still cannot handle them directly. They must first sell the goods to be sold to the Japanese government's Bureau of Commerce, which will act as an agent and resell them to foreign purchasers after approval from the headquarters. According to the Japanese foreign trade affairs, since the occupation, they have been under the control of the Allied Headquarters, and the US government has designated the American Commercial Company as the agent to undertake all import and export trade for the headquarters. Recently, the company announced that the restrictions on postal communications with Japan in various countries have been relaxed by the headquarters since January 2 of this year, allowing the use of postal and telegraphic services for the exchange of commercial information. Therefore, the above-mentioned measures have been adopted.

### New Wheat Will Soon Be Available for Purchase. The Authorities Have Not Yet Decided on the Amount of Wheat Purchase Loans.

The Fourth District Flour Industry Association submitted a statement to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs last week. They requested instructions on this year's wheat purchase plan from relevant agencies such as the Fourth Joint Administration Office and requested that flour and wheat loans be organized as soon as possible, hoping to lend 300 billion yuan, but no reply has been received yet.

Rong Yiren, the person in charge of the industry, visited Beijing a few days ago to exchange opinions informally with the authorities of the Ministry of Food in order to facilitate the process. At the same time, the industry has approached the Bank of Communications, which participated in the wheat loan last year, to continue to assist in the purchase. However, since the entire wheat purchase plan and loan amount must be approved by the Ministry of Food, and the new wheat will be launched in early June, the preparatory work for all parties has not seen progress. In addition, the recent personnel changes in the central government have caused delays in the issuance of concrete statements, and flour mills are very anxious.

Currently, the factory is based on the consumption in this city and its suburbs to make statistics, and believes that each factory in this city needs at least 100 billion yuan to turn around. After consecutive days of talks with the financial authorities, it has been confirmed that this wheat loan is indeed very important. Each factory has decided that if the authorities still have not made any decisions within the week, each manufacturer will independently raise funds and go to the production area to purchase wheat in order to increase production and supply foreign exchange needs.

### Central Agricultural Bank Holds Grain Production Loans

The Chinese Farmers Bank plans to launch grain production loans in order to increase grain production. In addition to ordinary loans, it also plans to allocate more loans to counties in the pacification area and the Pan area of the Yellow River and Huai River to help farmers resume cultivation and increase grain supply. The loan is limited to purchasing seeds, fertilizers, cattle, and farm implements. It is learned that the case has been approved by the Fourth Joint Administration Office and allocated for lending within a limit of 200 billion yuan, and it is approved to re-mortgage to the National Bank at a 10% discount.

### Exporters Request Postponement of Settlement Period for Consignment Goods

The Importers and Exporters Association, in light of the recent sluggish sales and declining prices in overseas markets, with even fur prices having fallen by more than 50%, notes that the Central Bank requires all foreign exchange from consigned goods shipped overseas by exporters and entrusted for sale to be settled by May 24th. Otherwise, the Central Trust Bureau's overseas agents will be entrusted to sell the goods at any price, causing widespread anxiety. It is generally believed that exporters have made great sacrifices in the past to secure foreign exchange funds for the government. However, due to the current decline in overseas market prices, they are not allowed to ship goods back from overseas, and are further required to settle foreign exchange within a limited time. This situation not only fails to adhere to the government's principle of encouraging exports, but will also deter exporters from engaging in outward processing business in the future.

The association will submit a petition to the Central Bank today, listing the reasons and requesting that the bank understand the difficulties of businesses, withdraw its order, and extend the settlement period for foreign exchange, so that exporters can suffer fewer losses and align with the government's original intention of encouraging exports.

### Chairman Xu Letian of the Fuel Management Committee Discusses the Current Situation of Coal Mines in North and Northeast China

[Our Reporter] Xu Rongtian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, upon returning to Shanghai from Beijing, stated during an interview with reporters that the coal production in North and Northeast China has increased. However, due to railway damage and insufficient allocation of railcars, transportation capacity still needs to be strengthened. To ensure a continuous supply of coal to Central and South China, the government will focus on the development of Huainan and other new coalfields. After two to three months of preparation, everything in Huainan is on track, and the railway to Yuxikou will also be strengthened to facilitate coal transportation. Regarding the issue of raising coal prices and the requests for price increases from merchants in North China, he discussed the matter in Beijing with the heads of Kailuan, Huainan, East China, and the six Northeast mines, and consulted with Vice President Wang. The government is willing to make reasonable adjustments without hindering production. Due to the government's continued implementation of subsidy policies this month, no changes are planned. The Fuel Management Committee is drafting measures to be submitted to the Price Conference in June for a comprehensive solution. The protection of coal mines in various parts of China was also discussed in detail, and it was decided to increase the strength of the mine protection forces to ensure safety. In the past, the Communist army often used occupied coal mines to continue production and exchange coal for our materials. Recently, the policy has changed, and after occupying coal mines, they destroy the equipment thoroughly. For example, the Datong coal mine, which had been developed by the Japanese for several years and had reached the scale of Kailuan, has been devastated since the Communist army occupied it. Currently, it is only producing using indigenous methods, and the output is insignificant. The machinery of the Boshan coal mine was dismantled by the Chinese Communists and transported to Yantai, making future restoration work difficult. Such cases are numerous, so mine protection work is extremely important. In addition, shipping companies have also requested higher water transportation costs for coal, which is currently being negotiated by Li Jinglu, Director of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, with the shipping industry.

### Free Trading of Cooking Oil; Oil Market Opens Today

Mayor Wu, to stabilize the prices of essential food materials for the residents of this city, in addition to allowing the free buying and selling of rice, it is learned that he has now also specially permitted the free trading of cooking oil, abolishing the price control system. The Oil Merchants Association will open a cooking oil market, which is scheduled to officially open at 10:00 a.m. today (the 19th). Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council, Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, and others will attend to give instructions.

It is also learned that the supply of oil and grain to the city has been difficult recently, and the future is not optimistic. Because Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, and other places in the Northeast have strictly prohibited exports, it is reported that the oil and grain industry has drafted proposals requesting Mayor Wu to negotiate with the local governments of Yingkou and other places to ensure the smooth flow of goods.

### Automobile Business Association Established

The Automobile Business Association of this city held its inaugural meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. at the Atlantic Restaurant. More than 80 people attended, including representatives from various agencies and members. Chen Ke, the interim chairman, delivered the opening remarks, and Liu Jingsheng reported on the preparations. Next, representatives from the party and government and guests delivered speeches. Then, the articles of association were discussed, and the directors and supervisors were elected by ballot. Fifteen people, including Zhu Daxun and Zhou Mengxian, were elected as directors.

### Shanghai Dairy Factory Introduces New Unsalted Butter

Shanghai Dairy Factory, established for many years, specializes in producing "An Jian Er" and "Golden Lion" brand full-fat milk powder and butter. Recently, it has added new-style machinery and continues to supply "An Jian Er" and "Golden Lion" brand milk powder, and has also launched fresh sterilized milk, which has reached thousands of households since its introduction. It has also newly released "An Jian Er" salted and unsalted butter in one-pound, half-pound, and quarter-pound packages. These surpass foreign products. Currently, they are widely sold in major foreign liquor, candy, and food stores.

### Taiwan Fertilizer By-products Planned to be Shipped to Shanghai for Supply to Factories

[Our Reporter] According to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, Taiwan Fertilizer produces fertilizer by-products. Regarding fertilizer, it produces 12,000 tons of gaseous fertilizer and 32,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer annually. Regarding by-products, it produces 100 to 200 tons of 66-degree sulfuric acid and 500 to 800 tons of 50-degree sulfuric acid monthly. In addition, it produces 300 to 500 tons of calcium carbide and 60 tons of electrodes (i.e., carbon electrodes) monthly. The carbon electrode products are divided into three sizes: 3-inch, 8-inch, and 12-inch. It also produces over 11 tons of saltpeter monthly. It is reported that the fertilizer products will be reserved for Taiwan's own use, while the by-products are planned to be sold to Shanghai. However, they are not intended to be sold as general commodities but are hoped to be supplied directly to various factories. The allocation method is said to be that the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office will convene various factories to discuss the matter.

### Incense Association Forms Joint Operation Office for Incense Sticks

The Incense Stick Group of the Municipal Incense Association, in view of the fact that past operations have not been jointly coordinated, resulting in inconsistent order prices and uneven quality, and that raw material prices have increased and labor and food expenses have become increasingly large, has organized a joint operation office to improve quality and standardize prices. It will begin accepting orders from today.

### Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoon Markets Scheduled to Open

This year's silkworm season in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is expected to be bountiful due to the warm weather in recent days. In particular, Zhejiang has started cultivating silk early. After discussion, it has been decided that all cocoon markets in each district of the province will open uniformly around the 20th of this month. The province is divided into sixteen groups, and the candidates for group leaders have been selected by the three district associations from the list of member manufacturers, which has been approved by the association. The group leaders have gone to prepare for the opening of the cocoon markets and the purchase of cocoons. It is estimated that the total amount of cocoons collected in the province will be about 120,000 dan of fresh cocoons. Calculated at 280 jin per dan of dried cocoons, this would yield more than 43,000 dan of dry cocoons. If calculated at 420 jin per dan, it would yield more than 10,000 dan of spring silk.

### Wei Daoming's Arrival in Taiwan

— Taipei, 15th (Air Mail) Special Report by Our Reporter Yang Yu

The heavy responsibility of governing Taiwan Province, which was liberated after being occupied by the Japanese for more than fifty years, has been passed on today from Governor Chen Yi of the Governor-General's Office, which has existed for a year and a half, to Dr. Wei Daoming, the first chairman of the new provincial government. This is a major event since the restoration. The people of Taiwan are not overly surprised by the change of personnel, but everyone is worried about the intangible stagnation and disconnection in politics from the February 28th Incident until now, and anxious about the slow arrival of the successor. Many people say, "During the Japanese rule, it only took three days to replace a governor-general." After waiting and waiting, finally at 11:05 a.m. yesterday, tens of millions of eyes filled with hope saw Chairman Wei and his wife, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, step down from China Airlines XT-T68 at Songshan Airport outside Taipei. The Southern country is early hot, the sun like fire scorches the skin, the airport surged with excited and enthusiastic waves of people.

Airport Broadcast

Chairman Wei was wearing a dark suit and was energetic. Madam Wei took off her black glasses, accepted two bunches of bright flowers with a smile, and stood still while two or thirty cameras freely captured this memorable moment. Amidst the military music, between the steel helmets and bayonets of the honor guard, between the heads and flags of the long welcoming line, Chairman Wei moved to the microphone in front of the airport lounge. Speaker Huang of the Provincial Assembly delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the people of the province: "The Central Government has specially sent Chairman Wei, who is extremely accomplished in diplomacy, to preside over the administration of Taiwan, which shows that the Central Government attaches importance to Taiwan Province." These words were translated into Taiwanese, Hakka, and Japanese. Chairman Wei's answer was simple, and he conserved his energy. He said: "Taiwan was occupied by the Japanese for more than fifty years. After eight years of bloody war, it was newly returned to the embrace of the motherland. I am extremely excited to come here. In the future, I am willing to do my best to work with my compatriots to seek the happiness of Taiwan Province." These words were broadcast to every corner of the island. Everyone is praying for happiness, and they believe that after these voices are heard, the new chairman will surely bring new happiness to the people of Taiwan.

The student队伍排队从机场一直到宾馆,足足晒了两个小时的烈日,这时候望着28001号汽车,有的挥旗,有的欢呼,魏主席频频点头,魏夫人则在车内佝偻了体躯,向行列摆手.

Policy Direction

Chairman Wei said when he received reporters at the Taipei Guest House at 3 p.m. that day: "I am very willing to know the local public opinion and consensus." The fact that he rushed to meet with reporters for the first time less than three hours after getting off the plane is enough to make the reporters feel comforted, and it is also worthy of the reporters to be more vigilant in their future work. "Governing should respect the public will, but it must also follow the path of the rule of law. In the economic field, we will make the greatest efforts to seek stability, and then seek development and prosperity from stability. The promotion of a free economic policy is necessary, but in principle, it should not hinder economic stability." He further added: "The principles have been decided, but specific problems need to be studied in detail, individually, and then planned and resolved comprehensively, which seems more practical." At the same time, he also used these words to answer many questions raised by reporters, such as the method of economic assistance and the adjustment of the salaries of public and educational personnel. Chairman Wei affirmed this view: It is not easy to clarify a problem, and deciding on a measure based solely on simple thinking often leads to failure.

Emphasis on Consideration

What reporters are most concerned about is the adjustment of the previous public office structure. What is the possibility of changing the Transportation Department, the Industry and Mining Department, and the Police Department? What countermeasures will be taken for the Monopoly and Trade Bureaus? How will public enterprises be dealt with? As for the smaller issues of dance halls and prostitution, Chairman Wei often replied, "This is one of the issues I am considering." He stated that before the new structure has been adjusted, everything will remain as it is. He emphasized the word "consideration."

Speaking of the press itself, Chairman Wei said that the provincial government should set up a special agency to maintain regular contact with the press, and he himself hopes to maintain contact with reporters at all times. Regarding the Japanese version of newspapers in this province, Chairman Wei believes that it still has value in the transitional period, but the focus is still on the active promotion of Mandarin.

One reporter asked Chairman Wei, "Does Madam Wei intend to lead the women's movement in this province?" Chairman Wei was amused and said with a smile, "Then ask her herself!"

At four o'clock, Chairman Wei continued to receive representatives from all walks of life. He left after ending this press conference. Before leaving, he invited the reporters to have some refreshments. Chief of Staff Zhou Guangming of the Garrison Headquarters represented the host and chatted with us humorously.

A new page has now been opened, and the pace of building a new Taiwan will be further developed. The six million people will always be watching and hoping! (May 16)

Chairman Wei uses a written report to explain the political direction: "Orderly Democracy"

### With the Gun-Carrying Soldiers, Reliving the Old Gejiu Dreams: Ten Days in Southern Yunnan (1)

— Kunming, 12th by Air Mail. Special Correspondent Xu Jilian of this Newspaper

Generally speaking, the people of the Three Yi region are known for their diligence and hard work, as this characteristic is nurtured by the natural environment. Among them, the people of Southern Yunnan demonstrate even greater fortitude. In this vast area, many people live by relying on their strength and depending on the weather for their livelihoods. However, on the other hand, Southern Yunnan is a region where culture and talent converge, producing numerous scholars and forming the cultural center of Yunnan province.

The out-of-town reporters in Kunming had long planned a collective visit to Southern Yunnan. After various arrangements, our temporary group finally set off on the 26th of last month, as we had wished. The members included one representative from each of the nine daily evening newspapers in Kunming, as well as four reporters stationed in Kunming from major newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai. The journey was filled with laughter and conversation, so it wasn't lonely at all. The round trip took a total of ten days, with stops in Yiliang, Chenggong, Kaiyuan, Gejiu, and Mengzi counties. However, we spent a longer time in Gejiu because it is China's "Tin Capital," and we carefully toured the area.

A City in the Hot Circle: Kaiyuan

After a full day and a half of train and car travel, we arrived in Gejiu. The journey was quite arduous. The narrow-gauge tracks and small locomotives of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway struggled, especially when climbing slopes, and the climate in Southern Yunnan was far from as cool as in Kunming. We gradually approached the scorching heat. In the train car, we felt like we were in a steamer. Adding to this were countless large and small tunnels, and the passengers' suffocation was something only they could understand. Fortunately, the railway bureau was quite punctual with the train schedule. After a full eleven hours, we arrived in Kaiyuan, a major city in Southern Yunnan, at six o'clock in the afternoon.

The weather in Kaiyuan already felt like early summer in the Jiangnan region. A stone-paved street, quiet and lazy, stretched through the city center. The young apprentices in the shops, wearing sleeveless shirts, were attending to the few customers. Business was not very prosperous. The sound of wooden clogs "clattering" on the stone pavement echoed once or twice, heavy and clear, breaking through the deathly silence of Kaiyuan.

Under the awning of the Railway Hotel, I spoke with Liu Jingming, the secretary-general of the special party branch of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, about the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which everyone was concerned about. He raised his voice and said, "The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway must be repaired quickly. This is indeed the most urgent task at hand." He then explained the importance of Kaiyuan in the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and in foreign trade. Currently, the repair work on the Bisezhai to Hekou section is still being delayed. It would be a great thing if it could be completed before the rainy season next year. Although the Ministry of Transportation had already approved 9.3 billion yuan for the construction cost, the money has not yet been received, so it is all just "talking on paper." At present, only 1 billion yuan has been received as an advance payment. With such high prices and labor costs, what can be accomplished?

Difficulties Still Need to be Overcome in Repairing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway

In fact, there are too many difficulties in repairing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. First of all, the dispute over the rights between China and France has not yet been resolved. Our side believes that after the takeover, France has no right to interfere with the main line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, at least within the national borders. However, the French have repeatedly demanded joint management, which is difficult to accept in any way. Under the premise of so-called "equal sharing of benefits," if China's international status cannot be improved, France may be unlikely to relax their demands.

Furthermore, the unstable situation in Vietnam poses a major problem for the transportation of materials. Whether there is money to buy sleepers and steel rails, or whether they can be purchased, it is still impossible to solve the problem of how to transport them to this area for laying. Moreover, the rainy season brings another major obstacle. With so many difficulties, talking about repairing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway naturally makes people feel extremely frustrated.

I spent a night in a Kaiyuan hotel, filled with doubts. I thought that those in charge of road administration were helpless, so what conclusions could I, an outsider, reach? Early the next morning, we climbed onto a large truck, leaving the problems behind, and headed towards the interview center: Gejiu.

It is only 53 kilometers from Kaiyuan to Gejiu. If you take the "Ge-Bi-Shi Railway" train, it takes ten hours. Traveling by road only takes three hours by car. Compared to the two, it seems that the car is faster and more convenient. However, heaven! After starting, I have never encountered such a bad road surface in my travel experience. The road was covered with jagged gravel and overgrown with weeds. How could it be considered a highway?

The Tin Capital of Ours: Gejiu

With great difficulty, we were brought into the county seat of Gejiu in this bumpy manner. After arriving in a new place, the three hours of thrills and fatigue were long forgotten.

The Yunnan Tin Corporation arranged our accommodation, and their hospitality reduced some of the inconvenience for long-distance travelers. At the tea party, Associate Manager Lu received a report from the security team leader: a Cantonese mine worker, carrying two packs of cigarettes, was mistaken by bandits for carrying cash and was stabbed to death on the street with a knife. This news naturally sent chills down the spines of the unfamiliar travelers. Everyone was asking themselves: Is Gejiu such a terrifying city?

With doubt and fear intertwined in our minds, the Tin Corporation sent four gun-carrying soldiers as escorts in the evening, allowing us to have a tour of the entire city. I walked in front with the security team leader. The irregular stone road was paved into a long slope according to the height of the mountain. I allowed my footsteps to move in the chaotic stones and finally asked impatiently, "Where exactly is the city?"

Past Prosperity Turned to Lament: Gejiu is Sobbing

"Sir, we have been in the city all along!" the team leader reminded me. So I finally focused my eyes and looked around. The world-famous tin capital had fallen into such a state of dilapidation that it was hard to believe if you hadn't experienced it yourself. The shops on the side were tightly closed. The mountain surrounded the city, and the scene was desolate. I hated my useless pen for not being able to depict it before the readers' eyes.

Then, from the mouth of the security team leader, I learned about the rise and fall of Gejiu in these years. "Gejiu is truly a bankrupt," the speaker said with deep emotion. He fell into the depths of memory and began to relive the beautiful dreams of the prosperous period. He said that in the heyday of Gejiu, there were nearly 200,000 sand miners on the mines alone. There were also many "factory bosses" (i.e., mining capitalists). At that time, there were theaters and cinemas. Imported goods arrived in Gejiu first. How could Kunming people talk about fashion? The factory bosses exchanged tons of tin ore for cash, stuffed it into their pockets, and used the best Yunnan soil and gold-made smoking sets. Tell me, where could you find this kind of extravagance?

Speaking of eating, what were delicacies from the mountains and seas, bear paws, and bird's nests, considered in Gejiu at that time? Banquets were commonplace, with three to five hundred tables at a single invitation, which was not uncommon. The power of the factory bosses was unmatched. Unfortunately, good times don't last forever. Times have changed, and today, not to mention people, even the city is sobbing in secret. This place, which produces nothing but tin, is facing such a bleak situation today, a bit like a young master fallen on hard times.

Countless Municipal Affairs: Not Knowing Where to Start

The days of prosperity are long gone. Today, Gejiu is desolate. This city, which rose from mining, is calling out to new and old factory bosses, hoping that the golden age will reappear and return to the hustle and bustle of the past.

Gejiu suffered a total of eighteen bombings by enemy planes during the Anti-Japanese War. In the entire Yunnan province, the losses were quite considerable. Remnants of the bombings remain on the streets, left to decay. At a time when the tin industry is yet to be revitalized, who can be in the mood to pay attention to the restoration of municipal administration?

A Line of Defense in Guangdong

The Ma'an Polder Flood Control and Farmland Irrigation Project is a concrete expression of the struggle against the forces of nature with great human power. Ma'an Polder is located in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, at the confluence of the East River and its tributary, the Si River. The land there is fertile, and the prices are abundant. The entire area is a plain of about 170 square miles, with 200,000 acres of farmland. However, due to the lack of water conservancy in the past, the farmland suffered losses. Every year, when the rainy season comes, floods inundate the fields, causing severe damage. During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, local villagers built a 21-kilometer-long embankment along the East River. After it was breached once, it was repaired and destroyed repeatedly, losing its flood control effect. Moreover, the Si River, a tributary of the East River, was not taken into account. When the East River rose, it flowed back into the Si River, flooding the fields on both banks, which could not be prevented. Twenty years ago, the embankment was breached by two kilometers, and the floodwaters carried sand into the fields, covering more than 5,000 acres, which remain barren to this day. According to local elders, no one wanted an acre of land even for two yuan at that time, making the fertile 200,000 acres of farmland in the entire area almost turn into wasteland. This is a very regrettable thing! Therefore, local enlightened people believe that the construction of this water conservancy project is essential to ensure the stability and livelihood of the villagers. This can be said to be the motivation for the construction of Ma'an Polder; however, the completion of a great project is not a matter of one day or one night. In addition to time, financial resources, and manpower, it also requires perseverance and determination to achieve today's success.

Construction Process Takes Four Years

The construction of Ma'an Polder, from surveying, design, and several planning stages to completion, took more than four years. During this period, the local gentry who mobilized the project traveled and appealed, resolved difficulties, and endured hardships. There were also heroic sacrifices. Now, General Qiu Zhaochen, chairman of the Polder Council, is the most diligent promoter of this project. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was the commander of the Changsha Garrison in Hunan and also a gentleman from Huiyang County. Because the supply of foreign rice was cut off during the war, there was a widespread famine in Guangdong Province, and the crisis was even more severe in the counties along the East River. Local gentry such as General Qiu Zhaochen felt that the lack of water conservancy in the area affected the people's food supply. Therefore, in the winter of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), they initiated the proposal to build Ma'an Polder. At that time, Mr. Liu Binggang, the magistrate of Huiyang County, strongly advocated the project. Unexpectedly, Huiyang was soon invaded by the enemy, and Magistrate Liu was captured and died after refusing to surrender because he ran around to promote the construction of Ma'an Polder water conservancy. He was later commended by the National Government, so he can be said to have sacrificed for Ma'an Polder. Later, Huiyang was lost and regained three times. General Qiu and others continued to work tirelessly on this project. In June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), they submitted a request to the provincial government to send a team to survey the area. The entire design work was completed in August of the following year. Just as they were about to start construction, Huiyang fell for the fourth time, and the construction work had to be suspended.

600,000 People Settled and Able to Make a Living

After the victory, General Luo Zhuoying returned to take charge of Guangdong's administration and set the goal of prioritizing people's livelihood in the construction of the province. Therefore, farmland water conservancy construction became a major project. The construction of the Ma'an Polder water conservancy project was brought up again. Initially, it was intended to use Japanese prisoners of war to save construction costs, but soon all Japanese prisoners of war were transported back to their country, and it was difficult to raise such a large sum of money, so it could not be realized. In June of last year, Xie Wenlong took over as the head of the Construction Department and also sought to implement this project quickly. At that time, Wu Zhimei, Lin Yizhong, Lu Yougang, Hu Mulan, Xiao Ciyao, Yi Qun and others organized the Guangdong Food Relief Association. Because the food shortage in Guangdong Province was serious and needed to be increased to provide relief, both the symptoms and the root causes were addressed. They allocated 140 million yuan in relief funds to advocate this project. Later, they obtained a loan of 860 million yuan from the Agricultural Bank, an advance payment of 90 million yuan from the Water Conservancy Commission, and 1,200 tons of relief grain from the Guangdong Good Rescue Branch. The local Polder Council also raised 300 million yuan in construction funds. Thus, this great project was laid the foundation on December 5 last year and was fully completed in early May of this year, taking a total of 15 months and costing more than 2.8 billion yuan. It mobilized 900,000 local laborers. Under the joint cooperation of the government and the people, this line of defense to protect people's livelihood was completed. From then on, the 200,000 acres of farmland would no longer be threatened by the floods of the East River, and the 600,000 villagers in the county would be able to settle down and make a living. This is not only the greatest achievement of Guangdong Province's reconstruction after the war, but also, according to the records of the Water Conservancy Commission, the largest farmland water conservancy project in China after the victory.

Great Embankment, Sixty Li Long

On May 11, Chairman Luo personally presided over the completion ceremony of the Ma'an Polder flood control project. The reporter followed to participate in the grand event and was able to see the entire picture of this great project: it is a long embankment, winding and flat, resembling the Great Wall; it is 60 Chinese li long, and the entire project involves 1.1 million cubic meters of earthwork. It can be divided into two sections: one starts from Ma'an Mountain, runs along the inner side of the Hui-Ping Highway, crosses Longpan, passes through Lin Village, Dahu Creek, and reaches Beng Mountain, then crosses Linjiang Drain and turns northeast to the bank of the East River, ending at Tanwu Mountain, with a length of 7,880 meters. The height of the embankment base is one meter higher than the flood level, the top width is two meters, and the inner and outer slopes are one to two. Among the various creeks and drains, Dahu Creek is the largest. The other section is the old embankment, which starts from Tanwu Mountain, runs along the bank of the East River, goes straight upstream, passes through Wannian Village, Shuikou Market, Pengying Village, and reaches Sanshan, with a length of 22.6 kilometers. It is the area through which the source of Dahu Creek flows and the only stream in the area that flows in from outside the area, originating about two kilometers from Heshanmen. There are a total of seven sluice gates along the embankment, all named in memory of the merits of the officials who planned and supervised the project and the assistance of various agencies. The largest of these is the Dahu Creek sluice gate, named "Ciwei Sluice" in memory of Chairman Luo's achievements. The others are "Ruifu Sluice," "Zhongnongwen Sluice," "Liangjiu Sluice," "Shanjiiu Sluice," "Wenlong Sluice," and "Qunxian Sluice." Except for the Qunxian Sluice at Heshanmen, which uses a vertical board type, the others are all roll-up types.

200,000 Acres of Fields Benefit

The engineer in charge of this project is Li Zefu, who has extensive experience in farmland water conservancy projects. He has been working on this project since 1942. According to his estimation, the value of this project is not only that it can protect 200,000 acres of farmland from floods, but it can also rely on the sluice gates to control the water volume, to accumulate the water in the lakes, ponds, creeks, and drains in the area and use it for irrigation. Therefore, the expected benefits of this project are as follows:

(1) Direct benefits of flood prevention - 150,000 mu of existing arable land can increase rice production by 300,000 dan and miscellaneous grains by 30,000 dan per year.

(2) Benefits of irrigation by using sluice gates to store the water volume of lakes and streams - Most of the above-mentioned 150,000 mu are interspersed with lakes, ponds, streams, and drains, and rice production can be increased by 50,000 dan and miscellaneous grains by 20,000 dan per year.

(3) Benefits of reclaiming wasteland by virtue of flood prevention - Reclaim more than 20,000 mu of large grassland in Mumachang and more than 20,000 mu of wasteland in other places. In the first year, rice production can be increased by about 100,000 dan and miscellaneous grains by 20,000 dan.

The total annual increase in rice production is 450,000 dan and miscellaneous grains 70,000 dan. This number is enough to bear a quarter of the total food shortage in the province. In today's severe food problem, this number has a lot of help for the allocation of food in the province!

Reclamation and Increased Production Still Need Effort

Indeed, this huge project has been completed, but there are still many problems in the future. As Chairman Luo said, "This is just the beginning of the work. This project is like a city wall, but we must maintain it well so that we will not allow the flood enemies to break through again; and how to make the farmland in the area benefit and produce a lot still depends on everyone's efforts." Indeed, the garden has been repaired, but this is only a passive way to prevent floods. To truly produce a lot, there must be a concrete plan and a large amount of manpower. At the same time, we cannot ignore the future distribution of land rights and interests, because the land price in the area will certainly rise with the completion of the project. Land disputes will be difficult to avoid in the future, so this depends more on the local government and enlightened gentry to deal with it fairly with a long-term vision, considering the majority of the people. All rights and obligations should be stipulated clearly, and they should be led to actively reclaim and increase production, so that this project can have real value, and the people can get permanent benefits after thousands of years.

### Impressions of Liu'an, Anhui

— Hefei, 8th Express News. Reporter Bao Baiping of this Newspaper

Shielding the southeast, with land and water routes open, this state is different from other states.

Mountains surround Yinghuo with a thousand layers of beauty, the land controls the Jianghuai with four hundred heroes.

— Wang Hong's poem about Liu'an Prefecture

When the spring rain half-soaked the reporter's clothes, the open car of the Anhui Highway Bureau finally completed the 101-kilometer journey, bringing the reporter from Hefei to Liu'an, an important town in western Anhui.

Liu'an is located on the eastern bank of the upper reaches of the Pai River, a tributary of the Huai River. From the central Anhui plain, it is already a small hilly area.

Ye Shi of the Song Dynasty wrote in "New School Records of Liu'an County": "Liu'an is the ancient state of Gaotao. More than four hundred years after its demise, Ying Bu (according to the Liu'an Prefecture Chronicle, Ying Bu was from Liu'an) helped Xiang Yu destroy it and then helped Han betray Chu, reigning over its land again." Now, 20 li east of Liu'an, next to the Liuhe Highway, there are the Gaotao Shrine and the Gaotao Tomb, and there is the Ying Bu Tomb in the city, but the wild grass and weeds have made it impossible to find the relics. This is just a legend, and the old people of Liu'an dare not determine its truth to the reporter.

Since the Ming Dynasty, Liu'an has been famous for its tea. "Huiliu Famous Tea," tea merchants have always used it as a sign to attract customers, and the name of Liu'an has also become particularly well-known because of this.

Abundant Products, Poor People

In 1931, a part of western Liu'an was划歸to the newly established Lihuang County. The county now has an area of 3,793 square kilometers, scattered with 700,000 people. In Anhui, compared to other counties, it ranks third in area and sixth in population. Located between mountains and plains, the highest temperature is 29.5 degrees Celsius, the lowest is 6.5 degrees Celsius, the average temperature throughout the year is 18 degrees Celsius, and the total rainfall is 904.9 mm. Under the excellent natural environmental conditions of the county's vast area, suitable temperature, and rainfall, it constitutes a wealthy county in Anhui. In the eyes of people engaged in county administration work, it is often considered an ideal place.

Among the 52 townships in Liu'an, strictly speaking, there are plains, hills, and mountains. Therefore, there are many kinds of products, the most famous being tea, hemp, bamboo, wood, rice, and wheat. According to not very accurate statistics, the annual tea production at its peak was more than 34,000 dan, and at its lowest was also more than 13,000 dan. The hemp production at harvest was 79,000 dan. The southwestern mountainous area is full of bamboo and wood, and the supply of rice and wheat for consumption in the county is more than sufficient. If you compare it with the small and poor counties, Liu'an can be said to be blessed by nature.

However, although Liu'an is rich in products, it is not self-sufficient today. The local products that the farmers have worked hard to harvest are transferred to the hands of merchants at the lowest cost and transported to other places to weave. The farmers are just holding on to a little surplus product to get through the years of hardship. They do not get the slightest enjoyment in life because of the wealth on their own land and are always groaning under the oppression of usury. Just more than 30 li away from Liu'an, the car that the reporter was riding in broke down, and I had the opportunity to see a resident's thatched shed by the roadside that didn't even have a door. You can imagine how bad their life is!

Copper Head, Iron Mouth, Tofu Accent

The reporter stepped into the streets of Liu'an, and the first impression was cleanliness and tranquility. The city wall was ordered to be demolished during the Anti-Japanese War, supposedly to facilitate guerrilla warfare if the Japanese army invaded. Liu'an was occupied for four months starting in July 1938. After the enemy withdrew, it has been free ever since. Because it is close to the occupied area of Hefei, it once had a great prosperity from 1939 to the time of victory. At that time, tea and hemp were smuggled out, and cloth and salt were smuggled in, so Liu'an took the "Anti-Japanese fortune," and it was very prosperous for a time. Today, there are many hotels and restaurants in Liu'an, which can be said to be the relics of the prosperity at that time, but now, all industries are depressed, and there is no bustling scene to be seen.

Liu'an has the saying "copper head, iron mouth, tofu accent," which describes the habits of the people of Liu'an. In Liu'an, whether it is cold or hot, few people wear hats when going out, which is called "copper head." Except for the hottest weather, people always put vegetables in a hot pot to eat throughout the year, which is called "iron mouth." Friends come and go, whether discussing matters or chatting, they like to lie on the bed or on the sleeping chair, which is called "tofu accent." When the reporter went to a restaurant in Liu'an for the first time, the waiter first served a hot pot, which contained braised fish that had already been cooked. At first, I was quite surprised. It was already late spring, so why still use a hot pot? Later, I learned that this was the local custom. However, the braised fish in the hot pot was very delicious while cooking and eating. Although it was the first time to try this way of eating, I was very satisfied. Compared to the mutton tripe hot pot in Chongqing in winter, it is even better.

### Dr. Li Peien Talks About Student Unrest

— Hangzhou, 12th Express News. Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Students of National Yingshi University, for the sake of the issue of school buildings and the president, petitioned the Ministry of Education, and, undeterred by hardship, travelled from Jinhua by train to Hangzhou, wanting to follow the Hangzhou-Shanghai and Shanghai-Nanjing Railways to Nanjing to appeal to the Ministry of Education. Here, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road was once interrupted, and disputes arose repeatedly. At this time, the reporter was on his way back to Hangzhou from Shanghai and was blocked in Jiaxing. After returning to Hangzhou, I visited Dr. Li Peien, president of Zhijiang University, and after a long discussion, we both agreed that the domestic academic atmosphere today is gradually declining. We have only seen people donating scholarships and building school buildings, but we have not seen anyone donating professors or donating instruments and books. The reason is probably that donating scholarships and building school buildings can get fame, while donating instruments and books and donating professors is nothing remarkable. But professors and equipment are the source of students' knowledge. The problem at Yingshi University this time is probably due to the lack of good professors and good equipment!

Postal Matters

Reply to the Returning Soldiers from Australia. Regarding your letter appealing for funds to return home, we have received a reply from the General Headquarters of the Joint Logistics Command stating: "Upon investigation, when the 303 soldiers of this group arrived in Shanghai on January 8th via Labul transport, this Headquarters, to show its appreciation for their loyalty, immediately ordered the First Supply Region Command and the Shanghai Garrison Command, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government and other organizations, to launch a慰勞慰劳 (consolation) campaign, hold a welcome meeting, prepare food and lodging, issue bonuses, and pay them three months' salary based on their original rank, as well as provide generous travel expenses and transportation to send most of the soldiers back to their hometowns. However, more than 20 people among them returned to Shanghai on their own halfway and worked as porters or laborers at the docks. Those who have failed to find work or have been squeezed out by labor unions are finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Under the current circumstances of financial hardship and meager treatment of the National Army (currently, the monthly salary of a combat soldier is only over 20,000 yuan), giving each of these soldiers tens of thousands or even two hundred thousand yuan at once was originally intended to express our sympathy for these soldiers who were captured during the war of resistance and stranded overseas, and urgently needed to be sent back to their hometowns. As for those who turned back halfway and voluntarily stayed in Shanghai, there is no way to arrange for their settlement. Upon receiving your letter, we have ordered the Shanghai Port Command to send personnel to properly persuade them to return home quickly, and will still provide transportation to send them away. This is a special reply for your information." Please be aware.

Reply to Mr. Feng Tianmo: Regarding your letter pointing out that the ticket sellers at Jiaxing Station lacked courtesy, we have received a reply from the Transportation Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration stating: "Upon investigation by the head of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Transportation Section, it was stated that the incident was due to passengers being unaware of the seat allocation for reserved train tickets, leading to a misunderstanding. On February 20th of this year, twelve passengers, holding official letters and travel permits, wanted to purchase twelve second-class tickets for the Jinling train to the North Station. At that time, the train was about to arrive at the station, and there were only seven second-class tickets left on the Jinling train. The ticket seller immediately explained the situation, stating that the remaining five tickets could only be changed to first class. However, the passengers did not understand the situation and thought it was a deliberate obstruction, leading to a dispute. The stationmaster then intervened to resolve the situation, and the passengers boarded the train. The ticket seller at the station did not show any discourtesy. After verification, the statement is factual. This is a special reply for your information."

### The Maid

— Chen Jiahua

She was a typical country woman. From her actions, her clothing, and her appearance, one could immediately tell that she was rustic.

Mother Wang introduced her, saying that she had three advantages: first, she was from the same hometown; second, she was honest; third, she had a particularly docile personality. However, after several days, I only discovered her honesty. Isn't so-called honesty just another name for stupidity!

For example, if the child cried, unless you told her to comfort him, she would continue to patiently mend the two worn-out sock bottoms, showing that she was very "capable." And when guests came, it was only after being repeatedly urged that she would pour tea. If you asked her to prepare a little snack, she would ask this and that, making it more troublesome than doing it yourself.

Her face also had a "blemish." My wife said that her husband was "pinned down" by her appearance. Because the muscles in her face were particularly developed, and sharp-looking, giving the impression of a nail. Because of this, the most mischievous of the three younger brothers nicknamed her "Nail." When she was called "Nail," she would stagger over. "What!" Her voice was low.

So everyone called her "Nail." "Nail," "Nail," and she would bustle around.

Not only was she foolish, but her eyes also seemed particularly dull. She had hardly ever done anything well enough to be praised. For example, if I wanted to change my clothes, she would always bring my wife's as well.

"You—these are Madam's!"

Sometimes I couldn't help but scold her, but she would still do the same. Even when she went to the market in the morning to buy some groceries, she would often mix up the oil bottle and the soy sauce bottle. It wasn't a big deal if cooking oil was put in the soy sauce bottle, but it was terrible when soy sauce was put in the cooking oil bottle. Even though my wife repeatedly instructed her, and even tied yellow and black threads around the bottle openings as markers, she still couldn't tell them apart.

It was even more troublesome when someone came to visit and we weren't home. She could only understand the dialect of Yuyao, her hometown. If someone from Shaoxing visited us, that was still alright; but if they weren't from Shaoxing, it would take at least half a day to get through to her.

One day, Jing from Beiping came to visit my wife. Jing asked, "Is Madam home?" but was turned away. Jing came again a second time, and was turned away again. On the third visit, it happened that my wife was standing at the door, and they finally met. The reason was that "Nail" only knew that there was a "Sir" and a "Madam" in the house, and didn't know of a "Mrs."

So my wife often complained, gritting her teeth and cursing:

"Really a nail, ruining everything."

Because she often did things that were very disappointing, one day, I talked to her for two hours. Although we were from the same hometown, I had been wandering away from home for many years, and my hometown accent was fading, so our conversation was very difficult.

Not only could Nail not understand what I was saying, but she also couldn't speak well. Besides "Yes, sir" and "I understand," she hardly made any other sounds. Originally, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk to her and correct her shortcomings, and tell her some common etiquette. But the result was truly both funny and exasperating.

My wife often clamored for me to change her, because she said, "This kind of person only adds to the trouble." But I could only tactfully persuade my wife to be patient, and do the necessary things ourselves.

The reason I persuaded my wife to be patient was that I found "Nail's" honesty particularly endearing. Although she wasn't as clever as the previous Zhang sister-in-law, she also wouldn't play tricks like Zhang sister-in-law. When Zhang sister-in-law went to the market, she would never return the small change from five or ten thousand yuan. "Padding the bill" was simply never an issue. She, on the contrary, might buy slightly inferior vegetables or not cook them well enough. But every day when she returned from the market, she would "report the accounts" to my wife. If she had more than a yuan, she would return it; if she was short a yuan, she would ask for it back. If she couldn't remember, she would get anxious and shout, "Madam, let me report it again." Even if my wife said, "Forget it, forget it," she wouldn't let it go. "Meat, five thousand," she would hold up her thumb; "Fish, one thousand five," she would hold up her index finger. She would do this until all five of her bent fingers were completely straightened, because we had limited the purchase to five kinds of vegetables each day.

After fully understanding her personality, my wife stopped scolding her. More important things were often done by my wife herself. So "Nail's" work changed from external duties to just teasing the newborn baby Mao'er, and looking after the house and doing laundry.

"Ah, ah, little master, don't cry, Mama is going to the market," when Mao'er cried, she would mutter in a heavy nasal tone, gently patting him.

Now, when someone came to visit us, she would also chime in with a word or two, or say, "Please leave a message!"

After a year, we regarded her as one of our own, and she got along well with the maids in the neighboring houses. Because of her honesty and frugality, my wife was also very happy. She often said, "Nail has been trained by us." And sometimes, she would talk to me a few words: "Sir," "Madam." Her pronunciation was already very clear, not as heavy and slurred as when she first came.

One day, she sobbed softly to my wife, saying that she wanted to go home. This sudden event caught my wife off guard. Having a degree of trust in her, my wife naturally tried to persuade her to stay, and asked her the reason for her resignation.

But she didn't say anything, and tears streamed from her eyes. When I returned from the newspaper office in the evening, her eyes were completely red and swollen.

"Madam, I'll come back after February," no amount of persuasion was useful. She finally left, leaving only this sentence.

On the third day after she left, I saw her in front of the door of a midwife. I was surprised that she hadn't gone home. She was carrying a blue cloth bundle in her hand. Behind her was a doorman from my neighbor Zhang's residence, called Old Jiang. When she saw me, she seemed very shy.

The next day, Old Jiang came to me in a fluster, wanting me to help a little, saying that "Nail" had died and he was preparing to buy a coffin.

My wife was frantic, asking him repeatedly.

"Miscarriage," Old Jiang stammered:

"Miscarriage?" my wife exclaimed, grabbing her head, looking incredulous.

Looking at Old Jiang's embarrassed expression, and thinking back to the scene of him and "Nail" walking into the midwife's house four or five days ago, I already knew the outline of this unfortunate story.

Sure enough, the next day, I saw a news item in my own newspaper, saying that a maid in a certain residence had died tragically due to an "abortion," and that the midwife and the related person Jiang Ayun had been arrested, and so on.

### Grapes and Swimming Fish

— Wang Yachen

### Cui Garden — Seventeenth of Yangzhou Dream

— Hong Weifa

A place where one played in childhood is always missed in middle age, when one is hurt by sorrow and joy. Occasionally returning to one's hometown and passing through that place, seeing that the scenery is completely different, it is easier to feel the vicissitudes of life. In the past, beside the collapsed city wall of Yangzhou's old city, there was originally a vast expanse of desolate smoke and weeds. At the end of the previous Qing Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Xuantong, someone built houses there and established the Datong Theater. For a time, the drums and gongs were loud and bustling, and ladies and gentlemen mingled. But it was short-lived. It soon met with the restoration. Then, the theater closed. The houses were eroded by wind and rain. Over time, they became dilapidated. Several years later, some people pooled funds to buy the land, enclose it with low walls, plant many trees, and build a small stage with artificial hills, calling it Cui Garden. At that time, the Lingnan Guild Hall in the Cangxiang Alley of the new city was nearby. There was a place for salt merchants to rest called Small Garden. In this Small Garden, people gathered for banquets every day. During the banquets, they would sing and select beauties, surrounded by jewels and greens, truly a place to lose one's soul. The establishment of Cui Garden seemed to have been greatly influenced by the Small Garden. However, the Small Garden remained a club for salt merchants until it closed, while Cui Garden was once open for selling tea. The pastries they sold were best with box cakes. Because the place was quite large, with few houses, and because the flowers and trees were sparse, it gave people a sense of being in the mountains and forests within the city. Near Cui Garden was a plank bridge leading to Willow Lane. This bridge was then named Cui Garden Bridge. However, the teahouse business in Yangzhou's old city never really flourished, so Cui Garden's tea sales soon followed in the footsteps of the theater and closed down.

After Cui Garden closed, it was once rented to Gao Zhou, a Japanese supervisor sent by the Yangzhou Salt Affairs Inspectorate. Because Gao Zhou found it inconvenient to travel back and forth to Xiaoban Bridge by carriage, the bridge was changed to a brick bridge. When the Inspectorate built a new house and Gao Zhou left Yangzhou, Cui Garden became a very deserted place again. Before Cui Garden existed, I used to fly kites there with my little friends. After Cui Garden opened as a teahouse, I also went with my parents to drink tea. When Gao Zhou resided there, although the lights were on, the doors were always closed. Occasionally passing through that place, one could only look at the swaying trees and scattered pavilions inside through the short wall.

Who knew that Cui Garden would change owners again during the period of the Japanese occupation? For a time, construction was in full swing, and Cui Garden was rebuilt to be extremely luxurious, becoming a private garden. Because the new owner was Xiong Yubeng, Cui Garden was renamed Heng Garden, and even Cui Garden Bridge had someone inscribe the name on the bridge, changing it to Heng Garden Bridge. After the victory, Heng Garden was repeatedly borrowed by military organizations. It is said that it was going to be changed to the County Council, so Heng Garden would become a historical term. As for Heng Garden Bridge, it has recently been restored to its original name, Cui Garden Bridge, but Cui Garden is gone. All the scenery of Cui Garden is just leaving a memory for a group of middle-aged people.

It is said that when Cui Garden was changed to Heng Garden, there were two extremely precious peonies in the garden, one red and one white. Each time they bloomed, they had hundreds of flowers and trunks as thick as bowls. They were hundreds of years old. They were originally planted in the Flower Kingdom of a certain Chen in Dongguan, and were later moved here by Xiong. After Xiong left Yangzhou, the whereabouts of these two enormous peonies were unknown. Whether they flourished, withered, survived, or died, no one could find out. Perhaps they encountered the same destruction as Cui Garden.

### Seasons

— Li Bai

Two

The seasons are about to make people old

Among the trivial mountains and fine grass

Autumn sounds like an old traveler pacing into the country

I remember that the small garden is full of sunset

Magpies are noisy on the birch trees all day long

At this moment, the building is empty and people are gone

Where is the old lotus fragrance left

Is the summer shirt of June already worn out

I only miss the past years

You come and go

Hasty travelers in the mountains

What year and month will you come back to stop at this small garden

Let white hair adorn the sparse stars

You are like ethereal white clouds in the sky

Never have the joy of revisiting the old place

Although this place has the beauty of lakes and mountains

There is nowhere to stop for you

In the eighth month of Xiaoxiang, you will come again with the mountain rain.

(1939, Hunan)

### Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry

— Zhu Wen

Guan Xiu's "White Orchid" from the "Grass Poetry Medicine After Whistling" collection, such as the poem about willow catkins: "Embracing lightness, it is suitable everywhere, drifting with the wind and falling into the clear stream. The setting sun shines on the fisherman's blurred gaze, surpassing the plum blossoms of Yuling," the poem is quite exquisite, but it does not escape the air of rouge and powder, weaving flattery.

"Middle age has countless sorrows and joys, unbearable to see the golden hairpin in dreams. Long knowing that becoming a lowly daughter was my mistake, I only feel that giving birth to a son is as difficult as giving birth to you; I am saddened tonight to meet in vain, pondering the past events that want to break the liver, even if I momentarily recognize the illusion of floating foam, I am lonely and happy with a solitary pillow and a dim lamp." This is Qian Qianyi's lament for his deceased daughter A Qing. Poetry should originate from emotion, and Qian's poem especially comes from deep affection.

Weng Tonghe, a scholar of the Grand Secretariat, was purely a scholar through poetry. From commentaries on the Confucian classics to textual research in history and biographies, and the combing of inscriptions on metal and stone, all are permeated in his poems. Hong Liangji lamented Weng's poetry, saying: "Most happy to hear him talk about examples of metal and stone, slightly disliking that the public has little spiritual poetry," which is also a sound argument. I once saw his "Shizhou Poetry Talks," a collection of eight volumes, which were the notes taken when the scholar discussed poetry with his colleagues when he was inspecting education in Guangdong. Shi Yushan said that his purpose in discussing poetry is like a builder who lays out the tiles, bricks, wood, and stones, and builds up from the ground, which is very different from the magnificent Hua Yan towers.

Dai Liang, also known as Shushu of Pujiang, lived during the late Yuan dynasty, with unusual integrity and firmness. Even when he was rugged and blocked, he did not slightly frustrate his ambition. He was truly a loyal and righteous person. His poems were vast and cool, with passionate voices, mostly with the sound of the Zheng scale. For example, in the first verse of "Yingqiu": "Empty moats and abandoned ramparts surround Yingqiu, a desolate sight makes me sad. Bestowing shoes and conferring marquises remain for thousands of years, entrusting the cause to rest here at this time; crows crow in the ancient trees in the west, geese fall on the plains in the autumn of the North Sea. Looking back at the more than ten thousand miles of Jiangnan, who am I leaving this foreign land for?"

Poetry is indeed sick with clichés, but the ability to push the old and bring forth the new does not lead to inferiority. Such as in the fifth and sixth couplet in one verse of the casual meeting of a hermit of Jiuling Mountain. The sentences say: "Hundred years of world affairs are like vinegar flies, one night's homesickness makes the leopard weep." According to 醯雞 is 蠛蠓, a tiny insect. Zhuangzi: "Qiu's relationship to the Way is like a vinegar fly?" Xie leopard is Du Yu, a bird name. Qin Jing says: "Du Yu cries bitterly, then hangs himself on a tree, calling himself 'to leopard'."

Zhang Shunmin of the Song dynasty used the tune "Relying on the Voice of Selling Flowers" to write about Yueyang Tower: "Mu Hua descends from Junshan, the empty water is full of paintings, carefully gathering beautiful faces. Not for the departing guests of the west of the city, stop singing Yangguan, drunk sleeves caress the dangerous waves, the sky is light and the clouds are idle, who can get to revisit this road? Looking back at the setting sun in the red canopy, it should be Chang'an." The writing is bold and healthy, close to that of Old Slope. Later generations especially love to recite the second sentence of the fourth verse, but they do not know that these two sentences come from Bai Letian's poem "Yueyang Tower": "When the spring bank is green, the dream Ze is transported, and when the evening waves are red, it is near Chang'an." The Wenxian Tongkao records that Shunmin had a "Painting Field Collection" of one hundred volumes and memorial of ten volumes, but since the Ming dynasty, they have been scattered and lost. Only the eight volumes collected and printed from the Yongle Encyclopedia are preserved today.

Zhang Lei's lament over his son's death says: "Is it that the doctor could not find the right prescription? Or is it that his life had a short length? Is it only you who can make me so sad? Or do all fathers love their sons? The skull is flat and the forehead is smooth, the eyebrows are beautiful and the eyes are clear, now that he exists or is dead, is he still a ghost? If there is nothing, then what do I still think about? If he still has knowledge, then who will look after him in the desolate house and wild temple, in the wind, frost, rain, and dew?" This is a folk song with true feelings revealed, which cannot be faked, unlike chanting about the wind and playing with the moon, which can be dressed up and made up.

Wei Chengxiao's poem says: "Today's world is full of people with 褦襶子, touching the heat and going to people's houses." The dictionary says 褦２, pronounced nai dai, originally refers to the cool hat worn in summer months, with a green painting to decorate its eaves to block the sun. Now people who do not know what they are doing are called 褦襶. Recently, while reading Zhang Lei's poems, I also found the sentence "often being disturbed by 褦襶惊午梦," which I think is taken from Cheng's poem. Li Bai's "Sending Wangwu Mountain People Back to the Mountain" says: "In May, create my words, knowing that I am not a suitable person." Weng Fanggang said that the sound and meaning of 佁儗 are similar to 褦襶, and Li Bai also used Cheng's poem. In fact, the poem by Li Gongfeng used Sima Xiangru's "Ode to the Great Man": "沛艾赳螑，仡以佁儗." 怡 is read as Chi, and 儗 is read as Ni. The phrase "touching the heat" was later used in Guan Hanqing's "Xie Tianxiang Zaju," in the first fold there is a cloud: "I went to this touch is also like an official's line to make etiquette."

Kui Lv Sui records Yang Wanli's words, saying that Fei Xian's poems are natural, which is indeed a definite theory. Fei Xian was a man of the Southern Song Dynasty, so he was called Zhang Lei. He wrote "Kuo Shan Collection" in fifty volumes, with poems accounting for more than half. In the regulated verses, such as the couplet "Autumn Excitement": "Good trees have carved this year's leaves, the west wind is still last year's autumn"; "He Liulangzhong Shuzhou Qian'an": "Wild cranes avoid people's nests in ancient trees, Qing apes ride the moon and howl in the cold"; "Summer Day" says: "Butterfly clothes bask in powdered flowers at noon, spider webs add silk to the corners of the house on a clear day"; "He Zhou Kangyan" says: "The new moon has grown outside the flying birds, and the setting sun is more in the west of the sunset." The style of the poems is fresh and natural, and those who are not good at observing things cannot produce this.

### Between Life and Death

— Ye Cao

When my illness became critical, my third brother sent a car and Ya Meng to take me to the hospital. Although my mind was often disturbed by pain at that time, my mood was unexpectedly clear, but my limbs were already weak and powerless. I wanted to do something or say something, but my heart was willing but my strength was not enough.

If I had gone to see a doctor five or six days earlier, not only could the surgery have been performed at any time, but the pain could also have been reduced, and it would not have been so dangerous. This was entirely due to my own procrastination. At first, I didn't expect it to be appendicitis, and I wanted to have it checked, but I didn't have any money.

Lying on the hospital bed, I didn't sleep all night. The diligent nurses would come to check my temperature every now and then, and change the ice pack every moment. I opened my eyes and looked at the sorrow on their faces. They were whispering, and I seemed to hear some unfavorable words. I knew that a small sign saying "No Food Allowed" had been hung on my bed rail. Terrifying doubts kept echoing in me. I had a premonition of my end, and my mind collapsed instantly!

I regretted that I didn't ask a friend to write a will for me when I could still speak a few days ago. Isn't such a death equivalent to a kind of pitiful escape? There are many things I still want to say.

A few days later, my pain eased and my mind was unusually comfortable. I thought, maybe this is a person's last reflection before death, but dying like this, like a dream, is also very peaceful. For me, it can be regarded as an ethereal detachment - I waited, I was about to see another world! So natural, I was not distressed at all, waiting quietly for the exchange between life and death!

My realm was clear and peaceful, without any disturbance. Everything in the world was isolated from me. I looked again and again, but I couldn't think of anything. Quiet night, in this quiet night my soul would leave my body!

Five hundred cc of saline solution was being injected, and I woke up. I realized that I was still alive, and that there was hope of living. On the bedside table were gifts and flowers sent by relatives and friends. The doctors and nurses all had smiles on their faces, asking me if the pain had stopped and how I was sleeping. I nodded slightly, indicating that I was okay.

A ray of sunlight was shining on my bedding, making people feel the arrival of spring. After a while, Ya Meng came, and my third brother also came, followed by many relatives and friends. They talked about the experiences of many people with appendicitis, how they got it, how they had surgery, and how they recovered, never mentioning the word "death." I knew they were giving me encouragement in spirit, and I also felt endless warmth. They hoped that I would live, looking at me and listening to me speak. And I have had more than thirty years of real feeling for the meaning of life; the joy of life can only be experienced and enjoyed by those who are alive!

The desire for life reoccupied my soul, and I continued to live! Although I had already had the experience of death, it was so peaceful, so natural.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 512

— Ye Jingfeng

"Admirable, admirable!" Tsurumi complimented the young lady with phrases like praising a little tiger. "Your boxing skills are very high."

"It doesn't matter!" She said lightly, but with a face full of smiles; she also sat back down in her original seat and placed the pistol she had taken out on the small round table next to her.

"I have two more questions to ask!"

"Very good, very good," Tsurumi also sat down, took out a handkerchief and wiped himself, "You may continue to enlighten me."

"Don't take offense: I want to ask, are you really Chinese, or Japanese?"

"Ha..." Tsurumi, upon hearing this sudden question, gave a dry laugh, like an old man with a full beard being asked by a naive child, "Why are there so many hairs on your face?" A similar situation; to explain it carefully would not only involve many profound theories and waste words, but it also might not convince this curious child. However, after letting out a dry laugh, his face immediately covered with a miserable and unhappy expression; because this question stirred his thinking mechanism, and immediately felt like a sharp thorn, suddenly piercing deep into his heart, and he immediately felt pain throughout his body.

This thorn touched his sense of identity; he strongly yearned for his mother, whom he had never met, and recalled his father, who had worked hard for national affairs, fell ill from overwork, and passed away halfway without fulfilling his ambitions. He yearned for his lonely life in a foreign land as a child, although he had the love of his adoptive mother Meiko, the care of Tsurumi Kiyoshi, the kindness of Little Source's wife, and the affection of his sibling Kikuko, there were still all kinds of uncoordinated hues naturally produced in the depths of his heart; this was impossible to console.

He also felt a inexplicable terror from this young lady's question; because from the tone of this young lady's speech, he could deduce that many other "friends" who had contacted or had not contacted him, how could he know that they did not have the same thoughts about his background? In everyone's mind? How could this "!" not evolve into a kind of "guess that is embarrassing to ask, and impossible to dispel doubts without asking"?

Tsurumi's nature was indeed upright and unrestrained, but even with such a sharp barb piercing straight into his heart, he could not help but feel miserable. Even other so-called magnanimous men of outstanding character, encountering similar pain, would not fail to have the same sensitivity as Tsurumi, but he seemed to feel it in his heart, and only remained silent on the surface. If he truly had no feeling, then he would be a person with a numb heart, and if his heart was numb, what kind of outstanding man would he be? Wouldn't he just be a fool?

Moreover, Tsurumi's childhood and adolescence were entirely formed in a narrow-minded Japanese social habit, it would be difficult for him to be particularly detached from the scope of this acquired educational force, and to achieve a very open-minded and unattached state, it would be a bit unbelievable. At this time, hearing this strange young lady's question, he couldn't help but feel a burst of pain in his heart. However, he didn't want to use words to analyze himself. He knew that the more he analyzed, the more he would cause suspicion, he wanted to use an objective way to prove it. Just as he hadn't grasped an objective way, the telephone bell in the room suddenly broke the awkward and dull situation.

### Strange "Unnecessary War"

— Leike

Former British Prime Minister Churchill recently delivered a speech when he accepted the city charter in Edinburgh, Scotland, declaring that World War II was the easiest war to prevent of all wars. He also recalled his conversation with the late US President Roosevelt in 1943: Roosevelt asked what name should be given to this war. Churchill replied, "The Second World War should be called an 'unnecessary war'." We don't know what the original words were, but judging from the report that translated it as "unnecessary war," it can be seen that the Chinese translation is not far from its original meaning.

Churchill's statement is admirable because he is not a hero who boasts about past achievements. Because if World War II was indeed an unnecessary thing, then his efforts to support the critical situation and help Britain through the crisis at that time would become an insignificant relic. It is strange why he held such a view of World War II, and even spoke so frankly to Roosevelt, the leader of the Allied countries, while the war was still in progress. Roosevelt, with his great mind, would not necessarily feel insulted by this, but old Churchill's thoughts were probably seen through. Old Churchill simply did not take the enemy seriously.

However, to the Chinese who fought for eight years against the Japanese, this sentence always feels insulting to the countless soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear who shed blood and sweat in this war, especially insulting to the sacred significance of our Chinese resistance to aggression and struggle for liberation. We were forced to take up arms to resist, and there was absolutely no expediency involved. This national self-defense war is completely different from Churchill's so-called easy or difficult to prevent.

Having said that, Churchill's words also have a warning effect. He made the fruits of victory worthless, so what about us? Have we thrown it in a corner and let it rot? If so, then how is our attitude any different from his sweeping negation? Perhaps they are just stubborn words from an old man, but in reality, they are cherishing and fully utilizing these fruits.

This is a terrible sentence. It was publicly spoken by a bold old man two years after the victory. It negates the significance of World War II. We must not let the mentality of this sentence spread, because this is ultimately not a question of whether it should or should not be said!

Free Talk

### Angola is Haunted

— You Jin

A few days ago, the Central News Agency's dispatch from Ankara, Turkey, reported the news of haunting in the British Embassy in Turkey. The original text was vivid and detailed. The general idea was that the residence of Lieutenant Colonel Ashley, the army attaché of the embassy, was originally built on a cemetery. Under the house, there was the tomb of a Muslim pastor, who seemed to be protesting from underground from time to time, making the house a haunted house, and even making the temporary homeowner - the beautiful wife of that lieutenant colonel, hear the ghost's voice, see the ghost's color (an old man in white), and even talk to the ghost. It was said so vividly, as if it were true.

If this kind of ghost story happened in a Muslim family that believes in ghosts and gods, or among the native Turks, it would not be a new thing. The strangest thing is that it happened in the official residence of an important figure in the diplomatic corps, and in the home of a British person who believes in science and does not believe in ghosts and monsters, which made friends who believe in souls argue strongly.

It is said that I have read Dr. Wu Qianfang's book on souls, and the newspaper also recorded that when his family took a photo, his wife, who had been dead for many years, suddenly appeared in the photo, and other strange news.

Not many days later, I found a book translated by Mr. Meng Xiancheng called "Ghost Language" in an old bookstore, which recorded many strange stories of communicating with ghosts. These are all new ghost stories of the 20th century, which Pu Songling never had. Metaphysics seems to be on the rise, but it will soon be defeated by the most realistic science.

In fact, seeing ghosts in broad daylight should be "commonplace" in this world of man-made ghostly shadows, and it is not just Angola that is haunted.

Everyone has seen the famous movie "The Blue Angel", right? The story takes place in a haunted house, which scares a young and beautiful wife to death. But the ghost in that house was originally played by the male owner who could perform magic tricks.

In this world, there are more ghosts than people. Ghosts are people, and people are ghosts. Ghosts are the returning, so why bother to distinguish between people and ghosts?

I also make such associations and inferences about the ghosts in the official residence of British Lieutenant Colonel Ashley in Ankara, because it is too similar to the plot in "The Blue Angel".

The opening phrase of each paragraph of the Islamic Koran often has the sentence "God drives away demons and ghosts". In fact, it should be changed to "God drives away people", that would be the right thing to do.

### Jiang Ying Solo Concert — Famous Lyric Soprano

— Sheng He

May is the season of music. The recent Shanghai music scene appears so prosperous and active. Following the second performance of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music held a grand concert of teachers and students on the 18th and 19th of this month. However, an even more noteworthy solo concert - the solo concert of Ms. Jiang Ying, a famous lyric soprano, will be held at the Lyceum on the 31st of this month. This is her first solo concert in Shanghai. I would like to recommend this famous Chinese lyric soprano, who recently returned from the European music scene, to the Shanghai music audience with excitement. Ms. Jiang Ying is the third daughter of the late famous Chinese military expert Mr. Jiang Baili. She has been fond of music since she was a child. She studied at McTyeire School in this city. In the spring of 1936, she traveled to Europe with her father. In 1937, she entered the Berlin Conservatory of Music for further study, and graduated in 1942. Then, she studied sacred music with Duari, a modern sacred music singer with a very famous Jiang. Just in time for the fierce European war, she transferred to Switzerland. On the one hand, she specialized in Wagner's opera with Koga, an expert in Wagner's opera, and served as Koga's teaching assistant; on the other hand, she also entered the Zurich Conservatory of Music, learning theory from Persky. Between 1944 and 1945, she was invited to participate in the International Music Festival for performance because of her excellent grades.

She has been specializing in music art in Europe for more than ten years. After returning to China this time, Mr. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, specially introduced her to the cultural figures of this city at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 4:30 pm on the 16th of this month. Under the enthusiastic welcome and invitation of everyone, she sang two moving songs on the spot - an aria from the opera "Carmen" and Schubert's "Song of Eternal Life". The tone is clear and beautiful, the pronunciation is clear, and it is full of expression, revealing exquisite cultivation and attainments.

The solo concert is scheduled to be held at the Lyceum on the 31st of this month. This is her first concert after returning to China. The program includes famous songs and famous opera works from Germany, Italy, and France. Mr. Magolins, a famous professor at the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music, will be in charge of the accompaniment. We expect that this solo concert will introduce an outstanding soprano to the Shanghai music scene, and her singing will surely attract a wide audience.

### Talking About Relief Supplies

— Zhongyuan

After the end of World War II, the most benefited people in the world were the relief supplies distributed by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the affected countries around the world. There are many types of such relief supplies, including not only the necessities of clothing, food, and housing, but also machinery, vehicles, medicines, etc., which can be said to be all-encompassing.

It is not known what happened to these relief supplies after they were transported to other countries. In China, the Executive Yuan Relief Committee and local branches managed this matter. The various situations are often seen in the newspapers, so there is no need to say more. Here, I will only talk about some common relief supplies received by general public and educational personnel and school institutions.

These common relief supplies are mainly clothing and food.

First, let's talk about clothing: The clothes distributed by the Relief Administration are of course mostly old clothes, but in my opinion, old clothes can be divided into two categories. One category is probably donated by the American people, which is more mixed, including men's suits, overcoats, shirts, women's coats, pants, long skirts, valuable to leather coats, and awkward to broken socks. The other category is old military uniforms of American soldiers, wool, khaki, cloth, and khaki dresses worn by American women in military service, all in one style and one color, which are more uniform. Of the two categories of old clothes, the former is more practical although it is mixed, especially things that can keep warm such as suits and overcoats. Last year, I lived in a certain city in Zhejiang, and saw the county government distributing old clothes to all public and educational personnel in the county. In order to ensure that the quality was not uneven, they used a lottery method. As a result, those who had good luck drew suits and overcoats, and those who had bad luck drew broken socks and broken hats. An old gentleman even drew a "sanitary belt", which made people laugh and cry, it can be said to be a "prank". As for the old military uniforms, some were so tattered that they could only be used as shoe pads, and some were very new and could be worn, but foreign soldiers were tall, and Chinese people looked like "flies hiding in bean pods" after wearing them, which was not very elegant. There is another troublesome thing: those old military uniforms were marked with "buttons returned", because the buttons had the American national emblem, and people from other countries could not wear them, but that kind of button was crimped on with a machine, and it was impossible to remove them unless the clothes were cut into a hole. It is said that several poor people were reluctant to cut the clothes, did not remove the buttons, and wore them on the street. When they were seen by American soldiers, they were forced to take them off, and they were slapped twice. I don't know if this is true? If it is true, it is also sad.

Let's talk about food again. The variety of food distributed by the Relief Administration is simply amazing. In addition to the main staples of rice, wheat, and beans, the iron-headed foods piled up like mountains are really dazzling. Milk, meat, fruits, sugar, sauce, ... It really takes three days and three nights to count them all! Of course, these foods are all delicious and nutritious, and they are all urgently needed by a group of poor, sick, and weak people, but after eight years of war, there are really too many poor, sick, and weak people, and a drop in the bucket is of no help. Last year, when I was in Zhejiang, I saw a certain charity organization received ten boxes of beef, and suddenly seven or eight hundred miserable people crowded at the door and refused to leave. The host had no choice but to give each of them a dish to "taste the flavor".

### Secrets Secrets

— Guo

Lily: "Ruth told me that you told her about that secret that I told you not to tell her."

Peggy: "She's such a despicable thing! I told her not to tell you."

Lily: "Yes, I told her I wouldn't tell you what she told me, so don't tell her that I told you."

### Starting with Glass Chopsticks

— A Lin

If you inspect the citizens of this city, everyone has at least one nylon product, even the most plain person, he will have a glass comb or a glass toothbrush. As for being a modern lady, she can be fully equipped with "plastic" (Plastic). From glass stockings to glass pins. Originally, plastic industrialists had already said that this is a plastic era, but it can occupy our department stores, but no one would have thought that it would also penetrate into our Eastern way of life.

Two days ago, the United Press sent a telegram from Seattle, saying that a company called Fanlagong Plastic Products Company is now manufacturing glass chopsticks with a gray steel machine, which can produce twelve chopsticks per minute. The chopsticks are light as feathers, bright in color, and will not change shape at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of this batch of chopsticks will be sold in China, competing with Chinese handicraft chopsticks. Therefore, just as other nylon products are popular among Chinese people, the United Press reporter finally predicted that it will be popular in the Far East.

After reading this telegram, there is one sentence that is chilling, which is that it will compete with Chinese handicraft chopsticks. When our national industry is still full of handicraft colors, this sentence has too many threats. We believe that once glass chopsticks come to the East, our bamboo chopsticks and artificial ivory chopsticks will be eclipsed, because these beautiful glass chopsticks are indeed made by a gray steel machine, as specially pointed out by the United Press reporter, which is both beautiful and hygienic.

If the United Press reporter sent this telegram not to promote Fanlagong Company in advance, then he must be warning our chopstick-making workers to change careers with sympathy. Look, this is a typhoon signal. It predicts that our Eastern life has collapsed, starting from the Western industry manufacturing Eastern chopsticks. Mr. Lu

### Anecdotes of Grand Historian Yu Biyun

— Lu Shi

The Grand Historian's name is Jieqing, and he is from Deqing, West Zhejiang. He was born in the Tongzhi year of Wuchen, so his nickname is Along. He is the grandson of Yu Yue, the great Confucian of the late Qing Dynasty, and the father of Mr. Pingbo, a modern literary figure. He was born with an extraordinary talent, short in body and fair in skin, with a particularly large head and hands that could reach his knees, so there was a legend that he was the reincarnation of an arhat. In the Guangxu year of Wuxu, he was the third place in the first class, and was selected as a Tan Hua (third place in the imperial examination) and edited in the Hanlin Academy and was later sent to Sichuan as the chief examiner. Afterwards, he encountered misfortune, and his career was not prominent. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, he had no intention of serving as an official. He lived in the old capital as a lodger and is still alive and well. Mr. Lan Xunqing is like the only survivor of the Jia Dynasty.

Before the war, the Grand Historian came to the South to sweep tombs and resided in Yulou on the West Lake for about half a month. His beard and eyebrows were as white as snow, very similar to the old god of longevity in the painting. Only the maid Xueer served him on the left and right. Xueer was graceful and skilled in poetry and painting. The Grand Historian's brushstrokes were delicate and weak, and Xueer imitated them with lifelike skill. Half of those who asked the Grand Historian to paint were done by this beautiful woman. That month, they floated on a painted boat in the depths of the lake and mountains at night. The Grand Historian played Kunqu opera, and Xueer played the flute. Tourists came to watch the spectacle. The Grand Historian was not recognized, and the next day, Hangzhou spread the news that immortals had descended, which was also a beautiful story of the West Lake.

In his later years, he lived in Beiping and encountered political upheavals and wars. He stopped writing. He has a hundred poems of wandering immortals, borrowing stories from Xiang Zhangshuo, etc. He describes the love between men and women in the world with the utmost tenderness and flamboyant charm. One day, Mr. Pingbo will edit and publish them. Then, there will be another style in the history of Chinese literature.

### Art and Literature Circle

Ms. Tang Yunyu's oil painting exhibition has been held on the second floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road. Since the week of the exhibition, the audience has been enthusiastic and well received. In response to the requirements of all parties, a special extension will be held on the 19th (Monday).

Wu Zuguang's mythological farce "Catching Ghosts" has been published by Kaiming Bookstore.

### The Business Philosophy of Taer Monastery

— Li Puyuan

There was such a thing in Xining: A department store opened by a Han or Hui person. One day, a Kazak went to buy cloth. Because of the language barrier, the shopkeeper stretched out five fingers to explain the price of one foot of cloth. The buyer shook his head and took out five silver dollars to pay the price. At that time, the price of Xining silver dollars was 17 legal currency to one. A comrade told the author the story, and I said: "This is not necessarily the shopkeeper wanting to deceive ethnic minorities, but the language is to blame!"

Before and after the Taer Monastery sunning scriptures, not only food, British goods, Indian goods, Tibetan goods, and inland goods are all based on the regulations of Rushar, and are set up next to the main road, with tents of about 15 feet square, one after another to welcome people from various races, various accents, and various costumes. They swarm to buy things all day long. Even on the entire small mountain where love songs are sung, people who buy and sell livestock are scattered everywhere.

It was a clear and bright afternoon. I went west from Wenhua Town with one or two comrades and walked up the mountain from another convenient path. Before my panting had settled, I saw a strange thing. In front of me was a livestock market. Mongolian sheep, Tibetan sheep, cattle, Tibetan horses, and Qinghai mules were all tied with a rope, one end tied around the neck of the livestock and the other end fixed on the green grass on the ground - the appearance was very funny, as if the livestock would be blown away by the wind. Next to the livestock, there were Kazaks, Tibetans, Mongols ... all kinds of businessmen. Among them, there was one who was in his twenties, thin, of medium build, with a very good complexion and a pair of quite intelligent big eyes. He seemed to have been seen in Rushar before. He was also squatting there, bargaining with a Tibetan who was selling Tibetan sheep. This person spoke Tibetan very well. When he reached into the sleeve of the sheep owner's white felt sheepskin robe, his movements attracted our attention. We were watching them.

Talking in words that we couldn't understand at all, he whispered to the Tibetan wearing a white felt hat for a long time. Then, he happily asked a few sentences in Turkish to another Hui. The Hui seemed very happy too, and immediately took out legal currency of ten yuan from his waist pocket and handed it to the sheep owner through him. The Tibetan's facial expression was very surprised, and he spoke in Tibetan, wanting to return the money. However, the young broker refused to accept it, and seemed to be satirizing him, mocking him. The sheep owner was angry. Since the money was given to the broker and he refused to accept it, he threw it on the ground and immediately pulled the rope of the Tibetan sheep and squatted there. The broker seemed to want to use force, but when he saw us wearing straw-woven uniforms, he retreated!

We understood his feelings and slipped to the department store stalls on the other side of the mountain. All the way, I thought of the five fingers and five silver dollars of Xining.

At a cloth stall, I asked about the price of a piece of British serge. He said: "Selling it to the Tibetans is 60 national currency, if you want it, sir, I'll give it to you for 30!" But, just as a group of female chieftains from the Yushu area came, we felt embarrassed for the cloth merchant and did not dare to make a deal, and quickly walked to the second store!

Ah, the business philosophy of Taer Monastery! How can you convince the ethnic minorities in the border areas!
