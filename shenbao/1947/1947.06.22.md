### Conflicts in the Woodcut World

— Xu Weinan

Woodcut art has become very popular recently. The Soviet Union, Britain, and France have repeatedly held exhibitions of their woodcuts in various parts of our country. China's woodcut circles are not lonely either; there have been several joint woodcut exhibitions, and several well-produced woodcut books have also been published. However, in today's bustling woodcut world, I have discovered a huge contradiction, which I find very strange and distressing, and simply cannot explain.

Woodcut history originated earliest in China, and its techniques are the most advanced, as can be proven by the "Beiping Stationery" published by Lu Xun and Zheng Zhenduo. In my humble opinion, China's old woodcuts have already reached their peak, and are in no way inferior to the great woodcut masters of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. However, there are reportedly not many Chinese woodcut masters (traditionally called artisans, not inferior) left in Peiping, and their livelihoods are becoming unsustainable. How strange it is that these woodcut artisans with excellent skills are finding themselves without food to eat amidst the prevailing trend of woodcut art in China! Their names and their work are almost completely being erased and forgotten.

Those who promote woodcut art and engage in the "wood movement" only know how to learn from the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, but they neglect China's own woodcuts, which have already reached their peak. What is the reason for this?

Some say that China's old woodcuts are only technically exquisite but lack consciousness, but I simply don't understand what this means. Let's not talk about British and French woodcuts, but only about Soviet woodcuts. Not every Soviet woodcut has a communist consciousness. For example, multi-colored flower prints, as exquisite as oil paintings, are considered masterpieces by the Soviet Union and are exhibited everywhere. There were also several of these in a recent exhibition at the Shanghai YMCA in May. Everyone who saw them was amazed, but what consciousness is there in the paintings? Besides admiring the woodcut technique, I really can't find any consciousness.

The Soviet Union considers multi-colored woodcut flower prints to be outstanding and exhibits them, while China's woodcut circles reject the old multi-colored woodcut flower prints for their lack of consciousness. In comparison, it's truly both laughable and lamentable.

During his lifetime, Lu Xun printed the "Beiping Stationery" on the one hand and introduced woodcuts from various countries on the other. He was inclusive, embracing both the new and the old, and completely impartial. People engaged in the woodcut movement today only want half of Lu Xun, and would rather send the other half of Lu Xun to hell. This is extremely unfair.

I have no prejudice against the efforts of modern woodcut circles; I only admire them. However, I feel truly saddened by the fact that the great woodcut masters of Peiping are being forgotten and abandoned. Moreover, judging by the history and achievements of woodcut art, we cannot but pay deep respect to the old woodcut masters in Peiping and elsewhere.

### Starting from Mu Seal Script

— Qian Shouzh

This newspaper has repeatedly published articles about the writing on seals. Did the two gentlemen, Qi Chongjian and Hua, have some discussions about Mu Seal Script, the former using "Mu" as "Miu," and the latter considering Xiaozhuan (small seal script) to be the work of Cheng Miao? One explains it with the ancient connection between "Miu" and "Miu," and the other considers it a copying error or a mistake. Actually, there is no need to argue about any of this. However, this matter all started from quoting the preface to the "Shuowen Jiezi." But whether the "Shuowen" book's claim that Qin script had eight styles and Han script had six styles is reliable is a major question. I feel that there are aspects of the "Shuowen" that one cannot but believe and aspects that one cannot fully believe, so I am also participating with some opinions, not to join a war of words, but just to discuss with knowledgeable gentlemen.

The "Hanshu Yiwenzhi" and the preface to the "Shuowen" both say that Cheng Miao created clerical script. Cai Yong, Wang Can, Qian, Zhang Huai'guan, Wei Heng, and Xu Kai all explain the origin and shape of clerical script. From this, we can know that clerical script is a square or rectangular font, different from the long, rounded shape of large and small seal script. Its strokes are also more liberated and convenient than small seal script. If we compare the imperial edict plaques of the First Emperor and the Second Emperor, the distinction between seal and clerical script is very clear. However, the shape of the script changes at any time and place due to the limitations of the objects, status, and number of characters being made. Therefore, the small seal script characters on the First Emperor's edict tiles and measuring instruments are round and square, while the Qin seal characters, although limited by the square frame, are mostly long. The characters on the stone carvings of Mount Tai and Langya are all long. The characters on Han seals come in square, flat, and rectangular shapes, mostly with clerical intentions. The inscriptions on the Han Yang Kitchen Ding and Cheng'an Palace Ding are in clerical script, while the 　文　and 趾下 inscriptions on the Yan Zu Deng are in seal script, and the inscription under the Pan is in 　書. The forehead of the Zhang Qian Stele is in clerical script, while the inscription on the stele is in eight-part script. Therefore, seal characters before the First Emperor's proclamation as emperor can be generally called large seal script, i.e., ancient 　文. The seal characters from the First Emperor's writing unification until the Second Emperor's era of course still used small seal script, but because of the influence of the convenience of clerical script, the seal characters also gradually incorporated clerical strokes. By the Han Dynasty, almost all seal characters were made in clerical script. Du Guangting said that clerical script arose in the Zhou Dynasty, coexisting with large seal script at the time. Cheng 　first abolished ancient script and used clerical script entirely. The postscript to 　篆分韻 Chen Chan also said that Han tomb seals were mixed with clerical methods. In fact, clerical script is the liberated form of large and small seal script, and is the origin of eight-part script, cursive script, and regular script. It is also the main body of seal characters after the Han Dynasty. The so-called terms like Miu Seal Script and tomb seals are nothing more than meddling by those who like to stir things up.

In short, writing methods change due to culture, material tools, environment, etc., and cannot be restricted by any name. The names of various scripts are merely a fixed name given to distinguish them when they have evolved to a certain point. However, if this naming is not accurate and appropriate, it will not only have little value, but will also leave many misunderstandings for later generations, which is a regrettable thing. Therefore, the scripts used in the pre-Qin period were only large and small seal script and clerical script. In the Han Dynasty, at the time of the "Shuowen" author, in addition to small seal script and clerical script, eight-part script (which should be considered another script, detailed in a discussion of calligraphy changes), cursive script, regular script, and other scripts were developing in many ways at the same time due to social needs and the advancement of writing tools. The theory of Miu Seal Script is a writing method similar to clerical script. The so-called twisting and winding became the precursor of the nine-fold seal script of later generations. As for names such as Strange Script, Carved Talisman, Shu Script, and Worm Script, they merely changed their shapes according to the objects, and there is no value in establishing separate script names. As for the ancient script styles in the "Shuowen," based on the unearthed bronze and stone inscriptions of past dynasties, it can be concluded that they were forged by the Han people. Therefore, the "Shuowen" book has many errors in the interpretation of ancient characters, which cannot be explored in detail one by one. However, its organization of characters laid the foundation for later generations of philology and is truly an unparalleled achievement. (June 9, Year Thirty-Six, written in 　Zhou Hang, 　Zhe　)

### A Glimpse of the Changhong Painting Society

— Lü Baihua

I am an amateur when it comes to painting, but when I stand in front of a huge painting like a flowing satin, with its smoky illusions and tranquil waters and stones, a sense of the boundless sky arises involuntarily. Therefore, I do not deny that I have a good impression of painters. Because they can indeed wonderfully capture nature, and transfer the emotions that we long for but cannot attain in the mundane world onto the tip of a brush, allowing us to get closer and wash away our troubled hearts.

Among the painters I know, Xie Xian'ou, the owner of the Changhong Society, gives me the best impression. He is very modest, and modesty can elicit good influence, so his "　敎" is successful. The members of the Changhong Society have all attained excellent accomplishments, and many friends in the news media also like to go to his Changhong Society. Running around for a living, I haven't seen Xian'ou for a long time. By chance, I walked past Hardoon Garden and turned into the Changhong Society. Coincidentally, they were holding a fan exhibition. Yes, it's summer, and fans are on the market again. I happily browsed around and felt that among the hazy sand and grass, or the corner of a red building, the painted lady standing against the wind, and his unique Five Hundred Arhats making a Taoist arena, were a thought-provoking contrast. The landscapes of society members like Shen Xiang'an, Chen Cui'e, Xie Deshui, and Zhang Baiding, and the flowers and birds of Xu Qingyun, Su Jusheng, Zhang Qi　, and Li Wenxiu, were all just right. And the people looking at the paintings all said that his daughter Xie Caiqin's painted ladies, flowers, and birds will be able to inherit his style, like a daughter passing on scriptures.

I remember a poem by an ancient person: "Entering the door and dismounting, the aura is like a rainbow." And I have the same feeling, but it should be changed to "Entering the door and looking at the paintings, the aura is like a rainbow." Therefore, I wrote "A Glimpse."

### Beethoven's Symphony

— Ni Qiuping

Compared to Mozart's works, Beethoven's are more serious, while Mozart's are simpler. Speaking of the Nine Pastoral Symphonies, they are program music, explicitly depicting rural life. In the first movement, he wrote about the joy of rural life, and in the second movement, he wrote about the scenery by the stream, with birdsong interspersed. The third movement first depicts farmers dancing, then suddenly several claps of thunder, several flashes of lightning, and then a heavy rainstorm, with thunder and lightning intertwined, which is very tense. The final movement is the shepherds singing after the rain, full of joy and delight. Do you want to know what program music is? What is a symphony? Then this Sixth Symphony is excellent research material. Today, the municipal government's symphony orchestra concert will perform Beethoven's Symphony.

### The Story of the Stars

— Sikong Wuji

On Christmas night, a group of innocent girls surrounded me. It was on the beach by the Yangtze River in Baziguo. We were almost all sitting cross-legged on the ground.

This group of girls was full of enthusiasm, asking me to tell a story. Their innocence aroused my rambling. However, this rambling is beautiful, so I have reason to ask anyone to believe me, pointing remotely to the stars twinkling in the sky.

I said: ——

"Children! Do you want to know the origin of the stars!"

"Yes!" Joy swept across the face of every girl.

I pondered slightly, then immersed my intertwined emotions into the sacred sea of boundless fantasy and slowly sailed along.

I continued:

"This story was originally preserved in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. Later, these pages were lost by foolish missionaries; this is truly a huge sin.

"Because of your innocent pursuit, I can only light the candle condensed from dreams and search in my heart.

"It can almost be said to be a miracle; no, let me thank God for the hint; I unexpectedly found this precious poem in my barren heart, which is the story of the stars that was lost by the absurd missionaries."

The children were brought into a realm of fantasy by my rambling. The suburbs were quiet, and the river water gurgled.

I continued: ——

"For the sake of the future, and precisely for the sake of our current brighter prospects.

"The Savior instructed Adam to bring Eve to arrange happiness for the future human race. So the two of them advanced on a road designated by the Savior, day and night, without stopping.

"On both sides of that road were abysses tens of thousands of feet deep. Occasionally, if they were not careful, they would throw their bodies into that terrible abyss. Fortunately, the sun and the moon were very diligent at that time, and they exchanged spreading light on this road—or rather, on this world—under the Savior's will.

"Adam and Eve borrowed this light so they would not stray from their path.

"When the two of them were about to complete their glorious road, that is, when they were about to obtain the eternal happiness of mankind, the poisonous Faust—that terrible demon king, foresaw that his dark forces would be wiped out. Selfishness, deception, and all hateful emotions enveloped his entire mind. However, he pondered that he himself did not have the power to directly destroy the Savior's darlings—Adam and Eve.

"So he maliciously and despicably transformed himself into a celestial dog, rushing into the sky (it was night). He swallowed the moon with his sinful mouth.

"The world became a mass of darkness. The demon king thought that under the power of darkness, the darlings of God would surely lose their way, stray from their path, and fall into the terrible abyss.

"…………

"It was a truly terrible dark world.

"The devils stirred up狂wind, and the sea was also roaring. Ash and sand followed the wind, piercing the bones of people.

"When the Savior created Eve, he forgot to give her courage and gave her more 'tenderness.' (Later women all accepted the transmitted character of Eve.) So on this desolate and terrifying night, Eve couldn't help but tremble, she clutched Adam's hand and said, 'I'm afraid!' Men received courage from God. So he said very firmly.

" 'Don't be afraid. I will give you strength, give you light; give you eternal hope.' Then Adam stirred his majestic singing voice, wanting to suppress the other party's fear through singing.

"However, it was an unprecedented and terrible darkness in human history; the sea was roaring, the wind was raging... Adam's singing did not have a trace of echo in this empty night. This was simply an impenetrable magic atmosphere.

"……

"Adam's singing voice grew hoarse;

"Vaguely, in this boundless darkness, Adam hesitated for a long time, vaguely discovering a brilliance that would never fall. That light flashed and hid in love, which was emitted from Eve's body. He suddenly realized that the essence of light was originally Eve. He smiled as if he had discovered something.

"He wanted to use singing to condense a small boat to carry the essence of light—Eve—to the dark heart of the sky. He firmly believed that light could replace the sun or the moon to drive away darkness.

"However, his singing drifted so far away. And how could the soul's boat carry a heavy body?

"So, Adam was deeply worried about all these difficulties. Finally, a glorious idea occupied the will of the ancestors of mankind, which was the dignity of the heroic temperament of men.

"He was determined to use the love of his entire soul as a sacrifice for the future happiness of mankind. He was going to kill Eve and then commit suicide; because he understood that he could not endure loneliness that was more terrible than death.

"Eve's body fell down, and the golden soul light of her golden yellow soul escaped that heavy body and flew.

"Fly, fly, fly to the distant heart of the sky, you see the brightest one is her. She is the first star in the sky.

"Adam grasped the sharp blade, staring dazedly at the star, and the star, like Eve's eyes, flashed a gentle light.

"When Adam fought against reason, his heart had already broken. When this gentle light shone into the bottom of his broken heart. He felt a burst of throbbing, trembled all over, he fell down, like a magnetic person, his whole body was shattered.

"The song that Adam released came back from a long distance, each syllable carrying a broken body of a soul. Jumping, trembling, ascending into the sky, showing thousands of golden lights.

"The first star in the heart of the sky looked around at the infinite number of stars with gentle eyes, and the infinite number of stars looked at the first star in the heart of the sky with joyful eyes. They jointly sent off that desolate night."

I coughed and finished my words.

I said this is the story of the stars.

"However, does the road that God called them to walk still exist now?" a girl asked me, two roses flying on her face.

"Why not? Isn't that road in front of you?" I said with a smile. "Although this road is illuminated by the sun, moon, and stars. But you must remember, you must walk slowly and continuously!"

Eve and Adam are twinkling in the sky.

The river water never stops and seems to be telling this hymn of mythology over and over again.

### Young Woman

— Minaud

Pierce Mignard (1610-1695) was an important artist of the 16th-century French Baroque school. He was also a court painter of Louis XIV, and was as famous as N. Poussin and C. D. LOrrain.

He specializes in portraits of figures, with gorgeous colors and relaxed brushstrokes. This work is representative of his style. The original work is in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, Germany. (Liu Shi)

### June's Pomegranate Flowers

— Jin Shan

——A Commemoration of Early Summer, Recording Old Works with Oddities

I can't write another chapter of lyrical poetry,

Like scooping up floating clouds in a deep pool.

Last night, the Milky Way drifted past a weeping shooting star,

June's pomegranate flowers wither in shame and resentment,

The remnant red sprinkles the dawn's 　啾,

The twittering chases away the warmth at the bottom of the dream.

Is it the cuckoo that has quietly returned,

The last drop of blood dyeing the fallen flowers?

Pondering the crushed morning dream,

The dream shadow is even sadder than the petals.

The fragrance under the azalea cannot stay until dusk.

Who said that a cup full of bitter wine is not easy to freeze!

The infatuated heart is willing to believe—

The lonely strings of the qin cannot be lit up;

Build a lonely tomb for youth,

It is even unnecessary to measure the bitterness,

Trembling with the tenderness under the moonlight,

It is vaguely the bell of ancient times.

A cloud shadow disappeared from the deep pool;

How much poetic feeling is left in the world?

Postscript

This is an old work from twenty-five years ago. Now I try to rewrite it according to the Peiwen Poetry Rhyme, using the Geng Qing rhyming scheme. Recalling the old dream, it is as if it were yesterday; and the flower and moon of last night are also vaguely a trace of a dream. Thinking of the words of the predecessors who regretted their young works, how can I not feel ashamed; although it is said that a shabby broom is cherished, I cannot help but feel a little lost.

### Colophon to "Qian Juntao's Ink Fate"

— Zou Mengchan

Calligraphy is a unique art of the East. Since the creation of characters, there has been no shortage of people who are proficient in it. In the Western Han Dynasty, calligraphy was regarded as a specialized field of study. Yang Xin said that 　He wrote the forehead of the front hall, thinking for three months, Yan Yannian was good at history books, Shi You was skilled in scattered clerical script, and Gu Yong was skilled in written notes. These are all mentioned in the Historical Records and the Book of Han. In the Eastern Han Dynasty, the love of calligraphy was even more prevalent. Cao Xi, Du Du, Cui Yuan, Cai Yong, Liu Desheng, and Zhang Zhi and others were all known for their purity and ability, and their new ideas and different states reached the extreme.

Descending to the Six Dynasties, the Wang family, father and son, in Eastern Pu, carried it forward and made it a unique field of study; the epitaphs of the Northern Dynasties were the most comprehensive, with square and round different styles, fat and thin different postures. The division between Southern Posts and Northern Tablets is based on this.

After the Tang and Song dynasties, they competed to admire the academy style, only talking about structure, not paying attention to spirit and charm, and the ancient meaning had faded away. This is why Kang Nanhai created the theory of "Despising the Tang Dynasty," and would admire the Six Dynasties.

From then on, the books of Yan, Liu, and Zhao Chong were popular. Scholars mostly used them as a lesson, and the style of writing became vulgar and easily inclined to be inferior. By the time of the Qing Dynasty, this trend was even more prevalent. Scholars who loved antiquity thought about reviving the decline. People like Deng Shiru advocated tablet studies, respected Northern Tablets, in order to reform the decadent style, and from then on, those who practiced Northern Tablets, "It is known to every family," Bao Shichen, Wu Rangzhi, and Zhao Huishu inherited their learning, and it became even more brilliant. They established a separate banner outside the official cabinet calligraphy style. Modern calligraphy is one 　because of this.

In this day and age, the world is learning 　　　, and those in our country who advocate national essence only talk about preservation. The study of art is almost a leisure activity for literati. It is because the country is in turmoil and the people's livelihood is declining. The world despises weak skills, art is encroached upon, and the style of calligraphy is 　, to the extreme today. Those who love it only pay attention to skills and only pay attention to application. It is rare to see those who seek its spirit, charm, and ancient interest.

My friend Qian Zijing, after practicing rhythm, devoted himself to calligraphy. Going back to the Three Dynasties and down to modern times, he studied all styles of calligraphy and was able to obtain their strengths. Seal and clerical script are peaceful and easy; although not as beautiful as Wan Bai's naturalness, they are graceful and unrestrained, slightly close to Rangzhi. Regular script takes Northern Tablets as its bones, breathing from Shi Ping and Meng Long, can be unrestrained and free, but not rigid, truly a man after Bei An. Cursive script has the vitality of the Second Wang, and also the Yuyi of Suo Jing and the Runhe of Qian Li, the body is firm, like a strong man's arm, and can be compared to An Wu.

Alas! The achievement of the Dao is not easy. Like Qian Zi, he is blessed by heaven, and also diligently practices without being tired, and also corrects the mistakes of Yan Liu Zhao Dong, does not seek skills but is charming to the public, does not lose the ancient meaning but seeks spirit and charm, and the aim is high, and its achievement is easy. I heard that Qian Zi, produced more than a hundred fine works in recent times, collected and printed them into a book, named Mo Lu, to seek evaluation and teaching, loves antiquity and is humble and restrained, which is worthy of admiration. I dare to offer a word to introduce to like-minded people.

### "The Mechanism on Ice Skates" - A Record of an Interview with Mr. Chen Lifu by a Reporter from the Era Weekly

— Leike

This mechanism is not an organization, but a name that the reporter from the Era Weekly calls Chen Lifu. This reporter recently visited Chen and saw Chen, who looked like a professor, wearing brand-new ice skates and performing ice skating in front of his four children.

The Era reporter believes that Americans are quite alienated from Chen, so he specially wrote an article to introduce him. He said that Chen firmly believes in the teachings of Confucius, and his beliefs represent two thousand years of culture. However, he does not advocate restoration of the old; he wants to improve the old things to adapt to the environment created by scientific progress. Therefore, he does not hope that a Chinese society that inherits the past and continues the future will be completely immersed in Western individualism or materialism. What he requires is social harmony, not class struggle.

The Era reporter also gave a detailed account of Chen's family background and education. Regarding the latter, he said that Chen 　studied at Beiyang University, majoring in physics, mathematics, and Chinese studies. Later, he went to the School of Mines at the University of Pittsburgh in the United States. His graduation thesis discussed how to apply mechanical and electrical technology to China's coal mines. After graduating, he registered as a miner in the Pittsburgh and Scranton coal mines, and was a member of the United Mine Workers of America. In that graduation thesis, his opening sentence was not like an engineer, but like a philosopher: "The primary purpose of any industrial development must be to seek the welfare of mankind." After returning to China, he very much wanted to apply the technology he had learned to the Shandong mining fields, but at that time he was working on the Northern Expedition, and General Chiang Kai-shek summoned him to do revolutionary work.

The Era reporter said that Chen's work can be divided into two aspects. On the one hand, he is writing books and establishing theories. He studies very diligently and is very fond of Western philosophers such as Bergson. He himself has a book entitled "On Vitalism," which has sold a huge 250,000 copies. There are many other books on philosophy and education. On the other hand, he is guiding a political organization, and this organization has been integrated into the folk life.

Regarding Chen's ideals, the Era reporter introduced a passage on the explanation of the Principle of People's Livelihood: This is social insurance, free health care and education; no concentration of capital and land rights; more cooperatives, and state ownership of major industries. If we want to take a recent analogy from the West, then the gradual evolution plan of the British Labour Party is almost close to it, although not completely the same.

Regarding Chen's integrity, the reporter quoted Ambassador John Leighton Stuart's words: "I believe that no one can prove that Chen Lifu is corrupt."

### French Perfume Town

— Yongnian

In the south of France, about 1,200 feet high on the hillside overlooking the Mediterranean, lies a town called GRASSE, the most famous perfume manufacturing industrial center in the world. The children there don't aspire to be engineers when they grow up, but rather to become "noses" of Grasse. The so-called "nose" is considered the highest honor in the perfume manufacturing industry. To become a "nose," one must be able to distinguish seven thousand different scents with their nose; at the same time, they must be a top student from a university and graduate school specializing in chemistry. In addition, they must undergo fifteen years of training before it can be determined whether they are qualified to be called a "nose." It is estimated that there are fewer than a dozen "noses" in the world, and most of them are concentrated in this town of Grasse. They often suffer from an occupational disease—liver disease. In medicine, it is said to be alcohol poisoning, although they are not drunkards. However, by smelling perfume containing alcohol every day, the alcohol is absorbed into the tissues of the body over time.

Each different flower has its unique scent. Even within the same type of flower, different scents can be distinguished depending on the growing location and color. The "noses" of Grasse can accurately distinguish the colors of flowers without restriction. The two indispensable flowers for making high-quality perfumes are rose and tuberose. Using one or both of these flowers, mixed with other ingredients such as hay, patchouli, camphor, pepper, cinnamon, resin, cypress, vanilla, etc., any type of perfume scent can be created. However, there is currently no artificial method to replicate the basic scents of the above two flowers. During manufacturing, gas is passed through sealed large vats of flowers to absorb the fragrance, and then steam distillation is used to obtain the perfume. To give the true fragrance of the perfume produced in this way vitality, musk, ambergris, or civet secretions must be added. These three fragrances are derived from animals, and there is currently no scientific method to artificially manufacture them. Musk must be extracted from the dried sacs of musk deer in Tibet. Ambergris comes from sperm whales in the sea. Civets live in Ethiopia. This shows the reason why high-quality perfumes are expensive. As for the formulas used in manufacturing, they are absolutely confidential documents in the town of Grasse.

### Clearing Away the Smoke Addiction - The Feeling of Nine Days of Abstinence

— Translated by Junsen

I have often felt deep sympathy for those suffering from nicotine addiction. That is to say, I have often felt this sympathy during the first nine days after I quit that terrible craving for tobacco. With my mind cleared of smoke and my blood free of nicotine, I am now able to offer some clear opinions on this issue.

I have calculated that an average cigarette smoker spends US$127.50 per year on their bad habit—enough to buy forty or fifty good books, or several sets of clothing, or a comfortable chair, or a great vacation. All of these things disappear in smoke. Using my new, clear-headed mind to calculate further, I discovered that an average smoker spends US$3,810 over thirty years. In other words, if I had decided to quit thirty years ago, I would now have enough money to buy a high-end car, take a long trip, or put a down payment on a house.

I have heard that the economic problems of our time have been explained in various ways, but the real cause of these problems has been completely ignored. If there were no tobacco, the average family (because men and women are both slaves to tobacco) would have more than twenty US dollars per month to spend on groceries, rent, or furniture. Our entire standard of living would improve.

In short, after nine days of reformation, I can see that our civilization is not declining due to poverty or war, but because tobacco, this civilization, is smoking itself to death. When our eyes are blinded by smoke, how can we see the answers to our larger problems?

I said it has been nine days since I first understood these truths. Although I have felt unwell all day long, have been unable to work, have been unfit to live with my family, have lost the love of my family, have insulted my friends, and have hoped every morning that I would hurry up and die before evening—aside from all this, these nine days have been the happiest days of my life. I am finally free; and because I have vowed to abstain from smoking for a month, I have at least twenty-one days left before I relapse into slavery to smoke. I am counting those days.

### Hong Kong, Macau and Showcases

— Ye Lin

Truly like a traveler missing their homeland, from our ancestors a hundred years ago to our generation, we have been missing Hong Kong and Macau for three or four generations.

We do not want our next generation to have such thoughts, so we hope that their current occupants will return them to their original owners with foresight and wisdom.

This is not only friendship or morality, but historical integrity.

However, our hope has been met with the most dishonest response. Mr. Eduardo, the minister who inherited the colonial strategies of the 18th and 19th centuries of Portugal, refused further consideration with the most sensational tone. He declared that he would use violence to deal with violence and insisted on taking Macau as a territory.

This is naturally a misfortune. It would be so unwise if a conclusion of historical integrity must be written in blood and sweat. Here, I privately admire Mr. Laski, who is a scholar and the brain of the Labour Party. Only he has more foresight than Mr. Inder and knows the world better than Minister Eduardo. He expressed his attitude towards Hong Kong with the sensitivity of a politician and the conscience of a scholar. He felt that Britain should return Hong Kong to China at the best opportunity in the near future.

This is right. Although the return of Hong Kong is a loss to Britain, it will be compensated. It will gain the best friendship between China and Britain in a hundred years. Based on this friendship, Britain can still obtain the greatest benefits in cooperation. Therefore, far-sighted members of the Labour Party have now advocated returning Hong Kong to its former owner, but hope to realize it at a suitable time. For example, a member of parliament advocated waiting for the opportunity to return it, hoping to build it into a democratic showcase in the East. Naturally, what is displayed in this democratic showcase is a democratic specimen. The member of parliament hopes to warn people in the East with this, just as when the mainland is like the exhibits in the democratic showcase, it will be the time for the return.

We do not deny that the mainland needs an epoch-making leap, but it is not necessary to use showcases as a demonstration. Democracy is neither a gift nor an imported product. For us, no matter what you display in the showcase, what we see is just various decorations under colonial conditions. It is meaningless. Only what is built on a rational foundation is true and valuable. This rational foundation is to return from a colony to Chinese territory.

Therefore, we earnestly hope that wise people like Laski, Minister Eduardo will not learn from Mr. Don Quixote who fights windmills!

### Strange Infant

— Hu Lu

Infant with transparent belly, died after two days—see local news,

Crystal belly, clear and bright, how could such a child be born easily?

Wanting to reveal the heart and mind together, one should know that this world does not accept it!

Life is a fleeting wonder, a strange tale spread far and wide, better than a floating corpse;

A kindred spirit of a thousand years, Su Shi laughs, "A small belly out of tune with the times"!

### Geographical Situation of Beitashan

— Yu Tian

People in the country are not familiar with the geography of the border areas. Even today, Beitashan, which is attracting the attention of people across the country, is located in? I am afraid that there are very few people who know. Therefore, I will not be humble and humbly provide a simple introduction to its geographical environment.

Beitashan is located at the eastern end of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang Province, about 350 Chinese miles from Qiqi on the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway. The terrain is about 1,000 meters, and it is a grassland dotted with quicksand. There are very few people, and the scenery is very desolate.

There is a large desert in the eastern part of Beitashan, called the Gurbantunggut Desert. This sand sea is prone to refraction due to light, so parallax occurs. At night, the stars are always bright, and in the daytime, distant mountains and forests are seen as if they are right in front of you. Therefore, there is a saying that "looking at the mountain makes a horse run to death, and it is vast to take things."

Beitashan is located in the Junggar Basin, and the latitude of the basin is extremely high, and it is extremely far from the sea, so the difference between cold and heat is extremely extreme, and the rainfall is scarce, forming a dry area. Therefore, animal husbandry replaces agriculture, and the poverty of the residents is also determined by animal husbandry. The main livestock are cattle, horses and sheep.

In addition to animal husbandry, this place is rich in resources such as gold, oil, and uranium.

### Duke Zhou and Kong Yi

— Lu Shi

Speaking of these two old gentlemen, maybe my thinking is too outdated, but after thousands of years, they are still respected as saints. What is the reason for their worship?

Duke Zhou made rituals, which modern scholars not only think restrict the freedom of the people and advocate exclusion, but also the Lao-Zhuang doctrine in the Ji Zhou era strongly opposed it. The so-called "saints do not die, great thieves do not stop," and the articles "Horse Number" and "Qiebo" have naked expressions.

As for Confucius' doctrine of respecting the king and despising barbarians, it is even more criticized as enslaving the people. The way of loyalty and forgiveness is equivalent to the spirit of Ah Q. I have also made sympathetic calls to overthrow the Confucian shop.

Now my thinking has gone from progressive to outdated. I believe that Duke Zhou's righteousness is more important than relatives, and Confucius' execution of Shaozheng Mao is precisely the iron-fisted politics of supporting a dangerous country and reforming the old system. The achievements of the republic and the songs of the State of Lu are the success of iron-fisted politics.

Guan Cai and Uncle Huo, as nobles, bear the important mission of monitoring the Yin. They coveted power, created rumors, and even worse, they did not hesitate to collude with the enemy and claim troops, attempting to subvert the Zong Zhou. Although Duke Zhou was an expert in speaking etiquette, and filial piety was important, but when the country was in trouble, he disregarded the feelings of his brothers, resolutely sent troops to quell the rebellion, and punished them separately, which can be called a model of the spirit of the rule of law.

Confucius served as the prime minister of Lu and knew that the weak State of Lu could not survive without vigorous reforms. However, the doctor Shaozheng Mao did not think so. The crimes of this doctor mentioned in the book "Heart is rebellious and dangerous... words are false and debatable..." probably refer to him being good at issuing political programs and theories, but they are all unfulfilled checks, just a mask to protect his position and deceive the public. Confucius killed him to boost his prestige, and soon the State of Lu was well governed. This approach is contradictory to his advocacy of loyalty and forgiveness; but he had to adapt to the times in order to save the precarious situation. Confucius was a sage of the times, and it was very appropriate.

We recognize what era this is? Let us give a correct criticism to Duke Zhou, who "made rituals and made music," and Confucius, who advocated "loyalty and forgiveness."

### Qing People's Humor

— Ji Ming

When Ruan Wenda's princess was in Zhejiang, a certain prefect paid his respects as usual. After the salutation, the princess suddenly asked, "Are you afraid of your wife?" The prefect pondered for a long time, privately thinking that being afraid of one's wife would tarnish the words of admonishment. The princess must be disgusted with those who were afraid of their wives, so he said in horror, "This humble official is not afraid of his wife." Princess Ruan was furious and slapped the table, saying, "You are not even afraid of your wife, how can you fear the imperial court?" He was dismissed from his position as a result. Later, the prefect privately inquired with Ruan's confidants and learned that Ruan was aided by his wife when he was a commoner. After work and before the lights, she urged him to be strict. Ruan respected and feared her, so he thought that all men in the world should bow down to the pomegranate skirt.

Chen Qinian had a clear talent for poetry, especially known for his talent. One day, he drank with relatives and friends in a brothel. Everyone agreed to use the word "red" to fly the wine cup, and they were forbidden to use the language of the time. There was a certain wealthy merchant among them, who was a distant relative of Chen. When it was his turn, he had no way to answer, so he fabricated, "Willow catkins fly piece by piece, red." The whole audience was in an uproar, saying, "Willow catkins are white, there is absolutely no reason for them to be red, it must be a fabrication, and should be fined a large glass." The wealthy merchant was embarrassed, and Chen slowly said, "You have read few books. According to what I remember, this poem is an unpublished work by Fang Weng, not a poem by our group." Everyone said, "In that case, we would like to hear the full poem." Chen then recited: "Twenty-four bridges, twenty-four winds, leaning on the railing, I still remember the old Jiangdong. The setting sun shines on the peach blossoms dancing, and the willow catkins fly piece by piece, red." Although everyone knew he was lying, they could not challenge him.

Chen Wengong was the supervisor of studies in Guizhou. He summoned the students from the Zuyuan area to take a face-to-face test. Xue Cao reported, "The Zuyuan area is remote and the literary style is not developed. I hope you will not make things difficult with poetry and articles." The princess said yes, and then gave out a seven-character antithetical couplet. Xue Cao then reported, "Seven characters are too many, I hope you can change it to one character." The princess had no choice but to give the character "firewood" for the students to make a couplet. The students scratched their heads and cheeks, and could not come up with an answer for a long time. Soon, a student handed in his paper, and it boldly read "coal." Xue Cao commented, "This can be taken as the first." The princess was surprised by this, and Xue Cao reported, "I am afraid that the rest of the people will not be able to answer." After a while, another student handed in his paper, only writing the word "firewood." Xue Cao said, "This can be ranked second." The princess was even more surprised and replied, "It is not easy to be able to write the topic." After a while, a stick of incense had passed, and those who handed in their papers later were all blank.

### Chronicle of a Beleaguered City

— Qin Shouou

"Hospital! Hospital! Where is the hospital?" Old Zhu, who had not had a decent meal for two or three days and had not drunk a drop of water all night, asked everyone he met in a hoarse voice.

He felt like there was a windmill spinning in his head. He didn't even know how his feet were moving; now, he didn't even pay attention to Feifei's illness, he just wanted to find a hospital quickly. Fortunately, he soon met a very enthusiastic policeman, who happily led him through several streets to the front of a relatively clean house.

"This is the hospital, let's go knock on the door..." said the policeman walking in front.

But Zhu Zhaonian could not hold on any longer.

His legs went weak, his body slumped to the ground, and his eyes turned pitch black. However, his arms did not loosen, but tightly embraced Feifei, who had fallen into a coma before him.

The policeman heard the sound and turned back quickly.

"Save him quickly, this child..., meningitis... meningitis...!" Zhu Zhaonian shouted as if he was breathing his last breath.

October 21st of the same year

When the Southwest Highway Bureau's charcoal bus, covered in sand, pulled into the Haitangxi Station in Chongqing, Rong'er happily dragged his father and rushed up like a charge. Even Professor Hu Juewen, who had always valued academics and family lightly, could not help but look radiant today.

The bus stopped and the passengers got off one by one.

The Hu family and his son both stretched their necks and watched intently; after six or seven people got off, Lan and Feifei finally appeared at the door of the bus, but their spirits were so haggard and their faces were so thin and yellow that Hu Juewen immediately felt endless guilt and pity in his eyes.

"This time it's really been hard on you, Lan!" The first thing he said to his wife was this.

"It's good to be here." Lan smiled lightly, her attitude still so calm.

Feifei clung to her mother's side like a wounded little bird, her eyes, which seemed particularly large after the illness, looking intently at her father and brother, but there was no joy on her face.

"Sister, where is Rabbit Daddy?" Xiao Rong asked impatiently.

Suddenly, Feifei covered her face and cried.

"I gave it to Uncle Zhu." Lan replied in a very calm voice, but Hu Juewen had already seen that his wife's eyes were red.
