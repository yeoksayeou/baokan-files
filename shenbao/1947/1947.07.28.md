### Grand Meeting of the Land Tax Conference Held: Chairman Explains the Significance of Grain Collection, Zhang Qun Announces Nine Key Points of Grain Administration

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Chairman Chiang attended the Land Tax Conference for the 36th year at 10:00 AM on the 27th and gave instructions to all attendees. He stated that, in order for the government to accomplish the task of suppressing the rebellion and saving the people, it must first ensure sufficient food and soldiers. Therefore, grain collection and conscription are the two major central tasks for local governments in the future. The provincial chairmen and land tax officials must collectively take responsibility for improving land tax operations, eliminating past malpractices, and striving to truly meet the principles of fairness. He also hoped that the provincial councils and local gentry would provide assistance in various ways so that government orders could be smoothly implemented. Most importantly, government officials and gentry should lead by example in complying with government laws and regulations, paying land taxes, and fulfilling military service, thereby setting an example for the people. Only in this way can the goals of sufficient food and soldiers be achieved, and the great cause of unified national construction be completed.

[Another dispatch] The Land Tax Conference for the 36th year opened at 9:00 AM on the 27th in the auditorium of the Executive Yuan. Attendees included provincial chairmen, speakers of provincial councils, directors of land tax bureaus, and central leaders Wang Yunwu, Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Yu Feipeng, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Wu Dingchang, Gan Naiguang, Pang Songzhou, Chen Liang, and more than eighty others. Premier Zhang chaired the meeting and delivered the opening remarks, stating that this conference was based on the "Continuing Collection and Borrowing of Grain in Kind for Land Tax" case passed by the seventh State Council meeting on the 18th of this month. The Executive Yuan, based on this principle, has drafted the "Implementation Measures for the Collection of Land Tax in Kind and Borrowing in Kind for the 36th Year." He hoped that all attendees would actively offer their opinions and conduct thorough discussions to fulfill the mission of this conference. At 10:00 AM, Chairman Chiang arrived at the meeting to give instructions and left after half an hour. Subsequently, the first general meeting was held, chaired by Premier Zhang, who announced the "Implementation Measures for Collection and Borrowing in Kind for the 36th Year" drafted by the Executive Yuan. The meeting adjourned at 11:20 AM. The second general meeting was held at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Premier Zhang. Various units presented their opinions on the collection and borrowing in kind. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The 28th will be for provincial discussions.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] Premier Zhang officially read out the key points related to grain collection at the first general meeting of the grain conference, divided into nine items, providing detailed instructions on the current grain administration:

The first item is the necessity of continuing the collection and borrowing, pointing out that the government originally decided to stop the collection and borrowing this year. However, due to the Communist bandits' rejection of peace talks and launching of rebellion, the government had to implement general mobilization and engage in suppressing the rebellion. Military actions were difficult to stop for a time, and the need for military grain naturally could not be reduced. The government's grain collection this year was insufficient, so it decided to continue the collection and borrowing. This is a measure that the government was compelled to take.

The second item, the standards and amounts for collection in kind, will still be handled in accordance with the original plan previously negotiated between the Ministry of Food and the provinces.

The third item, the areas for collection in kind and collection in currency should be designated immediately. While the provincial chairmen, speakers, or their representatives, and land tax officials are in Nanjing, the Ministry of Food should immediately, based on the central and local needs for actual quantities of goods, and taking into account the grain production and transportation conditions of each county, jointly designate the areas for collection in kind and collection in currency to facilitate implementation. Areas with greater grain needs should still collect and borrow as much as possible in kind to ensure supply.

The fourth item, the collection quotas and borrowing quotas must be fully met. The amount of collection in kind and collection in currency this year is the same as or lower than last year, and the borrowing is based on a one-to-one ratio. For some areas, it may be slightly higher than last year, but the total amount still does not fully meet the needs. It is hoped that the responsible agencies will strictly supervise and urge the handling of the matter, and it is particularly hoped that the provincial and county public opinion organs will cooperate in promoting and assisting in various ways to ensure that the quotas are fully met within the time limit.

The fifth item, the grain collected by provincial and county-level agencies on Sundays should be allocated immediately after collection. The central government's purchase of grain has been negotiated and determined by the Ministry of Food separately, and the price payment method is also quite fair. It is deeply hoped that the local authorities will first transport the grain to be purchased by the central government to areas with convenient transportation for easy concentration and allocate it as soon as possible. Before the rice is fully allocated, all collected grain shall not be misappropriated or used.

The sixth item, the proceeds from currency conversions should be immediately deposited into the treasury as soon as they are collected, and any retention is strictly prohibited to prevent currency circulation. Those who misappropriate funds without authorization should be severely punished.

The seventh item, public opinion organs assisting in carrying out the work of suppressing the rebellion and resisting foreign aggression are important. Public opinion organs must do their best to convey the government's policies so that the people understand the shared difficulties and rise up together to actively contribute.

The eighth item, establish universal supervisory agencies for collection and borrowing to eliminate corruption. Corruption is unavoidable in the collection of actual goods and currency. Supervisory committees for the collection and borrowing of actual goods at all levels must be universally established and strengthen their organization to achieve the effect of eliminating corruption and promoting integrity.

The ninth item, improve collection methods and work hard to supervise collection. In addition to the collection in kind this year, borrowing and public grain will still be collected as before. The burden on the people cannot be said to be light. The handling agencies must be dedicated to serving the public and loving the country, while also being considerate of the people's needs, clearly setting legal standards, diligently serving, and the quality of collection procedures will be the main items for assessment, rewards, and punishments. It is hoped that everyone will work hard together to achieve complete success.

Premier Zhang Submits Methods for Discussion, Grain Officials from Various Provinces Offer Opinions, Report to be Submitted to the General Assembly After Approval

[Another dispatch] The Land Tax Conference held its second general meeting at 4:00 PM on the 27th to discuss the "Implementation Measures for the Collection of Land Tax in Kind and Borrowing of Grain for the 36th Year" submitted by Premier Zhang, chaired by Yu Feipeng. The speakers of the provincial councils were the first to speak, raising many opinions on the grain collection methods, and generally believed that there were many difficulties in implementing grain administration at present. Subsequently, the provincial chairmen and the directors of the provincial grain bureaus provided concrete opinions and made some revisions to the implementation measures. Finally, Yu Feipeng made a conclusion, saying that he would report to Premier Zhang and submit a report to the general meeting on the 30th. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

Implementation Measures

The main points of the implementation measures are recorded as follows:

(A) Regarding collection and borrowing: (1) In order to coordinate with the needs of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, land tax in various provinces and cities this year should still focus on collecting in kind and borrowing grain as much as possible. However, for municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and a few areas in the provinces with inconvenient transportation and low grain production, land tax and borrowed grain may be converted into currency based on the highest grain price month before the start of collection in the local area, subject to approval. The conversion standard should be based on the ability to purchase an equal amount of physical goods in neighboring areas. The areas for conversion into currency and the conversion standards shall be determined by the Ministry of Food. (2) The principal and interest of grain bonds due this year should be offset from the central government's share of the collection and borrowing. Grain bonds will not be issued for grain borrowed this year, and no interest will be calculated. Starting from 1952, they will be offset in equal installments over five years. (3) Borrowing is based on a one-to-one ratio. (4) Public grain is based on 30% of the collection in kind in principle. If provincial and county-level finances are difficult, it may be collected up to 50% with the consent of the public opinion organs. (5) Land tax should be fully collected within three months after the start of collection. (6) No additional taxes or levies may be imposed on land.

(B) Regarding allocation and purchase: (1) All proceeds from borrowing grain shall be transferred to the central government. For the land tax portion, 30% goes to the central government, 20% to the province, and 50% to the county or city, 40% to municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and 60% to the city. (2) The physical goods belonging to the local portion shall be purchased by the central government for unified allocation. (3) The grain obtained from borrowing shall be allocated to military grain first.

(C) Regarding agency expenses (omitted)

(D) Regarding supervision and oversight: (1) Agencies at all levels should fully promote the collection and borrowing in kind and ensure that it is fully collected within the time limit. Those who handle the matter poorly or engage in bribery shall be severely punished in accordance with the law. (2) The supervisory committees for borrowing grain shall be established universally within a time limit.

[This newspaper, Chengdu, 27th dispatch] In order to strengthen the suppression of rebellion, the central government has decided that the quota for borrowing grain in Sichuan Province this year will be 10 million shi in principle.

### Provincial Chairmen Hold Talks

[Another dispatch] The government convened the Land Tax Conference to coordinate with the general mobilization and strengthen the military's suppression of the Communists, discussing the issue of collection and borrowing in order to ensure sufficient food and soldiers. In order to coordinate and comply with the Chairman's instructions, the provincial chairmen held talks at the International Recreation Club at 8:00 PM on the 27th to discuss various technical issues. Premier Zhang convened a symposium with the provincial chairmen on the evening of the 28th to exchange opinions. In addition, the Ministry of Food will also convene a meeting of the directors of the provincial land tax bureaus within a few days to discuss and decide on the technical issues of collection and borrowing.

### Experts Believe Now is Not the Time to Reform the Monetary System

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] Opinions are divided here on whether the monetary system should be reformed at this time. This reporter interviewed another economic authority on the 27th, who believed that monetary reform is not the right time at present. His views are quite different from those who advocate immediate reform. He pointed out that very few countries reform their monetary systems during wartime, because many changes during turbulent times can easily cause disturbances. Our country must not take this risk. Furthermore, in terms of our country's current reserves, without foreign support, it is not enough to cope with this matter. Unless the United States can lend us 1.5 billion to 2 billion US dollars, half of which is used for construction and half for reform reserves, it will be difficult to achieve this. He believes that even if reform is carried out immediately, it is only a transitional measure to "treat the pain." A "healthy" and permanent monetary system can only be established after stability.

### Central Government Appoints Wu Qiwai as Deputy Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters

[This newspaper, Beiping, 27th dispatch] The central government has appointed Wu Qiwai as Deputy Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and he will fly to Beiping to take office within the next few days. In addition, the Beiping and Baoding Pacification Headquarters are discussing joint defense matters, planning to establish a large mobile corps on the Beiping-Ning line to respond to sudden incidents inside and outside Shanhaiguan at any time.

### Qingyuan and Other Counties in Liaoning Province Reassigned to Andong and Liaobei

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 27th dispatch] The Pacification Headquarters ordered the Liaoning Provincial Government to reassign Qingyuan and Xinbin counties under its jurisdiction to Andong Province, and Kangping, Faku, and Zhangwu counties to Liaobei Province, effective August 10.

### Jilin Organizes Commando Teams to Go Deep into Communist Areas to Launch Guerrilla Warfare, Liang Huasheng Leads Reporters to Visit Baishan Summer Camp

[This newspaper, Changchun, 27th dispatch] Chairman Liang Huasheng led reporters to visit the Jilin Baishan Summer Camp yesterday. The camp is located at the foot of Xiaobaishan Mountain, and the participants are administrative and educational cadres. Commando team members organized by Chairman Liang also participated. Jilin Province is organizing commando teams throughout the province. These commando teams will go deep into Communist areas to launch extensive guerrilla warfare. General Liang Huasheng is the most energetic leader. The Baishan Summer Camp he presides over is full of vitality and fighting spirit. He is determined to lead the people of Jilin to make great contributions to the country and the nation between Baishan and Heilongjiang. In addition, more than a dozen reporters from Changchun and Jilin are scheduled to take cars to Siping on the morning of the 28th for a visit and to inspect the damage to the China Changchun Railway.

### Investigation Work Comes to an End, Wedemeyer Returns to the Capital Today, Will Come to Shanghai Again Within Ten Days to Continue Inspection

[This newspaper report] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to fly back to Nanjing at 9:00 AM this morning. The investigation team believes that the work in Shanghai, due to the short time, is only a "good start." Therefore, one or two experts from the team will be sent to Shanghai again in the short term to sort out the information obtained. According to personnel close to the investigation team, Wedemeyer and his entourage may all come to Shanghai again within ten days for further investigation and research, but the time cannot be determined yet. Special Envoy Wedemeyer was busy all day yesterday. Because yesterday was Sunday, he drove a Samsung car to Jiangxi Road Cathedral at 10:00 AM to attend a prayer service.

### President of the American Chamber of Commerce Submits Important Documents, Hoping to Improve Trade Conditions

The US Consul General Davis hosted a banquet at noon, during which the President of the American Chamber of Commerce, Smith, handed over important documents to Special Envoy Wedemeyer. According to what reporters have learned from various sources, the contents are approximately as follows: (1) Although the Central Government has stipulated the division of state-owned and private enterprises, it has not been effectively implemented, which has hindered the development of foreign-owned private enterprises. (2) Regarding import and export restrictions, they often increase the necessary raw materials for Chinese export products cannot be imported into China, while luxury goods and non-essential consumer goods can be imported instead. At the same time, many goods that have been prohibited from import by the government are still imported. Furthermore, regarding the import quota system, often long-established merchants cannot obtain permits for a long time, while newly opened companies can obtain them first. (3) After the signing of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, both parties should have equal and reciprocal treatment in accordance with the treaty, but in fact, there is considerable discrimination against American merchants. All of this seems unfair and unreasonable, and the American side deeply regrets it. Therefore, it is hoped that before the United States provides assistance to China, the above situation should be improved as soon as possible. In the afternoon, Special Envoy Wedemeyer began to receive Chinese and American guests. Party figures such as Zhang Junli of the Democratic Socialist Party and Li Huang of the Youth Party visited successively, and it was heard that they all emphasized that the government needs to make further reorganization and exchanged opinions on current affairs. Government officials Song Ziwen and Chen Guangfu also visited, but the content of the talks is unknown. Flying Tiger General Chennault, who served in the China theater with Wedemeyer during the war, also took time to visit yesterday. In addition, many Chinese and foreign people visited Special Envoy Wedemeyer yesterday. Due to time constraints, most of them could not be received in person, and were received by members of the team on their behalf. Special Envoy Wedemeyer expressed his deep apology for this and said that all opinions have been reported in detail by his staff.

### Invited to a Banquet by the Mayor, Meeting with Various Circles, Dismissed at 11:00 PM

Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for all the members of the delegation at his residence on Anfu Road at 8:00 PM, and those invited to accompany them included Speaker Pan, Li Fusun, Li Shuxiong, Yan Huiqing, and figures from the business community. The conversation was very pleasant until around 11:00 PM. According to relevant personnel, this was a normal social event and not Special Envoy Wedemeyer's intention to solicit opinions from the Chinese business community. Therefore, the invited business people were all those who had friendships with the Americans and were proficient in English, rather than representatives of the Shanghai Chinese business community.

According to people close to Special Envoy Wedemeyer, "The investigation team has decided to go to Shenyang, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao and Taiwan for inspection, which will take place in the last day or two of this week. First go to North China and Northeast China, and then to Taiwan Province. Due to time constraints, it is impossible to carry out thorough investigations everywhere. In some areas, we will try our best to use the results of other people's research, summarize and analyze them, and then make independent judgments. Because the investigation team still has to go to South Korea, the period in China is only one month. One week is used for general research and discussion, and the actual investigation time is only three weeks. In this short period of time, in order to maximize the effectiveness of the work, the investigation team decided to maintain maximum contact with all circles. If there are those who contribute opinions and data, regardless of whether they are experts or not, they are welcome. This type of data is summarized, analyzed, and then objectively judged and measured. Our investigation work in your country focuses on the goal of China's economic recovery, but if you want to point out what kind of information is most important, it is obviously difficult. This point can be explained with an example. For example, building a large sluice gate. In a stable and orderly country, the materials required, the basics required, and the completion time can all be estimated. However, under China's current unstable situation, this matter is related to politics, military, and economy, and it is no longer a simple engineering problem. Therefore, the types of information collected by the investigation team are extensive, and it is not possible to point out which data is the most important.

### The Impressions Gained in Shanghai Will Have an Official Statement

As for the investigation team's impressions in Shanghai, there will be a formal written statement issued by the US Information Service."

In other news, former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt is scheduled to fly to Nanjing by China Airlines flight this morning. The rumor that he will fly to Nanjing on the same plane as General Wedemeyer is not true.

### Control Urban Finance, Supervise and Assist in the Production and Sales of Daily Necessities, Control Interest Rates, and Crack Down on Speculation

B. Provincial and municipal banks shall report to the Ministry of Finance for approval before establishing new branches within their jurisdiction. C. Commercial banks and bureaus shall not establish public branches in areas designated by the Ministry of Finance to restrict the establishment of banks. In non-restricted areas, they shall first submit an application to the Ministry of Finance for approval in accordance with the regulations. (4) Control of interest rates. A. The Central Bank shall effectively control bank deposit interest rates in accordance with the regulations for managing bank deposit interest rates, and then control market interest rates. When necessary, interest rates may be appropriately increased to absorb financial resources. B. The interest rates on national bank deposits shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Four Banks Joint Office. C. The interest rates on commercial bank relending shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance for managing banks. (5) Cracking down on speculation. A. Crack down on illegal trading of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange. Local governments shall be responsible for strengthening inspections and rewarding informants. B. Local governments shall crack down on underground money shops and any organizations that operate financial business in disguised form. C. Supervise the business of stock exchanges and strictly prohibit off-exchange transactions. (6) Strengthen financial control and inspection work. Some of the above measures are the same as the "Measures for Strengthening Financial Control" recently announced by the Ministry of Finance, but they are even more precise. It is believed that after implementation, financial control will be effective.

### Chairman Receives American Reporters, Hoping to Jointly Find a Solution to the Problem of Inaccurate Reports and Essays to Avoid Hindering Relations

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] A group of ten American reporters, including Burton Crane, one reporter from the United Press, one reporter from the Hearst newspaper group and two escort officers, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by plane at 10:30 AM on the 27th. After being hosted at a luncheon by the chief of the US military advisory group, they visited Premier Zhang Qun. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, they attended a cocktail party held by Director Dong Xianguang of the Information Bureau at the International Recreation Club. More than 100 Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing attended and enjoyed each other's company. At 5:30 PM, they were accompanied by spokesperson Morsels of the US Embassy to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. At 7:00 PM, they attended a dinner hosted by Ambassador Stuart. They left Nanjing for Shanghai at 11:00 PM that night. The group spent the whole day in Nanjing in the hot weather, and there was almost no rest time between each program, which they found very tiring. They very much hoped to have more opportunities for free activities in Shanghai.

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] Chairman Chiang met with the American reporters on the 27th and delivered a speech, requesting joint cooperation to solve the problem of reports and essays that are prone to misunderstandings, stating that a part of the American reporters stationed in China, due to dissatisfaction with China's post-war situation, wrote reports and essays that not only criticized the incompetence of the National Government, but also misled the American public into believing that the Chinese people as a whole have no respect for value and should not enjoy the friendship of the United States and other countries. This is a serious obstacle to Sino-American cooperation and is enough to damage the honor and self-esteem of the Chinese people. I am deeply concerned. The Chinese people will always be friends of the United States and are grateful for your country's assistance. Our government welcomes any constructive criticism, but if it tends to be extreme, so as to damage the honor and self-esteem of the people, it may affect the friendly relations between the two countries. The Chairman also made his first statement on the mission of Special Envoy Wedemeyer, stating that I fully understand the importance of Sino-American relations and the significance of Wedemeyer's mission to China. The Communist Party issue will not prevent China from implementing the constitution this Christmas. The National Government will fulfill its wartime promises, create a constitutional government, and protect individual freedoms. Since Marshal Ma's mediation failed, the CCP has brazenly continued to pursue a policy of open rebellion, and it is no longer possible to resume peace talks. I hereby assure you that no matter how complex and difficult this issue is, the National Government will be able to solve it soon.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] A member of the American press corps said: The group's impression of Japan was quite good. The Japanese people all looked very docile, and the occupying forces were quite satisfied with this. The living standards of the Japanese people are very low, but there is no famine. The main purpose of MacArthur's rule in Japan at this stage is to reduce the occupying forces' annual administrative expenses of 3 million US dollars. Therefore, there are measures to allow the Japanese to whale in the Antarctic and to prepare to open up their trade. However, this is not unconditional or unrestricted. MacArthur's main plan is to enable the Japanese to have the economic conditions for independent living after the Allied forces end their occupation. For example, in the case of whaling, the Japanese fishing equipment and tools are in urgent need of reorganization and replenishment, which cannot affect Australia's interests in the short term. As for foreign trade, after the demilitarization and dismantling of heavy industry, it will be difficult for Japan to restore its pre-war imperialist style within three to five years and endanger the development of other countries' industry and commerce. They are very concerned about Chinese public opinion's criticism of MacArthur's style of governing Japan, and regret the haste of their itinerary. They were only able to see the sights on a cursory tour, and were neither able to enter the problem areas nor to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation in the places they passed through. Along the way, in addition to accepting invitations to talk and meeting with dignitaries, they were only able to catch a glimpse of the market scene in Shanghai and Nanjing from the train station. Therefore, they attach great importance to the opinions of their Chinese colleagues.

### Disasterous Drought in Yikezhao League, Sui Province Government Seeking Relief, Quickly Raising Funds to Purchase Grain to Provide Disaster Relief

[This newspaper, Gui Sui, 27th dispatch] After the Communist bandits captured Sanbian, they are actively preparing to invade Yikezhao League. Now there is a drought in Yikezhao League, and the Sui Province government is urgently seeking effective relief in order to stabilize the society of Yikezhao League. Chairman Ji of the Sui Province government convened an emergency meeting yesterday and decided to establish the Yikezhao League Drought Relief Committee to quickly raise funds to purchase grain and provide emergency relief. According to repeated reports from the three counties and seven banners of Yikezhao League, the 260,000 Mongolian and Han people in the entire territory of Yikezhao League have generally fallen into a state of famine. People and animals have already starved to death, and there have been incidents of grain robbery. It is no exaggeration to describe the current situation in Yikezhao League as "thousands of miles of red land and wailing everywhere." The Sui Province government is paying close attention to this. The Yikezhao League Drought Relief Committee will actively carry out its work.

### I Have No Intention of Squeezing Out Foreign Businesses; Welcome Friendly Nations to Invest and Offer Preferential Treatment - Remarks by a Committee Member of the National Economic Commission to a Reporter

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] During Wei Demai's (Wedemeyer) visit to Shanghai, news came from Shanghai that American businesses were quite dissatisfied with our trade policy and would take advantage of Wei's visit to Shanghai to express their grievances. On the 27th, a reporter interviewed a committee member of the National Economic Commission to inquire about his views on the matter. He said that our special attitude towards Sino-US trade can be studied from two aspects: basic policy and current phenomena. According to his personal observation, we have absolutely no discrimination against American businesses, and we have always welcomed foreign investment. Even if there are some things that are not completely satisfactory, they are not absolutely uncorrectable. In terms of basic policy, in the important documents recently announced or resolved by our authorities, not only are there no restrictions on foreign investment or doing business in China, but they are mostly welcome. In the section on utilizing foreign capital in the "Implementation Principles of the Industrial Construction Program," there are detailed provisions on how to utilize foreign capital, allowing foreign investment in joint ventures in industrial and mining enterprises, allowing foreign investment in private enterprises, and allowing foreigners to invest in and operate businesses independently in China. It is also clearly stipulated that "foreign investment in joint ventures in China shall be fully protected by the Chinese government." Furthermore, in terms of the "First Phase Economic Construction Principles," it is also stipulated that "the proportion of foreign investment in Sino-foreign joint ventures shall not be subject to fixed restrictions, and the selection of general managers of company organizations shall not be limited to nationals, except for the chairman of the board. After review and approval by the government according to the overall construction plan, state-owned enterprises may negotiate with foreign countries for loans or foreign investment by the competent authorities, and private enterprises may also negotiate on their own." In addition, the preamble to the "Economic Reform Plan" recently passed by the National Economic Commission also clearly stipulates that "foreign capital and technical personnel are welcomed in a preferential manner to achieve industrialization." At a recent meeting of the Economic Commission to discuss foreign investment in China, it was stipulated in the industrial policy that all kinds of industries, except for national defense industries and some monopolistic industries, are welcome to American direct investment. The financial policy department stipulates that the taxes and fees levied on foreign businesses operating in our territory should be the same as those for our own people. American businesses can remit a portion of the profits earned from industrial investment in China, and it is stipulated that new tax rules or special regulations will not be promulgated that would hinder the acquisition of profits. From the above decisions, it can be seen that our basic policy expresses welcome and protection for foreign investment, and there should be no discrimination against American businesses.

He continued to point out that, in terms of the current situation, it is undeniable that there are many unsatisfactory aspects. However, there are some facts that seem to need to be brought to the attention of friendly nations: First of all, it should be mentioned that our country is currently in an extraordinary period, and the economic situation is particularly serious. The authorities are trying to find ways to overcome the economic difficulties. Some control measures are unavoidable measures. For example, our foreign exchange reserves are not abundant, so foreign trade cannot but be slightly restricted. Also, what we currently value is how to strengthen construction. Therefore, the import of "non-constructive" materials cannot but be restricted. All of this should not be compared to a "closed-door policy." Another thing that should be noted is that our country has not yet recovered after a long period of war, and the purchasing power of the people is greatly reduced compared to the past. If we look at the current Chinese market with the eyes of the pre-war era, it is inevitable that we will be disappointed. However, some of the measures currently adopted by China are not entirely impossible to correct. At the same time, after China is industrialized with the assistance of foreign capital, the purchasing power of the people can also be improved. It is hoped that this kind of hardship can be understood and given active assistance.

### Issues Regarding the Preliminary Peace Conference with Japan: Britain Proposes a Compromise Suggestion - Foreign Ministers of Eleven Nations Attend the Meeting

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] A reporter learned today that the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty may be represented by the foreign ministers of each country, instead of the vice ministers and experts dispatched by each country as originally suggested by the United States. Britain has suggested that the preliminary conference be a meeting of the foreign ministers of each country. However, a State Department official told the Central News Agency reporter today that this meeting will be discussed by the representatives of the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission, rather than a meeting of foreign ministers as suggested by the Soviet Union. If this meeting is a meeting of the foreign ministers of the eleven nations, then the meeting will adopt a two-thirds majority system, and the veto power cannot be applied. (The current meetings of foreign ministers can all use the veto power.) Due to the repeated delays and stalemates in the Paris and London conferences, it is believed that the United States will accept the British proposal for a meeting of the eleven nations' foreign ministers and reject the Soviet proposal for a meeting of the four foreign ministers.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 26th] The Canadian Foreign Ministry announced today that Canada believes that the US proposal to convene a preliminary discussion meeting on the Japanese peace treaty of the eleven nations on August 19 conflicts in time with the British Commonwealth's discussion meeting on the Japanese peace treaty scheduled to be held in Canberra on August 26, so it has requested the United States to postpone the date.

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] According to the Christian Science Monitor: The US proposal for the Japanese peace treaty has now been fully drafted. The newspaper quoted evidence from authoritative sources that the real debate and controversy in the future peace conference will focus on territorial matters, industrial economy, post-occupation policies, and reparations issues. The newspaper described the US position on the above issues as follows: In terms of territory, it focuses on the Ryukyu Islands (including the Greater Ryukyu Island). The United States hopes that the peace conference will reach an agreement on the US strategic trusteeship of the Ryukyu Islands, but it seems that it has not yet been decided whether it will be a partial or total trusteeship. In terms of industrial economy, the United States plans to include clauses in the peace treaty allowing Japan's economic activities and maintaining industrial standards so that Japan's productivity and industrial talent can be fully utilized. At the same time, it restricts its expansion and development direction to avoid becoming a potential military threat. In terms of post-occupation policy, the United States advocates withdrawing the occupying forces from Japan within a few months after the treaty comes into effect. The United States also believes that the Allied control over Japan after the treaty comes into effect should be carried out under the guidance of the United States. Since the United Nations cannot immediately assume supervisory responsibility, the United States suggests that various countries form their own organizations to implement supervision and control during the transition period. In terms of reparations, the United States does not object to providing assets that are easy to distribute, such as machine tools, for reparations, but opposes the large-scale dismantling of Japanese factories. The Monitor did not mention the veto power, but said: The United States believes that the procedures adopted by the peace conference should "not allow any major power to unilaterally obstruct the agreement."

### Japan Plans to Engage in Barter Trade with China, the Soviet Union, and Other Countries After Representatives of Various Countries Arrive in Japan, Suggestions Will Be Put Forward

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] According to Jiji News Agency: According to the Japanese Trade Agency's large-scale barter trade plan, Japan hopes to import 30,000 tons of open-cut coal from China every month in exchange for 20 Japanese locomotives. The barter trade plan includes China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Sweden, and the Philippines. In addition to hoping to import coal from China, Japan also wants to import iron ore from the Northeast in exchange for locomotives, rails, and other items. Japan has currently requested headquarters to exchange agricultural tools made in Japan for soybeans from the Northeast. The Trade Agency's plan intends to exchange Japanese-made wooden boats for Chinese sugar and cloth. According to the current plan for international trade, the medium of exchange is the US dollar. Japanese business people believe that this is very unfavorable to both China and Japan, and the currencies of both countries are considered "unstable." Although the movement to set an exchange rate between the United States and Japan as soon as possible has been heard, it is feared that it will not be possible to set it in time for this plan. Also, regarding the barter trade between Japan and the Soviet Union, Japan will import 110,000 tons of coal and 100,000 tons of coke by the end of this year. Currently, 1,400 tons of coke have been imported. In addition, the Soviet Union will import 20,000 cubic feet of timber to Japan this year in exchange for 295 Japanese-made wooden boats. The Soviet Union also hopes to obtain machinery worth 500 million yen from Japan, mainly textile machines, zinc, iron plates, and fishing nets. Japan originally intended to supply France with textiles and chemicals in exchange for raw materials from Vietnam, but due to the current chaos in Luan and Vietnam, this goal may be difficult to achieve. The above trade plans are still under discussion, and the purpose is that Japan can put forward concrete suggestions when senior foreign representatives come to Japan. The plan also intends to export magnesium and other light metals to the Philippines in exchange for iron ore and scrap metal. Sweden intends to exchange iron shafts for Japanese textiles.

### Beijing Municipal Council Passes Resolution Opposing Opening Trade with Japan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Beijing Municipal Council passed a temporary motion by Sun Yulin and others on the 27th, opposing opening trade with Japan. The motion put forward two reasons: (1) Because the Allied peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, according to international practice, it is not possible to trade. (2) China has suffered a lot from the destruction of industry and commerce by the Japanese during the eight-year war of resistance. At this time, we should seek gradual recovery, and how can we endure being exploited by them again? Currently, various industrial and commercial organizations in Shanghai and resident members of the Political Participation Council have protested to the government one after another. The council will also express something on behalf of the million citizens of the capital.

### Beijing Press Conference Requests Stipulations on Reporter Identity

The whole country's industry unanimously advocates

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] The articles of association of the Beijing News Reporters Association stipulate that the qualifications of members are based on the spirit of Article 1 of the News Reporters Law promulgated by the National Government on February 15, 1943. Therefore, since its establishment on September 1, 1946, the association has strictly reviewed the membership of members in accordance with the articles of association, adopting the position of "寧缺勿濫" (better to have vacancies than to accept unqualified people) and raising the status of news reporters. Recently, with the implementation of constitutional government imminent and various elections being held one after another, news reporters are an important component of free professional groups. In various elections, such as representatives to the National Assembly and legislators, the number of votes nationwide is calculated comprehensively. If there is no clear, reasonable, and fair standard for the identity of news reporters, then the election results will be far from fair, and the foundation of democratic constitutional government will not be established. The Beijing Reporters Association is aware of this. At a recent joint meeting of directors and supervisors, a motion was passed to request the relevant authorities to declare and stipulate the identity of news reporters so that there will be a standard for the whole country to follow in order to avoid and ensure fairness. In addition to submitting separate reports to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Nanjing Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Election General Office, the association also telegraphed the whole country's industry to seek unanimous advocacy.

### A Goat Leading the Way: A Record of the Establishment of the "Citizen Governance Promotion Association"

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent in Beiping, Zhang Jianmei

(1) Growth

"The Citizen Governance Promotion Association created by the cultural circles of Tianjin was established on July 19." The Chinese Municipal Engineering Society specially wrote a congratulatory message for the establishment of the Citizen Governance Promotion Association, saying: "Authoritative progressive and enlightened people in the academic community are no longer silent, and they will use "wisdom" and "truth" to promote the democratic politics of the city, so that it can have a demonstrative effect and establish a belief in the inevitable success of the national civil governance in the future. It is said that it is a major event in the north and also a major event in the whole country."

This is indeed a major event in the north and even the whole country. Hu Shi, who has been called one of the main midwives of Chinese new culture for nearly 30 years, just returned to China last year, and foreign news agencies sent telegrams one after another saying that he was going to form a new party, but Hu Shi denied it. It was not until today, a year later, that we saw the birth of a political group led by Hu Shi that started with local politics - it is the "Citizen Governance" Promotion Association. Judging from the name of the association, it should be a purely local and low-key political group, and it is just as good as the local autonomy promotion associations in various places. On the other hand, judging from Hu Shi's position in the current political society and its planned strong lineup in the cultural circles, there will be a sense of the extraordinary.

The "Citizen Governance" Promotion Association, after months of preparation under the guidance of Hu Shi and with the assistance of core figures such as Zhang Foquan, Cui Yiqin, and Yan Renying, was finally born on the afternoon of July 19. A couplet in the venue of the establishment meeting: "Seek democracy through democratic means," "Practice autonomy starting from the city," explained their主張 (主張). The hall was filled with more than a hundred people, all professors, industrialists, doctors, and youth association leaders. Except for Wu Bingxun, director of the Beiping Municipal Engineering Bureau, who attended as a member, no party, government, or military dignitaries participated, nor was there any officialdom that is typically seen at the establishment meeting of general public groups. Only eight or nine Chinese and foreign reporters were present. The presidents of the three universities that had a marriage in the Southwest Associated University, Hu Shi, Zhang Boling, and Mei Yiqi, served as the presidium. The Beiping Broadcasting Station and the China Electric Factory did not let go of this historically significant scene. The former sent people to record the past, and the speech of Chairman Hu Shi was broadcast nationwide that night; the latter sent staff to the venue to shoot a new opening film. The entire meeting process was conducted under the golden brilliance of four large mercury lamps.

(2) Nature and Motivation

"Our Citizen Governance Promotion Association is neither a local political party nor a national political party." Hu Shi, the chairman of the大会 and leader of the association, wearing a summer gown, waving a folding fan, and explaining the nature of the association in a relaxed way. "It's just an amateur gathering of citizens with jobs—our职业 (職業) [occupation] is so hard-earned that it's hard to even maintain a living as a teacher or civil servant. It's a profession that is by no means worth exaggerating—we want to gather together from time to time to participate in local public welfare undertakings, to help people develop an interest in civic governance, and to train ourselves to do a little work to promote local civic governance in a fair, open, and democratic way."

"Now is the time!" "We should unite and express our opinions on politics." Zhang Boling, an old man in his sixties, took a train from Tianjin in the morning to participate. Like a gorilla in the forests of Africa, the giant of education described a great awakening in recent decades in heavy words: "If you don't care about politics, politics will destroy you. I used to think that as long as we do a good job in education, we can save the country; but because political turmoil is uncertain, the little results of our hard work in education have been destroyed by turbulent politics. Now everyone has this awareness. Enthusiastic participation in this meeting proves that now is indeed the time for us to care about politics." The old man who has been in education for forty-nine years also denied that this is a party, "We are not for forming a party, but for the people of the whole country, and we have nothing to do with high officials and political parties."

"We must shoulder the responsibility of a goat and lead the people"! Li Zhuchen, general manager of Jiuda Flour Company, member of the Political Consultative Conference, and president of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, who had just returned from Beijing and Shanghai to petition for industry and commerce in the north, was also invited to speak. "When I went to the Northwest, I often saw groups of sheep, always led by goats. Today, everyone present is a leader. Everyone can lead dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people. If we come together, like goats, and practically lead the people, we will definitely change this society." [Sentence is incomplete and grammatically incorrect in the original text.] Li Zhuchen is a practical family [sic] and will do great things.

Li Zhuchen: General Manager of Jiuda.

Zhu [Blank]: The person in charge of Tianjin Renli Woolen Company.

Chen Bingru: General Manager of Tianjin Chunguang Flour Company.

Zhu Yangqing: General Manager of Dongya Woolen Spinning Company.

Chang Wenxi: General Manager of the Beiping Branch of the Bank of China.

Wang Shiwen: A coal magnate in the north, Wang Zhengting's younger brother.

Yang Tianshou: Member of the China Agriculture and Industry Bank.

Chen Xisan: Deputy Manager of Dongya Woolen Textile Factory.

Ren Keyi: Director and former Secretary-General of Yongli.

There are three doctors, one is Guan Songtao, the most famous brain surgeon in Beiping, one is Zhong Hui, the most famous internist, who is currently the president of the Doctors' Association. Bian Wannian is also a famous doctor in Tianjin.

There are two people in the press, one is Liu Huoxuan, former professor of the Journalism Department of Yanjing University and current president of Tianjin Yishi Daily. The other is Yan Renying, nicknamed "Sea Monster," famous in the sports world, a descendant of the Yan Fanxun family in Tianjin, a Nankai student, and current deputy manager of the Tianjin edition of Dagong Bao.

People from the Christian Youth Association, such as Prince Wen's wife, are in charge of the Beiping Women's Youth Association. In fact, many people are inseparable from the Youth Association, such as Chen Xisan, the deputy manager of Dongya Woolen Textile Company, who is also in charge of the Tianjin Youth Association. ...... As for Prince Wen, it goes without saying.

The only official government official is Tan Bingxun. He is a food expert, in charge of the rear during the war, and is currently the director of the Beiping Municipal Engineering Bureau.

Zhang Foquan, a professor of political science at Peking University and the promoter of the "Citizen Governance" Promotion Association, also explained to reporters that "Citizen Governance" is neither a party organization nor a political organization, although what is discussed are political issues. "Most of our work focuses on the meaning of education."

(3) Theory and Work

"Practice autonomy starting from the city," this is the basic advocacy of the Civic Governance Promotion Association. They said that if they believe that the intellectual level of the people in the Chinese countryside is too low, the population distribution is too scattered, and the feudal forces are too strong, once "universal suffrage" is held and "autonomy" is implemented, I am afraid that malpractice will arise and instead make rural society go backwards; then "universal suffrage" and "autonomy" are most suitable to start from the city. Convenient transportation, concentrated population, concentrated wealth, popular education, and advanced and powerful arguments are all superior conditions for implementing self-government. "Although the city also has its shortcomings, these can be overcome with its advantages." Hu Shi said: "For example, the mobility of the urban population is relatively large. Many people regard it as a hotel, and even those who have lived in Beiping for generations still print their ancestral home on their business cards and do not admit that they are people of Beiping, and they are not concerned about the municipal administration of Beiping." Then Hu said: "Although I am a Xiren from Anhui, I have lived in Beiping for a long time and am willing to be a citizen of Beiping and participate in Beiping's public affairs."

Based on these theories, the "Citizen Governance" Association has set several fairly low-key work goals:

First, investigate and record the living conditions of the city, municipal facilities, and the actual situation of civic elections.

Second, research: invite experts to jointly study municipal problems, hoping that the research results can come up with a draft of a "Municipal Autonomy Law" or a "Municipal Charter" for national discussion. In addition, the city's education, city election law, city administrative organization, and various problems and regulations related to civic governance will be studied.

Third, discussion: often hold lectures and discussion meetings on municipal administration and citizens' rights and obligations, and provide the conclusions of the discussion to the city council as laws or suggest that the city government implement them.

Fourth, learning and training: I hope to do my best to encourage ourselves and fellow citizens to fully participate in various elections.

In addition, Article 17 of the brief also has the following task: "Promote the increase of the number of urban representatives in the proportion of various elections in the central and provincial counties."

(4) Organization and Lineup

The "Citizen Governance" General Assembly is temporarily located in Beiping, and the work will first start from the cities of Beiping and Tianjin, but Tianjin has no plans to establish a separate branch.

This association has two types of members, individual members and group members. The former has less than a hundred members so far, but if we use Li Zhuchen's metaphor, these are all goats, not sheep! The latter only has two groups so far: the Beiping Federation of Trade Unions and the Beiping Branch of the Chinese Municipal Engineering Society.

In order to understand the lineup of "Citizen Governance," let's review the goats among the goat herd—the directors and supervisors!

The promoters of the establishment, especially those from the Independent Review era and Zhang Boling's Nankai cadres, are the backbone.

Hu Shi: President of Peking University.

Cui Yiqin: Professor of International Relations at Peking University, a strongman of Independent Review.

Zhang Foquan: The spokesperson of the "Citizen Governance" Association in Beiping, and also the initiator. He was the first to introduce Lasswell to China, and also a strongman of Independent Review. During the Anti-Japanese War, he once went to the rear and is now giving an overview of political science at Peking University.

Wu Jingchao: A strongman of Independent Review, who later followed Weng Wenhao into officialdom and served as a counselor in the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After Weng left the Ministry of Economic Affairs, he returned to Tsinghua to teach.

Zhang [Blank]: Municipal engineering expert, once served as a counselor of the Executive Yuan, and is now teaching at Nankai University.

Chen Xujing: Dean of Nankai University.

Wang Yuxiu: Professor of Beiping Normal College

Zhang Boling: President of Nankai.

Li Shuhua: President of the Second Beiping Research Institute, the leader of the French faction below Li Shizeng.

Mei Yibao: Professor of Yenching University.

Huang Yusheng: Director of Nankai Training, Zhang Boling's capable cadre.

Chen Daisun: Professor of Tsinghua University.

Hu Xian [Blank]: Director of the Jinsheng Biological Survey Institute, an authoritative botanist.

### US Military Police in Qingdao Stealing from Themselves; Officers and Soldiers Collude in Car Theft Case

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 26th] Chinese police have recently solved a case of US military police stealing cars for the first time, as a result of which more than a dozen US officers and soldiers have been detained by the US Military Police Headquarters. According to statistics from the US Military Police Headquarters, the number of stolen military vehicles recently, including Jeeps and trucks, has reached more than 200. The US military authorities believed that they were stolen and sold by Chinese people, but the Chinese security authorities and those familiar with the inside story know that 99% of them were directly stolen and sold by the US military. Many US military officers and generals privately sell their own vehicles, priced between 500 and 600 US dollars. After receiving the money, they report to the US Military Police Headquarters that the vehicle was stolen at a certain time and place, claiming it with great certainty. For example, at the Donghai Hotel, US sentries often collude with Chinese and foreigners, and after receiving a bribe of 200 US dollars, they can freely steal the car. The sentries then deceive their superiors with lies, saying that it was stolen. Although the US Navy's auto repair shop on Daping Road is heavily guarded by sentries and the entry and exit of vehicles must be inspected by the officer on duty, thefts still occur from time to time, which is because the officers and soldiers collude to steal the cars and share the money. The US Military Police Headquarters has been unable to find any clues in the investigation of these vehicle thefts for a long time. A person named Xu Liye, a resident of Jimo, residing at 75 Dengzhou Road, secretly informed Odao, the leader of the US Military Police Investigation Team, that he had learned about the vehicle theft situation, but requested a reward of 50 yuan before he could reveal it. Chinese police arrested Xu when he went to the US military to swindle 50 yuan. After interrogation, he confessed that he was introducing the sale of Jeeps and provided details of the US military colluding in car theft. He recently sold several Jeeps through the hands of Navy Babel of the US Port Command and a translator from a certain unit, each for more than 500 yuan. At this point, the US side also obtained preliminary clues and successively arrested US military criminals.

### Flash Flood in Xikang Province; Washed Away the Sichuan-Xikang Highway

Requires 10 Billion Yuan to Repair

[Our Newspaper, Ya'an, 26th] The Sichuan-Xikang Highway is an important transportation artery for border defense. The section from Ya'an to Kangding has recently suffered from thunderstorms and flash floods. All the large bridges along the road have been washed away completely. Even the small bridges were washed away with the water. The section from Lengzhuguan to Wasigou, because it is close to the Dadu River, all the roadbeds have been washed away, leaving only a remnant. This is an unprecedented loss due to flash floods. At the current price level, it will cost no less than 10 billion yuan to repair. In addition to rushing to repair, the provincial government is requesting subsidies.

### Disputes over Xiao Zhenying's Estate; Wang Lengqi and Others are Mediating

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] After Xiao Zhenying, the mayor of Tianjin before the Anti-Japanese War, passed away in May, disputes arose over his estate. Xiao's father, Guo Ting, recently hired a lawyer to publish a notice, warning Xiao's wife, Liu Wenying, not to handle real estate and bank property rights without authorization. Currently, Wang Lengqi and other friends of Xiao from the "July 7th" Incident are mediating, so that a lawsuit will not be filed. Xiao's father has two sons, the elder is Zhenying, and the younger is Zhenxiang, who is now a lawyer. There are fifteen houses, some land, and shares in Datong Bank. However, the land deeds are mostly in the name of Liu Wenying. Several properties in Beiping were gifted to Xiao by Song Zheyuan, but Xiao refused and his wife accepted them. Recently, Xiao's wife, fearing that her husband's brother would compete for the property, intended to sell them, which led to the dispute. Ling Changyan, the lawyer hired by Xiao's father, said: The Xiao family originally lived together. After Xiao's death, his wife served his father-in-law with coarse grains and old clothes. This old father, who is sixty or seventy years old, has been humiliated by his daughter-in-law, and Xiao's brother has also been treated unfairly. In anger, he chose to live in Tianjin. Xiao's wife agreed to pay 3 million yuan per month for living expenses, but because Xiao's father and brother wanted more, she did not agree, and the dispute gradually accumulated.

### Editorial: China's Compromise

Our country's response to the United States' proposal to convene a preliminary conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty was formally sent to Washington yesterday. There are three main points: (1) China agrees to participate in the eleven-nation preliminary conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty; however, it hopes that before the conference is held, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will hold an informal four-nation foreign ministers' conference to thoroughly exchange views on various issues related to the Japanese Peace Treaty; (2) China agrees that the preliminary conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty should adopt a two-thirds majority voting system, but hopes that this two-thirds must include China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; (3) China hopes that the formal conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty can be held in Shanghai. This response can be said to be a compromise between the US proposal and the Soviet counter-proposal. If both the US and the Soviet Union have sincerity in concluding the Japanese Peace Treaty as soon as possible, then accepting China's compromise will not be difficult to break the current deadlock in the US-Soviet dispute.

The US proposal was put forward to the relevant governments in the Far East on the 16th of this month, advocating that a preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty be convened in Washington on August 19 to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty; any resolution can be established as long as it is approved by a two-thirds majority. The sole purpose of the United States in convening a preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty outside the scope of the Far Eastern Commission is to avoid the Soviet Union exercising its veto power in the meeting from time to time, and to accelerate the drafting of the Japanese Peace Treaty. Because US Secretary of State Marshall began to consider how to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty after returning to the country from Moscow. At the same time, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo General MacArthur has repeatedly appealed to the Allied countries, asking them to speed up the drafting of the Japanese Peace Treaty. Therefore, the US government recently made this proposal. In theory, any country that hopes to see the Japanese Peace Treaty concluded successfully as soon as possible will naturally not express objections to the US proposal; however, the Soviet Union, which stands in opposition to the United States everywhere, naturally cannot express its approval of the proposal suddenly put forward by the United States. The Soviet Union's response was published on the 23rd. In addition to rejecting the US invitation to participate in the preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty, it put forward a counter-proposal: advocating that a four-nation foreign ministers' meeting of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union be convened first to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty, and then the draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty be submitted to the Far Eastern Committee for discussion. As for the date of the foreign ministers' meeting, it should be decided by the US authorities in consultation with the ambassadors of China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The sole purpose of the Soviet Union in advocating that the procedure for drafting the Japanese Peace Treaty should be the same as the procedure for drafting the peace treaties of the five countries of Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, and firmly demanding that it be conducted within the scope of the Far Eastern Commission, is to retain its privilege of exercising its veto power, in order to enhance its importance in drafting the Japanese Peace Treaty.

Therefore, the US proposal and the Soviet counter-proposal have their own effects and their own merits and demerits, and it is difficult to have hope for compromise. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on the 26th, the US government will disregard the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty and will directly preside over the convening of the preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty. If this report becomes a reality, then the US and the Soviet Union will also go their separate ways in the Far East. The formation of this situation, no matter from which angle it is observed, is ultimately the misfortune of the Far East. The final result will only benefit the defeated country; and the first to suffer will be our China. Therefore, China, located between the two major forces of the United States and the Soviet Union, should do its best to reconcile the two countries, especially at this critical moment when the two countries are dividing and merging, it is even more necessary to act as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union. This time, China's compromise contains this major role. We only hope that the politicians and diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union will broaden their horizons, not haggle over their own interests, but plan more for the long-term peace of the Far East and quickly accept the compromise put forward by our country.

In the past, we cannot deny that China has failed to fully play the role of a "bridge" between the United States and the Soviet Union like France; at the same time, we cannot deny that the United States has also failed to respect our country's valuable opinions as much as it respects France; therefore, the countries concerned in the Far East, especially China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, should all reflect on themselves for the evolution of the Far Eastern situation to this point. The crisis in the Far East is deepening day by day. If we do not plan early to eliminate it in the invisible, then the Far East will still inevitably become a source of world turmoil in the future, which is even more serious than the situation in Europe. Therefore, China's policy towards Japan, whether it is trade with Japan, compensation, or peace treaties, should be carefully studied. The Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council decided yesterday to establish a Japanese Policy Committee, which is a very meaningful thing; at the same time, we also hope that the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries can also attach special importance to our opinions.

### National Food Conference

The National Food Conference opened in the capital yesterday. Gathering the heads of various provinces together to decide on future food plans is of profound significance. Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to food administration and came to give a training in person at the opening, which was especially inspiring. Our country has always been based on agriculture. In recent years, the countryside has declined and agricultural affairs have been abandoned. Even the grain produced is often insufficient. At the convening of this National Food Conference, I would like to briefly present my views.

First, the area of cultivated land in our country is tending to decrease day by day, so there is insufficient grain production. In the past, food imports became a major input. We should actively increase food production and expand the area of cultivated land, so that we can achieve food self-sufficiency. Second, the country is now mobilizing to quell the rebellion, and the country has entered a wartime system. Grain is related to military needs and should be supplied without shortage. Third, requisitioning and borrowing is a necessary means to ensure that military needs are met, but abuses are easily caused during implementation. All responsible personnel should do their best to prevent abuses from occurring. According to news reports, the Chairman pointed out in his training that some provinces collect land taxes on a contract basis, resulting in large households not paying grain, while poor farmers bear a heavy burden. This phenomenon is particularly unreasonable and should be corrected quickly. Furthermore, the national grain production should be shared, so that the distribution of food can be reasonable.

We cannot fail to point out here that there have been quite a few disasters in various places this year. The floods in Guangdong and Guangxi have caused particularly heavy losses to the people. For these areas, land taxes should be reduced or exempted as appropriate, so that the people can live in peace. The delegates to the food conference come from various provinces and must be well aware of the hardships of the people in each province. During this mobilization period, food is a major national policy. We should take both national interests and people's livelihoods into consideration, so that the country's resources will not be depleted and the people's hardships will not be deepened. We express our respect for the hard work of the representatives who came to Beijing to attend this conference in the summer heat. We wish the representatives a healthy stay and the success of the conference.

### US Concerned About Indonesian-Dutch War: Secretary Marshall Considers Timely Action; Indonesia Urges Australia to Mediate

[United Press International, Washington, 27th] According to well-informed sources on the 27th, Secretary of State Marshall is personally deeply concerned about the Indonesian situation in order to determine whether the United States can take action to stop the Indonesian-Dutch conflict. Marshall is currently under pressure from influential figures overseas and domestically, including some officials here, to take some steps, such as acting as an arbitrator or proposing that the matter be handled by the United Nations.

According to authoritative sources, this effort alone is not enough to move Marshall, but the political situation in Asia, and even the fate of the European Recovery Program, are to some extent related to this decision. Therefore, they feel that the possibility of the United States taking action has greatly increased. Most officials here are very hopeful to clarify to the world that resolving political issues with violence, as practiced in Asia, is not in the interest of any party that adopts this method. According to US officials, this attitude towards Indonesia is not only based on humanitarian and philosophical grounds, because they also hope to advise the Koreans not to resort to violence in their hope of achieving complete independence and autonomy.

Another point that the Indonesian situation influences some of Marshall's advisors is that, in their opinion, the use of violence is a bad example when the Western world is trying to show that its way of solving human problems is superior to the Soviet communist system. On the other hand, some officials in the government here insist that the peaceful end of the long-term political dispute in Indonesia would also benefit Marshall's European Recovery Program, as this would allow Indonesia to resume exporting rare materials such as rubber, tin, oil, vegetable fat, pepper, and quinine. They say that these products are the most valuable contribution to the recovery of Europe, and it is sufficient to show that the Netherlands occupies an important position in the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] Indonesian Republic's chief diplomatic representative to Australia, Mr. Toussaint, said that Australian Prime Minister Chifley has received a telegram from the Indonesian Republic requesting his mediation and is sincerely considering the whole issue.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] Authoritative sources say that Australia is "considering" requesting the United Nations to intervene in the Indonesian-Dutch war. British officials said that Australian officials had informed the British Foreign Office of this intention, but there is apparently no concrete decision yet. A spokesman for the Australian delegation said that the country is currently maintaining close contact with British officials in London and emphasized that Australia is deeply concerned about the Indonesian war.

[Reuters, New York, 6th] The chairman of the American Indian League, Singh, today sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie, asking him to bring the Indonesian issue to the Security Council. He pointed out that the Netherlands' use of force is a destruction of peace and will be despised by all people engaged in the struggle for independence.

### Main Forces of Indonesian and Dutch Armies Make Contact

[Associated Press, Batavia, 27th] Dutch military reports today indicate that Dutch troops advancing along western Java have made contact with the main forces of the Indonesian army. The Dutch army admitted encountering resistance in some locations, but made smooth progress in most locations. The 150-mile stretch between Batavia and Cirebon has been cleared, implying that eastern Java is now firmly in Dutch hands. The Dutch army has also established local maintenance committees in the occupied areas. Whether to advance south from Semarang to attack the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, remains to be decided.

[This Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: Indonesian military sources say that the Indonesian Republican Army has captured Medan, the largest city in Sumatra, and cut off the road between the city and the Dutch port of Belawan.

[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] A Dutch military communiqué announced today that it had occupied the small port of Tegal, 50 miles west of Cirebon on the north coast of Java. The Dutch army advanced 10 miles from Lawang in eastern Java and rescued a large number of Chinese who had been detained by the Republic in Singosari. The Dutch army also occupied Prabuhan Ratu in Wonokoyo Bay and the Lamajang power plant, 20 miles south of Bandung. When the Dutch army attacked the Genuk Sari area of Semarang, the Republican army used women as "shields." The Dutch military communiqué denied that Medan had been captured by the Indonesian army.

### Indonesia Adopts Scorched Earth Policy; Losses of Overseas Chinese are Incalculable; Chiang Chia-tung Asks Indonesia to Stop Atrocities

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th] Our Consul-General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, broadcast last night, appealing to the responsible leaders of the Indonesian government and army to stop the harm to the lives and property of our overseas Chinese. He said that the atrocities of irresponsible elements in the Indonesian army will damage the reputation of the Indonesian Republic in the international community. It is the responsibility of the leaders of the Republic to prevent the slaughter, looting, and burning of neutral third parties, so as not to lose international sympathy.

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 27th] The Chinese Consulate-General in Batavia has sent a team to the front line to investigate the losses of overseas Chinese. Consul-General Chiang Chia-tung recently inspected the Dutch-occupied valleys and found that the Indonesian army had set fire to hundreds of Chinese houses when retreating. According to Mr. Bouwer, the editor-in-chief of the Dutch newspaper in Batavia, the total number of overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra is about one million, with property losses amounting to millions of dollars, and many deaths. "Thousands of people have become homeless and are begging for a living overnight."

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 26th] Observers are gradually suspecting whether the Indonesian Republic is fighting the Dutch army or the unarmed overseas Chinese. As the war gradually unfolds, it becomes increasingly obvious that the overseas Chinese are in a dilemma and have no place to stand. The Dutch army has only suffered less than a hundred deaths so far, and the Indonesian side has suffered even fewer casualties, but it is generally believed that the overseas Chinese are likely to suffer the most casualties when the war ends. In terms of property, the overseas Chinese, who are so-called third-party allies, have suffered the most losses. Observers and overseas Chinese alike believe that the Dutch and Indonesian governments and the Indonesian Republic cannot prevent soldiers from both sides from engaging in destruction, arson, and looting. This is the scorched earth tactic adopted by the Indonesian side before the Dutch army arrived, and the Dutch army cannot quickly enter the areas evacuated by the Indonesian army to reduce the losses of the overseas Chinese. Observers also expressed their heartache at the Chinese government's silence on this matter. They constantly hope that the Chinese government can issue a strong written warning to both authorities, especially the Indonesian Republic, or issue such a warning in a broadcast. People here unanimously believe that the tragic experiences of the overseas Chinese here should be reported to the world, or at least notify former Prime Minister Shahrir, who is currently on a mission for the Indonesian government in Calcutta.

### Dutch Government Allocates Funds to Aid Refugees

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th] The Dutch government has allocated 1 million guilders to be used to aid refugees in the war zone. The chairman of the Chinese General Association will be responsible for distributing this aid. In addition, our Consul-General has also generously donated 80,000 guilders to aid overseas Chinese.

### British Parliamentarians Plan to Ask Government to Guarantee No Aid to the Netherlands

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] It is learned that British Labour Party members will raise a number of questions at a meeting of the House of Commons on the 30th of this month, asking the government to provide guarantees that it will not assist the Netherlands in fighting Indonesia. Labour Party member Mr. Driberg will ask Foreign Secretary Bevin to guarantee that Britain will not supply the Netherlands with weapons and equipment, and another Labour Party member will ask Colonial Secretary Jones to guarantee that Britain will not provide the Netherlands with facilities in Singapore. He will also ask the Naval Minister when Britain will hand over the aircraft carrier "Majestic" to the Netherlands, and whether it is still planned to transfer it.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] The London Times published an article today commenting on the conflict in Indonesia, reiterating its call for a settlement through mediation. The article stated that the United Kingdom and France are trying to guide the torrent of Asian nationalism into peaceful waterways. The recent actions taken by the Netherlands in Indonesia inevitably make the United Kingdom and France feel embarrassed. No matter how serious the damage caused by the Indonesian Republic's resistance to the Netherlands is, the consequences of the Netherlands taking unexpected actions will be even more serious. The scope of the current military operations is gradually expanding, and there is already a tendency for the two countries to be at war. If we want to avoid irreparable damage to the relationship between Europe and Asia, then these military operations must be brought to an end.

### Nationwide Holiday in Burma to Mourn Fallen Leaders

[Reuters, Rangoon, 26th] Burma held a nationwide work stoppage and holiday today to mourn the seven fallen leaders. Memorial ceremonies and demonstrations were held throughout the country. British troops were ordered not to enter the city to prevent incidents. Burmese people flocked to the Great Hall where the bodies were laid to pay their respects.

### Jinnah Sternly States Determination to Support Indonesia

[Reuters, New Delhi, 26th] Pakistan Governor-General and President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, told former Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir today that the Dutch government's disregard for arbitration, declaration of war against the Indonesian Republic, and abuse of force are not tolerated by civilized countries in the world. Pakistan considers the Dutch government's action to be an unfriendly act, intended to destroy the nascent Islamic democracy of Indonesia. I believe that any just person in any freedom-loving country cannot agree with the Dutch government's unreasonable actions, and democratic people in Britain and the United States will especially express indignation. The one million Muslims in India are determined to support the Indonesian Republic's war of resistance.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 6th] Former Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Shahrir told the Indian Constituent Assembly today that the war in Java is a challenge to the whole world, especially Asian countries. Indonesians should continue to fight with all their strength, but from a military point of view, Indonesia really has little strength. What they face is 100,000 well-equipped Dutch troops.

### Australia Seeks Important Speaking Rights at Japanese Peace Conference; Evatt Wants to Obtain This Guarantee from MacArthur

[Reuters, Tokyo, 27th] The significance of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's trip to Japan has become clear today. Mr. Evatt's trip is to inform MacArthur of Australia's mission in the Japanese peace conference, which should be second only to the United States, and not to criticize the US occupation policy. Mr. Evatt is expected to reach an agreement with MacArthur on the main issues of the Japanese peace treaty. According to Mr. Warner of the Australian delegation, the idea that Mr. Evatt and MacArthur are "arguing" must be rejected. Mr. Evatt is willing to obtain behind-the-scenes information. More importantly, his visit to Japan is to obtain a guarantee that the United States and Australia will jointly have the initiative in the Japanese peace treaty. Mr. Evatt believes that Australia should not be regarded as a secondary small country. In terms of the Japanese peace treaty, Australia should be a Pacific power second only to the United States.

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 26th] The local radio station has just issued a message: The head of the Canadian delegation to Japan, at the invitation of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, MacArthur, has set off for Japan tonight.

### Australia Strictly Limits Imports of Japanese Goods

[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley announced that after the opening of trade with Japan, the items imported from Japan to Australia will be limited to main items that are not owned by Australia. As for items such as toys and ceramics, their import will be strictly prohibited.

### MacArthur Releases Occupation Report: Communist Party of Japan Has Weak Influence

[United Press International, Tokyo, 27th] MacArthur released his April occupation report on the 27th, pointing out that the Japanese Communist Party has less than 4% of the seats in the House of Representatives, and the Japanese people supported the "moderate line" in the various elections in April. The report also said that, according to Japanese statistics, the number of votes for communist candidates for governor in each state and county accounted for 1% of the total, and more than 70% of the total number of voters voted in the general election of members of the House of Representatives. According to observations by the Allied forces, there was less harassment during this election than last year. Local committees in Japan have purchased the first batch of farmland from large landowners to redistribute to tenants. The economic dynamics in all aspects of Japan have become more active, mainly because the allocation of coal has improved, but the future food panic is still a serious problem.

### Hidden Materials in Japan Worth Billions of Yen

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Mr. Hinko, a key figure in the recent "Sego Incident" in Japan, told reporters on the 27th: "Whether this incident is related to the cabinet ministers of the current cabinet, there will be a day when the truth comes out. However, during the Yoshino cabinet era, it was publicly announced that there were no hidden materials. Today, I am accusing Yu, who was responsible for the investigation, which is unexpected. According to the investigation at that time, there were thirteen military locations in the Japanese mainland, each with at least nearly 300 million yen of materials destroyed by soldiers and bureaucrats, and more than 150 letters of complaints and reports have been received. I am determined to submit all these materials to the Special Investigation Committee on Hidden Materials of the National Assembly, in order to clarify the truth."

### Assassination of Korean Leftist Leader; Murderer Apprehended

[Reuters, Seoul, 16th] A 19-year-old Korean youth, Han Jae-neung (transliteration), has confessed to being the murderer of Liu Wen-yang (transliteration), the anti-communist leftist leader who was assassinated in Seoul on July 18. Han Jae-neung recently came to South Korea from the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea.

### US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal Transferred to Minister of Defense; Truman Signs the Army-Navy-Air Force Merger Bill

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] President Truman signed the Army-Navy-Air Force merger bill today, transferring Secretary of the Navy Forrestal to Minister of Defense, and issuing an executive order stipulating the powers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force departments of the Ministry of Defense. Truman had already learned that his old mother was getting old and frail and was about to die, and he urgently needed to return to his hometown to visit her. Because of the signing of this bill, he delayed his departure by 17 minutes. The reason why the President was eager to sign it was said to be to have the Senate approve Forrestal's appointment as Minister of Defense before the summer recess.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Truman today recommended Forrestal to the Senate as Minister of Defense. Mr. Forrestal is 55 years old. He served as Undersecretary of the Navy from 1940 to 1944, and as Secretary of the Navy from 1944 to the present. He is the only remaining figure in the Roosevelt cabinet.

### US Congress Adjourns; Reopens in Early January

Congress and the Government Can Still Cooperate

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The first session of the 80th US Congress ended today. There are very few major legislative bills that have been passed. Many major international and domestic issues, most notably the Marshall Plan, have not been resolved. According to members of Congress, whether or not they will be called to Washington for a special session during the recess to discuss the European Recovery Program, the first thing to be discussed at the beginning of the second session in early January next year will be a large-scale foreign aid plan that requires huge expenditures. In this session of Congress, although the Republican Party has a majority advantage for the first time in fifteen years, the conflict between Congress and the Democratic government is not as serious as generally expected. In foreign affairs, the State Department has quickly put forward many policies and passed them by Congress, including the 400 million yuan aid to Greece and Turkey under the Truman Doctrine, the 350 million yuan relief to war-torn countries in Europe and Asia, and the treaties with the former Axis satellite countries drafted by former Secretary of State Byrnes. On the domestic front, Truman has won the battle with the Republicans over the reduction of personal income tax, and the tax cut bill was finally vetoed by the President. However, the President's veto was overturned by both houses of Congress on the bill to restrict the activities of trade unions. When Congress adjourned yesterday, there were still some bills supported by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, such as raising the limit on the entry of exiled people, which were still in the committee stage, and it is expected that there will still be many difficulties when the discussions continue in January next year. Republican members of Congress, while preparing to return home, have all stated that before civilians in the United States receive a reduction in income tax expenditures, relief to Europe cannot be approved. Reducing income tax is one of the slogans of the Republican campaign, so it is expected that the foreign aid plan, which requires huge expenditures, will be difficult to pass smoothly when the second session of Congress reconvenes next year.

### US Congress Passes Foreign Aid Funds

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] A bill on the United States' aid to foreign countries with 165.7 million yuan was approved by the Congressional Mixed Committee yesterday, and was returned to President Truman for signature by the Senate today.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The House of Representatives today passed the funds needed for the government's foreign aid plan, totaling 1.657 billion US dollars, which is 256 million US dollars less than the amount requested by President Truman, including 400 million yuan for aid to Greece and Turkey, 332 million yuan for relief to war-torn countries, 600 million yuan for military administrative expenses and relief in occupied areas, and 73.33614 million US dollars for international refugee organizations and other expenses.

### US Senate to Form Committee to Visit Europe

In Order to Implement Secretary Marshall's Aid to Europe Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] The US Senate Appropriations Committee held a special meeting today to discuss whether it is possible to send a committee to Europe to study the European needs for the implementation of the Marshall Aid to Europe Plan. Republican Senator Bridges declared that the United States' participation in the Aid to Europe Plan is a very important decision. It is expected that the Senate will soon announce the establishment of the above-mentioned committee, with Bridges as chairman and Senate Republican leader Wiley also as one of the representatives.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] The US Senate today authorized the Legal Committee to investigate the issue of refugees in Europe, in order to amend the current US immigration laws. The committee will first discuss the draft bill proposed by Stratton to allow 400,000 refugees to enter the country within four years, and the recommendations that the United States will accept according to the International Refugee Organization, and then prepare a report to be submitted to the next session of Congress for discussion.

### President Truman's Mother Dies; President Rushes Back to Hometown; Bad News Arrives En Route

[Reuters, New York, 26th] President Truman's mother passed away at her home in Grandview, Missouri, at 5:30 pm Standard Time on the 26th, at the age of 94. The President had already rushed from Washington by special plane. He received a radio message in the plane that his mother had passed away. The old lady fell and injured her hip in February, and her condition worsened in May. The old lady was deeply loved by the American people. After her son succeeded as President, she only went to the White House once in May 1945. She was usually indifferent to fame and fortune and did not pursue luxury because of her son's prominence. She lived in a wooden house in Grandview, Missouri, in her later years. The old lady came from a prominent family. She was the daughter of a farmer in Western Seaport Station, Missouri, and there were nine brothers and sisters. Her property was completely destroyed during the Civil War. Later, she married a neighboring farmer and gave birth to a son, Truman. It is said that the President, from his childhood apprenticeship in a chemical store to the present day, often consulted his mother when he needed to make decisions. When major events occurred, the President always informed his mother by telephone from the White House first. The old lady knew about the surrender of Germany and Japan before it happened. The old lady's name was Martha, and she was born in Western Seaport Station, Missouri. There were nine siblings. Although the old lady was old, she was energetic. She fractured her hip in a fall on February 13 this year, and her illness recurred in May. Her condition was once critical, and the President attended to her bedside for 12 days, but it improved again. According to the old lady's doctor, Dr. Green, the old lady had been in a coma since last night, so he informed the President by telephone today that she might not be able to get through tonight. The President immediately rushed back after receiving the news, but it was too late. When the old lady went to Washington in May 1945, she was deeply disturbed to see a large number of officials, diplomats, and army and navy generals waiting at the airport. She said on the spot, "If I had known about such a scene, I would never have come here." She never went to the White House again afterward. When the old lady lived in Grandview, her daughter, Miss Mancey, was with her. The President served his mother from childhood until he grew up, and still often learned from her. Therefore, biographers have called the old lady the leading force in President Truman's life.

[United Press International, Grandview, Missouri, 26th] It is learned that the funeral of President Truman's mother is scheduled to be held at 3:00 pm on the 28th in the wooden house where she lived.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The House of Representatives today passed a resolution expressing condolences for the death of President Truman's mother, and all members stood up and remained silent in mourning. Senator Barkley announced the bad news in the Senate, praising the old lady as one of the finest figures in American history and a typical mother. It is especially commendable that the old lady was not proud because of her son's prominence.

### A Sketch of the Soviet Zone in Germany

Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Translation Department

The Soviet authorities in Berlin are preparing to divide Europe and Germany, making the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan more concrete. Stalin's right-hand man, Beria, has recently arrived in Berlin to complete a massive Soviet propaganda apparatus. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also preparing to draw down the "Iron Curtain," isolating the Soviet occupation zone of Germany from the outside world, as another concrete manifestation of its refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan. The Soviet Union has already established a totalitarian government there completely controlled by the German Communist Party. What follows is a combined and abridged translation of two reports from Donald, the Berlin bureau chief of the American magazine "Newsweek," and correspondent Howard, to provide a glimpse into the recent activities of the Soviet Union within Germany. - Translator

Number 15 Weissen See Parkstrasse in the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin is a majestic brown stone building, guarded day and night by Soviet soldiers and German police. It is a "sealed" factory, and anyone entering or leaving its doors is subject to strict searches. Inside, technical equipment such as radio facsimile telegraphs, radios, transmitters, etc., work non-stop day and night, receiving and transmitting various news items in German, Russian, and code.

This building is the headquarters of the Soviet Information Bureau and TASS, the former being the central organ of Soviet propaganda towards Germany, regularly supplying news to newspapers and radio stations in the Soviet occupation zone and Berlin. In addition, the postal section of the German Institute for Economic Issues is also located inside.

Some people believe that the Soviet Information Bureau is an organization that introduces world news to German newspapers, but in reality, this is not the case. The Soviet Information Bureau, under the guise of a news agency, regularly provides "news" to newspapers and radio stations within the Soviet occupation zone.

On the surface, the Soviet Information Bureau does not employ Germans, but in reality, it controls all the German staff of the German Institute for Social and Economic Issues, about two hundred people, who are nominally researchers, but in reality, are intelligence agents serving the Soviet Union.

These two hundred Germans have all been carefully selected and are able to convert to Soviet ideology and methods. Supervisors, nominally called "chief editors," are required to send their reports to the Moscow Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are fully responsible for the accuracy of the content of the reports. "Reporters" must adhere strictly to deadlines, and their reports must be submitted by 6:00 PM every day or sent by coded telegram. Agents in the Western-occupied zones send their intelligence through the post office to secret addresses in Berlin, which are then regularly collected by Soviet staff of the Soviet Information Bureau.

This Soviet propaganda apparatus, after months of preparation, has gradually established its foundation, and by the beginning of June of this year, all plans had been fully arranged. They sent out many letters, recruiting a large number of young intelligence agents, who have recently begun work. According to the head of the organization, Makarov, "The purpose of this new measure is to build a bridge between Germany and the Soviet Union."

Indeed, this bridge has two purposes: one is to send information about Germany, Western Europe, and the Western Allies to the Moscow Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the other is to inject Soviet propaganda into Germany.

The reporter (Donald, the Berlin bureau chief of "Newsweek," referring to himself, the following will follow this format) recalling his trip to the scenic areas of Saxony and Thuringia in the German industrial area, could not help but recall his first trip to the same area in the summer of 1939.

The only difference between the tyranny practiced here and Hitler's tyranny lies in this: in the summer of 1939, most of the German people supported Hitler's tyrannical government; today's tyranny is launched by the Soviet occupation authorities and carried out by the German Communist Party and thousands of rebels. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and everyone feels that the political atmosphere here is too suffocating. Resistance to this foreign tyranny has reignited the flames of nationalism from the Hitler era.

When an American car carrying American journalists arrived in a certain city in Germany, excited crowds began to gather, and in less than five minutes, more than two hundred people had gathered. Although we were escorted by six Soviet officials, we were soon surrounded by the crowd. The children, of course, wanted candy, but the adults exclaimed in unison, "When will the Americans come to save us again?"

Even the dullest German knows that this is impossible unless a third world war occurs, and this war may occur on the already bombed German soil. Twenty-five percent of the residents of western Germany hope that this will happen, and fifty percent believe that war is inevitable. In the Soviet occupation zone, approximately ninety percent or more of the residents seem to be hoping for the outbreak of war.

Only in this brief five-minute interlude were we able to smell some of the political atmosphere of the people behind the Iron Curtain. In addition, whether at meals, on visits, or on every stretch of the road in the eastern occupation zone, we were always guarded by Soviet officers. In Dresden, they did not allow us to watch the opera alone, and in Weimar, even the request to stroll down the street for an hour was rejected.

We visited several prominent German figures, all of whom were Communists. One elderly theology professor, Hickmann, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union in Saxony, questioned the "freedom" of the Free German Youth League. A Soviet officer standing next to him immediately gave him a stern look, and the old professor fell silent.

Another director of the Zeiss factory was even bolder. When the reporter asked about the situation in his factory on October 22, 1946, he glared at the Soviet officer next to him and then replied, "In the middle of the night, with less than four hours' notice, the occupation authorities forcibly seized three hundred skilled technicians from our factory and sent them to Soviet territory."

Such atrocities are commonplace behind the Iron Curtain in the Soviet occupation zone.

A large-scale propaganda picture posted by the Soviet side everywhere in the German Soviet occupation zone.

### Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations Stall: Failure to Reach Comprehensive Agreement; British Government to Continue Probing the Soviet Side

[Reuters, London, 27th] The British Cabinet will decide within days whether it is worthwhile to continue Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations. British Foreign Trade Secretary Wilson, the chief negotiator, will report to the Cabinet on Monday on the reasons for the breakdown of the negotiations. A Department of Commerce spokesman said yesterday that there is a high probability that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will reach an agreement on timber supplies alone. The Soviet Union has agreed to supply the United Kingdom with 53,000 units of softwood and 10,000 cubic meters of mining timber, in exchange for sawmill machinery. This agreement has been reached, but it is difficult to determine at present whether it can stand alone as an agreement.

According to Mr. Wilson, an agreement has largely been reached on trade matters, but the Soviet Union has raised financial issues as conditions for the conclusion of a trade agreement, which cannot be agreed upon. Mr. Wilson's remarks probably refer to the Soviet side's demand that the United Kingdom ease the terms of the 1941 financial agreement as a condition for the Soviet Union to lower the asking price for wheat. The financial agreement stipulates that the United Kingdom will lend the Soviet Union £55 million. The United Kingdom has agreed to reduce the interest on the loan from 2% to 1.5% after the trade agreement is concluded and to extend the repayment period. According to sources close to the government, the British government will continue to explore, through diplomatic channels, whether it is possible to reach an agreement.

### Anglo-American Meeting to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; Location: Washington, Date: Within This Week

[Reuters, London, 27th] "The Sunday Times" diplomatic correspondent said: The difficulties hindering Anglo-American negotiations on Ruhr coal production have been overcome. A group of British experts, led by Strong, the British political advisor in Germany, is expected to depart for Washington within the week to discuss issues such as the operation, production, raw materials, and prices of the Ruhr mining area with American experts.

The United Kingdom initially opposed the United States' proposal on two points: (1) The scope of the negotiations was not broad enough; (2) A solution established without French participation would hinder France's position. On the first point, the United States has agreed to accept some of the United Kingdom's opinions, so some special issues in the British occupation zone, such as the depletion of dollar foreign exchange, are also expected to be discussed at that time. Regarding the aforementioned second point, the United States has agreed to give special consideration to France's position, and will solicit France's opinions after the meeting concludes. Although a three-power conference is not planned at present, France will be informed of the progress of the meeting at any time. The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent also said: If France is willing to have the French military occupation zone participate in the Anglo-American merger agreement, the difficulties currently hindering cooperation can be easily resolved, and a three-power summit would be even more practical.

France and Belgium Express Deep Concern

### South and Bulgaria Top Leaders Meet to Promote Close Political, Military, and Economic Ties; Balkan Political Situation to Enter Important New Stage

[Reuters, Belgrade, 27th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov and Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito met in Belgrade on the 27th. Diplomatic circles attach great importance to this meeting. It is expected that the relationship between South and Bulgaria, and even the Balkan political situation, will enter an important new stage from now on.

It is understood that the nature of the talks held by the two prime ministers and their cabinet members is similar to those recently held by South with Romania. Bulgarian officials revealed that the outcome of the talks is expected to be the same as the South-Romanian talks, that is, to universally strengthen the relations between the two countries and promote economic, cultural, and political cooperation. After South and Bulgaria sign a peace treaty, a mutual assistance pact will be formally concluded. Those who came with Dimitrov included Foreign Minister Georgiev and the ministers of defense, finance, and trade. The group will stay in the South capital for a week and then visit various parts of the South. Some people believe that the Bulgarian military delegation came to the South last month and held talks with General Popovic, the chief of staff of the South, and others, indicating that the two countries will strengthen military cooperation, including the standardization of armaments.

### Bulgaria Applies to Join United Nations

[Reuters, Sofia, 26th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Lie, applying on behalf of Bulgaria to join the United Nations. The letter stated that Bulgaria is determined to accept the basic sacred principles of the United Nations Charter and the various responsibilities that member states should fulfill, and attached a statement of the achievements of the Republic of Bulgaria in resisting Germany during the occupation period, and its efforts to establish democracy after the war. Bulgaria is the fifth of the former enemy countries to apply to join the United Nations. Those who have already applied are Albania, Italy, Romania, and Austria.

### A Thousand Scientists Condemn Germ Warfare, Considering It Should Not Be Adopted by Civilized Countries

[Reuters, Copenhagen, 26th] The Fourth International Congress of Microbiology today unanimously passed a resolution condemning germ warfare tactics in the strongest terms. Nearly a thousand scientists from various countries around the world attended the conference. Among the scientists who drafted the resolution was Sir Fleming, the inventor of penicillin. The International Cell Biology Society, which was recently held in the capital of Sweden, also passed a similar resolution, but its wording was not as stern as this one. The resolution stated: "The International Congress of Microbiology believes that such barbaric tactics should absolutely not be adopted by any civilized country, and believes that global microbiologists must do their best to prevent research on germ warfare tactics." When the chairman of the conference, Danish Professor Metteesen, read out this resolution, the whole audience erupted in thunderous applause.

### Late-Night Bloodbath Outside the Cathay Theatre; Police Officers and Civilians Killed and Injured Total 16; Military Police Platoon Leader Who Caused the Incident Has Been Detained Pending Investigation; Police Chief Yu Persuaded the Student Police to Disperse This Morning

[Our Newspaper] A major bloodbath occurred last night in front of the Cathay Theatre at the intersection of Rue du Consulat and Avenue Foch, resulting in more than a dozen deaths and injuries among police officers and civilians. It is reported that at around 10 p.m. last night, a citizen went to the Cathay Theatre to purchase two tickets, but three people intended to enter to watch the movie. The ticket inspector intervened, leading to a dispute, and summoned patrol officer Lu Lingheng, badge number 6588 (a student police officer from the 7th graduating class), ordering the three moviegoers to purchase another ticket to settle the matter. At this time, six or seven military police officers stationed at the theatre suddenly stepped forward to defend the moviegoers. Lu believed that this matter was within the scope of police duties and had nothing to do with the military police. While still advising the three moviegoers to buy a ticket, the military police became furious and severely beat Lu, causing him to be injured and spit blood. Lu rushed to take a streetcar back to the New Cheng Police Substation to report the incident. Many student police officers from the 7th graduating class in the substation were very indignant upon hearing the news. At the same time, news spread to various substations, and student police officers from the 7th graduating class from substations such as the Old Zha and Huangpu substations urgently assembled and drove to the Cathay Theatre empty-handed in trucks. At this time, student police officers from the New Cheng Substation had also surged to the scene, totaling more than a hundred people. Some entered the theatre, guarding the theatre doors and verbally criticizing the military police officers who had committed the assault. The military police immediately called the Kang Deng Road military police squad for reinforcements from inside the theatre. In a short time, the military police arrived in force in trucks, numbering more than a hundred people. After getting out of the trucks, they immediately deployed defenses. At the same time, they ordered all the student police officers inside the theatre to withdraw. The student police officers refused, and a standoff ensued. The military police officers on the upper floor of the theatre immediately opened fire from the windows with Thompson machine guns, and the defending military police officers also opened fire on the police, firing dozens of shots in total. The order on the street was immediately disrupted, and the cries of panic and the sound of fleeing footsteps mixed together into a chaotic mess.

At that time, a truck with license plate number 37573, loaded with watermelons (belonging to the Xu Shenji truck company from Majiaqiao), was coming from the west. The student police officers stopped it and boarded the truck one after another. The truck immediately started moving, but the front tire of the truck had been hit by a bullet and could not move forward smoothly. Student police officer Li Zhengguang was shot and killed in the center of the road behind the truck. Two other student police officers were shot and killed in the road (one died at the intersection of Rue du Consulat). There were also two children, a boy and a girl, in the truck who were injured. In addition, more than a dozen other student police officers and civilians were injured and were immediately sent to various hospitals. By around 1 a.m. this morning, the police station received a report that four more of the student police officers sent to the hospital had died of their injuries.

After the incident occurred, Zhang Da, the chief of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, and Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the New Cheng Substation, rushed to the scene to investigate. At the same time, the student police officers were indignant and gathered at the parade ground inside the New Cheng Substation, demanding that their superiors immediately seek a reasonable resolution. Police Chief Yu Shuping rushed to the Cathay Theatre to investigate upon hearing the news. Then he went to the New Cheng Substation and, together with Chief Zhang and Chief Zhuo, spoke to the more than a hundred student police officers who were gathered and refused to disperse. According to Police Chief Yu, he had consulted with Commander Xuan, and Commander Xuan had agreed to investigate the truth and punish the perpetrators severely. The student police officers dispersed at around 3 a.m. this morning.

[Another Report] Li Yutai, the military police platoon leader who initially stepped forward to interfere and caused the incident in the theatre, has been detained pending investigation.

Investigation of Deaths and Injuries in Various Hospitals

The following is a record of the deaths and injuries obtained by reporters from various hospitals: (1) Renji Hospital: Two police officers were admitted, one with a gunshot wound to the head and one with a gunshot wound to the chest, both of whom died of their injuries.

### Former Abbot of Longhua Temple, Yongchan, Suspected of Being a Traitor, Colluding with Japanese Monks, Promoting the Enemy's Cause

[Our Newspaper] Following the accusation of traitorship against De Wu, Yongchan, the former abbot of Longhua Temple, has also been prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. According to the indictment of the High Prosecutor's Office: The monk Yongchan, 59 years old, from Xinghua. He was originally the supervisor of Longhua Temple. Due to a dispute with the monk Huizheng over the abbacy, there was a long-standing feud. After Shanghai fell, Yongchan colluded with the Japanese monk Sato to seize the position of abbot of Longhua Temple, organized the Sino-Japanese Buddhist Association, and vigorously promoted the enemy's cause in places such as Longhua Temple, Jieyin Temple, Jingxiu Nunnery, and the Penglai Market. During his tenure as abbot, he also colluded with local powerful forces to sell land belonging to Longhua Temple without authorization. The case was reported by the monk Xuanzheng, with vivid evidence. The monks Fuqing and Jialin also testified in court, and it was consistent with the records in the approval document issued by the pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted by the complainant. It was determined that he had violated Article 3 and Article 2, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and a public prosecution was initiated according to law.

### Sun Xun, Who Escaped from Prison, Indicted Under the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors

[Report from our newspaper] Sun Xun (also written as Sun Xun), a native of Wuxi, resided at No. 8 Lexuan Lane, Xichang Lane, Suzhou. Sun originally aspired to resist Japan, but after being arrested three times, he surrendered to the enemy. In the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], he joined the No. 76 Special Service Headquarters of the puppet regime as the head of the Investigation Section, and later served as the head of the Intelligence Section of the puppet Jiangsu Experimental District in Suzhou. After the Experimental District was reorganized into the Third Branch Bureau of the puppet Political Security Bureau, he served as the head of the puppet branch bureau. He established branch bureaus or directly subordinate groups in Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Yixing, Wujiang, and Nantong, dispatching lackeys such as Ge Shengwen, Jin Dingshi, Wu Linqi, Jiang Jingyan, Quan Yang, Wang Rusen, and Li Gang to serve as heads and deputy heads of puppet branch bureaus or directly subordinate group leaders. Later, when the puppet branch bureau was reorganized into the puppet Southern Jiangsu District, he left his post and went to Nanjing, serving as an inspector of the puppet Political Security Bureau and the major general deputy director of the puppet Second Branch Bureau (overseeing four provinces). After the victory of the War of Resistance, he mixed in with the Jiangnan Special District and Special Station, and was once arrested and detained in Suzhou, but later escaped from prison. The case was transferred by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to the High Procuratorate for investigation. Sun was prosecuted according to Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.

### Dispute Arises Over the Hiring of Crew Members on the Siming Steamer; Negotiations Underway

The Chinese Seamen's Union originally had more than 100,000 members. During the War of Resistance, they served on public and private ships, assisting government agencies and the military in transporting supplies and evacuating personnel. Under enemy bombing and strafing, their efforts were no less than fighting on the battlefield. After the war, the government recognized the significant sacrifices and casualties of the seamen during the war. Therefore, it specially protected the surviving seamen, considering their wartime contributions. The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Social Affairs issued regulations stipulating that any public or private shipping company could not independently hire crew members without a referral from the Seamen's Union. Recently, the Fenghua Steamship Company purchased an old ship originally named "Baohe" from the British Jardine Matheson & Co., renamed it "Siming," and sent it to the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department for repairs. It plans to sail the Yangtze River. However, the company hired crew members for various departments on the ship without a referral from the Seamen's Union, and they boarded the ship to work. Despite repeated negotiations, the company ignored the union, causing public outrage among all the seamen, who plan to take active measures against the ship's authorities. Currently, the Chinese Seamen's Union is urging the seamen to remain calm and is negotiating with the Fenghua Steamship Company to avoid incidents.

### Public Works Bureau to Host Another Tour of the Largest Pumping Station

[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works Bureau recently hosted tours for various sectors of society to visit the seawall project and the pier construction project. Now, the large-scale pumping station at Rihui Port on Xujiahui Road has been completed and connected to electricity. It was test-run once during the last high tide, and the results were satisfactory. The bureau has scheduled another tour for various sectors of society on August 4th, which is the 18th day of the sixth lunar month, a high tide period. This is the largest pumping station in the city, requiring 275 horsepower and capable of pumping 60,000 gallons of water per hour. After the pumping station is completed, the flooding situation in the central district of the former French Concession, such as the Thirteen-Story Building and Madang Road, is expected to be alleviated.

### Heat Reaches Record High; Yesterday's Maximum was 99.9; New Typhoon Heading Towards Shanghai; Cooler Weather Expected in Two or Three Days

According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the temperature yesterday was 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit, setting a new record for the extreme heat this year. However, it is still slightly lower than the 104 degrees recorded on July 12, 1934. Therefore, in terms of individual heat, it has not broken the new record in the past 73 years. However, the highest average temperature for July in the past 73 years was 94.8 degrees. In terms of average temperature, July of this year has indeed broken the new record in the past 73 years. The reason for yesterday's record-breaking temperature is likely due to the contact between the tropical air current and the Pacific air mass along the coast of our country. The forecast for today's weather is still sunny and cloudy, and the temperature is expected to be similar to yesterday. There may be localized thunderstorms in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. According to the observatory, a new typhoon has been discovered in the western Pacific, currently located at 20 degrees north latitude and 217 degrees east longitude, with a west-northwest wind direction. Shanghai will be attacked. If the wind direction turns west-west, Shanghai will be even more severely attacked. Therefore, the observatory predicts that the weather in Shanghai will turn cooler in two or three days. However, August of this year will still be extremely hot.

### Goal for Monthly Sales of Enemy and Puppet Assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Areas Set at 50 Billion

Various enemy and puppet assets seized and confiscated by the Enemy and Puppet Assets Clearing Office are being auctioned off one after another. To accelerate the process and increase national treasury revenue, the government previously set a goal of selling 100 billion in enemy and puppet assets in the valley areas each month. The specific breakdown has recently been approved as follows: 50 billion yuan per month for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area, 24 billion yuan per month for the Tianjin area, 12 billion yuan per month for the Shandong and Qingdao area, 5 billion yuan per month for the Wuhan area, 5 billion yuan per month for the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian area, and 1 billion yuan per month for the Henan area. According to the person in charge of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Clearing Office, the enemy assets in this area are already being auctioned off, and the various rebel assets are currently being auctioned off at an accelerated pace. The monthly income may exceed 5 billion yuan. However, there are many property disputes regarding enemy and rebel assets, especially rebel assets, and thorough investigations are quite complicated. If the government could have strict regulations regarding various property disputes, it would be easier to handle, auctions could be strengthened, and national treasury revenue could be increased significantly each month.

### Reflections on Education; Zhu Jingnong Broadcasted on Jiancheng Radio Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] This newspaper held its 17th Sunday Special Broadcast at Jiancheng Radio Station yesterday, inviting Zhu Jingnong (see picture), the president of Guanghua University, to speak on "Reflections on Education." The following is a record of the main points of his speech:

Why do we run education? What is the basic spirit of education? The purpose of education is to consolidate the foundation of democratic politics. Can we achieve this goal? We now need to review this issue. I have three thoughts on this issue:

We must cultivate the spirit of love.

(1) Is the foundation of our education built on the word "love" or on the word "hate"? Education is like a farmer planting crops: you reap what you sow. If it is "education of love," the result will be love, mutual assistance, and cooperation. If it is "education of hate," the result will be mutual struggle and fratricide. Everyone knows that China is very chaotic. What is the cause of the chaos? It is because the concept of loving others has not been planted. Once I saw a slogan on the street: "We don't want anything, we only have eyes! Eyes! Hate!" How terrible, this concept of fratricide. If mankind wants to survive and develop, it must first eradicate the concept of hate and cultivate the spirit of love. The core of Chinese morality is "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace." Loving the country is loyalty, and loving parents is filial piety. Benevolence is loving people and things, and loving friends requires trustworthiness. Loving the world can lead to true peace. Therefore, the center of these eight words is the word "love." Those of us who run education must plant the seeds of love and cultivate the spirit of love.

We must have the spirit of abiding by the law.

(2) What holds together many people with different opinions in a democratic country? It is the spirit of abiding by the law. The constitution must be followed by everyone to be effective. Young people must develop the spirit of abiding by the law in school. If everyone abides by the law, we can guarantee democratic politics. Without abiding by the law, the constitution is just a piece of paper. Let me give two examples to show the spirit of abiding by the law in other countries. (1) Last year, there was a major coal miners' strike in the United States. Because the lives of people across the country were greatly affected, the court issued an order requiring the strike to end by a certain date, otherwise legal sanctions would be imposed. The chairman of the strike committee obeyed the order and ended the strike on time. (2) The car of Mrs. Roosevelt, the former president of the United States, injured someone. The court summoned and prosecuted her in the same way and revoked her car registration. Mrs. Roosevelt complied and never used her status to evade responsibility. What China lacks is the spirit of abiding by the law. For example, when taking school exams, people don't rely on their knowledge but ask people to write letters and plead for special favors. Last time, I saw in the newspaper that students were rioting in court, making it impossible to start the trial. These are all phenomena of not abiding by the law. Those of us who run education must cultivate the spirit of abiding by the law in young people to help consolidate the foundation of democratic politics.

We must have the demeanor of statesmen.

(3) We should cultivate young people with the demeanor of statesmen through education. We must respect the personality of those who share our views, and we must also respect the personality of those who disagree with us. Kant said: "A gentleman respects the personality of the other party." This sentence is worthy of our deep thought. The habit of our people is to praise those who agree with us as saints, and to scold, insult, expose private affairs, spread rumors, and use all means to attack those who disagree with us. Everyone uses various methods to destroy the reputation of the other party in order to win the leadership. This is a terrible phenomenon. We must have a spirit of tolerance and be able to accommodate various different opinions to cultivate the demeanor of statesmen to establish democratic politics. The above is a very disorganized discussion of three thoughts on current education: (1) We must cultivate the spirit of love, (2) We must have the spirit of abiding by the law, and (3) We must have the demeanor of statesmen. Whether the above three points can be achieved depends on whether we who are educated can lead by example. Therefore, I feel that those who run education should have several attitudes in order to lead young people.

Those engaged in education should have six spirits.

Running education is not for wealth or fame. Education is a difficult career. Those who run education must have the following six spirits: (1) The compassion to save the world. Education is difficult and requires the spirit of enduring humiliation, bearing heavy burdens, and not being afraid of sacrifice. (2) The habit of reading. Education is a kind of growth. You yourself must grow every day to help others grow. Therefore, you must constantly strive for progress in learning. (3) The enthusiasm for transformation. Running education is not about being conservative. You must actively improve the unsatisfactory aspects of the education field. (4) The ability to influence. Running education is like a loving mother treating her children: be kind, tolerant, and benevolent to educate the next generation of young people. (5) Noble ideals. Confucius said: "A scholar who is determined to pursue the truth and is ashamed of wearing poor clothes and eating poor food is not worth discussing with." Because of noble ideals, you will not haggle over the difficulties and hardships of the moment. (6) Strong physique. Education is a difficult and demanding career. Without a strong physique, you cannot shoulder the heavy responsibility of education. The above six points are the spirits that we who run education should have. With this, we can effectively guide and educate young people in a patient and systematic way.

Let us who run education now review what results have been achieved in decades of education. Has people's hearts changed? At this time when democratic politics is beginning to be built, we who run education should discuss a common goal and move forward.

### Robbery of Firearms on Kuangchang, Xibaoxing Road at Midnight

[Report from our newspaper] A robbery of firearms occurred last night at 0:50 AM on Kuangchang, near the Baoshan Road Bridge at the end of Zhabei's Xibaoxing Road, opposite street light number 24. Hu Shunkang, 38 years old, who lived at No. 11, Lane 538, Wujin Road, a senior employee at the British-owned Jardine Matheson Packing Factory and the captain of the third team of the second squadron of the Jiangning District Police Brigade, was accompanying his friend Tao from a banquet when the incident occurred. Hu hired a rickshaw to accompany Tao home because Tao lived in a remote area. When the rickshaw arrived at the location, two people jumped out of the darkness, brandishing handguns. One robber discovered a handgun that Hu was carrying, along with six bullets, and robbed them all. Afterward, the victim reported the incident to the North Sichuan Road Police Station. It is reported that half an hour before the incident, Wang Xueming, a member of the fifth platoon of the second squadron of the second battalion of the Central Military Officers, was also robbed of a gold watch, a pen, and 300,000 yuan in cash at the same location when he was returning to the North Railway Station after dropping off a friend. It is feared that the robbers are the same gang.

### Reduction or Exemption of Municipal Construction Donations for Cultural, Charitable, and Educational Institutions; The Municipal Finance Bureau Has Drafted Six Measures

### Lucky Ones After Victory: Rongfeng Factory Expanding; Monthly Production of 50,000 Bolts of Fine Cloth; Difficulty is Insufficient Cotton Allocation

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Rongfeng Yarn Factory was established in June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, and it has now been over nine years. Among general yarn factories, it is still quite young. It was born under the bayonets of the enemy, struggling for a full seven years, and after victory, it finally received support from the motherland. Within two years, Rongfeng Yarn Factory greatly expanded.

Initially, it only had 11,000 spindles. In the 29th year of the Republic of China, it increased to 20,400 spindles and 420 looms. In the 32nd year, the textile industry was suppressed by the enemy and could not develop, so a paper mill was established separately. In May of the 33rd year, it merged with the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory. At that time, the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory had been shut down due to serious damage by the Japanese army. In September of the 34th year, Rongfeng took over, and after major repairs, it was renamed Rongfeng Second Factory and started operation. There were 10,800 spindles, 620 looms, and complete bleaching, dyeing, and printing equipment.

The Second Factory is located at 11282 Zhulu Road, covering an area of 47 mu. It is currently undergoing large-scale construction, building new factory buildings, and expanding cotton spinning and dyeing and printing equipment. They also have an attached iron factory and a sand factory, specializing in the manufacturing of spindles and textile machinery parts. Currently, they have products with good results, not inferior to imported goods. It is a pity that they cannot yet produce in large quantities. However, they have a goal to manufacture their own spinning machines, weaving machines, and all textile printing and dyeing steel parts, becoming self-sufficient. The general management office of Rongfeng Yarn Factory has drafted a detailed plan, proceeding step by step, and has already achieved initial success.

Rongfeng's development can truly be described as "rapid." It has only been two years since the victory. Their production capacity, compared with the long-established Wing On Textile Factory, is already in a ratio of five to one. Their First Factory produces 20-count Golden Bridge yarn, coarse cloth, coarse twill, serge, khaki, and the paper mill produces yarn wrapping paper and glazed paper. The yarn production is about 1,000 pieces per month, the cloth production is about 22,000 bolts, and the paper production is about 180,000 pounds. The Second Factory produces about 600 pieces of 20-count Golden Bridge yarn per month, and about 30,000 bolts of Bumble Bee fine cloth. The bleaching and dyeing department operates day and night, and can bleach and dye 8,000 bolts of fine cloth per day. Currently, due to various restrictions, it cannot be fully operational, so it can only bleach and dye 2,000 bolts per week.

The procurement of raw materials, coal, and electricity is currently the biggest challenge. The two factories consume 6,000 dan of cotton per month, but the government authorities allocate a limited amount, and the cotton reserves are gradually decreasing. The only remedy is to purchase domestic cotton to supplement. However, the price of domestic cotton is higher, so the production cost also increases.

The reporter visited the Second Factory. The brand-new white stone walls and the brand-new factory buildings inside the walls immediately indicate that this is a vibrant factory. Everywhere on the ground are wood, cement, and lime. Masons and carpenters work rhythmically, echoing the rumbling of machines. The female workers who have finished work quietly pass by on one side. The staff in the factory director's office and the workers among the machines do not relax their tense working mood because of visitors.

The reporter took a quick tour from the cotton pile stack to the cotton mixing and opening, steel wire machines (carding machines), cotton slivers, roving, fine yarn, sizing, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and to the bundled cloth ready for shipment. Factory Director Jin Delin told me: "Everyone here gets along very well, and there are no labor-management disputes, because the factory really takes care of the workers' welfare at all times." He also wanted me to see their newly built worker's restaurant, and the factory director smiled and said to me: "Isn't it more exquisite than the restaurant in a university?" I smiled and nodded.

### Promoting Eastern Art Lacquer Carving; Wu Songgao Plans an Exhibition First, Then Mass Production for Overseas Sales

[Report from This Newspaper] Wu Songgao, a Chinese radio expert, studied radio in the United States for 19 years, with innovative inventions and a prominent reputation abroad. Several years before the Anti-Japanese War, Wu returned to China and set up a factory on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, with excellent results, surpassing even the best British and American radios. During the Anti-Japanese War, Wu lived in seclusion in Shanghai, assisting the government in secret work, supplying many transceivers, and inventing electrical codes. He secretly set up radio stations in Ping, Shanghai, and Chongqing to communicate news, making great contributions. During this period, in order to avoid the attention of the enemy and puppets, Wu used art carvings to disguise radio equipment, which sparked his interest. He then engaged in research that combined science, art, and handicrafts, and invented five-color paint. Over ten years, he created a wide array of radio art pieces.

Yesterday, the reporter was invited to visit Wu's residence. The items on display were all brightly colored and exquisitely patterned. The radio was hidden in the shells of various carved objects. For example, under a rectangular large goldfish tank, an object resembling a fir wood cabinet was actually a 19-tube long and short wave radio. A radio was also installed in a seven-story pagoda. Another spherical globe was another form of a six-tube radio. The carvings mostly featured dragons, phoenixes, flowers, birds, fairies, landscapes, and other ancient patterns, lacquered with five-color paint. They can truly be called representatives of Eastern art. Therefore, in addition to the enjoyment of radio broadcasting, the patterns and forms make them the best decorations for a room. In addition to radios, there are also art pieces such as screens, jewelry boxes, handbags, and tea trays, as well as safe door locks that can be opened using numerical codes, all ingeniously crafted and very impressive.

Wu plans to mass-produce these artworks for overseas sales and intends to hold an exhibition first. He believes that the artistic transformation of these scientific and mechanical products can reduce the world's desire for power and disputes.

Various radio casings are intricately carved with different styles. (Photo by this newspaper)

### Tears of a Woman; Blood of a Neighbor; Speaking Out for Justice Leads to Disaster; An Axe to the Head; Zhang Songtao's Life is in Danger

[Report from This Newspaper] Lin Yuxia, a woman from Haimen, 21 years old, with a secondary education, lives in No. 3 Zhongxing Lane, Baoshang Road, Zhabei. Lin has many boyfriends. Every evening, she goes out to invite friends to her house for entertainment. Ying Ayu, the second landlord, hated this very much. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, she warned Lin not to associate with her boyfriends in the future to avoid disturbing people's dreams late at night. However, Lin felt insulted and went to her fellow villager Ding Qitai to complain, asking for a way to retaliate. Ding then gathered many people that evening, each carrying weapons such as axes, and broke into Ying Ayu's house, wantonly destroying furniture. The scene was chaotic. At this time, a neighbor, Zhang Songtao, arrived and spoke out for justice, which angered them. Ding Qitai used an axe to violently chop Zhang's head, fracturing the skull in a wound three inches deep, with blood flowing non-stop. The assailants saw the enormity of the disaster and fled in a panic. The North Station Police Branch Bureau, after receiving the report, sent personnel to investigate. They also sent the injured person to Jiming Hospital for treatment, where his life is in danger. Lin fled without a trace after the incident. It was also found that Lin's boyfriend, Wang Yaoting (a clerk at the Daye Customs Brokerage Firm on Zhongzheng East Road), was heavily suspected. Wang was arrested at his address and taken to the bureau for questioning. He confessed that Lin was hiding at No. 111 Qinghua Lane, Yongxing Road, and she was eventually captured. The murderer Ding Qitai is at large, and the North Station Police Bureau is tracking him down.

### Ministry of Education Formulates Precautions for Raising Funds for National Schools

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education has formulated precautions for raising funds for national schools in all provinces and cities in the future and has sent a telegram to all education bureaus for implementation: (1) Due to the difficulty of local finances for national education funds, in addition to raising funds for interest to make up for the shortfall, the following items should continue to be handled: (A) Regulations such as the method of persuading temples and caves to donate property to be used as school funds, the organizational charter of the fund management committee, the method of county inspectors supervising the raising of funds, and the detailed rules for local schools to use the funds, which have been formulated, should be strictly implemented. Those that have not been formulated should be formulated and reported for approval and implementation as soon as possible. (B) Stipulate the amount to be raised within the 36th academic year and complete it within the time limit. (C) Introduce effective fundraising methods from various places. (D) Expand publicity, mobilize forces from all parties, and actively raise funds. (E) Reward personnel who have contributed to raising funds in the previous year. (F) After the funds are used to purchase property, complete the transfer, draw up maps, and report and announce them. (G) Check and report the amount of funds raised in the previous year and report to the Ministry for filing. (2) For the funds that have been raised by each school, since the implementation of the method of sorting out public funds and properties, some localities have misinterpreted the sorting out laws and regarded education funds as ordinary public properties, which are managed uniformly by the county and city. This should be corrected. (3) As the amount of funds raised by each school increases day by day, the management and use of funds should be strengthened: (A) If the management committee has not been established, it should be established as soon as possible and strive for a sound organization. (B) The management committee should hire local elders to participate. (C) Prices fluctuate from time to time. The funds raised should be planned for use, with the principle of purchasing real estate as the main principle. Other methods, such as building school warehouses, storing grain or fertilizer, which have been effectively implemented in various places, can also be adopted. The above items can be considered based on local conditions, and detailed methods for the management and use of school funds can be formulated and submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation.

### Representatives of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Federation; Petition the Municipal Council; Speaker Pan Personally Receives and Instructs Three Points

[Dahua News Agency] The Representatives' Meeting of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Federation previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council, and on the morning of the 26th of this month at 10:00 AM, Xi Zhengfu, Gu Risan, Li Youzhang, Zhu Lie, Zhang Zhihua, Xu Ziling, Li Zhanren, Cao Junshi, Mao Wenpei, Huang Shiping and other ten people paid a visit to Speaker Pan. First, the representatives explained to Speaker Shen their gratitude for the Municipal Council's passage of regulations on advanced training fees and increased education and youth funding. They then made three oral requests, to which Speaker Pan gave his opinions one by one as follows: (1) The teacher advanced training fees had already been approved by the Municipal Council, which sympathized with the difficult lives of teachers. The Education Bureau had previously reported that 3.6 billion yuan of advanced training fees for this semester had been distributed to teachers in various schools. If there are insufficient funds now, the competent authorities should be responsible for raising them. Starting from August, based on the current markup of 1,800 times, the future increase in advanced training fees will be in the ratio of 11 to 18. That is, those who previously received 100,000 yuan per month should receive about 170,000 yuan per month in the next term. In short, I personally sympathize with the difficult lives of teachers. (2) Some places have already adopted methods such as collecting school rice, meal allowances, and teacher respect money to make up for the difficult lives of teachers. This city may also be able to adopt this method. However, the amount to be collected and the principles of distribution should be carefully studied, and fairness should be the main principle. Otherwise, disputes will arise and cause trouble. If the proposal is approved and implemented in the future, the procedures for the distribution of the money collected should be as quick as possible. (3) Education should be based on adapting to national conditions and taking into account the students themselves. All those responsible for the practical work of education should specifically ask the authorities to pay attention to various problems based on experience and facts. At present, the two issues that urgently need to be addressed in Shanghai's current education are: (1) how to make students physically healthy, have good conduct, and not be infected with current customs; (2) how to reduce the complicated subjects for students so that they can be trained with basic methods of learning. The representatives were deeply moved by Speaker Pan's earnest instructions.

Yesterday was the 50th birthday of Mr. Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the National Art Association. Art circles of the city all went to the bookstore at No. 47 Shaoxing Road to offer their congratulations. The picture shows Zhang Daofan giving his thanks. (Photo by China News Agency)

### Ministry of Education Issues Order Specifying; Fee Standards for Private Middle and Elementary Schools; High School Tuition Must Not Exceed 400,000 Yuan; Districts Such as Beijing and Shanghai May Collect the Highest Figures as Specified

[China News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education recently stated that private middle and elementary schools in various places are currently enrolling students, and some will start school soon. In order to avoid exploiting students by excessively charging fees or raising tuition standards, affecting too many students from dropping out of school, a special order was issued to the education authorities of all provinces and cities to specify the fee standards for private middle and elementary schools as follows: (1) High school tuition fees must not exceed 400,000 yuan; (2) Junior high school fees shall not exceed 350,000 yuan; (3) The maximum fee for private senior elementary schools is 250,000 yuan; (4) The fee for junior elementary schools is 200,000 yuan. As for the specific figures, the local education authorities must reduce or increase them based on local prices and cost of living. In areas such as Shanghai and Nanjing, the price index is the highest, and the highest figures specified may be collected. In the Tianjin-Beijing area, these figures should be reduced by 15%. The standards for collecting miscellaneous fees may be appropriately increased by 50% with reference to the previously issued standards for public schools, namely: (1) Primary school miscellaneous fees are 20,000 yuan, and library fees, sports fees, and scout fees are 10,000 yuan in total. (2) Middle school sports fees are 10,000 yuan, library fees are 10,000 yuan, and lecture notes and printing fees are 10,000 yuan. High school dormitory inspection fees are 20,000 yuan, and junior high school scout fees are 5,000 yuan. In addition, water and electricity fees for boarding students are uniformly 50,000 yuan per semester. If there are other names for charging fees, the local education authorities should be responsible for thoroughly investigating and strictly handling them. If it is necessary to collect additional fees due to facts and environmental factors, it must also be approved by the competent authorities. The Ministry of Education will send personnel to supervise and inspect them at any time.

### A Solid and Practical Institution of Learning: National Tongji University

— Qi Jufu

Tongji University was founded four years before the Republic of China, and it has a history of forty years. In the past forty years, it has made two major contributions: First, in academics, it promoted Sino-German cultural exchange; second, in technology, it saved people—patients (a major contribution from medical students) and also killed people—enemies (Tongji engineering graduates mostly served in the arms industry). Therefore, after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, some people proposed that it be renamed the National Defense University. (During the war, most of China's more than fifty arms factories, with the exception of one or two, were headed by Tongji alumni, and the magnitude of their contribution can be imagined.)

Looking back to the pre-war era, if someone went to Wusong, they would surely see a large area of brilliant German-style buildings, sparsely and densely hidden among lush greenery. Among these buildings stood a tall chimney, which was the National Tongji University, renowned for its medical and engineering programs, and its affiliated factories. However, unfortunately, precisely because its contributions were in specific areas, as soon as the "August 13th" war broke out, its fate was sealed. In a few days, a magnificent academy was completely destroyed by the enemy's navy with concentrated artillery fire. Now, not only is there not a single tile left of the original site, but it also takes a lot of effort to find out the original scope. As a result, the restored Tongji University had to be scattered throughout the suburbs of Shanghai.

Established as a National University by Order of the Ministry in the Sixteenth Year

Originally, Tongji University was founded by the German, Mr. Salong. At that time, it was called Tongji German Medical and Engineering Vocational School. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, due to the European War, it was closed by the French. The Chinese then took it back and ran it themselves, renaming it Tongji Medical and Engineering Vocational School to distinguish it from the previous name used by the Germans, but it remained a private school. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China that it was renamed National Tongji University by order of the Ministry, and in accordance with the university organizational structure, the medical department was changed to the Medical College and the engineering department to the Engineering College. Later, it was expanded and established over the years, and now it has five colleges of medicine, engineering, science, law, and literature, with a total of sixteen departments and two sections. In addition, there are affiliated senior vocational schools, affiliated senior nursing schools, and three affiliated middle schools. In addition, there are two affiliated hospitals, one named Tongji University Hospital-U.S. China Hospital, and one named Tongji University Affiliated Hospital, and a practical factory. Its scope is the largest among all colleges and universities in Shanghai.

Tongji is currently the only institution of higher learning in China that introduces Germanic culture, so its first major foreign language is German. Those who do not know German must study at the New Student Academy (i.e., the German Language Remedial Class) for one year (freshmen in the literature and law colleges are temporarily exempt from one year of German remedial instruction), and can only be promoted to the university after a rigorous examination.

Tongji's Current Education System is Different from Other Universities

Tongji's academic system is very different from that of other universities in the country. The following is an introduction to Tongji's academic system for readers: A, Science and Engineering Departments:

(1) Medical College (undivided)—divided into front and back phases, with the front phase lasting two and a half years, the back phase lasting two and a half years, and the final year being an internship. Including the first year of German remedial instruction, the total is seven years for graduation. The final examination for the first phase is extremely strict, usually presided over by an old German professor. The scope of his oral examination is very broad, which is a difficult hurdle.

(2) Engineering College—Originally, it was also divided into front and back phases, but now it adopts an academic year system. The courses for each academic year are generally assigned by the school, with no distinction between required and elective courses. Counting one year of German remedial instruction, two years of factory internship (the civil engineering and surveying departments have temporarily suspended the internship), and four years of regular courses thereafter, the total is six years for graduation. (Engineering colleges at general universities usually graduate in four years.)

(3) College of Science—Academic year system, one year of German remedial instruction, followed by four years of regular courses, for a total of five years for graduation. B, General Science Departments

(4) Law College—Tongji Law College is the only institution in China that introduces the "Continental Legal System." (According to the world's legal system, it is divided into the Continental Legal System and the Maritime Legal System. China belongs to the Continental Legal System.) It was established in accordance with the new system proposed at last year's Educational Restoration Conference. Currently, there are only four groups, namely, A Judicial Group, B Theoretical Legal Studies Group, C International Public Law, and D Administrative Law Group. In the future, it is planned to reorganize into departments. All groups adopt the credit system, emphasizing both German and English, and graduation takes four years.

(5) College of Liberal Arts—With the exception of the German Studies group in the Foreign Languages Department, which takes five years to graduate, all other departments generally take four years to graduate. The credit system is also adopted.

Knowledgeable Youths Enlist in the Army, Tongji Students are Uniquely Numerous

Because Tongji introduces Germanic culture, and its predecessor was a vocational university, the traditional spirit of Tongji is solid, simple, hardworking, and not talking much. However, being solid and simple is definitely not being rigid, working hard is definitely not working blindly, and not talking much is definitely not having nothing to say; on the contrary, as long as they recognize that it is justice, the public interest, they will work hard and do it to the end. As long as they believe that it is reactionary and destructive, such as the interests of a few, they will speak out, frankly, and loudly. I still remember that in the winter of the 33rd year, Guizhou was lost, and the capital was shaken. Chairman Chiang called on knowledgeable youths to join the army. Although all schools responded in unison, only Tongji had the most teachers and students actually participating. At that time, Tongji University had only over a thousand students, and more than six hundred of them joined the army, which was more than any other school. Later, for some reason, students from various schools returned to school midway, but almost no one from Tongji did so until the government issued a demobilization order last year, when the Tongji students finally returned.

Three Types of Extracurricular Activities, Emphasizing Academic Research

In their spare time, Tongji students' activities tend to focus on three aspects: (1) Research—They have organized reading groups, departmental academic societies, and run various wall newspapers and publications. However, most of these "associations" belong to academic research, and the wall newspapers and publications rarely involve politics (but they are not indifferent to politics). For example, the school-wide "Autonomous Week" purely reports on school news; "New Tongji Bi-Monthly" is half school news and half literature; the Engineering College's "Wildfire" is purely literature; "Riverside Grass" is a poetry journal; "Storm" is comprehensive; the Law College's "Original Man" is a law journal. "Xuguang" focuses on legal discussions and school news; "Law Society Bulletin" is purely legal papers; "Zhenbao" focuses on literature, and legal discussions; "Jian" clips current affairs reports and papers; ... This can be seen in general. (2) Art—Tongji currently has a Erhu Research Society, a Violin Society, a Harmonica Society, a Choir, a Drama Society, a Peking Opera Society, etc., which is truly a "hall of strings and recitations." (3) Sports—Tongji students have always attached great importance to sports, so although they focus on vocational studies, the physique of the average student is quite "solid." This is the result of their usual love of sports, and it is also the consistent style of Tongji students for forty years. Therefore, after returning to Shanghai, Tongji was nicknamed "Dark Horse" in university ball games, and it was no accident that it subsequently won the championships in both football and volleyball.

### The Champions of Women's Basketball from Beijing and Shanghai Meet: The Green Team Wins a Hard-Fought Victory Over the Xiang Team, 44 to 37. The First Half Ends in a 19-All Tie. The Scores Rise and Fall Sharply. The Final Quarter Decides the Game.

[Reported by this newspaper] In the nearly 100-degree humid weather, even those who sit still all day are sweating profusely and complaining about the heat, let alone a dragon-tiger battle. The Xiang team, a strong women's basketball team from Nanjing, played against the Green team, the women's basketball champion of this city, at the City Stadium last night at 8 p.m. This was the second game for the visiting team in Shanghai. The situation was tense and the scores went up and down, full of thrills. Nearly a thousand people supported the event. In a hard-fought battle, the first half ended in a 19-point tie. In the second half, the Green team scored 25 points and the Xiang team scored 18 points. As a result, the Green team won 44 to 37. Although the Xiang team lost, it was still honorable.

The three forwards of the Xiang team had excellent coordination skills, but sometimes their luck with the ball was poor, and the shots often bounced on the rim. The Green team was too nervous and slightly out of sorts. The hot weather also had an impact. The backcourt was not as good as the forwards. Although they worked hard, they still showed gaps from time to time. Liu Shouguang, Chen Bin, and Xixun were the main players of the Xiang team. The Green team relied on Liu Zhen, Dou, and Huang Mingyuan to charge forward. Details are as follows:

The Green Team Showed its Power, Leading by Only One Point

Presenting flags and taking photos have become routine pre-game procedures. Chen Bin of the Xiang team and Huang Mingyuan of the Green team presented flags to each other. The referees were Liu Hesheng and Yu Juju. The guest team started with Gao Yingying, Liu Shouguang, Xixun, Chen Bin, Wan Shunxiang, and Tan Biyun. The Green team started with Huang Mingyuan, Li Yunzhi, Liu Zhendou, Wu Ailian, Wang Weizhen, and Wu Meiyi. The Green team started with the ball. Liu Yizhen Dou scored from the left side from a distance. Because of a technical foul by Wu Ailian of the opposing team, Gao Yingying made a free throw. Huang Mingyuan of the Green team made two free throws out of one throw, taking the lead with 6 to 1. Gao Yingying of the guest team scored. Wu Meiyi of the Shanghai team fouled. Liu Shouguang scored two empty balls. Zhenshi retaliated with two points. Shouguang came back again, and the Green team led by only one point, 8 to 7. Seeing that the situation was not good, they called a timeout. Shou actually tied the score at 9-all. Huang Mingyuan was very confident with free throws and added three points through throws. Liu scored again. The Green team led by only one point, 12 to 11, in the first quarter.

The Xiang Team Surpassed the Green Team, the First Half Ended in a Tie

In the second quarter, Wan Shunxiang of the Beijing team replaced Gao Yingying. Liu Zhenshi of the Green team dribbled and scored. The Xiang team's forwards passed the ball well, but the ball luck was too bad in several attempts. Chen Bin scored from a distance. Liu Shouguang made a rotation under the guard of Wu Ailian, initially tying the score at 15-all. Zhenbin made a free throw. Chen Bin and Shouguang each scored one ball, surpassing the Green team 16 to 19. The Green team called a second timeout.

### Shanghai Industrial Association, Machine Industry League, and Other Groups Oppose Opening Trade with Japan; Yesterday's Reception for the Press Explained the Reasons for Temporarily Delaying the Opening

The Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Association, the Shanghai Machine Industry League, and other groups, to express the industrial community's position on the issue of opening trade between China and Japan, held a press conference at 3 PM on the 27th at the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road. Representatives from the Industrial Association, including Hu Boxiang and Tian Heqing, representatives from the Production Promotion Association, including Mao Shengdong, representatives from the National Goods Production and Sales Association, including Wang Xingyao, and dozens of newspaper reporters attended.

Chairman Hu Boxiang gave an opening speech, stating: "The industrial community has petitioned several times on the issue of opening trade between China and Japan, but without effect. Currently, the authorities are proceeding with sending an economic delegation to Japan, and the opening period is imminent. For the sake of survival, the industrial community is holding a symposium here today to express its solemn position and hopes the press will provide assistance."

Tian Heqing, who had returned from petitioning in Beijing, rose to report, stating: "The significant impact of opening trade between China and Japan on China's industrial community is already well-known to those in authority and need not be repeated. The reasons why the U.S. government allowed Japan to open foreign trade were (1) to restore the U.S.'s pre-war international trade position and (2) to reduce the burden on the occupying forces in Japan. The Potsdam Declaration also stipulates this. However, we do not permanently oppose opening trade with Japan; we only believe that opening now is premature. This opening of trade with Japan is due to the demands of the American people. The U.S. is a country with overproduction and needs to expand commercially. But China's situation is different. For more than two years after the victory, the national industry has been barely surviving due to the changing circumstances. The consequences after opening trade with Japan are unimaginable. Furthermore, this time, the opening is for private trade. The prices of Japanese goods being dumped in the future may be lower than other imported goods, but the profits will go to a few powerful private individuals. Besides the industrial community being directly harmed, there will be no subsidy for the country.

National Industry Inevitably Affected

According to statistics, from August 15th to the end of this year, goods that China could import from Japan amount to over 99 million U.S. dollars, while China could export to Japan about 44 million U.S. dollars, resulting in a trade deficit of over 50 million U.S. dollars. According to another statistic, the Allied Headquarters in Japan has approved Japan's export of over 50 kinds of goods, including five categories: (1) Textiles, such as linen, rayon, yarn, wool fabrics, etc.; (2) Daily necessities, such as paper, buttons, etc.; (3) Handicrafts, such as coral, ivory, carvings, etc.; (4) Chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, asphalt, etc.; (5) Electrical appliances, such as cameras, telescopes, etc. The Allied Headquarters has approved Japan's import of 28 kinds of goods: (1) Agricultural products, plants such as grains and timber, and animals such as ivory; (2) Minerals, such as bauxite, graphite, gypsum, mica, etc.; (3) Industrial raw materials, such as pig iron, quartz, sugar, salt, glue, lacquer, starch, tung oil, tallow, and intermediate products of pigments.

Based on the above two statistics, we can see the impact on our national industry after the opening of trade with Japan. What we are asking for now is not a permanent ban on opening trade with Japan. But we hope that (1) the authorities will temporarily postpone the opening and choose a suitable time to open. (2) If the government believes that opening trade with Japan is inevitable, we hope to expand the scope and manage it in a coordinated manner, with the Central Trust Bureau conducting the trade based on the principle of barter, so that the trade rights are not manipulated by a few special individuals, and bureaucratic capital profits. (3) We hope to immediately stop sending the economic delegation to Japan because the currently decided 64 business representatives cannot represent the national industry and commerce. (4) China-Japan trade will need to return to normal one day. We hope the government can work with the national industry and commerce community to organize a research committee on trade with Japan to study various technical issues. Currently, countries like England and the United States are advocating free trade, but free trade requires industrial development to a certain stage. In China's current situation, to protect the national industry, considerable restrictions and gradual progress are still needed.

Representatives Present Their Opinions

Next, Cheng Shouchong, a representative from the Machine Industry League, gave his opinion, hoping the government would actively cultivate the national industry as the foundation for completing the task of national construction. Zhang Zilian, another representative from the Machine Industry League, stated, "It is probably difficult to stop sending the economic delegation to Japan because of international influence, so we can only ask to reduce the number of representatives. As for opening trade with Japan, given the current environment of China's industrial community, it must wait at least five years. If it is opened now, it will not only be harmful and unprofitable, but the consequences will be unimaginable."

Wang Xingyao, a representative from the National Goods Production and Sales Association, believed that "If the government can properly protect the national industry, it can also deal a major blow to the dumping of Japanese goods in the future. However, the industrial community itself also needs to revitalize and propose self-help methods."

Mao Shengdong, a representative from the Production Promotion Association, and Pan Shihao, a representative from the cotton textile industry, successively gave their opinions. Mao believed that the Chinese industrial community should face the seriousness of the current issues and carefully study self-help methods. Pan specifically requested that the government improve its international trade policies and promote the importance of national attention to the use of national goods, believing that if these two points cannot be achieved, it would be difficult for the national industry to develop and grow.

Afterwards, Zhang Mengzhao, representing the private textile industry, reported on the recent situation of Japanese textile production and the impact on the Chinese textile industry after opening trade. Hu Xiyuan, based on the position of the Machine Industry League, hoped that everyone present would provide concrete suggestions to propose to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to improve issues of immediate concern, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

Ministry of Agriculture Stipulates Silkworm Egg Prices

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, it is estimated that there will be about 600,000 sheets of silkworm eggs for autumn use in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year, and they can be taken from the warehouse for acid soaking and incubation in the middle of next month. All prices of these silkworm eggs have been stipulated by the Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee: (1) New variety of silkworm eggs: 35,000 yuan per sheet, actually collected from farmers at 25,000 yuan. (2) Old variety of silkworm eggs: 25,000 yuan per sheet, actually collected from farmers at 18,000 yuan. (3) The above regulations may be appropriately adjusted in case of drastic price changes. The production amount distributed and the prescribed price will be subsidized by the provincial governments from the improvement fees collected during the silkworm season. Furthermore, silkworm egg farms in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and other provinces can produce 550,000 sheets of silkworm eggs this autumn, requiring loans of 15,000 yuan per sheet, totaling 8.25 billion yuan. The Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee will negotiate with the Four Joint Offices and the Central Agricultural Bank for loans.

### The Pig Bristle Processing Industry Association Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Passed the Constitution and Elected Directors and Supervisors

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Second District Pig Bristle Processing Industry Association, after more than a month of preparation, held its inaugural meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 3 PM yesterday. More than 100 member representatives attended, representing 97 member units.

### The Export Volume of North China's Specialty Pig Bristles Has Sharply Decreased

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Pig bristles are a major export commodity in North China, with those produced in the nine northeastern provinces being of superior quality. Due to the cold weather in the north and the abundance of miscellaneous grains, the feed is better, and the bristles are long, stiff, and elastic. According to folk customs, pigs are always slaughtered at the end of the year, so the period from October each year to June of the following year is the peak period for large shipments. Before the war, all European and American countries entrusted Tianjin foreign merchants to purchase on their behalf during this period. From March to June, the goods were collected and transported from the production areas to Tianjin and Pan Yang, packed into 50-kilogram wooden boxes, and shipped abroad by ship.

The trading procedures included delivery in Shenyang and export through Dalian, formerly known as "Dajiao," and delivery and export in Tianjin, known as "Tinjiao." Now that Dalian cannot be successfully received, all goods are concentrated in Tianjin. Before 1937, the annual export volume was generally around 50,000 boxes, with some surplus available for domestic manufacturers. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, when sea routes were not cut off, European and American countries competed to purchase, and trade was extremely prosperous. However, as the production areas fell one after another and the countryside was unsettled, production fell sharply. After Japan declared war on the United States, exports were interrupted, and the products were all purchased and sold by the Japanese. After the victory, the Communist army disrupted various places, and wars continued, and the villagers could not take care of themselves, so they had no energy to raise livestock. The production of pig bristles decreased accordingly, almost not reaching 30% of what it was before the war.

According to statistics from the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the export volume of pig bristles in recent years is about three-fifths of the export volume before the war, and part of it is likely to be wartime inventory. If this continues, and new goods are not supplied, it will not be enough to meet domestic needs, let alone foreign countries. And advanced countries such as North America have invented substitutes, so the future of China's pig bristle exports is worrisome.

The export volume of pig bristles from January to June of the 36th year and October of the 35th year is as follows: In October of the 35th year, there were a total of 32,131 boxes, worth 3,266,653,704 yuan, imported and exported to the United States, Britain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Australia. In November, there were 2,580 boxes, worth 2,831,368,705 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Sweden, and Hong Kong. In December, there were 2,392 boxes, worth 5,781,185,644 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, and Belgium. In June of the 36th year, there were more than 2,000 boxes in total, worth 1,449,918,829 yuan. In February, there were 864 boxes, worth 1,578,369,729 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Belgium, Australia, and France. In March, there were 2,065 boxes, worth 9,902,391,108 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Switzerland, Belgium, and Sweden. In April, there were 4,644 boxes, worth 21,290,617,110 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Sweden, Hong Kong, and Belgium. In May, there were 2,820 boxes, worth 12,119,838,389 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In June, there were 2,865 boxes, worth 13,076,442,076 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, and France.

### The New Stamp Tax Rate Will Be Implemented Starting August 1st

The Banking Association Stipulates Four Points to Inform Colleagues to Handle

The revised Stamp Tax Law has been promulgated and implemented by the National Government on June 6th of this year. The tax bureau has announced that starting August 1st, the new tax rate table must be strictly implemented. Because of many doubts in the annotations listed in the categories of the tax rate table, the Shanghai Banking Association proposed it through the Banking Association, and after a meeting decision, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for instructions and issued to colleagues for attention to unify the handling of the following four points:

(1) When entrusted by a branch in another location to collect money from a customer in a certain place, the receipt issued to the customer will not be stamped according to the second item (Money Receipt), but according to the eleventh item (Exchange Document), each piece will be stamped with a stamp tax ticket of 20,000 yuan. (Reason) The annotation column of the second item of the tax rate table has a proviso stating that documents related to interbank collection that are purely exchange-related between financial institutions may be stamped according to the provisions of the eleventh item of this table.

(2) When a bank collects tuition fees on behalf of a school, the school's receipt should be stamped, but the school issuing the receipt must bear the stamp tax.

(3) The document issued by the bank to the customer for receiving pledged items should be stamped with 50,000 yuan per piece according to the thirteenth item (Deposit Document).

(4) The document issued by the bank to the customer for receiving various deposits should be stamped with 20,000 yuan per piece according to the eleventh item (Deposit Receipt). (Reason) The deposit is temporarily kept on behalf of the customer and will be returned in the future, so its nature is the same as a deposit.

### Kaohsiung Port Enters a New Phase; To Be Developed as an International Trade Port; The Government Decides to Allocate Compensation Materials for Construction

[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 27th] Since the National Shipping Conference unanimously requested that Kaohsiung Port be developed as an international trade port, the status of Kaohsiung Port has entered a new stage. According to Lin Zebin, director of the Kaohsiung Port Authority, who attended this National Shipping Conference, his proposal to designate the port as an international commercial port was approved and sent to the Ministry of Communications for review. Lin stated: Kaohsiung Port directly affects our national defense economy, because many important factories of the Resources Commission are concentrated in Kaohsiung. Japan had planned to expand the area of Kaohsiung Port by five times to accommodate 100 10,000-ton ships. During the war, the United States had planned to expand Kaohsiung Port to accommodate 80 10,000-ton ships after occupying Taiwan. Today, we feel even more that the port must be restored.

Lin also stated that the government has decided to allocate cranes, dredging ships, and various machinery from compensation materials to assist the construction of Kaohsiung Port. Kaohsiung Port is 1,500 meters wide and 12 kilometers long. Except for the typhoon season from June to September, when there are showers, there is little rainfall in spring and winter, which is truly favored by heaven and earth. Originally, 10,000-ton ships could freely berth in the port, but the port is now more silted up. He has contacted the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to borrow dredging ships to assist in dredging. Currently, shipping at Kaohsiung Port is frequent and is becoming more prosperous.

### Current Salt Production in Northeast China Is Only Enough for Local Use

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Ni Haosen, director of the Northeast Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, recently came from Jin to Changchun to comfort the salt affairs personnel under his jurisdiction in Liaobei and Changji regions, who were harassed by the Communist bandits. When reporters inquired about the salt affairs issue in Northeast China, he said that during the enemy and puppet period, there were eight salt fields in Northeast China, with an annual output of about 36 million dan. After the restoration, due to damage and the chaos caused by the Communist bandits, only Yingkou and four salt fields in western Liaoning have been recovered by the National Army, totaling five places, with an annual output of about 16 to 17 million dan.

This year, Northeast China originally planned to export 2 million dan of salt, but due to various reasons, only 400,000 dan have been exported to Korea so far. In the future, if we want to export in large quantities, we can only wait for the National Army to recover the larger-scale salt fields such as Gaiping Fuxian Zhuanghe as soon as possible. Otherwise, given the current situation, it can only supply the needs of Northeast China and cannot be sold abroad. He added that the salt production in Northeast China accounts for about half of the country's total. If it can be improved and increased, the future will be limitless.

### Jinshan Branch Weakens

After the appearance of new Jinshan branches, a small number were offered at a price of 1.36 million yuan, but the company also has its own goods, and the selling price is softer. The market seems difficult to stabilize.

### Japan's Pampered Land System Reform

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Fu Junyi

Tokyo, 15th (Airmail)

The reform of Japan's land system is the foundation of Japan's democratization. The extent of land system reform reflects the progress of Japan's democratization. Japan's rural areas have always been a breeding ground for conservative forces and the core of reactionary forces and the military. Japan's land system has strong feudal characteristics. Since the Meiji Restoration, the people have had no freedom to access land. Vast lands are occupied by large landlords, state-owned lands, and imperial estates (御料地). Only 16% of the national land area is arable. As a result, the living standards of farmers are low, and workers have to accept low wages. Therefore, Japan's capitalism has a very small domestic market, insufficient purchasing power among the people, and must seek markets abroad for surplus goods, practicing dumping, which led to imperialist expansionist behavior.

Land Reform from Top to Bottom

Due to the contradictions of this land system, tenant farmer resistance movements occurred in the valleys of Japan during World War I, leading to the rise of right-wing thought, culminating in the May 15 Incident (May 15, 1930), the assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, and the February 26 Incident (February 26, 1936), the attack on the Prime Minister's official residence by the Konoe Guards. At this time, Japanese imperialism should have addressed the land issue, but under the pretext of overpopulation, it shifted the target of popular resistance to foreign wars of aggression. It created the September 18 Incident in our country and further expanded it into the Pacific War, which eventually buried the Japanese Empire.

The result of defeat was the demand for land system reform, coupled with food shortages and the increasing number of repatriates, and the calls for land reform grew louder. Although this demand had gradually grown in Japan, its power was very weak. The old forces, attempting to maintain the old system and entrenched in various places, were still very strong. Without external pressure, land reform would be difficult to implement. Therefore, MacArthur repeatedly instructed the Japanese government to implement land system reform as soon as possible, the so-called top-down reform.

MacArthur Directs Implementation of Reform

On November 12, 1945, MacArthur's headquarters, after instructing the dissolution of the zaibatsu, ordered the Japanese government to abolish the current agricultural land system that placed farmers and their families in a state of slavery. At that time, the Shidehara Cabinet submitted the "Revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Law" to the 89th Japanese Parliament in November 1945, which was promulgated and implemented in February 1946. This is called the "First Agricultural Land System Reform." However, MacArthur's headquarters was still dissatisfied with the reform and sent a "Memorandum on Agricultural Land Reform" to the Japanese government on December 9, 1945, pointing out the points that should be improved and ordering the Japanese government to submit a new reform plan by March 15. Subsequently, on May 29, 1946, at the Sixth Council for Japan, the Japanese government's new plan was discussed, and the British representative submitted a "Draft on Agricultural Land System Reform." During the meeting, it was recognized that the Japanese government's first agricultural land system reform was completely inconsistent with the purpose of the directive, and recommendations for modifications were made. Based on these recommendations, the Japanese government drafted a bill and submitted to the 90th Parliament the "Revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Act Again" and the "Special Measures Law for the Creation and Maintenance of Owner-Farmers," which is the second agricultural land system reform. Regarding the progress of the second reform, a dispute arose among the representatives of various countries at the recent 35th (June 25) Council for Japan, believing that the progress of land reform was not smooth enough. Let us see how the US side responded.

Reform Goal is to Abolish Tenancy

According to the report by Bader, the head of the Economics Section of the Agriculture Division of the Natural Resources Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, he said: (1) The goal of the Japanese government's agricultural land reform plan is to eradicate the exploitative tenancy system based on the democratic line of the Allied occupation's general objectives. The legal basis for this plan is (1) the "Special Measures Law for the Creation of Owner-Farmers" and (2) the "Revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Law," whose main purpose is to 1 purchase most of the cultivated land owned by landlords; 2 then resell the purchased cultivated land to tenant farmers who engage in cultivation; (2) This plan intends to purchase approximately 500 acres of cultivated land. This cultivated land is scattered in the hands of 5.5 million farm households in the form of countless small plots. The Japanese government is currently engaged in purchasing the land, intending to re-divide the purchased land into economic units suitable for agricultural management and transfer them to individual tenant farmers. The transfer work will be completed on December 31, 1948. (3) The basic agricultural land reform law was passed by the Japanese Parliament on October 11, 1946, and promulgated on October 20. According to this regulation, all farm households with more than one tan (0.245 acres) of agricultural land or cultivated land, and their direct family members over the age of 20, should be divided into landlords, owner-farmers, and tenant farmers, and registration should be completed by November 30, 1946. Furthermore, city and village agricultural land committees should be organized, composed of democratically elected members. This election should begin in December 1946 and end on December 31. The city and village agricultural land committees should be composed of five representatives of tenant farmers, three representatives of landlords, and two representatives of owner-farmers. The members of the prefectural agricultural land committees should be mutually elected from the city and village agricultural land committees and should be completed by February 25, 1947. The members of the Central Agricultural Land Committee should be appointed by the cabinet on March 26, 1947. (4) The city and village agricultural land committees are responsible for promoting agricultural land reform, and the government should try its best to avoid interference. The city and village agricultural land committees should formulate agricultural land purchase plans for each city and village and examine the qualifications of purchasers of agricultural land. The prefectural agricultural land committees serve as a mechanism for landlords and owner-farmers to appeal if they are dissatisfied. Within the general policies and objectives determined by the Central Agricultural Land Committee, the prefectural policies are determined. The composition, character, and activities of these agricultural land committees are all subject to specific legal regulations. (5) The general function of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is to ensure that farmers comply with the agricultural land reform law and protect the public interest. The agricultural land division within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is the agency directly responsible for implementing the agricultural land reform plan. Six agricultural land divisions are established in various locations to conduct voter registration, manage agricultural land committee elections, and establish agencies for purchasing and transferring agricultural land.

Reform Center Divided into Two Points

The important points of the agricultural land system reform plan can be divided into two. The first point is to purchase the cultivated land leased out by landlords to establish owner-farmers. The first and revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Act stipulates that the area of ​​land retained by landlords is 5 cho (1 cho is 2.45 acres), and the area to be purchased is only 950,000 cho. The second reform draft stipulates that the land area owned by non-cultivating landlords is 1 cho, and the cultivated land owned by self-cultivating landlords is 3 cho, and the area of ​​cultivated land to be purchased is approximately 2 million cho (approximately 500 acres), reaching 80% of the total area of ​​tenant-farmed land. The second point is rent, changing from in-kind payment to cash payment. The existing in-kind rent contracts should be converted to cash payment based on a standard of 75 yen per stone of brown rice (1 Japanese stone is 4.9629 bushels). The first reform plan stipulated that agricultural associations would be responsible for land acquisition and redistribution, while the second agricultural land reform law changed it to the state handling it, and the completion deadline was shortened from five years to two years.

Liberating Tenant Farmers and Eradicating Feudalism

According to the opinion of Japanese progressive economist and Tokyo University professor, Hyoe Ouchi, the greatest significance of this reform plan is that it changes tenancy from in-kind payment to cash payment. Because in-kind tenancy takes away more than half of the farmers' income, causing Japanese farmers to forever sink into a miserable state, taking away the funds for improving management from their hands, and turning them into low-wage springs, forcing farmers to rely on sideline income to maintain their lives. This law has brought about a major change in the basic social relations in Japanese villages, needless to say, because tenant farmers have gained a more advantageous and freer position as agricultural operators. In this sense, they have also been greatly liberated in relation to landlords, and the eradication of feudal colors from rural areas is indeed a progressive legislation.

Reform Progress Leading to Delay

What is the current situation of land reform? The Japanese government originally planned to purchase 500,000 cho of agricultural land by the end of December of this year, but the actual amount of land purchased was only 158,000 cho, reaching 31.6% of the planned target. The inherent reason for this lies in the technical difficulties encountered in the implementation of the law. In reality, the power of landlords representing conservative forces in rural areas is still deeply rooted, hindering the process. Most of the 158,000 cho of cultivated land purchased belongs to landlords who do not live in rural areas. It is expected that greater difficulties will be encountered in the second phase (starting from July 2) when purchasing land owned by landlords living in villages. There have been widespread reports in Japanese news about landlords superficially complying with and secretly opposing the agricultural land reform work, not only forcibly taking back leased cultivated land from tenant farmers or concluding secret rental contracts, collecting extra-legal high rents, but also directly threatening tenant farmers with violence. What the landlord class hopes is to take back the land from tenant farmers for self-cultivation, or nominally adopt the method of self-cultivation, but secretly lease it to others, obtain high rents, and preserve the landlord's management model. According to a survey by the Japan National Agricultural Association, villages and towns where landlords forcibly took back cultivated land from tenant farmers and hindered land reform accounted for nearly 50.8% of the country. Recently, the landlords' offensive has become more intense. For example, landlords in Makabe District, Ibaraki Prefecture, organized gangs to snipe tenant farmers. As for what the tenant farmers hope for, according to a survey of 563 villages and towns by the National Agricultural Association, 73.5% hoped to purchase land. It can be seen that the influence of the character of the city and village agricultural land committees in rural areas on land reform is very significant. According to regulations, democratic elections should be carried out, but those established without voting procedures accounted for nearly 45%. Most of them are composed of committee members recommended by landlords who occupy very important positions in rural areas, using the names of agricultural associations and official agencies. The representatives of tenant farmers are also mostly influenced by landlords. The proportional composition of the class of chairmen of the agricultural land committees in each city and village under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo Agricultural Land Affairs Bureau can give a glimpse into the power of the landlords. The proportion is as follows:

Tenant Farmer Association President 25%

Landlord Association President 36%

Owner-Farmer Association President 37%

Neutral Association President 2%

Self-cultivating farmers, especially those who are not members of farmers' associations, mostly stand with the landlords and support the landlords. Based on the above table, it can be estimated that 75% of the agricultural land committees nationwide can be said to have the character of landlords, showing the strength of the parasitic landlord forces. Because Japanese rural areas have traditionally been the core of conservatives, reactionary forces, and the military in the domestic system, agricultural land reform, in terms of its spirit and scale, can be said to be an act of peaceful revolution. Whether this plan will be fully realized depends on the self-awareness and organizational power of Japanese farmers.

Plan to be Completed Next March

Japan's agricultural land reform work entered the second phase on July 2. The first phase ended at the end of March this year, and the land purchased was all owned by landlords who did not live in rural areas. The land to be purchased in the second phase is the uncultivated land owned by landlords living in the villages, which accounts for approximately 226,000 acres. Most of the land owned by these landlords will be subject to purchase, with only 2.5 acres, or 1 cho, allowed to be retained. However, in Hokkaido, where there is a lot of wasteland, 10 acres are allowed to be retained. According to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano's reply to Senator Shoji Touura in the Senate on the 2nd, "The Japanese government purchased 150,000 cho of cultivated land by the end of March of this year. It is estimated that 160,000 cho will be purchased by the end of July, 180,000 cho by the end of October, 310,000 cho by the end of December, 180,000 cho by the end of February next year, and 240,000 cho by the end of March. In total, 1.22 million cho of cultivated land will be purchased by the government and transferred to owner-farmers. After the second agricultural land system reform is completed, the first reform will be started.

Rural Problems Still Need to be Solved

What changes will occur in Japanese rural society after this reform? According to the opinion of Hyoe Ouchi, after this reform, not all tenant farmers in Japanese rural areas will become owner-farmers, and the scale of operation of farm households that have acquired cultivated land will not be expanded. He said, "After the enactment of this plan, there will be no difference in the scale of operation in Japanese rural areas compared to the past, and it will still be a small-farmer rural area. On the one hand, there are many owner-farmers, and on the other hand, there are still many tenant farmers with small-scale operations, forming an oriental-style village." At the same time, this reform did not mention the vast state-owned land and imperial estates (御料地). Of the 38 million cho of land area in mainland Japan, approximately 19 million cho belong to the state, public, and imperial estates owned by the Emperor, accounting for 50% of the national land area. The current plan to purchase 2 million cho of cultivated land is a very small proportion, truly a drop in the bucket, and does not solve the fundamental problem. Secondly, regarding the issue of the tax burden on Japanese farmers, the taxes currently paid by Japanese farmers to the government are too heavy. Taking income tax as an example, the agricultural income tax paid by Japanese farmers is three times higher than the labor income tax paid by the general public. These are still rural problems that Japan urgently needs to solve.

### Chang'an · Xi'an · Xijing

— Reporter of this Newspaper, Zhang Xianzhou

Xijing City, 24th (Airmail)

On the plateau of the Northwest, a city with a population of more than 600,000 is indeed too small. People who have traveled through Lanzhou and Dihua always say, "Xi'an is still better!" when they come back.

In the administrative organization of the Qing Dynasty, Xi'an was a prefecture. Xi'an urban area and the near suburbs were administered by Chang'an and Xianning counties. In the early years of the Republic of China, the prefecture system was abolished, and provinces were established. In the third year of the Republic of China, in accordance with the national plan for merging the first counties in each province, Xianning and Chang'an counties were merged into the first county of Shaanxi. The county name remained Chang'an. The county government was located on West Street in the city. In the twenty-third year, the national government designated Xi'an as the auxiliary capital, renamed it Xijing, and established the Xijing Municipal Preparatory Committee, appointing Mr. Zhang Puquan as the chairman to prepare for the business of Xijing's directly-administered municipality. After the July 7th Incident, due to national affairs and the Japanese invasion, the ancient city of Xi'an suffered multiple bombings, and changing to a directly-administered municipality was only a term on the map.

New Plan of the Preparatory Committee

After the victory, Shaanxi Province first established Xi'an as a province-administered city, named "Xi'an," to show its distinction from Xijing. It was not until this spring that it was changed to a directly-administered municipality. Some people say that Chang'an represents the period from military administration to political tutelage, Xi'an is the product of demobilization, and Xijing should symbolize unity and constitutional government. The establishment of the new municipal government coincides with the national election period.

According to the plan of the Xijing Preparatory Committee, the urban area extends east to Baqiao, south to the Zhongnan Mountains, north to the Wei River, and west to Sanqiao. With this division, most of Chang'an County's jurisdiction was划去了. The reporter recently visited the Shaanxi Provincial authorities for this purpose. It is said that the provincial government intends to apply to the Executive Yuan to abolish Chang'an County, and transfer all the county's land, population, and jurisdiction to Xijing City. If this is successful, the area of Xijing City will be approximately 12,800 square kilometers.

Population Growth and City Prosperity

The gradual prosperity of Xijing can be clearly seen from the increase in population: in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Xi'an had only 154,540 people. By October of the twenty-seventh year, it reached 277,965. According to the latest statistics, it is approximately 620,000 people. Now, if we add the population of Chang'an, the number should be much larger.

Perhaps this is a common problem in Chinese cities: the production level is still handicraft industry, while the consumption level has reached the latest fashion. Xi'an is no exception. Currently, there is only light industry, and no heavy industry to speak of. Among them, the larger ones are the Dahua Shenxin textile mills, and the Yongfeng Taihua flour mills are considered to be the largest in scale.

Inflexible Transportation

Xi'an is a city without large rivers. In terms of transportation, it generally seems convenient, but in fact, it is still inconvenient. Airplanes are a tool for a few people. The Longhai Railway has more passengers than trains. Every train that departs and arrives daily is mostly crowded. Even second-class cars give people the feeling of "no room to stand." As for materials, they are even less smooth. Tongchuan, 300 miles north of the city, has mountains of coal piled up, but it cannot be transported out. The price of coal in Xi'an is more than ten times higher than the original price on the mine. Ask the people at the mine! In a word, "No wagons! What can be done?"

Expensive Tuition in the Education Sector

In terms of education, Xi'an has three specialized colleges, five provincial middle schools, twenty-two private middle schools, three normal schools, seven vocational middle schools, seventy-eight public and private primary schools, and National Northwest University. However, public schools are small in scale and have limited enrollment. Private schools are not only mostly poorly equipped, but also charge exorbitant tuition fees. Currently, it is said that middle school tuition fees will be 400,000 yuan next semester, with an additional note: "More refunds and fewer supplements." In fact, there have always been students who "supplement less," and the school has never "refunded more." In today's rising prices, it is not easy for ordinary citizens to make a living, and many people "sigh in vain for learning"! As for the National Library, it is currently under preparation, and it is said that even the site is still "under planning." The new books in the provincial Xijing Library seem to be too few. Although the Stele Forest is good, there are not many tourists, the door is deserted, and bird droppings are everywhere, which looks a bit out of place.

Enlightened New Municipal Administration

When Xi'an was changed to a directly-administered municipality, many people said, "Xi'an's funding is a problem. Its income is not high, and it is not comparable to Shanghai, Tianjin, Pinghan. It is feared that there will be a difficult hurdle in future municipal facilities." Mayor Wang Youzhi is a kind person who is tall and plump. He has worked in journalism in the past and presided over Shaanxi education. He has always been good to his colleagues in the news industry. Whenever you visit him, you can go straight to him without having to report three times. When he first took office as the mayor of Xijing, the reporter made a special visit. He only humbly said, "There is not enough information now, so I am researching it and cannot talk about the so-called 'grand plan.' In short, future governance must be enlightened? There will be no undisclosed matters...". His temper is really straightforward.

From Simplicity to Luxury

Xi'an's style is a city in transition from simplicity to luxury. On the streets here, the great cloth gray wartime uniforms of female students and the glass clothes of the United States reflect each other. In the Chenghuang Temple on West Street, you can buy old-fashioned canes carved with dragon heads, white copper water pipe... At the same time, you can see glass handbags and foreign-flavored knick-knacks in the Shangren Road East Street area. July 17 (the first day of the sixth lunar month) is the ancient fair of Nantai Mountain (80 miles south of the city), and the residents of Xijing City are still drums and music, burning incense and paper, kneeling in the temple and chanting in a low voice: "Great mercy and compassion—Guanshiyin—Bodhisattva." This should be 相映成趣 with the ladies sitting in the cinema humming "The night is deep, the embroidery needle has stopped!...".

There are eleven newspapers, only one of which is an evening newspaper. It is said that several more will be published soon. It is hoped that there will be more "good" ones. Currently, only one abstract publication, "Book and Newspaper Essence," remains, and it has been published for more than 30 issues without interruption. In the entire Northwest, this is probably the only flower!

Department Stores are Doing Good Business

The gold shop industry in the business world was once the darling of heaven, extremely popular for a time, but since the gold freeze, it has become increasingly depressed. It is said that more than half of them have already closed down. On the other hand, department stores are still doing good business. Consignment shops have begun to go "downhill" and are no longer as prosperous as they used to be. Generally speaking, Xijing is not much worse than Shanghai in terms of consumption appetite. Therefore, many goods are often more expensive in Shanghai than in Xi'an. Sometimes the goods in Xi'an are cheaper than in Shanghai.

Wishing the Ancient City More Prosperity

Summers in Xi'an are very hot. Although the streets are often sprinkled with water by shops, there is still a lot of dust. But Xi'an's summer has its mood. On the grass of Revolution Park after dusk, you will see pairs of young men and women, or a young couple, leading their child "one and a half" to take a slow stroll. There is quite a bit of "leisurely" spirit. Even the "dry lake bank" of the "Lotus Lake Park" with "no lotus and no water" is usually full of guests. If you ask what they are doing? There is nothing to see, but so many people, in Xi'an dialect, "relaxing!"

From Chang'an to Xi'an, and then to Xijing, it is progress. I think that in the process of nation-building, the ancient city should be more prosperous and more lovely!

### WEEKLY FORUM BASIC CONCEPTS OF ETHICAL CONSTRUCTION

— Chen Baohua

The definition of the word "倫" (lún) originally meant classes and ranks; "倫理" (lúnlǐ, ethics) is the principle of relationships between people. The concepts that a person develops toward those they come into contact with, the majority of people, or humanity as a whole are ethical concepts. The study of this principle of relationships between people and the concepts it produces is ethics.

The relationships between people vary according to each person's position and inherent conditions. If centered on the individual, he can have various relationships with others, such as above, below, before, behind, left, and right. Relationships with those above are with parents and ancestors; relationships with those below are with children and grandchildren; relationships with elders or those with more knowledge and experience are those that come before; relationships with the young or those with less knowledge and experience are those that come after; relationships with those of the same rank, such as classmates, are relationships on the left and right. The so-called Five Relationships of the past, such as ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife, siblings, and friends, are different representations of ethical relationships. Within these different relationships, intricate and complex relationships can arise, such as when someone is older but has less knowledge, or when someone is young but more knowledgeable. Due to these complex relationships, the concepts produced toward others also vary in importance, depth, and superficiality. However, broadly speaking, "generation," "age," and "knowledge" are the three most important factors in ethical concepts. The relative importance of these factors, with distinctions between before and after, determines the starting point and differences in ethical concepts.

1.  Reasons for the emergence of ethical concepts

The reasons for the emergence of ethical concepts can be broadly divided into three aspects:

First, it stems from innate conscience. From birth, an infant will inevitably develop feelings and impressions of affection and love for the closest parents or caregivers. The word "孝" (xiào, filial piety) is the most natural ethical concept that arises from human nature. Secondly, respect for the elderly and those with superior knowledge is also a naturally generated concept. Extending this further, compassion for all of humanity, even animals, also arises from innate conscience and produces the ethical concept of "仁愛" (rén'ài, benevolence and love). These all stem from conscience.

Second, it stems from wisdom. As people live in social groups, they gradually develop the concept of shared interests, knowing that for their own benefit, they must also consider the interests of others. By not harming the interests of others, they can consistently maintain their own interests. When the interests of most people increase, their own interests will inevitably increase as well. This concept of shared interests can be said to arise from human wisdom. Each person's sense of responsibility also arises from this enlightenment of wisdom, based on the concept of shared interests. Words like "信" (xìn, trustworthiness), "義" (yì, righteousness), "和" (hé, harmony), and "平" (píng, peace) can be said to be synonymous with this concept.

Third, it stems from artificial teaching. Under the systems of monarchical states and patriarchal societies, the words "忠孝" (zhōngxiào, loyalty and filial piety) became axioms of morality, which everyone must strictly adhere to. Based on this highest principle, various laws and regulations were formulated to ensure the stable existence of this social system. The so-called "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parents, Teacher" were each person's sole benefactors, enshrined with tablets and worshipped daily, with the "Ruler" at the center, and Heaven, Earth, Parents, and Teacher merely serving as accompaniments. Due to these methods of teaching and legal systems, each person's ethical concepts were strengthened, deepened, and distorted. Therefore, "禮教" (lǐjiào, ritual and moral teachings) became a tool used by the ruling class to oppress the common people and maintain the social system of monarchical rule and patriarchy. In fact, from an academic perspective, the words "忠孝" (zhōngxiào, loyalty and filial piety) are the purest ethical concepts, arising from conscience and wisdom. When a person lives within the large group of a nation and people, being loyal to the monarch or leader is also due to the concept of shared interests, and is also a sense of responsibility. The monarch or leader is the central representative of a large organization, and being loyal to them is for the common good. "孝" (xiào, filial piety) is, of course, the most natural ethical concept arising from innate conscience. When a person knows that their body and life are bestowed by their parents, how can they not naturally feel the desire to be filial and serve them? The stories of the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars in China are all moving and praiseworthy, expressing the purest and most sublime form of morality. Now that the systems of monarchical despotism and patriarchal society have been reformed, and social organizations are moving towards the goal of democratic constitutionalism, the words "忠孝" (zhōngxiào, loyalty and filial piety) should still be the highest standard of ethics and morality.

2.  Relativity of Ethical Concepts and Sense of Responsibility

Ethical relationships are relative, so ethical concepts are also relative. In China, even before the Three Dynasties (Xia, Shang, Zhou), this relative relationship between people was emphasized. Confucius further promoted the theory of the relativity of ethical relationships, culminating in a complete ethical philosophy. The most important point is his ability to recognize the relativity of ethical relationships. The so-called "君君臣臣父父子子" (jūnjūn chénchén fùfù zǐzǐ, "Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject be a subject, the father be a father, and the son be a son"), meaning that each should fulfill their position and responsibility, thereby upholding their proper ethical concepts. If the ruler does not act according to the way of a ruler, then the subject will not observe the etiquette of a subject. The saying "君不君，臣不臣，父不父，子不子" (jūnbùjūn chénbùchén fùbùfù zǐbùzǐ, "If the ruler is not a ruler, the subject is not a subject, the father is not a father, and the son is not a son"), then the world will be in chaos, and social order will naturally be destroyed. Mr. Zhu Bólu (朱伯廬) said, "倫常乖舛，立見消亡" (lúncháng guāichuǎn, lìjiàn xiāowáng, "When ethical principles are violated, destruction is immediately seen"), which is the same principle. To consistently maintain good ethical relationships, we must emphasize the principle of relativity. Not only must we maintain the proper etiquette, attitude, and service responsibility towards the other party, but the other party must also maintain their proper attitude and responsibility. This effort is what past sages and worthies have always praised. As for so-called blind loyalty and blind filial piety, they are universally criticized and opposed. For a subject, to make their ruler and father become wise rulers and virtuous fathers is the most remarkable accomplishment. Under this relative ethical concept, teaching people to do good also becomes a responsibility and a merit. This kind of teaching, based on the relative perspective of common interests, aligns with the principles of normal ethics and morality.

The relationship between people, starting from the individual, may be from close to distant, from near to far, from small to large; but from the perspective of the entire human group, the individual is the "small self" (小我, xiǎo wǒ), and the group is the "large self" (大我, dà wǒ). The "small self" is entrusted within the "large self." The importance of the existence of the "large self" is truly many times higher than that of the "small self," so the inherent meaning of the "small self" is small, while its meaning for the existence of the "large self" is large. This is the sense of responsibility and obligation generated from the concept of shared interests. Furthermore, starting from the individual's conscience, a person can naturally develop compassion for others, often serving others out of sympathy, even willing to sacrifice themselves to rescue others and strive for common interests, thereby maintaining the existence of the "large self." The so-called "殺身成仁，捨身取義" (shāshēn chéngrén, shěshēn qǔyì, "Sacrificing one's life to achieve benevolence, giving up one's life to take righteousness") is a proper expression of this concept. We should not only focus on the ethical relationships between individuals, but also ignore the ethical responsibilities of the individual to the nation, people, society, and humanity. The so-called "仁" (rén, benevolence), "義" (yì, righteousness), "忠" (zhōng, loyalty), "勇" (yǒng, courage), etc., emphasize the responsibility of the "small self" to the "large self."

3.  Maintenance and Destruction of Ethical Relationships

If we want to maintain good ethical relationships between individuals, there are two words worth following. Zengzi (曾子) said: "夫子之道，忠恕而已矣" (Fūzǐ zhī dào, zhōngshù éryǐ yǐ, "The Master's way is nothing but loyalty and forbearance"). These two words, "忠恕" (zhōngshù, loyalty and forbearance), are indeed the essence of Confucius's ethical philosophy. "忠" (zhōng, loyalty) is my personal sincere and earnest intention towards others and the attitude it expresses, developing into a service-oriented perspective and a sense of responsibility. "恕" (shù, forbearance) is forgiving others for their inappropriate behaviors and attitudes, with the intention of correcting and remedying normal ethical relationships, preventing them from further deterioration and destruction. Because its purpose is to maintain ethical relationships, it does not take retaliatory measures, but takes a forgiving attitude. "恕" (shù, forbearance) is an active method, not a passive response. The application of "恕" (shù, forbearance) is limited. It should only be applied in certain situations and to a certain extent; beyond this limit, it is unacceptable. The ancients considered the limit beyond which the other party is unforgivable before taking the step of breaking off relations. The purpose of the two words "忠恕" (zhōngshù, loyalty and forbearance) is to maintain the ethical relationships between people.

In order to maintain good ethical relationships, we must also pay attention to the Doctrine of the Mean. First, we must talk about the word "愛" (ài, love). The starting point of love is certainly good; but loving in the wrong way, such as doting, favoritism, and indulgence, can undermine the other party's position, causing them to do inappropriate things, thereby destroying ethical relationships and even social order. Although it is called love, it is actually harming them. Therefore, the word "愛" (ài, love) cannot be abused. Regarding the issue of repaying kindness and resentment, it should also not be excessive. Repaying kindness with kindness is natural, but repaying resentment with kindness is unnecessary and should be changed to "以直報怨" (yǐ zhí bàoyuàn, repaying resentment with straightforwardness) to be moderate. As for repaying kindness with resentment, it is extremely wrong. Generally, people hate and despise those who are ungrateful, which is also due to the reason of being abnormal and contrary to reason. Third, an attitude that is too respectful and tends to flattery is also unacceptable. Confucius said: "巧言令色，鮮矣仁!" (qiǎoyán lìngsè, xiǎn yǐ rén!, "Those who are clever with their words and put on a flattering appearance rarely have benevolence!"). Therefore, those who specialize in flattery today have lost the inherent nature of benevolence and are not allowed in ethics and morality. Confucius emphasized the Doctrine of the Mean, saying that both excess and deficiency are "不仁" (bùrén, lack of benevolence). We can see this from the Spring and Autumn Annals, which discusses principles based on events.

Here, we want to talk about the abnormality and causes of destruction of human relationships. In the past, Mencius advocated human nature is inherently good, while Xunzi advocated human nature is inherently evil. The policies of ruling the world between Confucianism and Legalism also differed. Gradually, everyone discussed the issue of love and hate, which is closely related to ethical philosophy and is a fundamental and major issue. As mentioned above, compassion arises from human conscience, and a sense of responsibility based on the concept of shared interests arises from human wisdom. This can explain that human nature is inherently good and should be able to consistently maintain good ethical relationships between people; however, why does human nature become evil?

First, it is due to desire. A person's desire to survive is innate, but their initial goal is towards things, not people. When there is no lack of supply of things in nature or artificial obstacles, the normal relationship between people will not be destroyed. Therefore, the innate nature of the desire to survive alone cannot be said to be evil. When a person's desire exceeds the limit of survival and develops into harming others to benefit oneself and satisfy private desires, their personality and wisdom have already been infiltrated by acquired social factors. However, these acquired social factors can still be corrected by artificial methods and forces, preventing the individual's desires from developing arbitrarily, hindering the interests of others, and thus destroying ethical relationships.

Second, it is due to revenge and hatred. Human nature is originally good, and everyone has compassion and sympathy; however, due to the flaws in the social system, if an individual has been oppressed and their survival becomes a problem, it will naturally cause their resentment and generate feelings of hatred and resentment, which of course arise from artificial causes. If we want to maintain good ethical relationships, prevent human nature from becoming evil, and restore it to goodness, we must strive to improve the social system, so that laws and policies conform to the principles of common welfare and equal survival, preventing some people from seizing the interests of others, eliminating the relationship of enslavement and exploitation, and then eliminating the phenomenon of contradiction and conflict. So-called "和平" (hépíng, peace) must first be "平" (píng, equal) and then "和" (hé, harmony), which lays the foundation for true ethical construction.

4.  Social Construction and the Function of the Four Cardinal Virtues

Ethical construction aims to maintain normal and good relationships between people, and under the principle of joint cooperation, to build a peaceful, progressive, and civilized society, and increase the happiness of human life. Therefore, ethical construction is also the foundation of social construction. When we talk about the five constructions, namely psychological construction, ethical construction, social construction, political construction, and economic construction, social construction is actually the central construction of the five constructions. The other four constructions are all coordinated with the needs of social construction. If social construction has a sound, good, complete, and dynamic foundation, then human happiness will naturally increase day by day. So-called political construction and economic construction should all take steps and methods towards this central goal, and all efforts are adapted to social construction. Psychological construction and ethical construction start from the individual's personality and moral concepts to establish good relationships between people and strive to serve the "large self" by sacrificing the "small self," all for the needs of social construction. In particular, ethical construction is the foundation of social construction and has a closer relationship. Now we want to talk about the arguments and functions of the concepts of the Four Cardinal Virtues: "禮" (lǐ, ritual), "義" (yì, righteousness), "廉" (lián, integrity), and "恥" (chǐ, shame).

"禮" (lǐ, ritual) is a polite attitude of people towards each other, used to maintain social order. As mentioned above, the relationship between people can produce different ethical concepts from the differences in the relationship of up, down, front, back, left, and right, and thus produce different polite attitudes. For example, father to son, son to father, ruler to subject, subject to ruler, husband to wife, wife to husband, teacher to student, and student to teacher all produce their proper polite attitudes due to the different relationships. This word "禮" (lǐ, ritual) is used to maintain normal and good ethical relationships, which is to maintain normal and good social order. In addition to starting with the polite attitude between individuals, the meaning and function of "禮" (lǐ, ritual) is also expressed from the aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Extending this further, in public gatherings, etiquette and rules that are commonly observed are set, such as weddings, funerals, celebrations, and various banquets, all of which have different etiquette due to the different ethical relationships.

"義" (yì, righteousness) is the common interest of the public. We advocate the word "義" (yì, righteousness) to make everyone strive for the public interest. So-called "急公好義" (jígōng hàoyì, eager for public good and fond of righteousness) means serving the society and the people, advocating justice and fairness, and carrying out public undertakings to create public welfare, all of which are included in the meaning of the word "義" (yì, righteousness). Even willing to sacrifice oneself to save or win the interests of the majority of people, the so-called "捨身取義" (shěshēn qǔyì, sacrificing one's life to take righteousness) is the same principle. This starts from the concept of common interests and a sense of responsibility, that is, with the "large self" as the goal, which is a kind of virtue with the most active expression among the "Four Cardinal Virtues."

"廉" (lián, integrity) means being honest and law-abiding, without corruption, which is the conceptual function of preventing individuals from infringing on public interests. If a person's desires are not restrained, it is easy to infringe on the interests of others and even public interests. Especially those who hold public office may use the convenience of their powers to erode public interests, which also destroys the law. We advocate the word "廉" (lián, integrity) to make everyone aware of their conduct, respect their personality, and dare not have the heart of greed and lawlessness, which is the self-restraint effect of the ethical concept of preventing problems before they occur.

"恥" (chǐ, shame) is the conceptual term for correcting the destruction of ethical principles. On an individual level, if one has an evil thought, has the intention of destroying ethical principles and harming others, or has already committed immoral acts, then the word "恥" (chǐ, shame) can be used to eliminate evil thoughts or stop destructive behaviors to save the restoration of ethical principles. Therefore, "知恥" (zhīchǐ, knowing shame) is an essential condition for an individual to survive in a social group. From the perspective of the "large self," public interests are also personal interests, and maintaining ethical principles and the welfare of the social group is also a personal responsibility. If ethical principles and public rights are destroyed by others, the individual also considers it a great shame and humiliation and must rise up to defeat the destroyers or invaders to restore social principles and public rights before they can avenge the shame and fulfill their responsibilities. The development of the meaning of "恥" (chǐ, shame) has a great function, with an active saving force. Therefore, its meaning is linked to the word "勇" (yǒng, courage). The sayings "過則勿憚改" (guò zé wù dàn gǎi, if you have made a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it), "知恥近乎勇" (zhīchǐ jìnhū yǒng, knowing shame is close to courage), and "明恥敎戰" (míngchǐ jiàozhàn, understanding shame and teaching war) are all force effects on the concept of "恥" (chǐ, shame).

The characteristics of the meanings of the four words "禮" (lǐ, ritual), "義" (yì, righteousness), "廉" (lián, integrity), and "恥" (chǐ, shame) are that people automatically and spontaneously maintain social order and protect public rights and interests. No matter what degree the social system changes to in the future, this central meaning will remain unchanged forever and can be permanently adapted. The function of these four words starts from ethical concepts and reaches the goal of social construction. (The End)

Spring and Autumn Annals

### Serenade

— Xu Weinan

One

Cut a piece of the hazy night to fill the two window frames in my room, as light gray curtains like glass. Let the starlight leak in from these curtains, let the leisurely wind before dawn blow in from these curtains, and give me a bath in the coolness.

Two

A white bird, panting, carrying a back full of slanting sunlight, flew hurriedly to the seaside. Arriving at the gradually gray beach, the white bird shook its body, suddenly throwing away its back of slanting sunlight, breathed a sigh of relief, looked back at the red sun hanging on the mountainside, felt it was not surprising at all, and then slowly strolled on the beach.

Three

A hexagonal bamboo hat, a short shirt of white cloth, short pants of blue cloth, bare feet in straw sandals, carrying a bamboo pole, with a birdcage tied to the end of the pole, the cage covered with willow branches and leaves, inside the cage were cicadas chirping "zhī le, zhī le." Two young farmers selling cicadas, walking leisurely back and forth on the busy Fuzhou Road, truly giving the city a dose of refreshment.

### Charming Lee

— Qin Ling

Beauty and intelligence are sometimes an unparalleled gift for a woman, but using them as capital is the most dangerous speculation.

It is said that entering C University without knowing Charming Lee is an irreparable regret.

I don't remember clearly the first time I saw her, but her attire—a green suit, green sunglasses, a wide-brimmed soft straw hat tilted on her head, and a string of white pearl necklaces around her neck—was so pretty and clever that you couldn't help but think, "She should indeed be called Charming Lee."

Her Chinese name is "Li Jiaming," but because it doesn't sound as crisp and pleasant as Charming Lee, the former has been forgotten. Her father is a staff member of the ambassador to the United States, and Jiaming lived with her father in the United States for three years, speaking fluent English. She socializes with diplomats all day long and is the headmaster's goddaughter. Naturally, her status at C University is unique.

She is a third-year medical student, one class above us. Our classrooms are next to each other. Every morning, about twenty minutes into the first class, there are often hurried sounds of high heels in the corridor. Male students whisper, "Charming Lee! Charming Lee!" Sure enough, nine times out of ten, it's her. The silk ribbon at her hairline flashes past the glass window. Although we are not in the same grade, we often see each other in the dining hall. In fact, "often" here only includes lunchtime. Jiaming never appears in the dining hall for breakfast or dinner. Even so, we became acquaintances who didn't know each other well. She always runs into the dining hall with a smiling face, bouncing along. When the old woman respectfully calls out "Miss Li" while wringing her hands, she is already scooping soup with a spoon. Everyone's comment on her is, "Although she is like a Western palace empress, she is not arrogant." This is probably one of the reasons why most people like her.

Our dormitory is located in the center of the garden, with bamboo forests and bushes in the corners of the walls, and yellow roses decorate the lawn in front. Outside the surrounding wall is the farm. When the wind blows, the bamboo forest rustles and the ancient well under the trees seems even more silent. From the farm, the gentle cooing of pigeons is heard from time to time. The environment is extremely quiet. On mornings without classes, we always like to pull a deck chair onto the corridor and prepare for lessons facing the garden. Once, when I was repeatedly reciting Latin and feeling a little sleepy, there was a faint sound of footsteps behind me. Turning my head, it was Jiaming again. She walked up the stone steps and greeted me with a familiar air:

"Are you reading Latin?" she smiled radiantly.

"Yes, won't you sit for a while?" I pulled over a chair next to me and carefully looked at her. Black shawl, black silk cheongsam, trimmed with sparkling small lenses around the edges, and the same color leather shoes, a complete evening party outfit. Dropping her handbag, she sat down.

"Another monthly exam, I haven't even looked at tomorrow's pathology..." she mumbled, her eyes showing a tired look.

"Another all-nighter last night!" Her black, slender eyebrows told me of a night of wild dancing.

"That's right... I envy you for having the peace of mind to study," she said, hitting her legs with her hands, her eyebrows furrowed like wrinkled flower petals.

"Why can't you do that!" I said in a slightly sarcastic tone.

"Do you think I like this kind of life!"

"..."

"For a ship that has lost its rudder, you can't control its direction..."

We ended the conversation in silence. Yes, with my personality, I'm afraid I will never understand Jiaming. When you run into the dormitory with a series of waves, I smile slightly to myself. It is a miracle if a person has reached such an age and still cannot live in the habits of their own choice. It was not just hearsay that Jiaming's notes and exam papers were all done by male classmates. She herself does not read books at all. Someone advised her that since she doesn't have time to read books, why not study a more relaxed department like commerce or literature. She replied: "Studying medicine sounds more glamorous!" Would someone who studies medicine for glamour be forced to socialize and dance all night? She dropped the rudder herself, she doesn't need a rudder!

The anniversary celebration is the most enjoyable festival at C University, because it is near the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the atmosphere in the evening is particularly deep. When Beijing opera was being performed in the auditorium with gongs and drums, I couldn't stand the noise and quietly walked out with Qinlv, who was sitting next to me. When we ran into the wooden fence of the women's dormitory, we both slowed down. Here, a white stone avenue winds around the prayer room and leads directly to the front porch of the dormitory. Both sides are full of lush green privets, their thick leaves shining in the moonlight; one snow pine after another, graceful canopies, emitting a deep emerald green; the night wind carries a bit of coolness. Just as we were silently walking along the avenue, three or four figures came towards us, talking and laughing. I only saw the one in front clearly, it was Xiao Bai from Medical Three—also a very active fellow, wearing a sash.

"Are you going to Xuanwu Lake?" An enviable tone of happiness.

Qinlv shook her head and stopped, holding me. Sighing at their backs, she said:

"These girls, really!" After passing the prayer room, I pulled Qinlv up the stone steps and sat on the stone railing in front of the door; facing the cold moonlight, someone staggered out, covering her face with a handkerchief. Qinlv, with quick eyes, said softly to me: "Charming Lee!"

We wondered why she didn't go to Xuanwu Lake. Running into the prayer room, we saw that the white candles in front of the altar were still dripping with wax tears. Could it be that Jiaming sings and dances all night, but is the only one who is haggard at this moment? That touch of bleakness that she had not taken away seemed to have infected us as well. We looked at each other in silence and sighed knowingly. Then, the recent rumors about Jiaming are not entirely unfounded. "For a ship that has lost its rudder, you can't control its direction." Yes, emotion is the most beautiful and also the most cruel decoration of life. Those who know how to use emotion will gain supreme happiness in the world, otherwise they will fall into the abyss of sin.

In the second year after I left C University, I heard that Jiaming got married. The other party was the son of an embassy secretary, possessing a great deal of property, but was a cripple. However, compared to Jiaming's first misstep, it was still a stable destination. After the marriage, they lived in a villa in West Lake. Jiaming was good at wearing beautiful clothes, so facing the faint moon and beautiful water of West Lake, she could find compensation for her unfulfilled emotional defects. Then I heard that she had a child, probably with a name similar to Peter or John. I hope her maternal love can erase the traces of pain. But recently, I heard people say that Jiaming died of TB. She decorated the lives of others, but let others decorate her tomb. Flowers that grow on the tips of green leaves bloom the earliest and wither the fastest, that is certain. However, the ups and downs of Jiaming's life have been surprisingly fast, regrettable fast.

### Return

— Renoir

This painting, "Return," is an early work by Auguste Renoir. The style is similar to Manet's. The brushstrokes are delicate, the outlines are clear, and the colors are simpler than his later works. The original work first flowed into England, and then the French government paid a high price to recover it. It is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. (Liu Shi)

### Stars of a Summer Night

— Pei Yin

Summer Night

The sky twinkles with stars

A thousand grains of fire light up on the earth

Light and dark in the boundless wilderness of night

Is a pair of mysterious images ah!

The moist grass is a soft bed

I lie down, stretching out my limbs freely

Let the breeze kiss my thin clothes

Listen to the floating frog drums in the distance

Look at the stars in the sky

Embedded in the deep blue sky...

A falling star

Drags a long yellow tail

Across half the sky

I remember that ancient legend:——

When a star falls

A soul enters heaven——

So I care about the family of the deceased

And yearn for that departed star——

Where does it fall after all,

The night wind wanders in the wilderness

Broadcasting the fresh breath of rice leaves

I realize a quiet, indescribable loneliness

The tide of deep longing surges in my heart

Many times, I choose the brightest star

Representing a noble and kind soul

This eliminates my countless times of loneliness

On a quiet, starry night

A hardworking night traveler

Treading on the faint starlight

Comes from the distant faraway

The stars have a kind heart

He lights up the hopes of travelers...

Dragging a heavy memory

Treading on the cobblestone path

Towards my small house

I wade in the silent July night...

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 360

— Ye Jingfeng

"About the past, I want to talk about it again later. Right now, I want to exchange some information with you first, what do you think?..." I know Yaoqun is anxious to know the current situation of Tsurumi, and also eager to know the situation of Mr. W in Beiping. She cannot use communication equipment, so she cannot obtain information on these two aspects, and of course feels depressed. But I think "information first."

"Alright..." Yaoqun's eyes flickered.

"Yesterday we detected that the Sakagaki, Sakai, and Suzuki teams have combined, and they will attack Nankou today. Is this information reliable?" I first raised this point.

"Yes, it should have been launched last night," Yaoqun nodded, "but so far, we haven't heard anything. Could it be that they really let them pass so quietly?"

"That's impossible," I told Yaoqun; "Tang Bu's 13th Army arrived a week ago to set up defenses. They must not let them pass so easily."

"That's what I said," Yaoqun seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, "that's great, I can take charge of one side exclusively; as long as we get those big shots out of the circle, we'll be able to make it in time!"

"Make it to where?... What for?" I felt that Yaoqun's tone was not specifically referring to the establishment of a branch in Shanxi; it seemed there was another, more important task.

Hearing my question, Yaoqun immediately flashed those already yellowish eyeballs, and stared at me for a moment, expressing some bewilderment: "Can't be...! You don't even know that the Songbe Unit has already had dealings with our General Liu, Liu Ruming" The word "dealings" was used humorously.

"Oh!" This information really surprised me: "This General Liu is a confidant in Shanxi, a formal member, one of Shanxi's 'assets'... If he is hooked by Japanese spies, it is simply equivalent to dismantling the stage of Shanxi, isn't it?"

"Isn't it?" Yaoqun sneered. He is stationed on the outer edge of Shanxi's heart and lungs, - from the throat to the stomach-...

"This news...?" I wanted to ask Yaoqun "the source of this news and its authenticity;" because I was a little afraid to believe it. If this is an unmistakable piece of news, the northwest half, at least the circle of Shanxi and Hebei, will be dangerous. In other words, Nankou has no value to defend; even if you risk your life to resist for a while, it is only a waste of some troops.

"100% sure!" Yaoqun had already understood my intentions, and answered me so decisively: "I have seen the stub of the Songbe Unit's leader's order, the intelligence from the Zhangbei branch, and the amount of activity funds... I..." Yaoqun said to this point, suddenly said "huh" with surprise, as if remembering something. She asked me: "How long have you been in Changping?... When did you leave Beiping?"

I told her that I had only left Beiping yesterday, and arrived in Changping yesterday as well.

"That's strange!" Yaoqun had a somewhat astonished look; "Didn't the team leader reveal it to you... about this news?"

I know why Yaoqun was astonished, probably because she didn't know that her intelligence was traveling so slowly: "Headquarters only received your intelligence three times in total. This third piece of intelligence was only received half an hour after I set off." This is a relevant fact, I cannot hide it from her forever.

### Difficult to Achieve a Noon Dream

— Meng Nong

A quarter or half an hour after lunch can be said to belong to me. If you follow the ideas of the ancients, you can burn a pot of incense, boil a pot of tea, and hold a book in your hand, which is naturally a unique and interesting thing.

I don't hope to have (and naturally can't have) such a life. I just want to take a nap, not looking at anything, doing nothing, and even temporarily eliminating the habit of thinking about anything. This is enough to make me enter a world of comfort, tranquility, leisure, and wandering.

With the bamboo blinds half-rolled up, lying down comfortably on a couch, without wearing long trousers or socks, just stretching my limbs, closing my eyelids, first pretending to take a nap, and soon falling asleep. This kind of happy nap is a common thing for idlers, but in my opinion, it is the leisure of busy people, a fate that can be encountered but not sought, and the supreme happiness in the world.

Near the north window, there was originally a neighboring family's barren garden, no, it was simply a garbage dump that hides dirt and filth. Rotten iron cans, withered grass, and sludge were piled up like small mountains, and when the sun shone on them, they evaporated an unspeakable stench. Mosquitoes, flies, and horseflies were all rolling and dancing there, which was naturally a good place like their paradise.

If I don't open the north window, I feel too stuffy; but if I open it, I feel inexplicably uncomfortable. Sometimes, helplessly, I have to plan this way, open it for a while, and then close it for a while, to let me breathe. However, this leads to another problem, my drowsy eyes have already woken up, and my noon dream is naturally out of the question, and it is too late to chase after it.

Lying down, lying down, barely lying down. Annoying flies are attacking me all over, with a buzzing noise, flying to my head for a while, and then flying back, as if deliberately playing a joke on me.

So at this time I had to get up from a lying position and start a fly-swatting exercise. The flies can't be caught, so I have a big showdown with the air.

After launching the fly-swatting exercise, it seems that the dead are dead and the escaped have escaped, so I can rest assured that I can take a nap, but that's not necessarily the case.

The most hateful is a kind of old fly. Old flies are used to fly-swatting exercises, so when I conduct fly-swatting exercises, they are not panicked, and they know what kind of way to temporarily avoid others' edge. When the exercise returns to quiet, it suddenly flies out from the dark corner and sits on the ceiling or power line, sitting there silently and motionless, as if peeping at the movements, laughing secretly at people, or at least planning to launch another offensive.

It's difficult to achieve a noon dream, so I have to let it go. In order to pass the difficult afternoon of the long summer, I simply opened a novel. It was really accidental and coincidental. I read a novel by the Swedish writer Raqilov, and found that there were also "Zaiyu painting bedroom" characters in Sweden, who not only liked to take a nap themselves, but also insisted on developing the habit of napping in his children. The novel says that a general named Lai Jiulov believes that if children are to grow up to be healthy, strong, capable, and useful, the first important thing is to develop the habit of napping. Therefore, every time after lunch, he always led two little girls to the villa. But those girls didn't think so. They pounced on General Lai, entangled him, pulled his beard, pulled his hair, and joked with him. After joking enough, they climbed into the small bed, pretending to sleep, which is equivalent to pretending to be dead, because General Lai does not allow the children to climb out of the small bed, or make a conversation. General Lai is asleep, but his snoring makes his two daughters, who need to develop the habit of napping, unable to sleep. They feel the horror of napping, the horror of a long time in the summer afternoon! Their only hope is in the flies. I hope that the flies will fly to General Lai's face with a buzzing sound, louder and longer, and wake him up quickly!

They suffer on the bed during nap time, cursing, which General Lai does not understand. They are envious of the fun of those who don't take a nap outside the window, running around, happy and carefree, eating peaches and bayberries, but General Lai, who is greedy for noon dreams, doesn't understand these?

### Parrot Beak

— Zhu Wen

Bai Letian's Yangming Cave Poem: "Hometown flavor cherishes Peng Hu, seasonal freshness values ​​partridge." Peng Hu is similar to crab, but smaller than crab, living in sandy caves by the water. Its color is bright red, commonly known as parrot beak. Also known as crab. "Shi Shuo Xin Yu" records: "Cai Mo crossed the river, mistakenly ate crab, vomited and slumped," Wu Song produced this thing, but only ate its claws. Every summer, it is made into soup with crab meat, the taste is extremely delicious, and I have never heard of anyone having diarrhea from eating it. Yuan Tao Zongyi's "Stopped Farming Record" food item also has: "Shanghai in Songjiang, Haining in Hangzhou, people all like to eat crab claws, named parrot beak, because there are very red ones that look like it."

### Night on the Lake

— Yao Yu

The wings of night sneakily extend towards the lake surface. The sky gradually darkens, and the mountains led by South Peak and North Peak fall asleep in a daze, drawing a winding black shadow on the milky white edge of the sky. Everything is blurred, and even with good eyesight, you can only see a vague outline. Because the night brings tranquility and comfort to West Lake, West Lake seems more spacious and beautiful than during the day.

The streetlights on Bai Causeway and Su Causeway blink with kind eyes. Her radiance gracefully passes through the willow groves and flowers on the lakefront, forming a black and white pattern with lace on the asphalt road. When I walked across Jin Dai Bridge in a thin shirt on a moonlit night, I once thought: Wouldn't it be more poetic to turn off the streetlights and let the bright moonlight pour down on the levee on this summer night? The night of West Lake seems to belong to human lovers. He (she) sits quietly under the willow shade, remembering a string of sweet memories, telling endless soft words. When sweetness intoxicates two hearts, does she (he) want to have a passionate embrace and a light kiss? Would she (he) resent it for being too bright for this dim street light? However, a gloomy night, a strange traveler, how will they tell the longing and gratitude in their hearts to this holy flower blooming in the darkness? ... Therefore, I deeply realize that only the light in the darkness is truly worthy of cherishing; and darkness and light are eternally fighting! ...

The lakefront is full of people. When a breeze suddenly blows from the lake at night, everyone will give a knowing smile at the same time. This refreshing pleasure is indeed not something that eating popsicles and ice cream can appreciate! As long as you line up a sleeping chair in front of the park or store, it becomes an ideal bed; you can snore to sleep with your chest bare. The corners of the walls are piled with urban dregs - ragged beggars, they are having different summer night dreams, dreaming of picking up gold, and also dreaming of the arrival of autumn, the arrival of winter... Although they do not have mosquito nets and DDT to resist mosquitoes and fleas, they at least have company...

At this moment, it should be the time when blue fluorescence paints across the vast night, the breeze sways the dense rice leaves, and the spinning girl and toad accompany the melodious nocturne between the fields. However, living in the city for a long time, where should I go to find it? I really want a night with a clear moon and a gentle breeze, let me throw myself into the wilderness, let me relive the mood of a summer night in the countryside! ...

Shanghai Tidbits

### The Psychology of Merchants

— Shilang

Some time ago, prices galloped forward, like a wild horse without a rein, unable to stop it. The marked prices of all goods jumped unbelievably; merchants, however, complained to their customers that business was difficult and selling an item was like losing money, because the wholesale price had already jumped past their retail price. Therefore, they always said that it was better not to sell than to "not be able to replenish the stock."

However, recently, all prices have been falling. Gold notes on the black market, superior white rice, and smart head items have all fallen by one-third, which is a rare thing to see in months.

But what surprises us is that the marked prices of many items have not been reduced. For example, the prices of Western medicines when the US dollar black market was high before are still stubbornly immovable; and many American goods, although their wholesale prices have been reduced, their retail prices are still "high above."

This kind of merchant's calculation and merchant's psychology often make it difficult for people to be convinced. We sympathize with merchants for having their "troubles" now, but their attitude of only having "themselves" and not "customers" cannot win the sympathy of the general public.

We feel that at this time, merchants should automatically reduce prices, so that customers can change their psychology and views on merchants.

The price of rice has fallen to more than 300,000, and the black market price of gold notes has fallen by half. Why don't our merchants try to suppress prices a little?

Free Talk

### The Troubles of Korea

— Pu Lun

Editor's Note: Recent negotiations between the US and the Soviet Union regarding Korea do not seem to be progressing smoothly. Wise people all over the world are concerned about the future development of US-Soviet relations. The editor has specially invited Mr. Pu Lun to introduce the geographical situation of Korea, which will be of some benefit to readers.

Having just escaped the suffering of Japanese enslavement, Korea has not obtained the freedom and equality it desired, but has become a testing ground for the two major ideologies of democracy and communism. Indeed, the 38th parallel north is like a bloody blade, cutting Korea into two sections; the Stars and Stripes fly in the south, and the hammer and sickle flag flies in the north. The most interesting thing is that both regions are regarded as the "cradle of democracy."

This ancient country with a long history of five thousand years, its economic and political backwardness, and the importance of its strategic geography, have painted Korean history in a very dim color. These three factors, "three in one," have become a chain that tightly binds it, preventing it from finding a suitable and satisfactory home in this long process.

Korea is a large peninsula in Asia, protruding between the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, facing Japan to the east across the Sea of Japan; bordering the Korean Strait to the south; facing Hebei and Shandong provinces of our country to the west across the Yellow Sea; and bordering Liaoning, Jilin, and Siberian parts of the Soviet Union to the north, with the Changbai Mountains, the Yalu River, and parts of the Tumen River as the boundary. Precisely because it is close to Manchuria and the Soviet Union in the north, and close to Japan in the east, it has formed its important strategic position. Therefore, Japanese imperialists used it as a springboard to enter the Asian continent and as a base to seize Manchuria and attack the Soviet Union.

This geographical factor is indeed a great temptation, but it is not the dominant reason. Economic and political backwardness are the dominant reasons. Before Korea became a Japanese colony, it was still in a state of agricultural society economically, and politically it was still under an autocratic feudal system. Korea's land system has always been state-owned in principle. By the Goguryeo era, the land system became even more practically state-owned. The king was not only the supreme sovereign of politics and military affairs, but also the supreme owner of state land. The people only had the right to cultivate the land but not the right to own it. Politically, Korea has always been ruled by autocratic feudal forces. Therefore, it buried the independence and freedom of the Korean nation!

Japan's invasion of Korea began at the end of the 16th century. The 350,000 troops of the Japanese feudal lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, after seven years of attack, did not defeat Korea, but retreated automatically. However, the Japanese took away many scholars and craftsmen, and also took away 30,000 salted Korean ears and noses. After that, Japan's ambition for Korea did not relax at all, and it formally annexed Korea in 1910.

However, the high degree of exploitation by Japanese imperialists nurtured the seeds of the Korean national liberation movement. The development of the Korean national liberation movement can be roughly divided into three main stages: from 1910 to the "March 1st" Revolution in 1919, it was the first stage; from the "March 1st" Revolution to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was the second stage; and during World War II, it was the third stage. After Japan surrendered, it entered a new stage.

The current division of Korea is to divide almost the entire Gangwon Province of Korea into two competing parts, and part of Hwanghae Province is the US military occupation zone, and a small part of Gyeonggi Province is the Soviet military occupation zone. The US military occupation zone has more than 36,761 square miles, accounting for 43.1% of the total area of Korea, and the Soviet military occupation zone has 48,487 square miles, accounting for 56.90% of the total area. In terms of population, the population of the US military zone accounts for two-thirds of the total population of Korea, but it has recently changed. It is very likely that the population of the Soviet military occupation zone is 40%, and the US military occupation zone is 60%.

### Reluctant Departure

— Hu Lu

Flying Discs Visit Shanghai's Sky

Flying discs on the sea turn pale; who's throwing empty discs to intimidate? Is it seeking a transaction? Market discs fly high and fast?

Who sees the foreigner's disc as truly lacking morals? A flurry over the expensive "murderous disc"—How many golden houses? The mind calculates, the worry complete!

Note: "Empty disc," "disc," and "murderous disc" are all Shanghai market terms. "Murderous disc" refers to an expensive disc. "Foreign disc" is a term for outsiders, originating from foreign goods whose intricacies are only known to those who understand foreign languages. Here, Lu uses these terms with different interpretations.

### Lin Zexu

— Ji Ming

What distinguished Lin Wenzhong from other famous ministers of the Qing Dynasty was the Opium War. At that time, Gong was the Governor-General of Liangguang, strongly advocated banning opium, and confiscated more than eight-tenths of the opium from British merchant ships, receiving praise from the Emperor. The Daoguang Emperor even personally wrote to report: "Now that you have taken such action, it would be greatly unacceptable to show weakness again. I do not worry about your recklessness, but I sincerely hope that you will not be timid. To control, first use force and then virtue is the best method." It can be seen that at the beginning of the war, the Qing Emperor was still arrogant and self-important. After the defeat, Gong was exiled to Yili.

Historical records state that Zexu's courtesy name was Yuanfu, also known as Shaomu, a native of Minhou, Fujian. He was less than six feet tall, but his eyes shone brightly, and his voice was like a bell. Every time he engaged in intense discussions, even those several houses away could hear him clearly. At the age of twenty-seven, he became a Jinshi. In the third year of Daoguang, he was promoted to Surveillance Commissioner of Jiangsu, where he resolved cases fairly and justly, and the people called him Lin Qingtian (Lin the Just). He was particularly skilled in water conservancy. When he was the Governor-General of Huguang, the Jingxiang region suffered from minor floods. Gong repaired the dikes and supervised the work, and the floods were completely eliminated. When it was discussed that he should be exiled, he passed through Kaifeng and the river breached. He was retained to supervise the repairs. After the work was completed, he still went into exile. It seems that the order of exile was not originally the intention of the Qing court, but it was a concession made to the British threats. After Gong arrived outside the pass, he was ordered to investigate and manage land reclamation matters. He personally visited Kuche, Aksu, Yarkand, and Ilik and other cities, covering a distance of 30,000 li horizontally and vertically, and water conservancy was greatly developed. When he had some spare time, he amused himself with writing and painting. Gong's calligraphy was based on Ouyang Xun's style, and his poetry followed Bai Juyi's. Although Yili was a large metropolis in the frontier province, within a few months, silk and paper were all used up. After four years in Yili, he returned and gradually resumed his official duties, later becoming the Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou. In the thirtieth year of Daoguang, the Hong and Yang armies rose up. He was ordered to lead the army as an imperial envoy, but he died on the way before arriving. Commentators say that Gong was superior to Zeng Wenzheng because Wenzheng did not understand the distinction of race, while Gong did not engage in combat with Hong and Yang. Is that true?

### The Protagonist of the Xigong Banner Tragedy: Queen Qi Junfeng

— Xiu Tang

According to a report on the 25th, the Queen of the Xigong Banner of Ulanqab League, Qi Junfeng, and the young Wang of the Mo Clan, Qi Fawu, were assassinated by Hao Youlong, the head of the security regiment of the banner, and his troops in the Gongsha area. The news of the murder shocked the border. The truth of the tragedy is still under investigation by the relevant authorities. Queen Qi Junfeng and the wife of the E Wang of the Donggong Banner, Ba Yunying, are both well-known anti-Japanese queens in Mongolia. During the war, they led the Mongol compatriots to support the central government's resistance against Japan and made great contributions.

Queen Qi Junfeng was the daughter of Shilabdorji (King Shi), the Jasagh of the Xigong Banner of Ulanqab League. Her father was a prince of the Alxa Banner of Ningxia at the end of the Qing Dynasty with revolutionary ideas, so he was removed from his position and exiled. She lived in Beiping with her mother. During this time, she studied Mongolian and Chinese languages. She was intelligent and excelled in eloquence and social skills. In 1932, at the young age of eighteen, she married King Shi.

In 1935, the East Assistant E Baozhai of Xigong Banner colluded with Ishidagden, the uncle of King Shi and a senior Lama, under the instigation of Prince De, and a rebellion occurred. After two years, it was fortunately quelled by the stationed troops. This was a difficult time she experienced with King Shi shortly after her marriage, and it was also a scene that honed her abilities. In 1936, King Shi passed away, and she was only twenty-two years old at this time, becoming a young widow. Fortunately, she was already pregnant. The people around King Shi wanted to take the opportunity to push the former Guanqi, Zhongkesa Geduer Zhabu, to inherit King Shi's position as Jasagh, but she strongly opposed it because she was pregnant and did not know if it would be a boy or girl. As a result, a compromise was reached with Sa Ren, the East Assistant, concurrently holding the seal of Jasagh. This handling of the matter fully demonstrated her courage and political ability. Sure enough, in 1937, she gave birth to a son named Altanochir, so the succession was no longer a problem. This Altanochir is the young Wang Qi Fawu who was also murdered this time.

On July 7, 1937, the Xigong Banner was invaded by enemy cavalry. The East Assistant Sageduer Zhabu and the West Assistant Seringhorlochochir surrendered to the enemy, colluding with the E Qi of the previous rebellion, seizing the seal, and using all means of coercion and enticement. However, the Queen did not move slightly. In an environment of life-threatening hardship and difficulty, the brave Queen Qi Junfeng had to resolutely take her old mother and son to flee. On the night of February 24, 1938, she escaped from the tiger's mouth, reorganized the troops, and carried out the anti-Japanese war mission of the Mongolian banner. The central government deeply appreciated her steadfastness and loyalty and formally appointed her as the Jasagh and garrison commander of the Xigong Banner. Not long after, she also served as a member of the Sui Border Mongolian Government Affairs Committee and a special commissioner of the Kuanyuan Mongolian Banner Party Affairs. She is the first woman in Mongolian history to serve as the head of a banner, the garrison commander with military responsibilities, and the party and government work. (25th)

### The Demise of an Honest Official

— Li Baifeng

The Shanghai news section of the Ta Kung Pao published a news item about Zhang Xiuwen, the former director of the Salt Affairs Bureau, publicly seeking employment. I finished reading it with infinite sympathy and felt very disappointed.

The news began by saying: "Life is pressing. The former director of the National Salt Administration... submitted a letter to the reader's page of this newspaper seeking employment..." It is true that life is pressing, but it is strange that even a salt bureau official, who has been recognized as a lucrative position since ancient times, feels the pressure of life after leaving office.

The problem is not that life has been able to push someone as noble as the director of the salt bureau to the point of not being able to survive, but that an official like Zhang, who has served in the salt bureau for as long as 35 years, not only failed to spend his years leisurely after leaving office but even had to lose face, complain to the public, and seek help after being "pressed by life."

This is truly the demise of an "honest official," and it also shows that it is very undesirable to be an honest official. "Clean sleeves" have now become a historical term. I never thought that I would actually see such a person in this life who is digging his own grave with this outdated and pedantic thinking, causing his wife and children to suffer along with him.

We don't need to talk about the salt officials since the Republic of China. First, let's talk about how, after the Han Dynasty inherited the evils of the Qin Dynasty, powerful families monopolized the profits of salt and iron. It was said that: "The income from salt profits does not benefit the country above, nor the people below, but only fills the private pockets of the salt officials. The state's salt tax revenue is not even enough to pay the salaries of the service personnel." This is what the Book of Han says: "The taxes of the world are not even enough to pay for their transportation expenses." The wealth of salt officials was such that they not only "communicated with princes and nobles and their power exceeded that of officials," but they also exhausted all the luxuries of the world. The feasts and revelry of salt officials in the late Qing Dynasty are described in detail in folklore novels.

Therefore, we feel that Mr. Zhang was unable to "commit adultery with the counties, increase empty accounts, the government treasury was not substantial, and the people were in distress..." during his tenure in the salt administration, which had been plagued by such problems for nearly two thousand years. This is precisely the cause of his being pressed by life today.

For an ordinary salt official, whether it is the Han, Jin, Yuan, Ming dynasties, or even the late Qing Dynasty or the Republic of China, if they are a little "flexible," they can currently live in Shanghai as a retired gentleman with three to five "Studebakers" and three to five garden villas. How much more should it be true for Mr. Zhang, who has served in the salt administration for thirty-five years and held the esteemed position of Director-General of the General Bureau, who has reached the point of publicly seeking employment, and the conditions for seeking employment are set so "pitifully"!

According to the reporter's report after visiting, it is believed that

Mr. Zhang: "Participated in the revolution in his early years, later served in the Ministry of Finance, and then transferred to the Salt Affairs Bureau, where he worked for more than 30 years. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Director of the Sichuan-Kang Salt Administration Bureau... After the reorganization of the General Salt Affairs Bureau into the Salt Administration Bureau, he served as the first Director..." Just looking at this resume, if it were not for the faithful report of the Ta Kung Pao, we might express doubts.

Starting from Mr. Zhang's job search, I can't help but think of my many friends whose positions are far inferior to those of Mr. Zhang, who transport wine and meat in large trucks when entertaining guests, and the scene of dozens of tables at a time.

I am someone who has eaten the wine and food of salt officials, and I have never thought that there would be salt officials in the world as poor as me. Mr. Zhang's matter proves on the one hand that honest officials have reached the end of the road and no one should do it again, and on the other hand, it can also explain that many people were not rich officials when they were in office, but after leaving office, they can actually live as extravagant retired gentlemen in Shanghai. The unspeakable points can be understood with a thought.

### American Miscellany

— Xu Shuyuan

Many Sinologists in the United States praise the thorough service in Shanghai barbershops, where a single haircut takes at least an hour. While this may be uneconomical in terms of time, the thorough scraping, polishing, and meticulous care are worthwhile. Although the barber's rough fingers may cause unpleasant sensations when stroking your face, the entire process – haircutting, shaving, washing, blow-drying, and applying hair oil – costs only 10,000 to 20,000 Legal Tender, equivalent to two or three dimes in the black market, which is extremely cheap. Once you come to the United States, you will encounter great difficulties with haircuts. When you step into the barbershop, many customers are already waiting. You have to sit down in order and may have to wait for two hours. Finally, you hear a "Next" and it's your turn to sit in the swivel chair. The barber picks up an electric clipper and sweeps through your hair like a gust of wind blowing away fallen leaves, shaving it into a spiky mess like a jackfruit. In less than three minutes, your head is shaved or, to put it bluntly, slaughtered, for 75 cents. He asks if you want a shave, which costs another 50 cents. Do you want a shampoo? Great, that's another 50 cents. After washing your hair, you have to add oil and water, and the price depends on the brand, usually between 50 cents and one dollar. The final bill comes to about two or three dollars, which is 70,000 to 80,000 Legal Tender. If you want a black man to shine your shoes, you sit on a high chair like the sedan chair of the City God, and rest your legs on a bar. There is no fixed price for shining shoes; one dime is not too little, and five dimes are not too much. As you leave, the black man brushes your coat and you have to take out a dime to earn a "Thanks." When you get home and look closely, your face, neck, and body are covered with short hairs. To avoid being ripped off and to avoid trouble, it is best for students in the United States to buy a pair of clippers and serve each other. Service is the foundation of diligence and thrift. It can save money and develop a skill. If you return to your country and become unemployed, you can still be employed as a "waiting for orders" scholar with a PhD title. Anyway, most ships do not have barbers or are too busy. I advise the first class of self-funded students to practice haircuts at home first, because your 800 official-rate US dollars will not be enough to pay for your haircuts in the United States for three years.

### Butterfly Loves Flowers

— Huang Zhong

Recently, a university student, Huo Wanli, broke into the boudoir of Miss Chen, his girlfriend, with an unloaded pistol and forced her to marry him—see the city news section of this newspaper.

Shouldn't proposals involve kneeling? Why force entry into her chambers late at night! Doesn't he realize the arrow of love is potent? Brandishing a gun to show a heroic spirit?

Don't laugh at his foolish behavior back then; he learned from both Hua Chong and Zhang Junrui! From now on, forced proposals will become a bad precedent; Misses will be afraid to socialize!

### Thirty-Three Years of the European War

— Ding Rongguan

Thirty-three years have passed! The Austrian Archduke and his wife were assassinated in the capital of Bosnia on June 28th. A month later, on the evening of July 28th, Austria officially declared war on Serbia! Were over 1,500 days of fighting and over 30 million deaths and injuries not enough for the largest massacre in history?

However, who remembers these bloody and ugly lessons? In just over a decade, weren't the firebugs of the Far East rekindling the wildfire that was already burning? Mankind once again relived the abominable suffering; over 2,000 days of hand-to-hand combat and over 50 million deaths and injuries. History does not repeat itself, but mistakes are repeated over and over again!

Twenty-nine years ago, the sound of the armistice bell rang throughout London. Lloyd George addressed the members of parliament:

"Thus, at eleven o'clock this morning, the most cruel, most terrible, and unprecedented war that has tormented mankind has ended. I hope I can say that on this fateful morning, all wars have ended."

Reality is a terrible mocker! Not long after, Hitler tried "my old fight" in the dream of the "Third Reich." Mussolini completed his exposure of his corpse on the streets of Milan in the delusion of "Roman reconstruction." And Showa practiced the glorious "kneel down" in the poisonous fog of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"—who was helping them to be so arrogant?

"We are living in the most difficult era today. The years of fighting were a time of crisis, sometimes even alarming, but I think the current period is in many ways even more dangerous than wartime" (Marshall's address at Princeton University on February 22 of this year when receiving an honorary degree). In the 1950s, mankind has already tasted more than two catastrophes. Historical mistakes must not be repeated. Facing this path of co-existence or mutual destruction, let the world cherish the path it should follow!
