### Deeply Hope the CCP Will Exercise Mutual Tolerance for the Sake of the Country, Abandon Preconceived Notions, and Continue Negotiations: The Government Announces a Plan to Resume Peace Talks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Central Propaganda Department released the following statement on the afternoon of January 20th regarding the government's desire for peace negotiations and its progress: The National Government's greatest goal is to implement constitutional government and complete national construction. Therefore, it has been seeking the peaceful unification of the country at all times. As early as the initial stage of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to unite the strength of the entire country, it recruited people from various parties and social elites to establish the National Political Council. Regarding the CCP issue, the government has always considered it a political issue. Therefore, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang on November 10, 1942, and the Central Executive Committee on September 11, 1943, both unanimously advocated using political methods to seek a quick solution. The continuous negotiations between the government and the CCP representatives after May 1944 were aimed at obtaining a political solution. When the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association convened on March 1, 1945, Chairman Chiang reiterated that the CCP issue must be resolved peacefully as soon as possible and proposed three steps for the implementation of constitutional government, because the CCP issue, if unresolved, is a major obstacle to national unification and all construction. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang telegraphed an invitation to CCP leader Mao Zedong to come to Chongqing for negotiations. Finally, on October 10 of the same year, both parties signed the "Double Tenth Agreement" and expressed that they would continue to negotiate on the basis of mutual trust and mutual concession in order to achieve a satisfactory result. Since the convening of the Political Consultative Conference at the beginning of last year, the government and the Communist Party have negotiated on various issues such as military affairs and transportation. In various stages, General Marshall of the Allied United States has made many efforts to promote various agreements. The Chinese and foreigners alike eagerly anticipated the common

The Political Consultative Conference was originally an important decision in the "Double Tenth Agreement." It was convened on January 10, 1946, in Chongqing, the wartime capital. Regarding all the agreements, the government has repeatedly declared and the Kuomintang Second Central Executive Committee has resolved that "they are willing to cooperate with all parties and people from all walks of life with the greatest sincerity to promote its implementation." However, many of the PCC resolutions have not been implemented in the past year due to the following facts:

(1) According to the Sino-Soviet Agreement, the nine northeastern provinces should have been taken over by the National Government. When the Soviet army began to withdraw, the government sent troops to station in the Northeast. The CCP troops obstructed in many ways and occupied various places in Liaobei that had been taken over by the government in mid-March, and attacked Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places. In order to fulfill treaty obligations and maintain the sovereignty of the takeover, the government had to make the "March 27 Northeast Truce Agreement." However, after repeated mediation, there was still no result. The Northeast issue has not been resolved smoothly to this day, and the National Assembly, which was decided by the Political Consultative Conference to be convened on May 5, has also been postponed.

(2) After the government returned to Nanjing in May last year, the conflicts in the Northeast intensified and the transportation in North China remained disrupted. From June 7th, the government and the CCP ordered a ceasefire for 15 days. An agreement was about to be reached on three matters: completely stopping the conflicts in the Northeast, restoring domestic transportation, and implementing the military reorganization plan. Unexpectedly, although the ceasefire order was extended three times, the CCP occupied Dezhou, Tai'an, and other places during the ceasefire period, and besieged Datong and Jinan and the periphery of Qingdao. Therefore, the agreement drafted by both parties could not be effectively resolved.

(3) Before the convening of the National Assembly in November, the government, in view of the unrest and instability in the country and the urgent desire for peace of the people across the country, and feeling the sincere hope expressed by various parties and non-party individuals to stop the conflict as soon as possible, proposed eight understandings to the Communist Party on October 16 in order to order a ceasefire and convene the National Assembly as scheduled to formulate a constitution. Although third-party individuals ran around to mediate and proposed a compromise plan, the government repeatedly expressed its willingness to make concessions. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party firmly opposed the compromise plan and demanded the suspension of the National Assembly, which led to a standstill.

### According to the Decision of the Committee of Three, There Is No Need to Dispute the Military Positions

The Passage of the Draft Constitution Is Also in Accordance with the Principles of the Political Consultative Conference

After the National Assembly, the government, with the constitutional implementation scheduled, was eager to resume peace talks and conveyed to the CCP through US Ambassador Stuart that the government was willing to send personnel to Yan'an to continue negotiations. However, the CCP's response was still to restore the military positions before January 13 last year and to abolish the constitution formulated by the National Assembly as preconditions. However, it is not known that the military positions before January 13 last year have changed greatly due to the passage of time, and the areas that the government has recovered. Once withdrawn, the lives and property of the people in the area will have no support. Restoring order and protecting the people is the duty of the government. How can we bear to let the people suffer the tragedy of revenge and murder again? If the Communist Party is sincere in peace, it can implement the reorganization and unification plans that have been established by the Committee of Three, then there is no need to dispute the temporary military positions. As for the abolition of the constitution, the National Assembly for formulating the constitution was composed of representatives of all ethnic groups, provinces, cities, and occupations across the country, and the PCC resolution had already stipulated that various parties and social elites would also participate together. It is by no means as the CCP claims that it was monopolized by the Kuomintang. Moreover, the constitution it passed is also the draft constitution agreed upon by the PCC, in which the Communist Party and various parties participated together, and the draft constitution formulated by the Constitution Drafting Committee based on those principles. The CCP has no reason to oppose it.

New Program Content

Based on the above facts, it can be seen that the government has spared no effort to compromise for the sake of national peace and unity, in the hope of introspection by the CCP. Because "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" are the goals jointly adhered to by the Political Consultative Conference, if the CCP can sincerely practice them, it should not stubbornly adhere to prejudices and have doubts. In short, more than a year has passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and peaceful unification cannot be delayed any longer. It is deeply hoped that the CCP will understand the government's hard work in exercising mutual tolerance for the sake of the country and striving for a political solution, abandon preconceived notions, and continue negotiations. The government is still willing to make the greatest concessions and sincerity, and humbly accept, and hereby reveals the plan to restore peace again as the basis for continuing peace talks and reorganizing the government. The plan is as follows:

(1) The government is willing to send personnel to Yan'an or invite the CCP to send personnel to Beijing to continue negotiations, or hold a round table meeting, inviting various parties and social elites to participate.

(2) The government and the CCP should immediately order a ceasefire on the spot and negotiate effective measures for the ceasefire.

(3) Regarding the reorganization of the army and the restoration of transportation, the government is still willing to continue negotiations on the principles of the past agreement of the Committee of Three on the location of the army, the reorganization procedures, and the implementation measures for the restoration of transportation.

(4) Before the implementation of the constitution, the government is willing to negotiate with the Communist Party to determine a fair and reasonable solution for the local governments in the disputed areas. (End)

### The Democratic League Proposes Four Suggestions for the Current Situation

Advocates for Re-negotiating and Establishing a Coalition Government

[Our Newspaper] The Democratic League held a press conference at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 2:30 p.m. on the 20th. Zhang Junmai, Xian Ying, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others attended. Luo Longji presented the Democratic League's declaration on the current situation and explained the main points.

The Declaration Is Divided into Six Points

The declaration is more than 16,000 words in length and is divided into six parts: The first part explains the nature, purpose, and working methods of the Democratic League, stating: The Democratic League is an "independent political group" whose "purpose is to realize democracy in China," and its primary task is to "mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in order to achieve national unity, unification, and peace." The second part reviews last year's peace talks and believes that failure to resolve the Northeast issue was the source of the PCC's failure. The Democratic League opposed such a loss at that time. Luo emphasized that the spirit of the PCC resolution lies in the process of implementing the PCC resolution. Therefore, if a coalition government is not formed to jointly implement various resolutions, and a one-party government implements them, the spirit of the PCC has been destroyed. The third part is an analysis of domestic problems, with emphasis on the economic aspect, and the suffering of the people is the main topic of discussion. The fourth part studies the international situation, pointing out that the failure of Marshall's mediation should be attributed to the mistakes of the US policy towards China and hoping to correct it. It also specifically points out the short-sightedness of a few people in the United States who want to support Japan in order to dominate Asia. The fifth part reviews last year's democratic movement, with special attention to the losses of the Democratic League members.

Three Conditions for Peace Talks

The sixth part is the conclusion, which believes that there are three preconditions for resuming peace talks, namely: (1) The government should first and foremost protect the people's freedom. (2) The government should first and foremost end all long-term war preparations. The CCP should also stop full mobilization in order to stabilize society and show the CCP's sincerity in seeking peace. (3) The government should earnestly recognize and respect the equal and legal status of parties. After the preconditions are met, the Democratic League has four suggestions for the current situation: (1) Strive to promote peace talks and oppose the method of "reorganizing the government and then seeking to restore peace" because it will cause "long-term civil war and permanent division." (2) Re-hold political consultation, and the necessary conditions for this consultation are: the power must be higher than the participating parties, and the scope of discussion must include all national political, military, economic, and other issues. The separation of political and military solutions and the discussion of central political institutions without addressing local institutions in last year's PCC are now considered to be mistakes. (3) Implement the previous PCC resolutions because last year's PCC resolutions are nothing less than China's Magna Carta, a contract jointly signed by all parties that must be trusted and observed together. (4) Establish a coalition government. This coalition government is a coalition government in which "the whole country is united and all parties have equal participation," including local governments.

### Prosecutors Will Not Consider Overdue Reports of Traitor Cases

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the case of ending the reporting of the property of traitors, the Central Trust Bureau's Clearing Office for Enemy and Puppet Property in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas has been ordered to limit the reporting of traitor cases by people or groups during the Anti-Japanese War to before December 31, 1946.

### The Xisha Islands Issue Is Expected to Be Resolved Peacefully

Minister Bai Reports at the Commemoration Week

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] A reporter visited a spokesperson for a relevant authority on the 20th about rumors that the French army was attempting to land on the Xisha Islands by force. It was reported that some French officials had indeed made this attempt in the past, and French warships had sailed close to the Xisha waters. They left after being warned by our garrison troops. The wise men of the French side also ordered a halt to such behavior. At present, the situation in the Xisha Islands has not changed much, and there will be no armed conflicts. Qian Tai, our ambassador to France, recently issued a statement of sovereignty again in Paris. The government's position is very clear and firm. It is expected that the French side will not make mistakes and cause political disputes over this small island with no economic value, which will affect the friendly relations between China and France.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 20th] Defense Minister Bai Chongxi gave a speech at the Commemoration Week on the morning of the 20th, reviewing the Xisha Islands issue and discussing the recent landing of French troops on the island. According to well-informed sources here, a French warship sailed to the Xisha Islands a few days ago, and a small team of French troops landed on its main island and demanded that the Chinese garrison on the island withdraw, but was rejected by the commander of the garrison. The Chinese and French governments are currently negotiating on this matter, with each side arguing for historical and diplomatic reasons. However, the relations between the two countries are good, so it is unlikely that this "small problem" will cause trouble, and this matter will soon be reconciled.

### Incident of a U.S. Soldier Raping a Female Student in Beiping: Debate Court Scheduled for Today; Twelve U.S. Witnesses Interrogated Yesterday

[Report from our Beiping Bureau, 20th] A heavy snow fell in Beiping City on the 20th. On the third day of the public trial of the U.S. soldier's atrocity case, the Chinese defense witnesses have finished their testimonies. Today, the U.S. witnesses presented by the defendant will be interrogated, totaling twelve individuals. Among them, five were present at the scene, two were U.S. medical officers who examined Ms. Shen Chong, and some others testified regarding the number of passersby, sound levels, and lighting on the streets near the incident location on the evening of the 13th (details omitted). Although these witnesses presented testimonies today that were generally favorable to Pearson, there were many inconsistencies in their statements. (1) The U.S. officer on duty at the Sino-American Police Liaison Office that night and other U.S. military police who arrived at the scene claimed they did not hear anyone accusing Pearson of "rape" that night. However, one heard someone using Chinese to say the words "rape." (2) Among the five military police who were present at the scene, two stated that after the police and military police arrived, they saw Pearson still with his hand on Ms. Shen's shoulder, one saying it lasted for ten minutes, and the other saying the time was very short. Another said he saw the hand on Ms. Shen's waist, while the other two, one said he did not see it, and the other said he did not pay attention. (3) The U.S. soldier who went out with Pearson that afternoon said that Pearson had been drinking and was drunk, and that his hand was scratched by a glass, providing an explanation for Pearson's hand injury. (4) The medical officer examined Ms. Shen's injuries twice, once at 8:00 AM on the 25th and the second time on the 5th of this month. The first examination revealed that Ms. Shen's hymen was ruptured, and there were three small lacerations at the entrance of the vagina, totaling half an inch in length. The surfaces of the wounds were red and broken, and the wounds were one-eighth of an inch wide. Otherwise, no injuries were found. Later, Shen informed them that there were still injuries that had not been examined, so they went to examine her again and found four injuries on her left leg, but they had already scabbed over. Subsequently, the defense lawyer and the prosecuting attorney questioned each other for a considerable period, mutually protesting that the medical officer admitted that the injuries could have occurred on the 24th. The defense lawyer asked whether normal sexual intercourse could cause such injuries, and the response was that it was possible, but under certain conditions, and only if there had not been many instances of sexual intercourse previously. They also asked if the injuries could have been caused by the first examination (referring to the examination by Dr. Wang Hecheng), and the answer was "possible." The prosecuting attorney then asked if, from a physician's ethical standpoint, it should be disclosed to subsequent examiners if the injuries were caused during the first examination, and the answer was "it should." The defense lawyer further asked, "Could Ms. Shen have had sexual intercourse before the 24th?" The answer was "Unable to answer," but stated, "It is safe to say that she had not had it many times before." After the prosecuting attorney protested the scope of this question, the second sentence was withdrawn. Finally, Ms. Shen's long wool coat and white pants were presented as evidence in court, and it was announced that the debate court would be held on the 21st. It was also learned that Shen's side will submit as supplementary evidence on the 21st the shrunk coat worn on that day, which is being chemically tested at Peking University Hospital.

[United Press, Beiping, 20th] Regarding the atrocity case of a U.S. soldier against Peking University student Shen Chong, U.S. military police officer Lieutenant Colonel Ward used Chinese in the U.S. military court to defend the defendant, stating: Chinese police and the victim did not accuse the defendant Pearson of rape on the night of his arrest. It was only on the following day that the U.S. military police were notified that Miss Shen had accused him of rape. The Chinese police only told him that Pearson was "apprehended with a young woman on the playing field." Ward also testified: Pearson was intoxicated. The other eight witnesses for the defendant also testified that the defendant was intoxicated. U.S. Navy medical officer Captain Clark, who examined Ms. Shen, testified that he found only three small abrasions at the entrance of Ms. Shen's vagina on the day after the incident. These abrasions could have occurred during normal sexual intercourse or a previous examination. If the woman had resisted, the injuries would have been greater. No other injuries were found on the woman's body, and Miss Shen also stated that there were no other injuries. Nine days later, Ms. Shen requested another examination, and three small abrasions were then found on her leg.

### No Major Changes in the Lunan Battle Situation; Traffic on the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway Restored; No Traces of Communist Troops Near Yongcheng

[Report from our Xuzhou Bureau, 20th] There are no traces of Communist troops near Yongcheng; there are still minor skirmishes around Jinxiang.

[Report from our Xuzhou Bureau, 20th] There are no major changes in the Lunan battle situation. Although the Communist troops continue to attack Zaozhuang, they have all been repelled. The Communist troops' offensive is now on the decline, and morale within the ranks is wavering, with soldiers surrendering to the National Army with their weapons. Zaozhuang is as solid as a rock, and the war situation will have a new turning point in the coming days.

[Report from our Bengbu Bureau, 20th] More than 50 Communist troops have gathered in the Lucheng Chadian area, attempting to attack Shenqiu. The Communist troops are only over 80 li away from Linquan, and the situation on the Anhui border is becoming serious.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] After the National Army advanced into Xin'an Town between Xuzhou and Haizhou, traffic on the eastern section of the land and sea routes has been restored.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] (1) The Communist troops in Lunan are currently attacking Zaozhuang with all their strength. For the past two days, they have been charging fiercely at the National Army day and night. The battle situation is extremely intense. As of this morning, Zaozhuang is still firmly defended by the National Army. (2) The National Army on the south side of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is advancing towards the railway line. One unit arrived at Xin'an Town on the 19th. The eastern railway line defeated the resistance of the Communist troops, capturing a large number of enemy soldiers.

Over the past week, the National Army has arrived at the line of Niushan Station (about 35 kilometers west of Donghai), Ahu, Xin'an Town, Yaowan, and Guojiaji (all the above places are on the Longhai Line, except Yaowan) to pacify the local area. The main force of the Communist troops was defeated each time, with little resistance. Only a few hundred Communist troops briefly harassed Yaowan on the evening of the 18th, but they were repelled by the National Army. In addition, there has been no fighting behind the front line of the National Army. As for the Jingjiang, Taixing, and Taixian areas in Jiangbei, there are no Communist troops present.

[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 20th] Military news: The Communist troops who crossed the river to attack southward have suffered considerable blows and heavy losses after being counterattacked by the National Army in recent days. Their New First and New Second Divisions, as well as the Jibei Military Region troops, were defeated northeast of Jiutai and retreated northward. Their Sixth Column and Sixth Division were successively defeated southeast of Dehui and southwest of Nong'an and fled in disarray. The Communist troops' winter offensive has now failed, and their attempt to occupy Changji and cut off the Jichang Line has been completely foiled.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 20th] The 16th and 17th Divisions of the Northeast Communist Sixth Column, totaling more than 10,000 troops, entrenched themselves in Hou Shigou, east of Dehui, on the 18th, relying on the terrain to resist stubbornly. Their Third Division, with more than 5,000 troops, entrenched itself near Dafangshen. Another unit of more than 30,000 Communist troops retreated to the Baiqitun area on the 17th. The National Army recovered Mushihe and Chengzi Street on the 17th and advanced to the line of Hanjialing Qianhenantun on the 18th. Xiajiadian, east of Dehui, was also recovered by the National Army on the 17th.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 19th] According to a military official here speaking to reporters today: The Communist troops' offensive launched this time north of the Jichang Railway has been planned for a long time. At the end of last year, there were frequent movements in various places along the Songhua River. First, a test was made in Chen'an, which was repulsed after suffering losses. Then, forces were concentrated in an attempt to cut off the Jichang Railway in one fell swoop, damage the tunnels of Tumenling, and the coal mines of Yingchengzi, to isolate Jilin and then besiege it. However, due to the steadfastness of the few National Army troops on the outskirts of Jilin, the Communist troops suffered heavy casualties. Coupled with the National Army's reinforcements and counterattacks, their conspiracy was foiled. It is estimated that there have been more than ten battles, large and small, in the two weeks from the 6th to the 18th of this month. During this period, in addition to Hewan Ten Station being briefly occupied and burned, and the people in the war zone being sacrificed, looted, enslaved, and abducted, the Communist troops gained nothing. When the official spoke to reporters, he was still in contact with the front lines by telephone from time to time. The National Army is currently clearing the battlefield and pursuing the remnants of the Communist troops.

[Report from our Beiping Bureau, 20th] The Changchun military has returned the Communist Party's radio station at the Changchun Branch of the Military Mediation Department, which was sealed a few days ago.

Mr. Cai sent a letter through the U.S. representative to the Communist representatives, stating: The government believes that the military situation in Changchun is critical, and it cannot guarantee the safety of the Communist representatives who wish to return to Changchun from Beiping to investigate. As for the forced occupation of the radio station of the Changchun Communist delegation and the guarding of Communist personnel, the blame lies with a certain "adjutant." Restrictions on the Communist personnel have now been lifted, so this matter can be considered closed. The Communist side replied, publishing the second telegram sent by the Changchun Communist representatives, which stated: The radio station has been returned, but there is no electricity, and the Communist personnel are still restricted. The reply also revealed a new incident that occurred at the Beiping West Suburbs Airport today.

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau, 20th] Diplomatic sources: The war in French Indochina is frequent, and overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam are often in danger.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 19th] The Dutch East Indies government issued a public statement tonight stating: According to the latest estimates by the Chinese Consul in Palembang, the number of Chinese casualties in the conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands there is as follows: 250 dead, 1,000 injured, 600 missing, and 900 homeless. The property losses of the overseas Chinese amounted to 5 million Straits dollars, of which 200,000 Straits dollars were due to Dutch East Indies actions, 1.5 million were due to Indonesian arson, and the rest were due to looting.

### Editorial: From the Xisha Islands to France's Colonial Policy

According to reports, the French side has dispatched several warships carrying marines, preparing to sail to the Xisha Islands to land. The Chinese navy stationed on the islands has requested instructions from the Ministry of National Defense. Although this news has not been officially confirmed, judging from common sense, its reliability is quite high. Recently, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry declared on the 9th that France has always believed that the Xisha Islands belong to Vietnam, but before receiving an official report sufficient to prove that Chinese troops have occupied the Xisha Islands, the French government has not yet decided what action it will take. This passage was transmitted to China by Reuters, and after being published in the newspapers, public opinion was in an uproar. Reporters from various newspapers telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for inquiries, and Ye Gongchao, the Director of the European Department, replied: "The Chinese government has recovered the Xisha Islands from Japanese occupation. The sovereignty of the islands belongs to China, so there is no need to go through the formalities of requesting recovery from any party." From this, it can be seen that the Xisha Islands have become an object of contention between China and France.

The French side believes that the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands should belong to Vietnam, and its reasons are four: (1) The Kings of Annam repeatedly requested to obtain the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they were only occupied by China in 1920, and their administrative power was划 into Hainan Island. In 1930, the Chinese government decided to exploit the resources of the Xisha Islands, but France, claiming to be the protector of the five countries of Annam, came out to express its objection, and said that France also wanted to take the same action. (2) France proposed a friendly settlement to China in 1937, and stated that if the Chinese government refused, it would ask a third country to arbitrate. (3) China agreed in 1938 that France would occupy the Xisha Islands in the name of the Kingdom of Annam, and the Vietnamese army only withdrew from the islands when the Japanese army occupied the islands in March 1945. (4) The Xisha Islands are very important in military strategy, but they were not used for military strategy during World War II.

The reasons provided by the French side are obviously insufficient and really have no value for defending. According to legal principles and facts, it is not difficult for us to prove that the Xisha Islands should belong to China: First, the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands belongs to China, which has a long history, and its administrative power is also assigned to Guangdong Province. Chinese fishermen must go to the Xisha Islands from Hainan Island every year to engage in fishing, and the Chinese navy also goes to patrol from time to time. Second, the Sino-French Treaty of Tianjin in 1858 has a map attached, which can prove that the Xisha Islands belong to China. Third, in 1908, the Chinese Customs proposed to build a lighthouse on the Xisha Islands for the safety of ships sailing; in 1930, when the International Meteorological Conference was held in Hong Kong, it was also proposed that the Chinese government set up a meteorological station on the Xisha Islands to facilitate navigation at sea. Fourth, between 1932 and 1938, the diplomatic authorities of China and France exchanged countless notes. In its repeated notes to the French Foreign Ministry, the Chinese government never expressed its abandonment of its sovereignty over the Xisha Islands; at the same time, it never recognized France's occupation of the Xisha Islands in the name of the Kingdom of Annam in 1938. Fifth, when France suddenly occupied my country's Tuansha Islands on July 25, 1933, Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, protested to the French government, stating that the islands are not only geographically part of the Xisha Islands, which form the territory of China, but also the majority of the inhabitants on the island are Chinese fishermen, so the sovereignty belongs to China, and France should return the islands to China. This note is really the most powerful evidence, and the French diplomatic authorities can turn out the previous files for review. I remember that at that time, the Japanese government also issued a statement on August 21 of the same year: "This occupation by France cannot be regarded as having taken effect in international law, and Japan expresses its firm opposition to France's occupation of the Tuansha Islands."

From the above, it can be seen that there is absolutely no doubt that the Xisha Islands belong to China; but now France is forcibly quibbling, trying to occupy the Xisha Islands in the name of Vietnam, and no matter from which angle you observe it, it is an unwise move by France, not only revealing that France still harbors imperialistic ambitions for its overseas colonies, but also this attempt will inevitably arouse the anger of the 450 million people of China! The relations between China and France have always been very friendly, especially during World War II, the positions of China and France were quite similar, so between the people of the two countries, there was a sense of "sympathy for each other," which made the friendship between the two countries more consolidated. After the war, the Chinese people were particularly concerned about the political situation in France; the first aircraft of the French airline that day, test-flew to Shanghai, and was warmly welcomed by the citizens of Shanghai. This is a powerful proof of the friendship between the Chinese and French people. In the future, China and France should find ways to promote the relations between the two countries, and all actions that may stimulate the emotions of the people of the two countries should be avoided as much as possible. Taking the current conflict between France and Vietnam as an example, although China sympathizes with the liberation movement of the Vietnamese people, it still maintains a neutral position in order to cherish the relations between China and France. This is China's expression of its willingness to maintain friendly relations with France. The London Times commented on France's colonial policy the day before yesterday, saying that it was similar to the policy of the Roman Empire. This unpleasant but sincere advice is worth considering by the French authorities. Whether this kind of colonial policy can conform to the trend of the times in the post-war peaceful and democratic world needs to be reconsidered!

[This Newspaper News] San Francisco 20th Broadcast, Washington News: The US Air Transport Command announced: Marshal Marshall's special plane was unable to take off from Burbank City, California due to bad weather, so Marshal Marshall will not be able to arrive in Washington as scheduled today.

[United Press Washington 20th] Marshal Marshall was originally scheduled to come to Washington today to be sworn in as Secretary of State, but the swearing-in ceremony will be postponed indefinitely due to bad flying weather.

[United Press California Burbank 19th] Marshal Marshall arrived here today by special plane from Honolulu. Marshall smiled and did not answer reporters' questions, saying "no comment, you must know that I have not yet taken office as Secretary of State." Mrs. Marshall went, and the couple spent most of the day in Hollywood, visiting McCoyse, Marshall's wartime staff secretary.

[Associated Press Washington 20th] The new Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to be sworn in at the White House at 11:00 am today (Eastern Standard Time), with Chief Justice Vincent of the Supreme Court presiding over the oath. After that, Marshall will hold his first meeting with President Truman. At the same time, former Secretary of State Byrnes will also sign the first batch of peace treaties of World War II at the State Department conference at 9:30 am on the same day. After these two grand ceremonies, another new era in the United States' post-war international relations will begin. Byrnes has completed the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary in 18 months of arduous tasks. The four peace treaties, together with the peace treaty with Finland, will be officially signed in Paris on February 10. The United States has never declared war on Finland, so it cannot be one of the signatory countries. After Marshall succeeds as Secretary of State, he will take on the task of concluding peace treaties with Germany and Austria, and continue to work to resolve the China issue. Marshall must also work to rebuild peace and draft a peace treaty with Japan, and one of his most important tasks is to review the United States' policy toward the Soviet Union.

### Widespread Lack of Freedom in Poland, US Government Considers Sanctions, Preliminary Results Show Government Party Wins

[Reuters Warsaw 20th] The initial results of the general election in the 18 districts of Warsaw show that the government party "Democratic Bloc" won 21,000 votes, while Mikolajczyk's opposition Peasant Party only won 6,000 votes.

The reports from US Ambassador Bliss and US newspaper reporters on the election activities of the Polish government will be studied in detail before the United States may take new actions. It is expected that the State Department has obtained sufficient evidence of the lack of freedom in the Polish elections, and officials here are now studying the following measures: (1) Veto Poland's request for a $500 million loan from the World Bank; (2) Suspend the shipment of food and industrial equipment relief supplies in the future; (3) Protest the election behavior and notify Poland that the United States will temporarily take the same measures as it has taken against Romania, that is, explain that its elections were not the result of a majority vote. It is reported that the United States' actions against Poland may be decided after Marshall takes office and studies them.

[Agence France-Presse Warsaw 19th] Regarding the general election in Poland, the commander of the civil corps recently told the press that the voters in the suburbs of Warsaw voted in an orderly manner and no accidents occurred. However, according to the leader of the Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, regardless of the election results, Yu will request the Supreme Court to declare it invalid because it violates the election law.

[Reuters London 19th] Representatives from Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Africa held a conference here today at the Swaraj Bhavan (the center of Indians in London) to express their determination to take a completely consistent stance with the Minh people's fight against French imperialism.

The resolution will be sent to the Indian Affairs Department, the British Foreign Office, and the French Embassy.

### Ho Chi Minh Sends Telegram to French President, Calls for Peace

Fierce Battle for Hanoi

[Agence France-Presse Hanoi 20th] The Viet Minh Radio recently announced that Ho Chi Minh, the President of the Republic of Vietnam, took the opportunity of the election of French President Auriol to send a telegram calling for peace.

[This Newspaper News] London 20th Broadcast: Viet Minh Radio broadcast that after the guerrillas used rubble as barricades to make the final defense in the student dormitories in the southwest of Hanoi, the French army attempted to break through the rubble pile after continuous shelling, causing many casualties. Viet Minh regular troops and self-defense corps, as well as some women, defended behind the piles of bricks and stones, resisting the attacking French army.

### French Cabinet Formation Completed, Prime Minister Will Report to Parliament to Obtain Trust, Attitude of the People's Republican Party Still Quite Speculative

[This Newspaper News] London 20th Broadcast: Raudi, who was appointed to form the cabinet, will attend the National Assembly tomorrow, and will determine the list of candidates for the united cabinet, including five communists, five members of the People's Republican Party, and seven socialists.

[United Press Paris 19th] Socialist Prime Minister Ramadier has completed the negotiations with leaders of various parties on cabinet formation, and officially reported to President Auriol that he has accepted the appointment. As soon as he gains the trust of the parliament, he will announce the list of ministers. According to a spokesperson for the People's Republican Party, Bidault has been internally determined to be re-elected as Foreign Minister, and has stated that France's policy toward Germany will remain unchanged. He has full authority to implement this policy when he attends the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March. Pidault also told Ramadier face-to-face that Blum recently contacted Britain and France in London, hoping to revise France's policy toward Germany, and he felt deeply disturbed by it. France's policy toward Germany has been criticized by US officials.

[United Press Paris 19th] Although Ramadier has officially accepted the cabinet formation today, the attitude of the People's Republican Party makes it doubtful whether his cabinet formation mission can succeed in the end. Ramadier intends to include the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and various right-wing organizations in the united cabinet. The Communist Party requested to obtain the position of Minister of National Defense, which Ramadier has agreed to. However, the People's Republican Party has proposed a counter-proposal to Ramadier, advocating that the Ministry of National Defense be divided into the Ministry of Military Equipment and the Ministry of Army, the position of Minister of Military Equipment should belong to the Communist Party, and the position of Minister of Army should belong to other political parties.

### An Englishman's View of Allied-Occupied Japan (4)

— Original by John Morris, Translated by Zhang Deqian

(4) Education Problems

Let us now discuss the central issue of the entire occupation. General MacArthur repeatedly instructed the Japanese government to adopt democratic methods in every aspect of public and private life. I have already described the current achievements in this regard. The difficulty, as MacArthur himself said, lies in the essence of democracy. Democracy must gradually arise from the people's own desires. If democracy is implemented through purely autocratic methods, it is bound to fail. However, only by democratizing Japan first can the entire Far East issue be resolved.

Changing Mindsets Relies on Education

In my opinion, this is entirely a long-term educational problem. I am extremely doubtful that there is any way to change the mindset of Japanese adults. The true purpose of education is to create conditions that enable people to educate themselves. In Japan, I have not seen anything that would make me believe that Japanese adults have any intention of changing their ways. I fear that the eight million demobilized soldiers and sailors who recently returned to their home country will cause trouble. These people have been subjected to long-term mental conditioning by Japanese militarists, and their minds may not be able to change overnight. However, until I left Japan in July 1946, their behavior was so good that it could almost be called exemplary, which was truly unexpected. The reason they did not cause any trouble may be because most of them came from farming families, and Japanese farmers have not been as affected by the current widespread food shortage. However, this does not mean that they do not pose any potential danger.

Thoroughly Remold the Thinking of the Japanese People

I believe that if we want to complete the democratization of Japan and prevent their aggressive desires from reviving in the future, we should focus not on any short-term "re-education," but on a fundamental reorganization of the entire Japanese education system. This is obviously a very difficult task, but it is not impossible. The Japanese authorities also admit that the Japanese education system does need such a reorganization, but so far there has been little practical action. Those that have been effective are limited to purely negative work. Several subjects, such as history, geography, and ethics, are not allowed to be taught until new textbooks that eliminate all narrow-minded nationalism have been published. Some have suggested that the certificates of every Japanese teacher should be carefully reviewed to determine whether they are suitable for this profession. This seems very correct and very proper. Others have suggested that each Japanese teacher should be summoned for individual interviews, which is also very correct. However, there are approximately 414,000 teachers in elementary, middle, and high schools throughout Japan. It will take a very long time to clear this educational field so that we can sow new seeds. Current teachers and students cannot attend classes on time. This is partly due to the housing shortage everywhere, but more importantly, it is due to the general instability of life and the lack of any proactive policies by the authorities. In any case, these suggestions can only solve half of the problem. No one has yet suggested how to obtain new teachers to replace those who are deemed unsuitable (and of course, there are many teachers who are unsuitable) after they have been eliminated.

Long-Term Occupation is Necessary

I personally feel that this problem cannot be completely resolved without a long-term occupation. The occupation should be extended at least to include the education of two entire generations, so that they will not be influenced by reactionary elements when they enter public service in the future. Therefore, the occupation must be extended to fifteen to twenty years. However, the actual number of occupation troops can be greatly reduced. In fact, in the last few years of the occupation, a small and highly specialized regulatory commission would be sufficient.

Before the war, the Japanese government hired many foreign teachers to teach in Japan, especially in higher schools and universities. Most of them were British and American, and their influence was great, which cannot be measured by their numbers. This system should now be restored and expanded. We need a large number of qualified male and female teachers to teach in Japan. They must fervently believe in democracy and be prepared to spend part of their lives promoting the benefits of democracy.

During my trip to Japan, I felt that the young teachers and students in Japan were indeed asking us for help. The more clear-headed among them have begun to recognize that the entire Japanese education system does have its flaws. They cannot say exactly what is wrong, but they want to correct this mistake before their own education is completed. If we cannot satisfy their demands now, we and our descendants will inevitably suffer in the future. (The End)

### Qian Daqun is Spared No Death Penalty, Loses His Soul Upon Hearing the Sentence, His Crime is No Different From Zhou Ni's

Family Members Cover Their Faces and Sob, Expressing Intent to Appeal

[This Newspaper's Report] Qian Daqun, the Deputy Governor of the False Central Reserve Bank, was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. When the criminal Qian was brought to the court, he was holding a gray Russian hat, wearing a dark blue silk-lined cotton gown, a wool scarf, yellow deerskin gloves, leggings, and black patterned leather shoes. He was led to the court by Chief of Police Hu. After Judge Liu questioned his name, age, and place of origin, he stood up and announced the main text of the judgment: "Qian Daqun, colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life, all property, except for necessary living expenses for family members, confiscated." When Judge Liu loudly read the main text to "sentenced to death," the criminal Qian's face suddenly turned ashen, and his body trembled slightly. Then Judge Liu briefly explained the reasons for the judgment, saying: "The defendant Qian Daqun, under the instigation of the traitor Zhou Fohai, prepared to organize the False Central Reserve Bank, and served as 'Director' and 'Deputy Governor' of the bank. All of these roles, he has confessed without denial. His most prominent crime is to arbitrarily set the ratio of 'two to one,' forcing the people to exchange legal tender for counterfeit currency, and providing the enemy with more than 20 billion yuan in counterfeit currency, as well as purchasing a large amount of materials on behalf of the enemy. The total amount of counterfeit currency issued reached more than 4.6 billion yuan, disrupting finance, violating national policies, and undermining the war of resistance. His crimes are serious. Compared with the traitor Zhou Fohai, there is no difference, so he is sentenced to the death penalty. If he does not accept the judgment, he may apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment." Upon hearing this, the criminal Qian still stared blankly at the court, without saying a word, his lips trembling up and down. Two female family members of the defendant in the audience covered their faces and sobbed. When the court ordered him to be returned to custody, his family members followed behind, and the criminal Qian also frequently looked back, being escorted back to the Zhongjian Prison at a hurried pace. According to the family members of the criminal Qian, after receiving the judgment, they intend to apply for a retrial. According to the Shanghai High Court, the criminal Qian is the tenth traitor sentenced to death. (Among them, Liang Hongzhi has been executed, and the Supreme Court changed Ji Peijing's sentence to life imprisonment.)

### Second Batch of German Overseas Chinese to Return Next Month

### Request for Wider Limits on Industrial Electricity and Gas

### Gui Zhongshu Invents the Directional Character Lookup Method

[This Newspaper's Report] Mr. Gui Zhongshu, a senior figure in the legal community of this city, has spent more than three years researching and inventing two methods, the "Directional Character Lookup Method" and the "Chinese Character Spelling Method," which have made great contributions to the study of phonology and linguistics. Mr. Gui, in view of the fact that in Chinese dictionaries that generally use the "radical method" for character lookup, there is no scientific principle for determining which radical a certain character should be classified under, which often wastes time when looking up characters, and improvement is indeed needed. Therefore, based on the principle of pictography, all radicals of characters are divided into five types: "priority," "exclusive," "separated," "connected," and "mixed." Whenever there is a priority radical, the lookup uses the priority radical; when there is no priority radical, the exclusive radical is used; when there is no exclusive radical, the separated radical is used, and so on. In this way, when looking up characters, one can "enter the hall" without mistakenly turning to other radicals. Also, because dictionaries use national phonetic alphabet only to indicate the even tone, the rising tone and departing tone of a character must be comprehended by the reader themselves, which is difficult to guarantee accuracy, it is proposed to use the Chinese character spelling method to indicate the rising, departing, and going tones of the rhyme according to the national phonetic alphabet, and no longer use the spelling method to pronounce. In this way, the rising, departing, and going tones can be accurate, and it can also facilitate foreigners or young children to learn. Mr. Gui has now submitted his work to the Ministry of the Interior for registration, and it is planned to adopt this new method of dictionary soon.

### The Case of the American Sailor Who Stabbed a Pedicab Driver with a Knife, First Public Hearing Yesterday, Defendant Claims Self-Defense, Female Bartender Called to Testify, Victim Brings Civil Suit Seeking Compensation

[This Newspaper's Report] The case of Rogers, an American sailor on the UNRRA fishing boat "John," stabbing pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang with a knife at 10:00 PM on New Year's Day, was investigated and concluded by the District Attorney's Office, and a public prosecution was filed on charges of assault. Yesterday morning, the District Court held its first public hearing. Judge Wu Shaochang and Prosecutor Shen Zushou ascended the bench at 10:20 AM and brought the defendant Rogers to the court. After Prosecutor Shen stood up and delivered his accusation, the interrogation began. According to Rogers, he is 26 years old, an American citizen, and came to Shanghai in July last year. On September 12, he was hired by UNRRA to work on the fishing boat "John," with a monthly salary of 300 US dollars. At around 3:00 PM on January 1st this year, he and a friend went to the Haibin Bar on Dongda Ming Road for drinks. At 10:30 PM, he left with Wang Xiulan, a female bartender from the bar. Many pedicab drivers competed to solicit business. One of them threw an iron ring tied with a rope at him, causing injury to his forehead. For self-defense, he took out a knife and stabbed him. Witness Wang Xiulan was then called to testify. Wang testified that she is 22 years old, from Beiping. Rogers is a regular customer of our bar. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, when the bar closed and she hired a pedicab to go home, she saw Rogers arguing with the pedicab driver. The other three foreigners had already hired cars. She also said that Cheng Rongfang was indeed stabbed by Rogers, and she also saw blood on Rogers' forehead. The victim, Cheng Rongfang, was unable to recover from his injuries, so only his attorneys, Zhou Lianze and Chen Zhen, appeared in court to bring a civil suit seeking compensation for damages of 66.6 million yuan and all medical expenses. The US Deputy Consul General in Shanghai, William, and his legal consultant, Zhang Tianyin, attended the hearing. The hearing was adjourned until noon, and the court ordered the case to be reheard at a later date.

### The Case of the Zhijiang Ferry Disaster, The Handling of the Aftermath Has Been Determined, The Issue of Responsibility Will Be Investigated, The Meeting Will Continue Today

[This Newspaper's Report] After the Zhijiang ferry, operated by the Tongji Shipping Company on the Shanghai route, collided with the Huatong, a barge of the Gongyi Industry Company, at the Wusongkou, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau convened an aftermath meeting at the bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to urge the company to quickly handle the aftermath. Li Guifan, Director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, Yuan Jin, Port Superintendent of the Customs, Wu Kexiao, Chief of the Water Police Sub-bureau, and the persons in charge of Tongji and Gongyi companies attended the meeting and decided on the following aftermath measures: (1) To urge Tongji Company to register passengers immediately, in addition to refunding ticket prices based on ticket stubs or other evidence, the compensation for the dead, medical treatment for the injured, and compensation for luggage will be paid by Tongji Company before the responsibility for the accident is determined. (2) To entrust the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Bureau to salvage the sunken ship in order to clear the bottom of the cabin and avoid blocking the waterway. If corpses are found, the Water Police Sub-bureau will handle the examination of the corpses. Luggage and goods will be temporarily kept by the Customs for collection. (3) To convene another meeting by the Maritime Affairs Bureau on the 21st to determine the responsibility for the accident, and to determine where the fault lies. At that time, the owners of the Zhijiang and Huatong barges will be present to report on the incident. (The Zhijiang ferry has been under the custody of the Port Police Station after the accident, and was released on bail yesterday. The owner of the Huatong barge has been sent to the District Attorney's Office.)

Director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau Speaks

Director Li of the Maritime Affairs Bureau told reporters after the meeting that the Maritime Affairs Bureau has regulations on the fixed number of passengers for each ship leaving the port. The fixed number for the Zhijiang ferry is 357 people, but the company has sold more tickets or the crew has smuggled yellow croaker. Because the bureau only has more than 60 staff members, it is difficult to take care of all the details. In the future, the Customs and Water Police Bureau will be asked to pay more attention. Ships with more passengers than the fixed number will not be allowed to leave the port. In addition, in order to plan for damage control, wooden boats traveling to other ports will be re-examined, and those that are too old will be prohibited from sailing. Motor sailboats will be banned altogether.

Tongji Issues Statement

[Another News] Personnel from the Customs Port Affairs Bureau, together with more than 100 people from the Water Police and Navy, began salvage work yesterday afternoon at the site where the Zhijiang ferry sank. The number of casualties in this tragedy is still uncertain. The company is strongly denying rumors that there were more than 1,000 passengers on board. Wu Guoqing, Deputy Manager of Tongji Company, also entertained the press yesterday afternoon and issued a written statement, stating: "All passengers have generally been rescued. Seven injured people were sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. Among them, Cai Zhilin died due to serious injuries, Zhou Haigen was seriously injured, and the rest were slightly injured. The company's tickets are entrusted to the Global Bank at 131 Hankou Road, Shanghai, for sale. According to the ticket stubs submitted by the bank, a total of 378 tickets were sold (Nos. 1001-1378)," and so on.

### Xu Jianong, Who Rampaged in Northern Jiangsu and Killed the Township Chief, Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison

[This Newspaper's Report] Xu Jianong, the chairman of the Communist Army Peasants' Congress in Taixian County, Northern Jiangsu, on April 10 last year, because Yuan Chengxu, the township chief of the 10th district of the county, was slightly hesitant about the "land distribution" method forcibly implemented by the Communist Army and did not immediately comply, Xu tortured him with illegal means, and then ordered his subordinate Teng Zhigan to shoot and kill Yuan. Later, Xu came to Shanghai and happened to be seen by Yuan's nephew, Yuan Yanchang, who reported him to the police and had him arrested and sent to the District Court. After trial, the sentence was pronounced yesterday, with the main text stating: "Xu Jianong is sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for murder, deprived of civil rights for 10 years, and the rest of the charges are dismissed." The other murderer, Teng Zhigan, has been detained and interrogated by the Taixian County District Court, so it is not accepted.

### Outdated Movie Star Xia Peizhen Can Hope to Go Home for the New Year, Commenced to Pardons of Convicted Criminals, More Than 300 Released Yesterday

Busy Judges Do Not Rest Slightly Due to the Holiday

[This Newspaper's Report] Since receiving the amnesty order, the judicial organs of this city have been carrying out the release work. The release of unconvicted prisoners has come to an end in recent days. Yesterday, the release of convicted prisoners who meet the requirements of the amnesty regulations began. A total of 281 prisoners (including one White Russian) in Shanghai Prison were released for convicted simple cases with sentences of 15 years or less. A total of 36 prisoners (including two White Russians, Shavchinsky and Vitetsky) were released from the Sinan Road District Court Detention Center who had been convicted but had not yet been sent to prison. A total of 317 people. Releases will continue today, and work will continue as usual during the Lunar New Year. According to reports, female prisoners who meet the amnesty regulations will be released starting today. Xia Peiren, an outdated movie star who was sentenced to imprisonment for drug use, will also be released today on New Year's Eve and return home for the New Year.

Regarding the reduction of sentences, because this city has not yet received detailed measures, it will need to be handled after receiving the order. Release

### Discussing Simplification of Procedures

[This Newspaper's Report] The head of the criminal court of the high court and the district court, the prosecutor, and others gathered yesterday afternoon to discuss emergency handling measures for the release of prisoners, and decided to simplify procedures, handle them quickly, and avoid bail as much as possible to reduce abuses. For all (1) cases in which judgments have been finalized, the files and prisoners will be handed over to the District Attorney's Office in accordance with the Amnesty Order. After approval by the Chief Prosecutor, they will be released immediately. (2) For cases where the judgment is not final, they are further divided into (A) cases that have been judged and are now on appeal, and (B) cases that are still under trial. In this case, there are those under the High Court and those under the District Court. In this situation, the defendant's opinion is sought. If the appeal is waived, it will be treated as a final judgment. If the appeal is not waived, it will depend on the seriousness of the circumstances. Those that are light will be released immediately, and those that are serious must be released on bail.

According to attendees who told reporters: Now that the government has issued the amnesty order, the prisoners held in this city who meet the requirements of the amnesty should be released quickly. However, in fact, it is impossible to release thousands of people in the one or two days before this abolished lunar year. The procedure is really not possible. Because it takes quite a while to review. And some cases involve many defendants, some involve other cases, some have attached civil suits, some require exemption from punishment, and some require reduced sentences, so it is more difficult to judge, and therefore there may be a delay of one or two days. I hope that the family members of the prisoners outside will not be deceived by others, and will not engage in soliciting, etc.

### Single Clothes Seemingly Washed, Warden Gives Money

[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, four prosecutors from the District Court, Yang Shoucheng, Liu Yongzhi, Cao Hong, and Liang Gengsheng, went to Shanghai Prison to handle the release of convicted simple cases. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang also rushed to supervise at around 10:00 AM. In the afternoon, two more prosecutors, Gong Daping and Gan Chong, went to the prison. After reviewing the roster created by the prison, they opened release tickets on the spot in the prison with the secretary. Ten prisoners were questioned each batch about their age and origin, and then handed over to Bai Qilin, the warden of Shanghai Prison, and Feng Dengyun, the head of the general affairs section, to verify that their identities were correct, press their fingerprints, and then released in batches. Those who were released had all removed their prison uniforms and put on the civilian clothes they had brought in. Among them, several people were thinly dressed and shivering in the cold wind. Section Chief Feng immediately distributed cotton clothes donated by the Post-War Relief Administration for warmth. Among them, there was a prisoner surnamed Pan, who wanted to return to his old home in Qidian after his release, but he had no money, so Warden Bai helped him with 4,000 yuan. Pan thanked him with tears in his eyes. At the time of the release, the prosecutors and prison guards all exhorted them kindly. Most of the released prisoners expressed remorse and vowed not to forget the great kindness of the government's amnesty this time. A total of 281 prisoners in convicted simple cases were released from 11:00 AM to 8:45 PM. All of them had committed crimes such as theft, fraud, intimidation, obscenity, and homicide, and were sentenced to less than 15 years in prison.

### New Year's Eve Scenes: Frenzy at Silver Shops, Atomic Bomb Lanterns Hit the Market

The silver shops have been a hive of frenzied activity for days, with common laborers and matrons alike flocking to them in a state of "infatuation."

By the Nine-Bend Bridge, a pool of fetid water stagnates, tourists are few, and vendors are languishing – a symbol of hardship, perhaps?

The most striking impression from a visit to the City God Temple is the prominent sign above the main hall: "Beware of Pickpockets." Patrolmen are constantly on the move, guns in hand, creating an atmosphere of grim vigilance.

According to the temple receptionist, "If you want to offer incense, come early on the first day."

On New Year's Eve, in the chilling rain, an abandoned infant was found right next to the Lido Dance Hall, starkly illustrating a tragedy of human life.

In this city's public utilities, year-end bonuses are also being awarded to foreign employees – while not unprecedented, it is certainly rare.

According to "well-informed," "reliable," and "authoritative" sources – "qualified," "high-ranking," and "leading" figures – the "outlook" for the market after the New Year is seen as neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic. Thus, the so-called "outlook" seems both right and wrong, and yet neither.

Candle shops around Hongmiao are well-stocked, and there are no restrictions on the supply of ghost money. A single 250 yuan gold certificate can be exchanged for a considerable quantity of ghost money.

Customers throng the large companies to buy New Year's goods, but unfortunately, all the apprentices have been sent away to get their year-end bonuses.

Silk and cloth shops closed early, sealed their windows, mopped the floors, and pulled down the iron gates. The shop assistants had their heads shaved and went out to play, while the old shop manager stayed behind, listlessly playing a gambling game at the counter.

South goods stores were not as crowded as in previous years, but the small vegetable markets were overwhelmed with activity, selling fish, meat, and chicken. Prices changed by the day, and each stall had its own market.

Lanterns are everywhere on Sixth Avenue: lotus lanterns, rabbit lanterns, revolving lanterns... Lantern makers are keeping up with the times, even crafting atomic bomb lanterns. Ignorant children clamor to buy them, oblivious to whether their parents can afford the "New Year's Eve" feast. At dawn, roosters near and far crow in chorus. The streets are littered with firecracker debris. This is "New Year," the "New Year" that everyone looks forward to, the "New Year" that everyone worries about.

### Spring Festival - Many Government Agencies Take Holidays

### Doctor Deeply in Love - Ashamed of Lover, Seeks Death - Shen Yaoxian Shoots Himself, Seriously Wounded and in Critical Condition

[Our Newspaper] Dr. Shen Yaoxian, 41 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at 19 Wuding Lane, Wuding Road, was visiting his relative Ms. Zhong Yongfang (19 years old) in Ward 7, 3rd floor of Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital at the intersection of Huangpi South Road and Ninghai West Road at 10:45 last night, when he suddenly took advantage of the lack of preparation and shot himself with his self-defense pistol, the bullet entering his left chest. He immediately fell to the ground. The hospital then reported the case to the police, who came to the hospital to investigate. After investigation, it was found that the incident was due to Zhong falling in love with Shen last fall. Because of the vast age difference, she felt deep regret. At the same time, people were afraid of gossip, so the idea of ​​disgust with the world arose spontaneously, and she attempted suicide the night before at her residence at 50 Wenhua Villa, Shanyin Road, and was seriously injured after jumping from the building. After this incident occurred, Shen felt even more guilty. Last night when he went to the hospital to visit her, he couldn't help but shed tears and was very saddened, and finally pulled out his gun and shot himself. As of late last night, he was still not out of danger.

### Miss Luzon - Rescued British Boy - Full of Sadness - Stamp Collection All Washed Away

[Our Newspaper] After the "Miss Luzon" accident near Manila, many tragedies and comedies occurred. Among them, three British boys were also frightened, but they finally survived the ordeal. One of the three children, Li Que, Spackens, was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Manila yesterday morning. His parents went to the airport to meet him, but learned that the plane had returned to Manila due to mechanical damage and would not arrive until this afternoon.

Li Que is twelve years old this year. His father works for the Shanghai Gas Company. This time, he planned to study in the UK and left Shanghai alone with two young friends by plane. The reporter met his parents yesterday. According to them, Li Que and his two friends were very calm after the plane crash. After being rescued to the rubber dinghy, Li Que found that the water in the dinghy was gradually rising. He hurriedly took off a sock and used the sock to scoop the water out of the dinghy, and as a result, he was safe. But the thing he felt most sad about was that the 2,000 old stamps he had collected for several years were swept away by the waves.

### Starting Point for Banquet Donations - Tea is Not a Dish - No Tax Should Be Collected - Wine and Food Industry Association Requests Reconsideration

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Wine and Food Industry Commercial Association believes that the tax rate for banquet taxes decided at the second meeting of the City Council does not conform to the actual situation, and has specially requested a review. The reasons are: (1) The banquet tax rate stipulates that a flat rate of 15% should be levied above the tax threshold, which is inconsistent with the revised tax law. Please reduce it to a flat rate of 10%. (2) The tax threshold is set at 5,000 yuan, and regardless of how many people eat together, 5,000 yuan is used as the starting point, which is not consistent with the price situation in this city. Please relax the scale and calculate it per person. (3) Tea is not a dish, and using tea for guests at festive banquets is to promote frugality, so banquet tax should not be levied.

At the Second City Council Meeting, some councilors and a few newspapers arbitrarily insulted our colleagues in private schools, and the dignity and personality of our educators have been insulted, and the future of educational development has also been hit. We are convening this emergency meeting to protest against defamation and to safeguard education." After a heated discussion, eight resolutions were passed as follows: (1) The amount of tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools for the next semester and the number of free places will be reserved and decided at the general meeting on the 27th of this month. (2) The date of the next general meeting is scheduled for 2 pm on January 27th at Fudan Middle School.

(4) Representatives will be sent to the Xinwen Daily to protest in writing against the insults such as "school store" and negotiate in person. (5) The "Declaration of Private Primary and Secondary School Teachers in Shanghai Against the City Council's Arbitrary Regulations on Tuition Fees Regardless of Teachers' Lives" should continue to be signed. (Currently, more than 2,000 people have signed.) (6) The organization of the Primary and Secondary School Friendship Association will be decided by the board of directors and submitted to the next general meeting for discussion. (7) Regarding the publication of a daily or weekly newspaper, the board of directors will draft a plan and submit it to the next general meeting for discussion. (8) Regarding the regulations on tuition fees announced by the Education Bureau, the board of directors will draft a statement stating that they cannot be implemented and submit it to the Education Bureau after a vote at the next general meeting. Finally, it was reported that teachers from various primary and secondary schools will gather at Xinhua Middle School (Chongqing Road, at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road) at 9 am on January 27th and depart to petition the City Education Bureau. After the report, it was 4:30 pm, and the meeting was adjourned.

### My Wife, Helen

— Zhao Xueshan

The number of divorces proves that marriage is extremely difficult to maintain love. Many marriages are only maintained reluctantly like shackles. Thank you to my wife, she saved me from this terrible fate!

Helen is optimistic. I have been married to her for ten years, but I have never seen her grumpy, sad, or indifferent face when I come home every day.

If I am mentally depressed, her warmth will cheer me up. If she has any difficulties in her own life, she will face them bravely and cheerfully. I have seen her give birth three times and undergo two operations, but her actions make people feel that I am the one suffering, and she is saving me.

Helen is loyal. I am her person, and her loyalty to me is even greater than my loyalty to myself. She is my "fan", my agent. No matter how many mistakes or failures I have, her belief in my abilities has always been strong.

She knows that our three children are the most promising teenagers in the world. She carefully records every bit of their health, skills, and love. She treats them very strictly, with the aim of promoting their sense of superiority. They can respect themselves even more because of her strictness. Helen is very wasteful, but not with money, but with herself. Her personality does not allow her to do something and stop halfway. When she solves a difficult problem, she always says proudly, "This thing must be done right."

Helen is not picky. She doesn't bother me with the question, "Why didn't you do that?" She never tries to manipulate my career, control my entertainment, choose my friends, or order me to do all the other chores.

She doesn't pry into secrets or ask questions. If I am not interested, she will not force me to speak. She can wait. I don't have to give a report every day like other husbands about when and with whom and for what reason I went where. Helen is the best at listening, but the worst at asking. She doesn't open my letters, and she doesn't search my luggage. I don't even have to worry about money. It's not because I have abundant financial resources, it's because we don't have to be petty with each other. I give her some money every week, and I keep some for myself. She pays the household expenses, and the excess money is spent appropriately. I pay insurance, taxes, and medical expenses, etc., and I am free to save or spend the rest.

Helen is not perfect. She has her quirks, and although some of them seem annoying, I don't want to change them because they are the essence of her personality. One of her weaknesses is that she speaks too generally; if it rained for three days in September, she would say "it rained all month". She is not afraid to organize closets, suitcases, and drawers; in fact, they are always messy.

Helen is interesting because she is interested in herself. Life makes her happy and makes her sad, and she moves forward with excitement. There seems to be a kind of surprise and laughter boiling in her all the time. Even when she is not speaking, you can see her soul criticizing herself. She listens to the most ordinary stories with the same energy as someone describing the attack on Pearl Harbor. Because she is interested in the things happening around her, she cannot be too interested in herself. Many women have a strong sense of self-awareness, and always comb their hair, tidy their clothes, look in the mirror, apply rouge, etc. in front of people, but she never has this kind of anxiety. Life, laughter, pain, vision, memory, discovery, creation, love—all these dramas move her. For her, marriage is not boring; to do it well, one must put in effort, "but this thing must be done right!"

Although she does not work hard at marriage, she does not dream of seizing her partner and children entirely for herself like other women. I am not her prisoner, and she is not my jailer.

Then what is the ending?

The ending is strange and sweet; Helen does not restrict my freedom or change my personality, but she has indeed gained my slave-like loyalty for herself.

### Men's Vanity

— Wei Shan

Men often like to talk about women's vanity to set off their own brilliance.

I admit that women are vain, but at least they are open about it. For example, I like to read articles about beauty in newspapers and I don't hide it, but men's vanity is different.

If you want to see a man's vanity, it is best to hide where he cannot see you when he is dressed up and ready to go to a party. He will slowly walk to the mirror, and his hand will gently touch his shiny hair, which is full of oil, then he will straighten his bow tie, pretend to dust off the dust on his coat, stick out his shoulders, and finally walk out triumphantly.

We often hear that women's decorations are to attract men. This is not correct. Men's decorations are indeed to attract women. Women love beauty entirely out of normality. They decorate, whether the people they interact with are male or female, they are all the same.

If a woman is washed up on a desert island, her suitcase will still contain various makeup tools and cosmetics. Do you think she would be disheveled all day long just because there are no men on the island? But purely male group life is mostly disheveled.

Most men like their wives to wear eye-catching clothes, and many men encourage their wives to wear luxurious and fashionable clothes.

I once heard a friend say: "I love my wife to wear fashionable clothes. If she wears shabby clothes, it will lower my status."

This sentence probably represents the vanity of men.

### Talking About Soy Sauce

— Shunding

Opening the door to seven things: firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea. Soy sauce is also a major item in the seven things, and soy sauce is not only a condiment, but also made from soybeans and wheat flour through a long period of fermentation with water and salt. Therefore, soy sauce, in addition to water, also contains very rich protein. Protein is the highest class of nutrients and is the element for the body to make blood and muscles. Foods that contain a large amount of protein and are easily digested and absorbed are nourishing foods. The protein contained in soy sauce is not only abundant but also easily digested. The umami taste of soy sauce comes entirely from protein. The fresher the taste, the more protein it contains. In addition, soy sauce also contains vitamins B and D, calcium, phosphorus, and other substances, which are important nutrients that the human body cannot lack. According to recent research by experts, soy sauce also has several important properties in treatment. Singers who occasionally have hoarse throats can drink a cup of soy sauce soup. If they can drink a cup of hot soy sauce soup every morning, over time, their voice will become bright and clear. Also, when traveling or camping in snowy weather, if you drink a cup of warm soy sauce in advance, it can not only resist the cold and increase body temperature but also strengthen the heart's beating ability. Or pregnant women whose fetal qi is rushing upwards and vomiting, drinking soy sauce can also treat them. In addition, soy sauce can also detoxify opium and arsenic. However, now because the raw materials for making soy sauce are expensive, unscrupulous merchants make fake goods to gain huge profits. According to reports last year, several soy sauce companies in the city had their soy sauce found by the health authorities to be made entirely of water, salt, and coloring agents. If we buy this kind of soy sauce, can eating it be beneficial? Therefore, we should still go to a larger and more reputable sauce garden to buy soy sauce, which is more appropriate.

Finally, I will write down the most common and easy-to-do methods for selecting soy sauce below for reference: First, if you try top-quality soy sauce on the tip of your tongue, you will immediately feel that its taste is slightly sweet, salty, and pure. Inferior ones taste sour and bitter, and the salty taste is strong and not pure. Second, take soy sauce and drop it into a colorless glass bottle, and shine it in the sunlight. The red color and extremely beautiful luster will be found. Also, those that turn reddish-brown in white porcelain are good products; as for those with yellowish-brown or cyan-black color and impure luster, they are inferior products. Third, if a small amount of soy sauce is placed in a colorless glass bottle, and the mouth of the bottle is plugged and inverted, and the soy sauce at the bottom is illuminated by sunlight, the longer the trace of soy sauce remains, the thicker it is. If the time is short, it is a thin product. Fourth, put a small amount of soy sauce in white porcelain and stir it with chopsticks, and the foam color is light yellow, which is a top-quality product. As for the foam that is light red or white, it is an inferior product. Fifth, if a top-quality soy sauce is boiled and placed in a white glass bottle, the protein contained in it will coagulate and appear like mist or thread. Inferior products will show a mixture of impurities that precipitate. Sixth, for pure soy sauce without a mixture of impurities, its specific gravity to water should be 1.19120 to 1.19125.

### New Year, Be Careful with Your Children!

— Du Yun

The Gregorian New Year has just passed, and the Lunar New Year is coming again. The joy that children experience during the New Year far surpasses that of adults; I believe everyone has gone through such a phase! Therefore, at the start of the New Year, parents should be especially careful with their children.

Be careful with what your children eat: During the New Year, children eat particularly a lot. One moment it's snacks, the next it's candy. They truly never stop eating from morning till night. As parents, you should know that children have limited appetites. As the saying goes, "Illness enters through the mouth." Overeating can cause indigestion and bloating. Children's digestive systems are weak. If you're not careful about what they eat, celebrating the New Year might instead create illness. Joy turns into worry. It's best to prevent problems before they arise, and moderation in eating is ideal.

Be careful with how your children spend money: At the start of the New Year, children usually receive lucky money. However, children don't know how to use money wisely. They often buy meaningless toys, such as firecrackers. Even older children still gamble. This must be strictly avoided because learning to gamble from a young age leaves a deep impression. When they grow up, they'll only escalate their gambling, causing endless harm. It's best if children obtain parental permission or guidance before buying toys and snacks. The best approach is to collect the lucky money children receive and save it for appropriate expenses. Half can be used to buy candies and toys for the children, or to watch movies, and the other half can be used for tuition, savings, or charity. This is a proper way to spend money, harmless and beneficial.

Be careful with what your children play: During the New Year, children are not attending school, and staying at home is like letting loose a wild horse. They play wantonly, which is also highly inappropriate. Children often get lost or run away during the New Year, or get into accidents by running on the streets. As parents, you should always pay attention.

As parents, who doesn't cherish their children? Taking advantage of this New Year, it is vital to be extra careful with your children!

### British Women's Employment Statistics

— Jia Ling

Recently, female professionals in Britain have been passionately advocating for equal treatment, specifically equal pay for equal work (Equal Work and Equal Pay).

### A Photo of Yu Dafu

— GM

Recently, I have often talked about Mr. Yu Dafu with friends. His kind of idealistic art is something many writers cannot learn. We are still inevitably shrouded in the ideology of heroism, not worshipping the ordinary, believing that art, as such, is less useful in the material world than boilers and motors. If it cannot win over others with unique methods or broad spirit, or bring comfort to people, or give people good enlightenment, then the diligent pursuer will gradually lose his original intention. Dafu has had heroic acts; in simple paper art, he compared himself to George Moore, and in attitude, he did not fail to be a Chateaubriand. His style defined a school in Chinese literature.

We are most afraid of looking at Dafu with a moral consciousness, because he originally wanted to stand against this concept to create that kind of art. He was a trendsetter produced by the May Fourth Movement.

Dafu had many crowds who loved him. These people chased him, just as the poet Zhimo said, "Dafu is very lovable," for no other reason. His idealistic lyrical writing, melancholy temperament, and general unconstrained attitude indeed easily overcame those who had strong self-consciousness with a calculating mind.

In the fourteenth year of the Republic, when I first visited his residence in Shichahai, Beijing, I had a fantasy that he must be someone with the appearance and demeanor of Hugo and Shelley, and I was somewhat hesitant to move forward. When I met him, I felt that he was very much like the boss of a housekeeper, if not for wearing that semi-old coffee-colored robe. It is said that he lectured on economics at Peking University, but soon he went south because of other jobs. We often heard news of him in Shanghai, his whereabouts, before he went to Guangzhou.

After returning from Guangzhou, he wrote many texts. The Chicken Rib Collection and Nine Kinds of Diaries were all printed during those one or two years. His complete works also gradually appeared in various bookstores, "Luoyang was made more expensive by its paper," this is indeed not an excessive description. From the Nine Kinds of Diaries, we know his new family organization. We were all happy to read this book of his, thinking that he had a poet's attitude. In those one or two years, he collected many old Western books, "encompassing everything." He said that they were dragged home by a car. He did not prepare to run to the mountains of Fuyang, which also made us feel his brightness.

In the twenty-third year, he lived quietly in Hangzhou, in a small happy family, with two or three children already. He did not easily go out to get drunk anymore, frankly and openly. Sometimes, on the Su Causeway of West Lake, he could be found walking slowly with his hands behind his back, talking侃侃, followed by several young people wearing Western clothes or carrying Western clothes on their shoulders.

Several times, I went to visit him with Jingwen. "I don't write anything anymore," he said without waiting for anyone to ask, "I have collected many books, and I am going to estimate the good price in the future." We walked into his书房, and we really sighed that even Zuo Si was not as good. Some of the versions he collected cheaply were indeed precious. Such as the English translation of DeCameron (Boccaccio), first edition—at that time, Dr. Samuel Johnson had not yet died.

He taught literary criticism for a few hours at Zhijiang University. Coincidentally, his collection of books was lacking in this area, so he made two trips to Shanghai to search extensively, only finding one book by Saint Beuve, in French, and one book by Lewison, which was very popular and had already been translated by Mr. Fu ××. I borrowed a book from a friend, Winchester's Principles of Criticism, but it was too common, and many people said they had read it; G. Brandes of Denmark could not figure out the clues; there were too many of Saints-berry of England, and Belinski of Russia could not be bought at all. He said: "Buying them all is also a bad business."

Dafu served his mother very filially, and often returned to Fuyang to visit her. His mother was very frail and frugal, almost too much so, and rarely came to see West Lake even once in ten years. In the early summer of the twenty-third year, Dafu took her to his residence and visited West Lake for a day. She did not seem to feel anything and hurriedly went back.

In the summer of the twenty-third year, some people said it was the first time in their lives that it was so hot. Dafu lived in seclusion, and we sometimes went to visit him. We often encountered him teasing the children while writing. Sometimes, when he heard a knock on the door, he would first have someone peek through the mailbox slit. Perhaps it was a tired guest, or perhaps he was afraid of being intimidated. In those few years, he was simply a little afraid of something. West Lake cracked, and the scenery was not easy to appreciate.

After that, I never saw Dafu again. In the twenty-eighth year, Mr. Ke Ling, a friend in Shanghai, was the editor of the supplement of the Dami Newspaper. He had an appointment and wrote in a letter saying: Dafu had been in Singapore for only a few months, and he received the Asian Literature he sent from Singapore, which also contained a creative little × son serving as a soldier. He began to feel that Dafu still loved himself, his homeland. He ran so far to avoid the hustle and bustle, to seek bread for his young children, not out of cowardice. At that time, some people still passed on his news from time to time, until after the fall of Singapore.

### Snow

— Zhong Baihua

Snow has finally fallen.

This pure white and subtle crystalline substance, even shorter than the ephemeral epiphyllum, is loved by everyone. From childhood impressions, to the wandering in mournful middle age, even in old age, seeing it will make their "eyes light up". Of course, I am the same. Every time I am in front of snow, I will simulate Su Dongpo's "Light Yao silver sea dazzles flowers" and Zhang Yuanhao's "Fighting back three million jade dragons, defeated scales and broken fields fly all over the sky", those poetic meanings. However, every time I face it, I never evoke any "烟司披里纯", I don't know why, I only simulate and fantasize, I don't know if it is so beautiful that it is difficult to describe, or if a cold power hidden behind the subtlety silences me. However, I, like everyone else, love it.

Today's snow makes us love it even more, because a year has passed. The snow, like a late arrival, is still the first time it has deigned to come. How people who have been waiting anxiously will cheer: "Snow, has finally fallen!"

I love it, put on my raincoat and go out, feeling very relaxed in the subtlety. Unlike rainy days, the heavy raindrops attack uncomfortably. At this time, what unfolds before my eyes is a piece of white, a beautiful white. I can't think of a better sentence to praise it, except for thinking of Yang Fu's Snow Eulogy: "Using purity to transform, riding the air to flutter, encountering images can be fresh, instantly becoming a clean brilliance." Yes, all I have is fantasy, like its own ephemeral illusion. In fact, the predecessors were smarter than us. The so-called "God's Jade Play" has pointed out its illusion, and the sentence "also knowing that it will not make solid jade" further explains that it cannot be regarded as jade after all. Why are there now many poor scholars confined to cold eaves who can fill their stomachs or be dispatched to the market?

The sorrow of fantasy!

But subtle snow is still better than heavy rain. Although its quality is so light and weak, the ability of the sky to act in unison can temporarily allow a piece of white to cover up the black holes of the earth. Especially today's snow, flying over everything, the ground, the roof tiles, the trees, truly "instantly becoming a clean brilliance", also because it is not abused, it stops after a few hours, just in time to clear the stuffy and muddy roads of the whole morning rain.

Of course, the temperature suddenly dropped because of it. Alas, - the snow is fluttering and the guests have warm robes! (After the snow on January 8th)

### Sleeping Beauty (Partial)

— Qiao Erqiao

Giorgione (1477-1510) was the most outstanding disciple of Bellini of the Venetian school. He had no opportunity to receive education since he was a child, and everything was achieved through his own efforts. After studying under Bellini, his talent was extraordinary, and he eventually became a great master of the time. His works mostly depict figures. Representative works include "Pastoral Concert" and "Sleeping Beauty". The style is rich in ideals and contains an atmosphere of music and poetry. This picture is very long, this is a part of it.

### Poems from the Cangshan Pavilion

— Cheng Tixuan

Small Room

In this small room, I dream of mountain passes and rivers, but wake up to a sudden storm. I don't hear the cry of a wild rooster; I suspect there are dragons hiding. I put on my clothes and walk into the courtyard, my autumn shadow lean in the lamplight. Grand thoughts gallop to the eight corners of the earth, and I pity the starving and drowning millions. Even now, on the coast of the East Sea, the remnants of the brigands are still arrogant. I long to join Li Guo, and sadly imagine Yan Zhao. I sit and wait for the river and sky to clear, and the heavy darkness will open up the woods.

Travel Notes from the Suburbs of Chongqing

Passing Tiger Rock, I ride quickly to Xiaolongkan. The morning wind drums up the angry wheels, as fast as a ball rolling down a slope. The car compartment is filled with clamor; the worry is that it is too full of people. Standing side by side like stringed fish, being in it feels like being crushed. Walking on level ground is like treading on thorns; the distance is so near, yet I resent its farness. Looking at the flowers on the path from afar, I envy those who return slowly. The Shu Road is high in the blue sky, and the spring plain has short daylight. Alas, it is difficult to travel on this road, which has been said to be rare since ancient times. Who is it that has caused us to come here? The bandits in the country are fierce. When will the reform come? I want to sigh for the insignificance of Weiguan.

Autumn Feelings Following Pengming's Rhymes

The old customs are mixed in the book collection, and your talent is truly unparalleled. The snow table is piled with thousands of lines, and the frost blade is stingy for a test. You sent me an autumn cloud poem, falling with deep meaning. Everyone is drunk in a daze, and scholars are frustrated. The dragon is trapped in the mud, who will spread its influence? I am ashamed that I cannot help you, and I also violate my will. I look in the mirror and sigh, already past thirty-four. I always cherish the hungry and drowning heart, watching the sky and tears are hard to control. The sycamore leaves fall in the high autumn, and the phoenix bird arrives. There will be a day for clarification, and I dare to swear to the Great River.

Flower Morning Gathering and Selling Calligraphy

The spring shade brews a slight chill, and suddenly the Flower Morning arrives again. The club gathers at Xiaoxiang (wine shop name), chanting in high spirits is really pleasant. I happen to be nursing my illness at this time, not to avoid poetry debts. One thought is tied to red and purple, and I bow a green chapter to the sky. May the hundred flowers bloom in the future, and do not let the wind and rain defeat them. I hope to fill this heart, and hold it as a precept for governing the people. Nourishing the people is like nourishing flowers, and the demands are too harmful. Protecting flowers is like protecting the people, and removing the superior is not allowed to be loaned. The spring breeze fans the warm harmony, and all the flowers are happy to rely on it. The south acre should be in time, and the oxen should be bought with a sword to be sold.

### Abolishing the New Year and Abolishing Words

— Lao Dan

The Republic of China has been established for thirty-six years, and the Gregorian calendar has been used as the national calendar for thirty-six years, but the folk society still has a considerable, temporary, and difficult to eradicate universal potential force for the habits of the old meals. Even if you use the power of ten thousand jun, there is no way to eliminate it. Habit can be said to be extremely stubborn.

"The sound of firecrackers removes the old, and peach charms are renewed by thousands of households." The judgment of the division between the New Year and the year of the abandoned calendar lies in these few firecrackers to mark the era. Although people post couplets two or three days early, before the time comes, everyone will not set off firecrackers, and it is still the remaining year.

Although the Spring Festival couplets of "National Grace and Family Celebration, Longevity and Abundant Years" contain a bit of feudalistic color, it shows the scene of "Ascending Peace Century". What people hope for, in terms of the country, is that the sea and the universe will be peaceful; in the family, it is Anqing and happiness. Personally, it is health and longevity, not illness and premature death. The farmers naturally seek a good harvest with favorable weather; such a scene is undoubtedly the common desire in the hearts of the masses. But what is it like now, think about it, I think about it! Why did it come to this point?

"A year's plan lies in spring, and a day's plan lies in the morning." Our welcoming of the New Year has a profound meaning. The cold and solemn winter is about to collapse; the spring breeze is kind and gentle, and everything is revived, which means the germination of the new opportunity for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the individual hopes for it in the same way!

I have said that the abandoned calendar year has a stubborn, widespread, and potential force in society. No matter how much you don't have a relationship with it, the surrounding air attacks can't help but have a little influence on you, which is an undeniable fact. At the same time, it can also prove that a traditional habit (whether good or bad) has its own objective conditions for existence. The abandoned calendar year has been sentenced to death for thirty-six years, but it still stubbornly occupies and exists. From this point of view, we know that the reform of an old habit is gradual, not rapid. At the same time, we know that it takes great determination and effort to eliminate (reform) an old habit. In Chinese society, especially among the vast number of farmers, the abandoned calendar is just a period of rest, not a superstitious act.

Some people say that the biggest harvest of the Xinhai Revolution was the universal cutting of braids by men, and most of the others failed. This sentence can be said to be quite reasonable.

Now, in addition to some industrial, commercial, agricultural, and monks, there are also some calligraphers, painters, and poets who use the abandoned calendar to record the year. Some of them are the ruling authorities. All official documents use the national calendar, and even name and write to prohibit the use of the abandoned calendar, but in his calligraphy, painting, poetry, and lyrics, some still write using the lunar calendar to record the year. What is the reason?

Only a few people, such as Ye Gongchuo and Liu Yazi, write 件 and use the Republic of China to record the year. In addition to using the national calendar, Liu also uses the Gregorian calendar more often, which is of the times.

Newspapers in Hong Kong and Macau. Some of them have the lunar calendar listed in addition to the national calendar, and the old and new are the same, which is said to be convenient for the local citizens. For example, "January 22, 36th year of the Republic of China", and another page is printed with "the first day of the first lunar month in the year of Ding Hai", which makes some people have another impression when they read it.

Speaking of which, it is mostly a malformation to talk about all reforms when politics is not on the right track, and it is not something that can be achieved overnight. Talking about abolishing the calendar and the New Year in the late winter and early spring seems to have a bit of attention to the suspicion of the abandoned calendar. In this weird season, let's talk about the year of the abolished calendar, let's just talk nonsense.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 156

— Ye Jingfeng

"Do you know their purpose tonight? It's funny that they treated me as stupid as Cao Cao in the Three Kingdoms period; even Cao Cao knew to assume seventy-two suspicious tombs, but his real tomb was outside the seventy-two tombs... Judo and kendo we cannot abandon, that is the traditional foundation of the founding of Japan, but like they use it again and again, as a tool to attack people's spirits, ha, that is abused... Your swordsmanship is not bad, but unfortunately I can't keep you by my side, the things on the mainland are more important..."

Tsurumi came out of Konoe's place. The "08" wild boar and the car were still waiting outside Beppu.

"How is it?" Tsurumi asked anxiously.

"Failed!" The wild boar replied listlessly.

"What exactly happened?" Tsurumi was eager to understand everything that had happened.

"Ansaka received an emergency warning around nine o'clock, advising us to stop the action; it was sent by Pingzi. But we still proceeded; at the intersection of Thirty-six Town, Yuanzi's small line ran over and also stopped us from proceeding, saying that all the arrangements had changed. This, we encountered great difficulties. For the sake of caution, Ansaka ordered a general retreat, otherwise, all future arrangements would be destroyed...

"When we were about to disperse the personnel at the corner of Thirty Town, we suddenly found ourselves surrounded. Pingzi came out and told us that everything did not violate our plan, as long as we had the courage to cooperate with them. He also told us that except for the technical personnel, no other strength was needed. We agreed to the conditions, and only three people joined their group; Ansaka left three or four ambush lines, prepared to give you a warning, and later found the secret post of the Fifth Column, so he immediately canceled the ambush lines; the most important reason was still due to Pingzi's guarantee that you were in no danger..."

"Our three people three, seven, eleven, followed their group,绕大圈子, crossed from the 'Kuto' abandoned garden to the Xiongben Temple, and from the Xiongben Temple they attacked Beppu; our Yuanzi and several of their internal lines connected the three technical personnel and explored the basement without encountering much difficulty. The goods were also found; when they opened the envelope, there were only a few blank sheets of paper. Ansaka suspected that chemical ink was used on the paper, but Ueno said it was absolutely impossible, because it was an international document and could not use invisible ink. When they turned around to come out, they found a note hanging behind the exit hatch, 'Wasted effort'..."

At half past ten the next morning, Tsurumi arrived at the military airport again. In advance, the General Staff Headquarters received Konoe's hand note, "Tsurumi Tamaki was promoted to the actual rank of colonel, assistant of the special operations section of the General Staff Headquarters of the mainland, and director of the telecommunications section." The former full-time position is now changed to a part-time position, I am afraid that the second step is to cancel the part-time position. Because of the emergency order from the headquarters, Tsurumi once again boarded the plane to cross the west.

As soon as he stepped into the plane, Tsurumi noticed at a glance two delicate and beautiful young women, quietly occupying one seat each; one of them nodded and smiled at Tsurumi, but at the same time gave Tsurumi a hint, telling him not to talk. That was of course Pingzi again. As soon as Tsurumi saw Pingzi, he immediately felt extremely uneasy, like a芒刺stuck in his back. As soon as he sat down, Pingzi's signal came, she was sitting next to Tsurumi, separated by a narrow aisle, her left hand was on her knee, avoiding the sight of the other woman.

"Big brother, don't pay too much attention to my hand!" Pingzi tapped out the code with her fingers.

"Who is she?" Tsurumi also put his right hand in a place that the woman on the opposite seat could not see, and asked.

"A Manchurian bitch, she stinks, but she doesn't feel it at all. Big brother, do you think it's funny?"

### Abolish Lucky Money, Change to Sending Children Gifts

— Xiao Kang

The Lunar New Year is a custom to give money to children, which is called "lucky money". The meaning of "lucky money" is to suppress the "peace" of a child for one year, who knows who is the originator?

But under the modern reform of customs, although we are not very opposed to the meaning of lucky money, we dare not agree with and promote it!

You should know that the "struggles" and "infighting" that occur among human beings in the world are all for "money". Children's knowledge is not yet developed, and rashly opening this effect of money is not very logical with the two words "lucky money"!

Especially in this "New Year", the colorful toys, candies, firecrackers, etc. on the street, once children have money, they buy recklessly behind their parents' backs, some eat unclean or indigestible candies, some buy inferior toys, so that children are indirectly affected by this "lucky money", even eating out of trouble, or causing trouble!

Therefore, the custom of "lucky money" is to love children appropriately enough to harm children, but for the unbreakable customs, most people know that it is harmful and do so every year, we should call out and "abolish" it!

Often a person in society will obliterate reason and forget shame for money, let alone a small-minded child, enlightening them with the concept of "having money to play and eat", this kind of fluke mentality is really undesirable! Because during the New Year period, "gambling" is prevalent in Chinese society, and there are demons everywhere on the streets and alleys that tempt children, so giving children "lucky money" really has "a hundred harms and no benefits"!

I hope that social people will abolish this custom of "lucky money"! Change to sending "children's newspapers" and "intelligent toys" to cultivate noble knowledge, which is exactly for the sake of our next generation and the relationship of the country, society, and the country, we have to "cry out loudly"!

### Who Says the Old Year-End is Hard to Get Through? Joyful Scenes in the Streets and Alleys

— Kang Shi

Yangguan (阳关, a place name representing safety) ultimately couldn't defeat Yinguang (阴关, a place name representing hardship).

The streets frequently added a lot of "red" color. Vendors selling "lucky money" envelopes were everywhere. Ten for 1,000 yuan, ten for 500 yuan, they shouted as they walked the streets. This "red" color reflected many people filled with "happiness," and many holding "sorrow!"

Orange vendors lined the streets and alleys, with bright red Fortune Oranges and golden Shantou Mandarin Oranges, each stall displaying the fruit, such beautiful colors, so adorable!

In the City God Temple, the New City God Temple, Wangping Street... one could see carts selling "New Year's offerings." Yellow winter plum blossoms, potted ancient plum blossoms with budding flowers, and red and adorable Nandina domestica plants, one by one. Most of the flower buyers were young mistresses from wealthy families, who specially came by rickshaw, chartered car, or automobile. The flower sellers didn't have a fixed price, it depended on the buyer's "style." This year, a branch of Nandina or winter plum, even the most ordinary, would cost ten to twenty thousand yuan. Poor people don't have this "refined interest," they simply aren't worthy of "pure offerings!"

Children's toys are also "popular" during this time. Balloons, knives and guns, lanterns... colorful and vibrant, which child wouldn't be happy to see them? Especially the "crackling" sounds, strings of firecrackers piercing people's eardrums.

The candy department in companies is the busiest, and the shops selling southern goods are even more crowded. "New Year's Eve" and "New Year's Day" are "the season for eating" and "the days for playing." If we stroll outside, how could we see "poverty"? "New Year cake," "fine wine," "oranges," "chicken," "fish," "meat," bundles and baskets, everywhere is filled with a "busy New Year" scene, everyone has "money," such "extravagance!"

All prices are much higher than ten days ago, the Shanghai people call it "slaughtering on New Year's Eve," but customs are hard to change, so one can only "eat rat poison with their eyes open"!

Not to mention that prices rise with the occasion, even the young rickshaw pullers are making ten times the usual profit, demanding an additional "one-third" compared to usual.

On New Year's Eve, the City God Temple and Hong Temple are packed with crowds burning incense to the stars... wisps of incense smoke sting the eyes until they tear up. "Boss, incense candles, please!" If you walk around the City God Temple and Hong Temple, these incense candle sellers who rely on one spring to get through three winters truly have a good time to make money from New Year's Eve to the Lantern Festival.

But everything, big or small, male or female, especially those doing small businesses, hopes that the heavens will be kind at the end of the year and the beginning of the New Year. This is the first condition. Only "rain" makes those doing small business "cry out in distress!"

### Filler: Where is "I"?

— Nai Ren

Where is "I"? How big is it? How tall? What does it look like? I haven't heard its laughter or footsteps, it just follows you, its age is the same as yours, neither old nor young.

Where exactly is "I"? When you are talking to someone, don't you often say "He asked me?" "That thing is mine," and point to the tip of your nose? And you would never point to your eyes or ears, so at this time "I" should be on the tip of the nose.

When quarreling with someone, you often pat your chest, shouting "Damn it, I'm afraid of you!" At this time, "I" should be in the chest, and not in the lower abdomen or thighs.

It is rarely found elsewhere. This "I" that accompanies us throughout our lives, we should discover it, grasp it, seize it, and not let it waste this life without a trace or sound.

### A Murder Case

— William

This is a murder case that happened in Bagdad.

A careless pedestrian on the sidewalk was tripped by a stone and fell to his death.

The road was crowded with people, and someone went to report to the judge.

The judge was very anxious, because the murderer was unknown.

The judge ordered the bailiff to arrest the owner of the house closest to the stone to be punished.

The homeowner said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I am innocent! Because that stone was forgotten by the stonemason, he repaired my house yesterday."

The judge then released the homeowner and ordered the stonemason to be arrested and punished.

The stonemason said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I am wronged! When I was working, suddenly a very beautiful girl walked by, her loveliness, her beautiful hair, her curved body, and her most outstanding blue dress attracted me!... The color of her dress was so moving, I couldn't control myself, I could only forget my work and follow her to see my fill. So the responsibility for forgetting the stone on the sidewalk is not mine but the girl's!"

The judge then declared the stonemason innocent and ordered the girl to be arrested and punished.

The girl said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I am innocent! Heaven gave me beauty, it is not my fault. As for that blue dress that made the stonemason infatuated, I didn't make it myself, it should be the tailor's responsibility!"

The judge then ordered the tailor to be arrested and punished.

The tailor said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I just sewed a few pieces of material together with thread, I didn't weave the material, the responsibility should be on the textile worker."

The judge then arrested the weaver to be punished.

The weaver said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! Although I wove the material, you can't blame me for the moving color, the responsibility should be on the dyer."

The judge had no choice but to arrest the dyer to be punished.

The dyer said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! This dye was not invented by me, it was passed down by our generations, and some also come from foreign countries..."

But the judge didn't want to listen anymore, he thought the dyer was guilty, so he ordered him to be hanged.

After a while, the bailiff suddenly came back and said

"Your Most Honorable Sir! Our gallows can't hang him, because he is too tall."

"Release him and find a short man to replace him." The judge said impatiently. (Released from "Crown Magazine")
