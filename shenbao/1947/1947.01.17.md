### Government Prepares New Peace Proposal, Decides to Send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an, Already Informed to the Communist Side by Ambassador Stuart

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Minister Peng announced at a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 16th that the government intends to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an. This matter may be communicated to the Communist Party by Ambassador Stuart today. As for the basis for negotiation, it will be discussed between Zhang and the Communist Party. Peng refused to announce some key points that the government would consider regarding the negotiations, believing that once announced, there would be little room for maneuver, and it would lead to public debate, hindering the progress of negotiations. When reporters inquired about the stage of government reorganization, whether to negotiate first or reorganize the government first, Peng replied that the government is currently planning to negotiate with the Communist Party, and in terms of steps, negotiation should come first, followed by reorganization. Reporters asked whether the Democratic League and other parties would participate in drafting new negotiation proposals. Peng replied that all parties can participate, and they will come to Nanjing one after another. Whether to hold a round table conference or a square table conference is not important; the important thing is the content. Reporters asked: Will a direct approach be taken in the future, or will party meetings be held? Peng replied that on one hand, Zhang Zhizhong will go to Yan'an to inquire the Communist Party, and on the other hand, various parties will discuss in Nanjing. Asked whether the government will grant full freedom of publication in light of the recent declaration on civil rights by the Democratic Socialist Party, Peng replied that publication is already completely free, but before a complete peaceful resolution with the Communist Party, publication that encourages the overthrow of the government and attacks on the national army by force will not be allowed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The peace talks are gradually being finalized today. After the government formulated a new plan, it announced that it would send personnel to Yan'an and informed the ambassador late at night on the 15th, asking him to convey it to the Chinese Communist Party. How the situation will develop in the future depends on the response of the Communist Party.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart invited Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party for an hour-long meeting at 10:30 AM on the 16th. According to Conner, the spokesperson for the American ambassador, the ambassador conveyed to the Chinese Communist Party the new peace plan that the government had prepared and the government's decision to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an, and hoped that Wang would consult with Yan'an immediately. It is said that the ambassador did not express any opinions on this matter, but purely conveyed the government's views. Some people believe that the content of the new plan must not be announced at present, so as to avoid failures like the past few times. As for Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Yan'an, it depends entirely on the Communist Party's expression. If they express their consent, he can set off immediately.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] A spokesman for the American Embassy said that Ambassador Stuart has no intention of flying to Yan'an with General Zhang Zhizhong.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Zhizhong held a grand banquet at the International Friendship Association on the evening of the 16th, inviting Soviet Ambassador Petrov, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Maxwell Wood, and dozens of other Chinese and foreign celebrities. After the banquet, a dance party was held, and it ended late at night with light clouds and graceful dances.

### Lei Zhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Invited Representatives of the Youth Party and Democratic Socialist Party to Discuss New Proposals and the Peace Talk Situation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Lei Zhen took the night train to Shanghai on the 15th to discuss the new peace plan formulated by the government with people from various parties in Shanghai, so that this plan can be more sound and suitable for the opinions of all parties.

[Our Newspaper] Sources informed reporters that Lei Zhen arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 16th and did not bring a new peace plan. His main task is to invite representatives from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party to Nanjing to study the peace plan and the situation of the peace talks. Mr. Zhang Junmai has not fully recovered his health and it is not yet determined whether he will go to Nanjing, but the Democratic Socialist Party may send one or two other representatives to go. In addition to Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, who has already gone to Nanjing last night for other matters, more representatives may be sent when needed. In addition, Lei Zhen's stay in Shanghai is scheduled to be very short, and if there are no other reasons, he plans to return to Nanjing tonight.

[Our Newspaper] Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, and others took the night train to Nanjing yesterday. Before his departure, Zuo told reporters that this trip to Nanjing was for the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council, so as to hear the government's economic and financial reports, and it was not related to the reopening of peace talks. The number of days of stay in Nanjing is uncertain, and if there are no other matters, he will return to Shanghai after the Lunar New Year.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Shenfu of the Democratic League met with Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party on the 16th and had some discussions. He then visited Shao Lizi for a long talk.

[Our Newspaper] A spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party said that if the government could lift restrictions on the magazines and newspapers of the Chinese Communist Party at this time, and if it could release all political prisoners in the amnesty, it would definitely improve the Chinese Communist Party's mood for resuming peace talks. Speaking of reopening peace talks, he said that two prerequisites must be implemented, and the military part "cannot retreat even by a single county." "This matter is like doing business. Last year, empty checks were issued. This year, cash must be traded in order to be guaranteed."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Mei Yi, a spokesman for the Communist Party, took the night train to Shanghai on the 16th.

### Whether Peace Talks Can Succeed Depends on the Attitude of the Chinese Communist Party

Talk by Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party [Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Yesterday was the 61st birthday of Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party. His colleagues and friends specially set up a birthday celebration at noon in Fanwei. More than 60 people participated, and the situation was very warm. Jiang Zengyu, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party stationed in Nanjing, also rushed from Nanjing yesterday morning to celebrate his birthday and told reporters: The content of the peace plan is nothing more than a few items such as ceasefire, stationing locations, local government, and restoration of transportation. The key to the endless disputes between the KMT and the CCP is obviously that the two items of stationing locations and local government have not been resolved. In the former case, the two sides are vying for strategic strongholds, with gains and losses on both sides, and neither side can be solely responsible. There is still room for discussion as to what month and date the military status should be restored. As for local government, when the constitution is implemented in the future, governments at all levels in all regions must go through elections, and it seems unnecessary to haggle over this now. In short, all the current problems seem unsolvable when viewed up close, but there is nothing that cannot be solved when viewed from afar. He said: Chairman Chiang has the determination to solve all current problems, but whether he can get his wish depends entirely on the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party. Jiang continued, saying that he would take the train to Nanjing tonight, and Mr. Junmai would also go if his physical strength allows.

[Another Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party will issue an important declaration on the current situation in the coming days.

### Sovereignty over the Xisha Islands Definitely Belongs to Our Country According to the Treaty of Tianjin

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Relevant parties in our country have been meeting for days to study the issue of the Xisha Islands and prepare to thoroughly negotiate with the French side. According to the attached map of the Tianjin Treaty of 1885, the sovereignty of the islands clearly belongs to our country. However, France made a request in 1937, and later fell into the hands of the Japanese due to the war. After the victory, our army took over again. After our side's sovereignty was clearly announced, the French side made a request again. The islands themselves have little economic value, but they are of great importance to our national defense and shipping in the South Seas, so our side attaches great importance to them and is determined to investigate the sovereignty in accordance with the law.

### Navy Captain Executed for Corruption, Liu Naiyi Executed in Beiping, Sentenced in Court and Bound to Tianqiao for Execution

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th Dispatch] Liu Naiyi (Navy Captain), the director of the Pingjin Branch of the North China Naval Commissioner's Office, who was reported by the investigation team for corruption and sentenced to death, was executed by shooting in Beiping today. This is the first execution of corruption reported by the National Investigation Team. At 9:40 AM this morning, Liu was taken from the detention center of the Xingyuan Military Law Office. Liu was wearing a gray coat and black cloth shoes. He walked out of the prison cell in good spirits. He had no prior knowledge of being sentenced to death. As soon as he left the prison, two soldiers who had been lying in wait outside the door went forward and tied his arms behind his back. Liu realized something was wrong and was pushed to the judge Zhang Jieyi, who had set up a public case in the courtyard. His face was as white as paper. The judge immediately pronounced: "Liu Naiyi is sentenced to death for embezzling public property and deprived of his political rights for life. 29 catties and 14 taels of opium confiscated and destroyed, 100 boxes of medicines, 15 catties of culture balls, 80 taels of gold, a platinum diamond ring, and a house in Sui'anbo Hutong, Beiping, confiscated." He then announced that the death sentence would be carried out immediately and asked if he had anything to say. After hearing the sentence, Liu trembled and replied that he did not accept the sentence. The judge praised that Chairman Chiang had ordered that he be shot immediately. If there was a will, it could be forwarded on his behalf. Liu had nothing to say, only asking the judge to inform his family, "I hope they (Liu has three wives, one in Tianjin, two in Beiping, and has not been allowed to see them since his arrest) will live a good life, and he wants the children to study and sell things at home and move to the south to live." He also said, "Many of the confiscated things are my personal belongings." At this point, the official threw the vermilion pen on the ground and instructed the soldiers to tie him up firmly. They pushed him onto a truck. Liu could not stand and was half-lying on the front of the truck. He was escorted to Tianqiao execution ground. The crowd along the way was as thick as a wall, and shouts were endless. On the way, he encountered a funeral procession, and Liu nodded his head frequently. He was silent all the way. After arriving at the execution ground, two soldiers helped him get out of the car. After taking a few steps, he was ordered to kneel down facing the ground. The executioner fired a shot first, hitting the northern part of the body, and blood spurted from the collar of the coat. He fell to the ground, but his breath had not yet stopped, so two shots were fired. After his death, a subordinate of Liu, who did not reveal his surname, carried a coffin to the execution ground to collect the body. Liu's concubines in Beiping will extend the service of monks to transcend him. Liu was 44 years old, from Liaoyang, Northeast China. In addition to his wives and concubines, he also has two young sons.

### Marshall Greatly Disappointed That the CCP Did Not Participate in Constitution-Making

[United News Agency, Washington, 15th Dispatch] General Marshall will take office as Secretary of State this week. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has guaranteed that the Republican Party will support Marshall on important foreign policy issues in the coming months. Vandenberg argued last week for a change in China policy, saying the United States should support a coalition government of all parties and organizations other than the Chinese Communist Party to implement a new constitution. This clearly indicates that the United States will abandon Marshal's policy of not taking sides between the KMT and the CCP in China. According to a diplomatic authority, Vandenberg's suggestion that the United States support the Chinese parties who support constitutionalism and political training may conflict with the policies Marshal wants to implement in China. However, Marshal is greatly disappointed that the CCP has not participated in constitution-making in order to reorganize and expand the government, which is undeniable. Therefore, if the Communist Party insists on refusing to accept the new constitution, Marshal himself may also agree to the United States supporting another group in China.

[Another Telegram] Democratic Senator Pepper spoke in the Senate today, opposing Vandenberg's advocacy of changing China policy, saying that Vandenberg, a close friend of Secretary of State Nellernas, made a speech in Lexington, advocating that the United States encourage a coalition government of all parties and organizations other than the CCP to implement a new constitution, which is very misleading. This view is inconsistent with General Marshall's proposal and is sufficient to unite the United States with the "reactionary fascists and corrupt elements" of feudalism. At that time, Vandenberg, the chairman of the meeting, did not respond to Bober's accusations.

### Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, Chairman Chiang Will Serve as Chairman

### Chen Lifu on Marshall's Statement, Marshall Correctly Points Out Various Points of the Current Communist Party, Preventing Communist Conspiracy is Seeing as a Stubborn Element

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th Dispatch] Yesterday, the New York Times published an interview with Mr. Chen Lifu by the newspaper's reporter in Nanjing. When the New York Times reporter asked for his opinion on General Marshall's statement, Mr. Chen's answer was roughly as follows: After reading Mr. Marshall's frank and well-intentioned statement, my first thought is that Mr. Marshall has achieved quite a lot in his mission to China, promoting the unity of various parties in China (regrettably, the Communist Party did not participate in the National Assembly in the end), opening the National Assembly, and even passing a democratic constitution "that is completely in line with the principles established by various parties (including the Communist Party) in January last year." Mr. Marshall has made contributions to all of these. Secondly, I believe that Mr. Marshall has a fairly deep understanding of the China issue and has a very correct view of the Chinese Communist Party. However, if he could spend more time contacting responsible cadres and people from all walks of life in the Kuomintang, his understanding of the entire China issue might be more accurate. Thirdly, I believe that Mr. Marshall pointed out that the problem of the Chinese Communist Party is different from the problem of the American Communist Party, and reminded Americans not to use the view of the American Communist Party to view the Chinese Communist Party, which is also very appropriate. Fourthly, I believe that Mr. Marshall's pointing out that the Communist Party's "disregard for the facts" and "disregard for the suffering of the people" and its exclusive engagement in "very harmful and inflammatory" propaganda, as well as its attempts to overthrow the government and collapse the economy, is also very profound. Fifthly, I believe that Mr. Marshall pointed out that the Communist Party is a pure Marxist and "deliberately wants to establish a communist form of government," which is different from some Americans who mistakenly believe that the Communist Party is a land reformer. This is a very insightful view. Sixthly, I believe that Mr. Marshall's advocacy that China should conscientiously complete the work of democratic politics in accordance with the constitution in the future and welcome the participation of various parties in the government is an absolutely correct view.

What we regret and are ashamed of is that Mr. Marshall, as a friend of an allied country and an elderly man, made tireless efforts for China for thirteen months, but was still not understood by a small number of Chinese people, namely the Chinese Communist Party, who "deliberately distorted and slandered the actions, policies, and objectives of the US government, and disregarded the facts, disregarded the truth, and clearly intended to mislead the Chinese people and cause fierce anti-American sentiment in various countries around the world." After reading Mr. Marshall's words, "In this kind of public slander and complete disregard for the facts, it is difficult to remain silent. If we deny it, we must deny it every day. This is something that American officials cannot tolerate." It can be seen that he is sincerely distressed and bitter. However, those who are familiar with the Communist Party's tactics are not surprised by this. In the past twenty years, hasn't the CCP used the same method, or even ten or a hundred times more, to deliberately distort the actions, policies, and objectives of the National Government and the Kuomintang to its own government and compatriots. Misrepresent. Slander. Mislead the Chinese people and people from all over the world to arouse fierce anti-Chinese, anti-Chinese government and Kuomintang emotions. Taking myself as an example, I was actually the first to work hard for KMT-CPC cooperation at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, and I had already completed the initial work of cooperation with my own hands, but the person who has been most distorted, slandered, and sought after by the CCP so far is also me alone. Therefore, those who are familiar with the Communist Party's tactics should not be surprised by this. What I must frankly point out is that most of the Kuomintang representatives in the National Assembly were educated and influenced by British and American liberal ideas to varying degrees, that is, the so-called "reactionary elements" or "stubborn elements" that the CCP has maliciously propagated for a long time. In fact, they are the "progressive elements" or "free elements" who passed the democratic constitution "that is completely in line with the principles established by the various parties' Political Consultative Conference in January last year" at this National Assembly. The Communist Party is good at creating nouns to add to people, and its publicity methods are very skillful, so its influence is easy to make people dazzled and unclear, or even mistaken for the truth without knowing it. In fact, in the past twenty years, in China, all those who have exposed or prevented the Communist Party's conspiracy to subvert the government or "deliberately establish a communist form of government" have been regarded as "reactionary elements" or "stubborn elements."

The method scientists use to solve scientific problems is to have more contact with phenomena, analyze and study their content more, and then it is possible to discover facts that cannot be broken. Politicians should also use the same method to study or solve political problems. Mr. Marshall was able to discover "a very harmful and inflammatory fact" in the actions of the Communist Party because of his long-term stay in China for thirteen months, his wisdom and enthusiasm, and the scientific attitude and methods he adopted. Therefore, he was able to discover that "the stubborn Communist Party members will never hesitate to use drastic measures to achieve their goals," and that the Communist Party is an absolute Marxist, and that all its current words and deeds are means and policies, and its goal is "to establish a communist form of government in China, or to organize a British and American-style democratic government during the transitional period." As for the British and American-style democratic government, it is exactly in line with the ideals of the Three Principles of the People that our party has been striving for for decades, and it is also the government that will be produced according to the constitution passed by this National Assembly.

### Issues of Rights to the China Changchun Railway, China and the Soviet Union Are Currently in Negotiations in Beijing, US Bans Overseas Chinese from Going to Soviet-Controlled Ports in the Far East

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] There are various rumors about the negotiations on the issue of the China Changchun Railway's property rights. According to relevant sources, the only thing being conducted by China and the Soviet Union in the capital is informal talks. The Chinese side participating in the negotiations includes the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications is represented by Ling Hongxun. It is heard that the main crux of the negotiations is that the two sides have different opinions on the valuation method of the property rights.

[United Press, New York, 16th Dispatch] Newton, a reporter for the Scripps-Howard system who recently revealed that the Soviet Union sent a note to US ships in Dalian, ordering them to withdraw within a time limit, today sent a message from Shanghai again, saying: The US Navy has clearly ordered American reporters and businessmen not to board warships to any Far Eastern port under Soviet control. According to Newton, this ban was issued by the Naval Operations Bureau in Washington. "This action is clearly the result of the Greater Dalian Incident." He also said: He learned of this order from Mike, an official enforcing the order at the US Consulate in Shanghai. The Navy Department's order invisibly dispels the purpose of the January 6 note sent by the United States to China and the Soviet Union, which hoped that Dalian would return to normal immediately so that American citizens could travel to and reside in Dalian to "engage in their legitimate activities."

[Our Newspaper, Subsidiary 16th Dispatch] The Communist army constantly attacked the National Army's position in Puguandian every night. The National Army was clearing the nearby mountains. The street in Puguandian, which has a population of 30,000, is occasionally the responsibility of the security team, but at night it is almost the world of the Communist army, and the harassment is endless. Because the National Army's position is still about two miles away from the street, we are waiting for diplomatic negotiations before taking active action.

### Nationalist Troops Concentrated Around Yongji; Communist Offensive Collapses; Zhao Jiaxiang Claims Communist Intention Is to Seize Grain and Destroy Roads

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Sun Liren's troops around Changchun and Yongji have concentrated, and the Communist offensive has collapsed. Zheng Dongguo flew to Changchun at 8:00 AM on the 16th to command. Zhao Jiaxiang flew back to Shenyang at dusk on the 15th. According to him, the Communist offensive has been thwarted.

There are no large-scale battles currently taking place in the Northeast. The Communist forces are only testing the strength of the Nationalist troops' positions in various places, as the Communist forces are deeply afraid that the Nationalist troops may launch an offensive towards Harbin in late winter or early spring. Nong'an northwest of Changchun and Dehui northeast of Changchun are currently in the hands of the government forces. It is rumored that many Communist forces are gathered north of Yongji, but they are not surrounding the city, nor will the Communists likely do so. In short, the current activities of the Communist forces are a strategy of feinting east and attacking west to prevent Harbin from being attacked.

Although station staff warned that small groups of Communist forces were active three li away from the station, the special train still advanced slowly at its own risk. Besides Zou and the reporter, there were only two railway employees in the train. The special train continued to stop about one hundred meters away from the bridge station, and the bridge body was seen burning fiercely from a distance. By this time, more than fifteen hours had passed since the Communist forces destroyed the bridge. The railway bureau was using sleepers to build a pile to rush the repair. On the 15th, train traffic between Changchun and Dehui resumed as usual.

### The Yellow River Control Project Reaches a Critical Juncture; Blocking the Breach Must Not Be Delayed; Minister Peng Explains the Reasons to Reporters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM today in the department's conference room. Regarding the Communist Party's request to postpone the completion of the Huayuankou Yellow River breach closure by five months, Minister Peng Xuepei made the following explanation when answering reporters' questions:

The initial work of controlling the Yellow River has now reached a critical juncture. This project has several important reasons to prevent delays. The breach closure is expected to be completed soon, allowing the river to return to its original course in 1938. This project plan has long been known to the whole country and the world, and innovative measures have been taken. Currently, it is necessary to block the 170-meter breach twenty kilometers east of Zhengzhou. This is the remaining part of the total 400-meter breach. The remaining 230 meters has been filled with stones, rising above the water surface. Why is it inconvenient to postpone this project, which is just one basket short of completion? The reasons are as follows.

### Detailed Explanation; Three Reasons

(1) The method of blocking the breach is to use flat closure. First, 119 rows of wooden stakes are driven, four stakes per row, deep into the main stream. Wooden boards are then laid on top to form a bridge. Narrow-gauge rails are laid on the bridge surface for transporting stones and throwing them into the river. If the work is stopped midway, the wooden stakes and stones may be washed away at any time. Even if only the current height of the stone dam is to be maintained, stones must continue to be thrown in during the shutdown period to supplement the washed-away parts. This is a waste of materials and manpower. The 洋松 timber used is imported from the United States, and the stones need to be transported from other places by rail. (2) The current water level is still low, and the average flow rate is only about 1,000 cubic meters per second. If this situation continues for a long time, the "凌汛" will arrive in early February, and the force of the ice can cut off the banks. Even if it can resist the impact of the 凌汛, the "桃汛" will come in late March, and the flow rate will reach 4,000 cubic meters per second. It is estimated that the banks will be in danger when the flow rate in Shaanxi County exceeds 1,500 cubic meters per second. When the "秋汛" comes at the end of July, the peak flow rate will reach 30,000 cubic meters per second, which is the most dangerous period of the year. Therefore, the most suitable season for construction is only from mid-October to the end of January. (3) After the breach is closed, the river water can flow into its old course. The amount of water gradually increases from spring to autumn. Engineers have ample time to observe the actual route taken by the Yellow River in its original riverbed. The waterway meanders between the north and south banks, sometimes reaching several kilometers apart. They can take advantage of this time to strengthen the weak parts of the downstream river堤. If the Communist Party's request to delay the project by five months is granted, the completion of the breach closure will be far from the 秋汛, and there is a risk of breaches in the river堤 below Hebei and Shandong, causing unimaginable harm to the people.

### Relocation of Riverbed Residents Facilitated

The Chinese Communists are spreading propaganda saying: People who moved to the old course during the War of Resistance will suffer losses. It is difficult for us to give a definitive answer. There are no permanent houses built in the riverbed, only temporary shacks that are easy to move. Everyone knows that the Yellow River must eventually be returned to its old course. Therefore, the propaganda of the Chinese Communists is inevitably exaggerated. Or it is said that when the river is forced to return, millions of residents will be washed away. This is even more alarming. According to the initial survey figures submitted by the Chinese Communists, only 150,000 residents need to be relocated. Currently, one-tenth of the Yellow River water has flowed into the old course. The flow rate is only one 华里 per hour, and the depth is less than one meter. The speed is slower than human walking. A huge amount of water is first absorbed by the dry riverbed, and then the remaining water can move forward. Even after the entire river is diverted, it will not immediately become a turbulent flood.

Currently, the relief fund distribution team jointly formed by the government, the Chinese Communists, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is distributing relief funds along the old riverbed to the affected people. Each person can receive 100,000 yuan.

In 1938, when the Yellow River was diverted, about 6.1 million people were affected. After the breach is closed, they can all return to their homes, and food production is expected to increase dramatically.

### Yellow Flood Zone Refugee Group Calls for Early Breach Closure

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 15th] Refugees and fellow villagers from the Yellow Flood Zone who fled to Bianyuan organized a refugee group to march and petition in opposition to the Chinese Communist Party's policy of obstructing the breach closure, calling for the completion of the breach closure so that they can return to their hometowns as soon as possible. It was recently learned that the Chinese Communist Party is still insisting on immediately closing the diversion canal and stopping the breach closure work. Therefore, a meeting was convened on the afternoon of the 15th, and it was resolved: (1) To send separate telegrams to the Chairman of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Party Headquarters, calling on the central government.

### Zhao Shouyu Arrives in Zhengzhou to Supervise Breach Closure Project

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Commission, came to Zhengzhou on the 14th. In the afternoon, he accompanied Dawa and more than ten other representatives of Mongolia, who were returning west via Zhengzhou, to Huayuankou to visit the breach closure project. According to Zhao, he came to supervise the project and will not return to Bian for the time being.

### Representatives of the Post-Disaster Construction Conference in the Yellow Flood Zone Return to Bian After Inspection

Very Satisfied with All Facilities

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 15th] After the conclusion of the Post-Disaster Construction Conference in the Yellow Flood Zone on the 11th, the participating representatives and experts went to inspect areas in Fuyou, Zhongmu, and other counties in the flood zone and returned to Bian today. It is reported that the representatives were very satisfied with all the facilities in the flood zone. However, they are concerned that after the breach closure is completed, a large number of refugees from the flood zone who have fled to various places will inevitably return to their hometowns. Before the production capacity of the flood zone is restored, the food problem will inevitably be very serious and measures should be taken to solve it quickly.

### Sun Lianzhong Returns to Beiping by Special Plane; States that Xiong Shihui and Zhang Zhizhong's Visit to Nanjing Had Missions; All External Rumors Are Unreliable

[This Newspaper, Beijing, 16th] Sun Lianzhong flew back to Beiping by special plane at 2:30 PM today. When he met with a reporter from this newspaper, he said: (1) The authorities are indeed considering changing the war zone to a pacification command to unify it, but there is no concrete decision yet. All rumors about changes in military and political personnel in North China are inaccurate. He also said: Xiong Shihui's visit to Nanjing was to discuss the issue of transporting grain and teams from the Northeast, and Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Nanjing was to discuss the reorganization of the army in Xinjiang. The rumors about Xiong and Zhang are all unreliable. (2) The situation in Nanjing is dull, and there is no progress in peace talks. North China can only maintain the status quo because the overall direction of the country is uncertain. The Chief Executive's Office has not yet fully moved to Baoding due to the lack of housing in Baoding and the fact that the railways and highways have not been safely and smoothly opened. The restoration of traffic on the Pinghan Railway is progressing step by step due to complex conditions such as a lack of materials and security forces. The restoration of the railway between Yuanshi and Anyang also awaits a change in the overall situation. (3) Hebei Province has no income because it is a pacification zone. The annual administrative expenses are 50 billion short. It is expected that after consulting with President Song during this trip to Nanjing, the budget will be re-drafted. Sun said at the end: He will soon go to Tangshan and other places in Eastern Hebei for inspection.

Editorial

### A Plea for the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese!

Since the outbreak of armed conflict in Vietnam, we have been concerned about the development of the situation in Vietnam, and for the safety of the lives and property of more than 400,000 overseas Chinese, we have always hoped that the Franco-Vietnamese conflict can be resolved peacefully. However, up to now, there is no possibility of realizing what we have hoped for. After the French reinforcements poured into Vietnam, the French army launched an offensive on the front lines; on the Viet Minh side, this is the liberation movement of Vietnam, and it will not stop until the goal is achieved. Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh issued a statement on the 15th, also reiterating: "The Vietnamese people will fight to the end." Therefore, judging from the attitudes of both France and Vietnam, there is little hope that the Franco-Vietnamese conflict will end soon.

However, "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." If the war in Vietnam does not stop for a day, the safety of the lives and property of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam will not be guaranteed for a day. How can we sit idly by and watch these poor and helpless overseas Chinese without saving them!? In particular, the Hanoi Overseas Chinese district, after being occupied by the Viet Minh army, was surrounded by the French army and completely isolated from the outside world. Food and drinking water have become a problem, not only causing panic in material life, but also the French army may launch a large-scale counterattack at any time, and the threat of airplanes and artillery is pressing on every overseas Chinese. How can they not be in danger?

Vietnamese overseas Chinese representatives Yan Renfu and Yang Wenzhong rushed back to their motherland to petition the government to demand emergency protection for the overseas Chinese. The day before yesterday, they hosted colleagues in Shanghai to explain the five demands of the overseas Chinese to the motherland government: (1) Emergency relief to the overseas Chinese in Vietnam; (2) Dispatch government officials to Vietnam to appease the overseas Chinese and investigate the losses; (3) Order the French and Vietnamese parties to compensate for the losses; (4) Request the Vietnamese side to release the arrested overseas Chinese and to release the overseas Chinese who are stranded on the way in various places so that they can return to the cities; (5) Send planes to transport rice and medicine to relieve the besieged overseas Chinese, and immediately use the plane to carry women and children back to the country.

These demands are indeed the most effective way to provide emergency relief to the Vietnamese overseas Chinese. The government has an unshirkable responsibility to protect overseas Chinese, and should quickly take effective emergency measures, and must not let the overseas Chinese who are suffering in Vietnam be disappointed again. Whenever we mention the grievances suffered by overseas Chinese in foreign countries, we always feel that it is impossible to describe them all. It is a sad history that cannot be told. In the past, we blamed the weakness of the country for not having the power to protect overseas Chinese in their industrial and commercial activities overseas; but today, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, no matter what, the international status has finally improved. When our representatives speak at the successive international conferences, the great powers have to respect our opinions and give them special attention. If our diplomatic authorities can use it properly, then protecting the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese abroad is within their capacity, especially protecting the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese, which can be considered no problem. Taking the Vietnam incident as an example! Yuan Shijian, our Consul General in Hanoi, has done his best to protect the overseas Chinese, and has repeatedly made suggestions to both France and Vietnam, advocating the division of a neutral zone in Vietnam for overseas Chinese and peace-loving Vietnamese people to live in, but this security plan has not been realized. We deduce the reason, in fact, because our government has failed to give Consul General Yuan Zijian sufficient power to argue according to reason and achieve this. This makes us have to express considerable regret to the diplomatic and overseas Chinese affairs authorities.

Past events cannot be changed, but future events can be rushed. The most urgent issue at present is for the government to quickly take concrete and effective measures to protect overseas Chinese. The five demands put forward by the overseas Chinese representatives should be given serious consideration. There is no hope for a peaceful resolution of the Franco-Vietnamese conflict for a while, and more than 400,000 overseas Chinese are in danger, and they are expecting emergency aid from the two countries at all times; the situation is urgent, and the government must not turn a blind eye, or calmly discuss and listen to the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese who cannot get the protection of their motherland and die. The two measures approved by the Executive Yuan, (1) Allocate 2 million Vietnamese currency to relieve the overseas Chinese in North Vietnam; (2) The relevant departments will organize an investigation team to go to North Vietnam to investigate the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese. We always think that it is still not enough. A mere 2 million Vietnamese currency is like a drop in the bucket, and it is still of no help! Investigation is a post-event nature, and this move is definitely not enough to protect the safety of overseas Chinese! In short, we hope that the government cannot ignore the safety of the lives and property of Vietnamese overseas Chinese, and should quickly take effective emergency measures, on the one hand, to rescue the endangered overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and on the other hand, to comfort the overseas Chinese in other places!

Technical Guidance

The Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office recently has a proposal to organize a technical committee, whose task is to assist factories in solving technical problems with the voluntary assistance of several industrial experts. This move is very commendable. Because the decline of current production is due to the lack of technology, which is indeed one of the reasons. Either there are too few such specialized talents to recruit, or the scale is too small to recruit such talents, so it is indeed a very necessary and valuable work for the public to provide experts, do their duty, and solve technical problems for factories.

Government agencies have never lacked superficial assistance to factories. For example, support, reward, conservation, and promotion are all familiar terms. But how much actual benefit can manufacturers get? This seems to be another question. We have indeed heard manufacturers complain: It would be enough if the government caused us less trouble; we don't expect them to give us much help. Originally, following those nice-sounding nouns, there would be a series of procedures and forms distributed, and each would make its own form and set its own procedures, although they were largely the same, they went their separate ways. In many places, they were also prepared very delicately, and if there were no specialized talents and a long period of time, it would be difficult to deal with. Sometimes, a committee was specially sent to question, investigate, and inspect documents face-to-face, and had to accept, entertain, and accompany the inspection. And the final result was not to add many useless data to their archives? After the event, it is considered a success if a statistical figure can be seen, and many investigation forms do not even have a statistical figure. As for the general work at ordinary times, no matter what the purpose is, it is always more of a suppression and restriction component and lacks the actual benefits and enthusiasm of encouragement and support. Therefore, it is still a matter worth writing about to send experts to design and improve factories, solve difficulties, and never charge fees.

Some people believe that the urgent need of the industrial sector at present is not only a technical matter. With factories, there are no raw materials; to buy raw materials, there is a lack of funds; when manpower and raw materials are all ready, there is no sufficient electricity; if you are lucky enough to start work, the sales of products are often blocked by low-priced foreign goods; in addition, the interest on loans is frighteningly high, and wages are increasing day by day; old taxes are not removed, and new taxes are coming one after another; just the transportation, loading, and unloading costs are equal to the water feet between Shanghai and the United States; if these cannot be improved, what is the use of simply improving technology? These words are indeed facts, and we do not deny them. But technology is technology, and it cannot be confused with these problems. As the saying goes: focus on the big picture, start with the small things, not to mention that technical problems cannot be regarded as small things?

I heard a certain gentleman in the textile industry say: China's textile machinery and technology are thousands of years behind the United States, thousands of years behind Japan, and even several years behind India. Taking this as an example, it can be seen that even if these many problems can be solved, if the technical aspects cannot catch up and catch up quickly, then the future of China's industry is still not optimistic.

Taking export goods as an example: many products cannot meet the standards of overseas markets, so returns are often heard and sales are decreasing day by day. Although there are still reasons for mixing in fraud, etc., the fact that the technology is too poor to compete with others is naturally a main reason.

As for the fact that foreign goods are flooding the market and Chinese people do not like to use domestic goods, the only excuse is that the quality is too poor and the effectiveness is too low. In seeking the reasons, in addition to the raw material problem, we have to attribute the main reason to technology. Therefore, improving technology is not only one of the means to save industry, but also a crucial way to promote domestic goods and maintain exports. It is hoped that the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office can implement this new proposal without any slackness, and completely wash away the shame of the official from the past who has been useless, and also hope that manufacturers will make the most of it and not live up to this kindness.

### Amnesty Decree Issued to the Higher and District Courts of Suzhou; Released Prisoners Begin to be Released; It is Said that They Weep with Joy When Released from Prison; the Poor Will Also Be Assisted

[Report from our Suzhou Office, 16th] The National Government's amnesty decree was received by the prosecutor's offices of the Higher and District Courts here on the 16th. All those who meet the provisions of item A of the amnesty regulations, whose most serious original sentence is imprisonment or less, will be released uniformly, and the rest will have their sentences reduced separately. The two courts immediately reviewed the cases and released prisoners this afternoon, including three from the Higher Court and more than 200 from the District Court, including fraud, kidnapping, embezzlement, theft, opium, intimidation, and counterfeit currency criminals. Our reporter made a special trip to Jiangsu First Prison to visit the amnesty and release situation, and happened to see four officials from the District Court Prosecutor Xiao Qi, etc., explaining the government's virtue of amnesty to the prisoners in batches by name, encouraging them to be new citizens, and warning them not to have narrow-minded revenge behavior. The prisoners were extremely grateful, and some wept with joy. It is learned that: The First Prison is detaining more than 300 prisoners from the District Court, of which more than 200 are fully amnestied and more than 100 have their sentences reduced. Later, due to lack of time, Wu Kegen and other twelve were released first, and the rest will be released on the 17th. As for the vast majority of traitors, there is no hope of amnesty or reduction, and even if there is, it still needs to be sorted out by the Higher Court. The reporter talked with Warden Chen Songnian about the recent situation of Chen Bijun, the traitor, and was told that she has been able to adapt to prison life, and now there are no servants, and fires are not allowed in the room for heating. Only food and drink are still delivered by relatives in Suzhou on a meal-by-meal basis. It seems that the female traitor of the generation will end her life with the flavor of iron windows!

[Report from our Suzhou Office] After the National Government issued the amnesty decree, there were quite a few prisoners detained in all prisons and detention centers of the Higher and District Courts of Suzhou who met the amnesty conditions. However, most of the criminals were forced by life to take risks, resulting in violations of criminal law. Now that they are released, and it is now the end of the year, with severe cold, and without food or clothing, it will inevitably increase social hidden dangers and affect local security. Now the Suzhou Lawyers Association and Xia Yi Society are jointly initiating the establishment of an amnesty prisoner protection association, modeled on the Shanghai Women's Prison Protection Association, to find ways to provide relief.

[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 16th] The Hangzhou City Council believes that there will be more than 600 criminals in the city this year who will be granted amnesty, and the lives of the pardoned criminals have become a problem. It has been resolved to send a letter to the city government and the court to discuss solutions to accommodate these criminals.

### Active Deployment of River Defense; Command Post Established in the Short Term; Transportation and Communication Improved Separately

[Report from our Jiangyin Office] General Tang Enbo summoned the commanders of various districts to hold a meeting after arriving in Wuxi the day before yesterday. Commander Kong Qinggui of the fortress went to Wuxi on the morning of the 14th to participate. Commander Tang inquired in detail about the situation in various suppression areas, and gave many instructions on river defense matters. The most noteworthy is that if a bandit alarm occurs, if the Baojia chief of each area knows but does not report it, or if there is collusion, the Baojia chief should be jointly punished, and the commander can directly execute it. Also, the county magistrate in charge of the area has dereliction of duty, but the county magistrates are questioned. At about 4:00 PM, Commander Kong returned to Cheng and stepped up the planning of river defense. Because the defense line under his jurisdiction is the longest, it is urgent to deploy it so that the river defense command post can be established in the short term. In addition, Commander Kong believes that communication is extremely important, and specially telegraphed the county government to mobilize civilian laborers to be responsible for rebuilding the bridges from Beiwai Junshan along the Jinwu Road to Wushan. From Wushan to Hougang to Yangku Road (the section east of Yangku must be built to the border of Changshu Shangyuan), the county will allocate civilian laborers to repair it. The above two items must be completed before February 15th. The telephone from Beiwai Junshan along the Jinwu Road to Zhangjiagang is the responsibility of the county government and must be connected within the 20th of this month. The highway from Shengang via Liangshiqiao to Jiaoxi is the responsibility of the county government and must be completed before February 15th. The standard for bridge construction and repair of the above items is at least 5 tons of heavy load. The required expenses will be telegraphed by the headquarters to the provincial government for approval.

[Report from our Wuxing Office] The county's Tianliang Office received a provincial order on the 13th to hire civilian boats to load 250 large bags of grain rice and transport them to Hangzhou for storage. The boat passed the Qianjiatan area near Linghu, and it was already late. Suddenly, more than 20 bandits came, each holding long and short guns, shouting to stop and dock. The boat and the rice were all robbed. At the same time, two merchant ships passed by the area and were also looted. After the boatmen returned to the city to report, the military and police agencies sent a team to pursue them, but the bandits had disappeared without a trace.

### Huhu Ferry Robbed

[Report from our Jiashan Office] The Huzhou-Shanghai ferry, Rongshu, was sailing through Qiandun Port, Xitang Town, which belongs to the county, at 3:30 AM on the 14th.

After three hours, it was dawn, and they dispersed into several boats and fled. It is reported that the loss reached 20 million yuan. Also, on the night of the 13th, a kiln cargo ship was sailing through Xiangfu Dang, north of Xitang. Suddenly, a small boat came with seven people, holding long and short guns, boarded the ship and looted. As a result, more than 100 yuan of clothes and miscellaneous items were robbed.

[Report from our Suzhou Office, 16th] Wu District Prosecutor's Office summoned Fan Junbo, Wang Yangzhi, Wang Xianeng and others again on the morning of the 16th for interrogation in the famous local extortion case, which lasted four and a half hours. Our reporter inquired from various parties about the inside story of the re-investigation, and learned that another person, Zhu Mengzhen, accused Fan Junbo of committing a crime of corruption, which was not related to the 6 million yuan extortion case that has already been tried. It is heard that the District Prosecutor's Office has gained clues on this case and will formally announce the details of the case in the near future.

### Changlu Salt Sold to Bengbu and Xuzhou

[Report from our Bengbu Office] The largest market for the concentration of salt in Anhui and Henan is Bengbu. However, since the start of the military uprising, the salt-producing areas in Huaibei have been affected by the war, and the output of various salt farms has decreased sharply, leading to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. In October last year, the salt affairs authorities allocated 356,000 dan of Huai salt for sale in northern Anhui, with a time limit of only three days. In the rush, many transporters here regretted not being able to participate, and there were complaints. Seeing that the warehouse inventory was insufficient, in order to maintain the people's food and increase tax revenue, the authorities decided to sell Changlu salt to the Bengbu and Xuzhou areas. In Bengbu City, it is stipulated that 400,000 dan should be allocated and transported. On the 12th, the salt affairs management branch ordered the Huai salt transporters to apply to the Lu Bureau. Now this quota has been undertaken by a few large merchants under assumed names. At this time of the end of the lunar year, the money market is extremely tight and sea transportation is scarce, making transportation a problem. It is heard that the authorities have set a time limit for compliance and do not allow delays. The transporters have telegraphed the salt administration authorities to allow the application procedures and the collection of salt tax to be transferred to the Salt Administration Bureau.

### Anonymous Salesman's Attack Exposed; Donation of Guns and Bullets Settles the Matter

Yang Ruxun Brings Humiliation Upon Himself Out of Spite

[Report from our Wuxing Office] There is a businessman named Yang Ruxun in Wuzhen, who opened the Douhua Pharmacy in Xizha. He usually likes to pursue vanity. Recently, the Youth League District Team Department in the town expanded its recruitment of members. Yang believed that his ability was better than others, and hoped to obtain the position of squad leader after joining the League, so he happily joined. Unexpectedly, a League member named Cai obtained the title. As a result, jealousy arose, so on the afternoon of the 7th, he sent an anonymous letter to Chen Qizhe, a wine merchant in Beiji. The letter was full of descriptions of the misdeeds of Cai and five other League members. Chen was confused after seeing the letter, so he took the letter to Shen, the district team leader, to show the original letter. As a result, the handwriting was recognized, and there was no way to deny it. He had to admit it and bowed his head in acknowledgment. Cai and others had no intention of suing in court. Fortunately, someone came forward to mediate, and the lawsuit was settled. Yang apologized in the newspaper and volunteered to subsidize the team with four rifles and 240 bullets.

However, the severe shortage of plowing cattle in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu has become an extremely serious problem.

According to Chairman Wang's report, he only saw two plowing cattle and one wild dog on the 120 li journey from Dongtai to Yancheng. The situation is miserable, like the abdomen sand Han. In the future, if we cannot address the reality and provide a large number of plowing cattle, seeds, and agricultural implements to the rural areas of northern Jiangsu, the consequences will be disastrous.

According to the constitution, the interim President and Prime Minister will resign after the formal President is elected on the 16th. Before the Anglo-French statement was announced, Blum's political reputation was already good, due to the 5% reduction in prices. Initial impressions in Paris regarding this statement have been favorable.

[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] The committee of various parties in the French National Assembly recently held a meeting under the chairmanship of the Speaker and immediately unanimously passed a resolution proposing to the parliament that the election of the President of the French Republic should adopt two methods: secret ballot and absolute majority. It is generally believed that all parties have expressed their agreement on this and it is hoped that the parliament will pass it without any amendments. [French News Agency, Paris, 16th] General Manager Bertaux of the French Public Works Department has now been appointed as the French Governor-General of Tunisia to replace General Mast.

### England and France to Conclude a Treaty of Alliance to Prevent Germany from Threatening Peace Again, Completing the Linkage of the Triangular Alliance Relationship, Blum Returned to Paris from England Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: French Prime Minister Blum arrived at the Paris airfield by plane from London at 12:10 pm today, carrying a draft Anglo-French alliance, and attended the joint session of the two Houses to elect a president at 2 pm.

[Reuters, London, 15th] After Prime Minister Blum arrived here to hold two days of talks with Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Minister Bevin, the two sides agreed to negotiate and conclude an alliance. The communique from 10 Downing Street stated: The United Kingdom and France have agreed to conclude a treaty of alliance as soon as possible to prevent Germany from continuing its aggression and to ensure peace and security. This alliance will not go beyond the scope of Article 53 of the United Nations Charter. Negotiations on Belgian affairs will begin as soon as possible. Political observers here believe that the Anglo-French negotiations on this matter are the most important event in the history of the two countries. If the negotiations progress smoothly, the signing of the alliance can complete the linkage of the post-war European triangular treaty relationship. This relationship began with the Anglo-Soviet alliance in May 1942, followed by the Franco-Soviet alliance in February 1944. Therefore, if there is another Anglo-French alliance, the three European powers can complete the triangular alliance relationship.

### Joint Communique Issued

The full text of the joint communique issued by 10 Downing Street is as follows: Prime Minister Blum's visit to London has provided an opportunity for a joint review and exchange of views on various issues of common interest to the two countries, as well as various other issues. The policy towards Germany has been thoroughly reviewed. During the review, both sides recognized that for the sake of the interests of the two countries, effective steps should be taken to prevent Germany's economic recovery from becoming a threat to world peace again. During the discussion, it was further recognized that France's economic recovery requires the import of more coal, and increasing coal production in the Ruhr region is a major factor in European recovery. During the discussion, it was recognized that both countries had been attacked by Germany twice in 25 years and have the same interests in defending themselves against future German aggression. For this reason, both sides agreed to conclude a treaty of alliance as soon as possible within the scope of Article 53 of the United Nations Charter to prevent future German aggression and ensure peace and security. The two governments further believe that the conclusion of this alliance will facilitate the resolution of all issues between the two countries in a spirit of mutual understanding. Since the two countries have close ties in industry and commerce, they agreed to instruct the representatives of the two countries in the Anglo-French Economic Committee to immediately review the two countries' recovery and innovation plans to avoid conflicts. The committee will meet in Paris in the coming days to provide an opportunity for full implementation of the Monnet Plan. After the British government's economic white paper has been debated by Parliament, talks will be held again as soon as possible.

### The British Foreign Office Denies Abandoning the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Newspaper Distorts Bevin's Speech

[French News Agency, London, 15th] The Soviet political organ newspaper "Pravda" recently published an article criticizing British Foreign Minister Bevin's speech on December 22, in which it said that the Anglo-Soviet Treaty had been abandoned. This statement has been denied by a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office, who said that the "Pravda" article was excerpted and taken out of context to become material for discussion. In fact, the Foreign Minister denied in his speech that Britain was bound by American policy and said that Britain was not bound by any policy other than the obligations stipulated in the Atlantic Charter. However, this does not mean that Britain will not fulfill its obligations under treaties signed with other countries. If the "Pravda" report is interpreted in this way, it means that Britain has not only abandoned the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, but also abandoned its treaties signed with other countries. This is completely inconsistent with the facts.

### Europe Will Have a New War Within Five Years

Benes's prediction

[Reuters, Prague, 16th] Czech President Benes said in a speech here today that he expects a full-scale struggle against Nazism or fascism to occur in Europe within four to five years.

### The Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting Decides to Allow Austria to Participate in Peace Treaty Discussions, France Clarifies its Position on the German Issue

[Report from this newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: The Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting decided today that Austria should be consulted on the drafting of the Austrian Peace Treaty. At the same time, it was decided to rename the Austrian Peace Treaty the "Treaty on the Reconstruction of an Independent and Democratic Austria." US Representative Clark announced the withdrawal of the US draft peace treaty for Austria and will present a new draft treaty in a few days. The British draft treaty remains unchanged, and the French new draft treaty will be presented in one or two days.

Yugoslavia submitted a memorandum to the Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting today, demanding that southern and central Carinthia be ceded to Yugoslavia, making Austria a small province.

[French News Agency, 15th] The Four Foreign Undersecretaries continued their meeting today and began discussing the German and Austrian peace treaties. The theme was the proposal put forward by the Australian representative, who advocated inviting the 18 relevant countries to attend and present their opinions. It was finally decided to invite representatives from Poland, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Australia, South Africa, and Canada to attend and present their opinions on the German and Austrian peace treaties, but the date will be decided later. In addition, the Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting decided to discuss the Austrian issue in the morning session and then discuss the German issue in the afternoon session.

Divide Germany to Prevent Revival

[French News Agency, New York, 15th] Former French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault told a reporter from the New York Times today that France is the only country that has clearly stated its position on the German issue. France hopes that the Saar region will be independent, but must be economically and financially linked to France. As for politically, France does not want to have a relationship with it, because France knows that the 800,000 residents of the Saar region are all Germans. As for the Ruhr region, it should be independent and internationalized. The Rhineland should be separated from Germany and placed under the military control of the Allied forces. In short, Germany must be made a decentralized federal state. I believe that the coal mines in the Ruhr region should be developed under a system similar to the nationalization of British coal mines, so that the whole of Europe can benefit. The German people are a powerful and dangerous nation. The strength of Germany is only beneficial to itself, and there is no benefit to other countries. It would be foolish to think that Germany will change its original ideas after it becomes stronger again. That is why France hopes that Germany will become a federal state.

### Disarmament Issue: Postponed Discussion, Reconsidered in Three Weeks

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 16th] The United Nations Security Council today passed the American proposal to postpone the discussion on the disarmament issue for three weeks until February 4th, so that the governments of all member states can study the issue from various complex angles. Earlier, British representative Jebb expressed support for the American proposal, but advocated for a swift start to the work, while also emphasizing the importance of not sacrificing effectiveness. American representative Austin stated that he believed that before February 4th, they would be able to reach an agreement on the implementation of military reductions, and at that time, they also hoped for a closer agreement on the report of the Atomic Energy Commission. Austin continued, saying that the report of the Atomic Energy Commission should be discussed first, as this was the instruction of the United Nations General Assembly. Soviet representative Gromyko still stated that the General Assembly resolution was for the Security Council to promptly review the disarmament proposal, so he could not accept the American suggestion to postpone the discussion until February 4th. Polish representative Lange also expressed his firm opposition to delaying the discussion on the disarmament proposal. Finally, after a vote, the American proposal was passed.

### The Huge Fascist of Italy: Montana Still Lives

Once rumored to be designated as Mussolini's successor...

He sentenced Mussolini's son-in-law, Ciano, to death...

He commanded the Blackshirt divisions to invade Albania...

He is at the top of the list of war criminals held in Yugoslavia...

[Special Dispatch from a Correspondent in Italy, 15th] Montana, the short-lived leader of Mussolini's Social Republic who was once rumored to be designated as Mussolini's successor, has now changed his name and lives in seclusion in a remote Italian village. Montana served as the police chief of the Fascist Republic until the end of the war and was a judge in the Fascist court, sentencing Mussolini's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Ciano, to death. According to Montana, he was able to settle here with the help of powerful friends. Montana's hair has turned white, and he is now writing his memoirs, defending Fascism. When the Italian army invaded Albania, Montana commanded the Blackshirt divisions. Later, he commanded Fascist militias in Yugoslavia. Montana is at the top of Yugoslavia's list of wanted Italian war criminals. For a year, he has been living with his dark-haired wife and four-year-old daughter in a simple apartment outside a village on the Mediterranean coast. We walked down a narrow alley to reach his simple and unadorned residence, where Montana lives in hiding, constantly at risk of being arrested.

According to the guide, Montana is protected by powerful people, so he is safe. His friend Orlanta, another fugitive Fascist general, is also hiding in Italy. Montana met with the two reporters without appearing fearful or uneasy. When he was told that they would not reveal his location, he spoke freely with the reporters. Montana said that his memoirs would record Mussolini's good deeds, awaiting later generations to judge, and hoped that he could publish the book when he no longer needed to hide. Montana then recited a section of it, describing Mussolini's last situation in Milan, saying, "While I was negotiating surrender terms with representatives of the National Liberation Committee, Mussolini went to see the Archbishop of Milan, constantly raging and denouncing the National Liberation Committee as a gang of thieves, ordering me to stop the negotiations. I reported Mussolini's decision to the committee, and when I returned to headquarters, Mussolini had already left. A few hours later, Mussolini was captured by the party and executed in April 1945. If Mussolini had waited for me to go with him, I would probably not be alive today!"

After the end of the war, Montana evaded the eyes of the United Nations and Italian inspectors for a long time. On one occasion, he was interrogated by American intelligence officers in Rome for three days but was eventually released. Montana considers communism the greatest scourge of human civilization and has always believed in Fascism. Today, he is still alive in Italy. When asked about his feelings towards Mussolini, he said that Mussolini made too many mistakes, so he eventually lost faith in him. When asked about his opinion of Hitler, Montana shrugged dismissively and said, "He has been defeated."

### Byrnes Signs Treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary

[United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Byrnes is scheduled to sign the treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary at the State Department on the 20th of this month. These treaties will be signed in Paris on February 10th, and the representative of the United States will be Ambassador to France Caffery.

### World Food Council Holds Third Executive Committee Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The Central Executive Committee of the World Food Administrative Agency has announced that its third quarterly meeting will be held in Washington on the 30th of this month. The Secretary-General of the committee will report on the world food situation and the quantities of food to be allocated to food-deficient countries as decided by the previous meeting.

### Koreans Oppose Trusteeship, Hold Large Demonstration Tomorrow, Demand Hodge Reject Soviet Proposals

[Reuters, New York, 15th] Korean representative to the United Nations, Rhee Louis, said today that Koreans are scheduled to hold a demonstration on Saturday to protest the four-power trusteeship of Korea, which will not be a violent riot. At that time, men and women from all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce will march in various cities in Korea, demanding that U.S. military commander General Hodge reject the Soviet proposal to only allow communist representatives of Koreans to participate in negotiations to end U.S.-Soviet military control. This is a collective expression of protest and will not be a violent riot. According to a Korean news representative, the scale of this demonstration may shock General Hodge. A year ago, Koreans held a similar demonstration, at which time the military mobilized and used tanks and machine guns to intimidate the demonstrators. Rhee has also sent a letter to U.S. senators, requesting that South Koreans be granted democratic autonomy before the unification of the northern and southern parts of Korea. He pointed out that although Koreans do not sympathize with communism, Koreans in the Soviet military zone in the north actually enjoy more autonomy, and their food supply is also better than that in the south.

### Amidst the Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives Meeting, the Soviets and Germans Suddenly Establish an Agreement: Show Goodwill to the Germans to Satisfy Their Desires, Which Will Affect the Future Moscow Conference

[Our Report] Berlin Radio, London, 16th: The Soviet authorities have announced that Sokolovsky, commander of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany, signed an agreement with leaders of the German Socialist Unity Party on January 11th, agreeing to stop dismantling German factory machinery in the Soviet occupation zone. Sokolovsky also promised to greatly reduce German reparations and completely exempt them from the supply of food, clothing, and fertilizer.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 15th] The "German Express," which is allowed to be published by the Soviet Union, stated today that Soviet officials are holding extremely important meetings with German political leaders to discuss fundamental plans concerning the future of Germany. The issue of reparations is the main topic of discussion. The Soviet military authorities are apparently prepared to make concessions to Germany's wishes, especially regarding the dismantling of German factories. Regarding the extraction of reparations from Germany's existing production, the Soviet Union will also give extensive consideration to all reasonable German wishes and then resolve them. The publication of this news by the newspaper at the time when the four foreign ministers' meeting in London is discussing the German-Austrian peace treaty is noteworthy. The location of the German-Soviet meeting has not been announced, but it is likely in Karlshorst, where the Soviet General Headquarters is located. The Socialist Unity Party, which is supported by the Soviet Union, did participate in the meeting. The newspaper stated that the concrete results of the discussion are expected to be produced within a few days. This meeting will enable Germany to obtain more substantial results, which cannot be compared with the Germans who recently went to London with only wishes in their hearts and unfortunately returned empty-handed. According to the Social Democratic Party leader Schumann, who recently went to England, the newspaper is referring to this person. The newspaper further stated that the current meeting is extremely important for two reasons: first, to allow Germany, at least the part of Germany in the Soviet occupation zone, to know the economic foundation for its recovery. Second, the moderate and coordinated policy adopted by the Soviet Union will inevitably affect the future Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, possibly leading other representatives at the Moscow Conference to adopt the same approach.

### Japanese Political Situation Increasingly Serious: Internal Disagreements Within the Socialist Party Regarding Participation in the Coalition Cabinet

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to Japanese observers, the heavy pressure from leftist elements within the Social Democratic Party, the third largest party in Japan, will delay Prime Minister Yoshida's plan to resign from his cabinet and form a new coalition cabinet for several days. It is also said that Japanese labor groups are also opposed to the Social Democratic Party participating in a coalition cabinet dominated by reactionary elements, with Yoshida as the president of the Liberal Party and Minister of State Shidehara as the president of the Progressive Party, which hold an absolute majority in the Japanese Diet. At the same time, the right-wing elements of the Social Democratic Party support participating in the coalition cabinet. Due to the attitude of the labor groups, the right wing, which holds power in the Social Democratic Party, is adopting a policy of trying to persuade the leftist elements in order to avoid divisions within the party.

### Moutet Issues Statement on Vietnam: Viet Minh Army Stops Internal Strife

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] French Overseas Territories Minister Moutet issued a statement last night stating: I recently went to Vietnam to inspect the situation on the ground and to seek a political basis for establishing or maintaining a Vietnamese Federation within the French Union. France is prepared to cooperate with people who strive for freedom and peace, but will never yield to violence.

[Agence France-Presse, Kunming, 15th] According to Viet Minh sources, the conflict between the Viet Minh army and the Viet Minh splinter groups, namely the National Army and the Allied Army, has completely stopped since the Hanoi French-Vietnamese conflict on December 19th. The strength of the National Army is estimated to be about 4,000, half of whom are irregular troops.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 15th] According to a communiqué issued by the French military headquarters, French forces are continuing military operations in the Hanoi area, which are progressing smoothly. The Viet Minh army has suffered heavy losses, with 128 killed or wounded and 18 captured. In addition, French forces seized 20 firearms and occupied an ammunition depot.

### Freight Car Derailment at Nanxiang Station: Traffic Interrupted for Seven Hours Due to Fracture of Three Empty Freight Cars Awaiting Repair; Fortunately, People and Cargo Were Safe with Minor Losses

Yesterday morning, a freight train on the Beijing-Shanghai line derailed when it arrived at Nanxiang Station, causing the entire line to be interrupted for more than seven hours. It is reported that three damaged empty freight cars were being transported to the Qiqihar Car Factory for repairs. At 10:40 AM, when the train was near Nanxiang Station, 16 kilometers from Shanghai, the eighth car behind the locomotive, an empty car in disrepair with number 15CW, suddenly leaned south of the track. The ninth car, an empty car with number 20.OH.250225, was stuck in the track. The tenth car, an empty car with number 20CW270307, leaned north of the track. The eleventh car, an empty car with number 20CW270326, had its front wheels slightly off the track, and stopped at a location 16.7 kilometers from Shanghai. About one hundred and fifty sleepers were crushed, and the track was damaged, causing the train to stop. The stationmaster of Nanxiang Station, upon seeing this, immediately telegraphed the Railway Administration for assistance. Deputy Director and Chief of the General Affairs Office Hou Huohua, upon hearing the news, immediately led Deputy Chief Guan Duo, Wu Yukun, Transportation Chief Zhou Weidong, and engineers and employees from the Engineering Department, numbering dozens, to Nanxiang by rescue train. After strenuous repairs, traffic was restored at 6:00 PM. As a result, the special train for returning home on the Beijing-Shanghai line, which was newly opened at 10:30 AM yesterday, as well as train No. 8 at 11:00 AM, train No. 78 at 12:30 PM, train No. 1 at 1:30 PM, train No. 74 at 3:10 PM, and train No. 50 at 5:20 PM, all departed after 6:00 PM. Trains Nos. 75, 73, 51, 1, 5, 77, 7, 79, 71, and 3 from Nanjing to Shanghai were all waiting at Kunshan Station due to their inability to proceed, and arrived in Shanghai at 6:30 PM. According to Guan Duo, Deputy Chief of Transportation, the cause of the derailment was the fracture of the three damaged empty freight cars being transported to the Qiqihar Car Factory for repairs. Fortunately, it was a freight train and empty cars, so people and cargo were safe, and the direct damage was minor.

### City Government Revenue Suddenly Decreases Due to Unapproved Budget; Director Gu Jokingly Tells Reporters That He Will Not Retreat into Seclusion to Avoid Debt

[Our Report] Regarding the city government's budget for this year, the City Council discussed it repeatedly and finally considered the amount to be too large and did not approve it. Also, in order to reduce the burden on citizens, the City Council has reduced various taxes in the city, such as entertainment tax and banquet tax, in accordance with the newly established central tax law. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, to inquire about how to deal with the decrease in city government revenue and the increase in expenditures. Director Gu was on the phone borrowing public funds to get through the year. He then smiled and told reporters: This year (lunar calendar) can be worry-free. As the Director of the Finance Bureau, I won't have to retreat into seclusion to avoid debt. Fortunately, the City Council has approved that the winter municipal construction donation can be collected as usual, so there is no major problem for the time being. The reporter then asked how to increase revenue next year. Director Gu replied: All avenues for increasing revenue have been rejected by the City Council, and the Finance Bureau has not been able to establish new tax items to increase the burden on citizens. Anyway, the City Council is temporarily adjourned and will be convened soon. I hope the Council can understand the city government's tight financial situation and approve the Finance Bureau's various proposals. According to reports, the 40 billion yuan for citizens' compulsory labor remuneration proposed by the Finance Bureau in this City Council meeting has been decided to be removed, and the tax rates for all other taxes have been reduced in accordance with the newly established tax law.

### Established Accelerated Delivery Methods for Mail to Foreign Residents in Beijing

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received instructions from the Ministry of Communications Postal Administration, forwarded by the Minister, that postal delivery should be improved and accelerated. Especially, there must be improvements to the sorting and delivery of mail to foreign residents in Beijing. Accelerated delivery methods were thus established as follows: (1) The Postal Administration shall write to postal administrations in the UK, USA, France, and the Soviet Union, requesting them to directly seal all mail to Nanjing, China, so that the mail can be sent to Beijing for sorting and delivery upon arrival. (2) The delivery sections (i.e., the delivery post offices) for the residences of foreign residents in Beijing should be investigated and clarified by the Beijing Postal Administration, and a list of the delivery sections should be posted (and revised as needed) at the management office, all branch offices, the mobile post offices on the trains, and other conspicuous locations for the sorting of mail, so that it can be referred to when sorting the mail. Also, personnel should be assigned to consult with foreign residents in Beijing, requesting them to provide foreign senders with the delivery post office numbers for their residences on the envelopes or packages, such as Nangking (0) (indicating the Jiangsu Provincial Post Office in Nanjing), Nanking (1) (indicating the First Branch Post Office in Nanjing), etc., so that, once the mail from overseas arrives in Beijing and is opened, it can be sent directly to the relevant delivery post offices to avoid the delays caused by translating and inquiring about each item. (3) The Shanghai Postal Administration shall write to local newspaper offices, requesting them to indicate the delivery post office numbers on the envelopes of newspapers sent to foreign residents in Beijing, so that they can be sealed separately, increasing delivery speed. This method has already been widely implemented in this city. (4) The local factories and businesses in Shanghai should first deliver their mail to Beijing to the relevant Postal Administration branches before the 9 AM dispatch, so that they can catch the Shanghai-Nanjing train.

### More Than Nine Hundred Italian and Austrian Nationals Happily Brave the Rain to Board Ship to Return Home

[Our Report] 952 Italian and Austrian nationals in this city, who are willing to return to their countries, have boarded the S.S. Marine Falcon at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf No. 1 yesterday afternoon, with the assistance of the UNRRA authorities, and will set sail for Naples, Italy, this morning.

Among the nationals returning to their countries, apart from the 91 Italian nationals who are not subsidized by the UNRRA, the remaining 762 Austrian nationals and 99 Italian and Greek nationals are being repatriated by the UNRRA. Most of them are Jewish refugees who fled to China under the persecution of Hitler. They have lived in Shanghai for seven or eight years, and many have had children here. Now, because their homelands have been restored, they are all willing to return home to reorganize their former businesses. Therefore, although it was windy and rainy at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf yesterday, these nationals who were about to leave Shanghai were all excited and not at all gloomy.

### Year-End Disputes Surge in the Party; Staff Joked About a Thorough Cleaning; Customers Unable to Enter; Yongan Director Receives a Bottle of Corrosive Liquid as a New Year's Gift; White Powder Slogans Smear the Windows; After "Worry Work," There's Now "Diligent Work"

[Report from Our Newspaper] Labor disputes caused by year-end bonus issues have been surging recently and have not subsided. At the Yongan Company on Nanjing Road, also due to year-end bonus issues, the labor side suddenly launched a so-called "cleaning campaign" starting the day before yesterday, a unique twist on labor-management disputes. For days, staff have been covering the glass with red and green slogans, creating a dizzying effect. Simultaneously, staff printed and distributed leaflets to various sectors, expressing their grievances. The leaflet stated, in brief: "Regarding the demand for year-end bonuses, management has not only ignored it this year but also intends to renege on last year's bonuses." Therefore, the staff believe the campaign was launched out of being "forced" to do so. However, just as the "dispute" unfolded, unexpectedly, a visitor came to the residence of Yongan Company Director Song Changchao (No. 3, Lane 149, Jiaozhou Road) at around 10:30 a.m. yesterday, carrying two paper boxes, pretending to be delivering New Year's gifts. After knocking on the door and handing them over, the visitor immediately turned around and left. Later, upon opening the boxes, it was discovered that they contained a few oranges and a bottle of corrosive liquid. The motive was clearly intimidation. Song Changchao immediately reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. It is understood that Song is representing the management side in the current Yongan labor unrest.

Furthermore, following past practice, the National Goods Company used to give a 20% salary increase at the end of the year. However, this year, when the staff invoked the precedent, the management, citing poor business conditions, did not agree. Consequently, all employees began "action" yesterday, implementing a so-called "thorough cleaning" movement. This is similar to the Yongan Company's "cleaning campaign," albeit with a different approach. When customers arrived yesterday, the staff gathered in front of the main entrance, saying, "Please do not enter; there is a thorough cleaning going on inside." Simultaneously, the large glass windows along the street were covered in white powder, truly giving the impression of a thorough cleaning. In reality, the scene was quite similar to the "Empty City Stratagem" performed in Peking opera.

It is also reported that this "thorough cleaning" at the National Goods Company is also known as "diligent work." It is reminiscent of the "worry work" action at the Little Luzon Department Store the other day, a sign of ever-changing tactics. "Diligent work" differs from "worry work." "Worry work" involves staff displaying "worry" on their faces, not attending to customers, and appearing solely with a "mournful face." In contrast, "diligent work," on the surface, involves being eager to work, sweeping the doors and windows of the company, mopping the floors, and preventing customers from entering. When onlookers see this, they don't know whether to cry or laugh, like "a mute eating coptis," experiencing bitterness they cannot express.

### Bandit Leader from Nanhui Caught in Shanghai; Kidnapped a Baoshan Farmer Woman Imprisoned for More Than Sixty Days; Confessed That It Was Related to a Team Leader; The Team Leader Was Also Arrested

According to a confidential report recently received by the Garrison Headquarters, a large group of bandits, approximately twenty in number, armed with light machine guns and various firearms, was operating in the Nanhui County area of Pudong, harassing and robbing civilians, committing all kinds of evil deeds. On November 3rd of last year, they kidnapped Shi Zhang Meiliang (52), a farmer woman living in Pan Shi Township, Shitousha. The Inspection Department dispatched the Pudong Inspection Office to investigate the case. After careful investigation by squad leader Yang Fulin, it was learned that the kidnapping was carried out by Lu A'er, a bandit leader hiding in Nanhui County. Shi's family had received a letter from the bandits, arranging

a meeting to negotiate the ransom.

Investigators disguised themselves as Shi's relatives, carrying the items specified by the bandits and heading to Sanzao, Donghai Township, Nanhui County, the designated

meeting place.

At the time, squad leader Yang, together with personnel from the Pudong Joint Defense Command and the Nanhui County Security Brigade, set up an ambush along the old Jianghai Beach, while inspector Huang Ding, disguised himself to negotiate the ransom conditions with the bandits. Huang arrived at the designated location, but the bandits were

extremely cunning.

They first searched Huang Ding and then took him to a small hut. The bandits posted guards outside to watch for any signs of trouble, while inside the hut, they negotiated the ransom procedures with Huang. The troops lying in ambush at that location could not

get close to the scene.

By the time they arrived, the bandits had already fled into the sea, so they gained nothing. The Inspection Department believed that this case would be difficult to handle with force and sent personnel to the township chief, instructing him to send a letter to the bandits,

appealing to their sense of righteousness

and ordering them to release Shi Zhang. On January 4th, Shi Zhang was released unconditionally by the bandits and returned home. According to Zhang's report on her kidnapping experience, she was kidnapped on November 3rd in Pan Shi Township, Shitousha, and taken by boat eastward to the sea near the area. On the 5th, she went ashore at Dushan after crossing three hills to a civilian's house in Jiulong Mountain. The same night, she returned to Dushan. On the morning of the 6th, she went to Jinshanwei, where she slept in the open for three days before being taken to a certain port. She was imprisoned in the bandit's den for more than sixty days before the bandits released her unconditionally, giving her 8,000 legal tender yuan

as travel expenses.

After Shi Zhang escaped, squad leader Yang Fulin continued to closely monitor the bandit's whereabouts. Later, he coincidentally encountered bandit leader Lu A'er near the Jiaotong Leather Shoe Store at Zhifu Road, Beijing Road, and secretly followed him. At the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road, Lu was arrested. During interrogation, Lu admitted that he had kidnapped Shi Zhang, but it was carried out by his subordinate, Gu Xiaogen. Lu also implicated Chen Shan, the team leader of a certain regular brigade who was involved in the kidnapping. Later, inspection personnel arrested Chen Shan in a corner flat at the intersection of Xuejia Lane and Lujia Lane, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. The case is currently under investigation.

### Former Shanghai Municipal Council's Retirement Pension for Chinese Employees; The Key Lies in the Multiplier Issue; If Calculated According to the Index, It Would Reach Over 60 Billion; Foreign Employees Are Not Included; Awaiting the Mayor's Final Decision

[Report from Our Newspaper] For over a year since the victory, former Chinese employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council have not received their savings, pensions, or severance pay. Since being unemployed, it has been difficult to maintain their livelihood. They have collectively petitioned the British consulate several times without result. The other day, Mayor Wu expressed his deep concern for their situation and resolved to instruct the Finance Bureau's Liquidation Committee to expedite the matter. Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu immediately summoned Gu Chunfan, the director of the Finance Bureau, to inquire about the progress of the Liquidation Committee and discuss repayment methods. This reporter visited Director Gu at 5 p.m. yesterday to inquire about the outcome of the meeting. Director Gu told this reporter that the Finance Bureau's Liquidation Committee is working according to the former Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations to calculate the amounts due to each employee. This is easy and can be completed in a few weeks. However, the key lies in the issue of the repayment multiplier, as the amounts calculated by the Liquidation Committee are very small, ranging from a few hundred yuan to larger amounts. Whether to issue the payments to former Chinese employees according to the cost-of-living index or multiply them by a corresponding factor is a matter for Mayor Wu to make the final decision on. The Finance Bureau has no power to decide. It is reported that there were approximately one thousand Chinese employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. According to related sources, the total amount of their savings, severance pay, and pensions is close to 100,000 yuan. Based on their position and length of service, the amounts vary greatly, with the smallest being only 100 or 200 yuan and the largest being about 500 or 600 yuan. If calculated according to a cost-of-living index of over 6,500 times, the amount the city government would have to repay would reach over 60 billion yuan. In the current situation of extreme economic difficulty, this is a major problem. Furthermore, this number does not include foreign employees. It is reported that there are approximately 500 or 600 foreign employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. Their positions and length of service vary, making the calculation extremely complicated. British employees are paid in pounds. It is said that there are senior employees who have served for two or three decades, and the total amount they are entitled to can reach tens of thousands of pounds. It is difficult to decide according to what ratio the city government will repay, as there is no precedent after the victory. Victory public bonds, for example, have not been repaid. It is also generally speculated that the central government is unlikely to provide subsidies, as all the assets of the Municipal Council were taken over by the local government, and its debts should also be repaid by the local government.

### The Xingzong Wanxiang Ship Privately Carrying Passengers and Cargo; The Entire Crew Involved in Corruption; Too Many People Involved, Difficult to Conclude the Trial Soon

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of the Xingzong Wanxiang ship illegally profiting from privately carrying passengers was retried in court yesterday. The defendants included Yang Weichen, Tai Jisheng, Lin Shixing, Han Xingcai, Yang Jishui, Yang Jingui, Jian Shijin, Tang Shengsong, Ku Yuda, Krick, and Jin Amao, a total of eleven people. It was found that Yang Weichen was an employee of Xingzong. In October of last year, while

transporting relief supplies to Tianjin and Qingdao, he took the opportunity

to carry 32 passengers, charging 120,000 yuan per person. Shipowner Krick was involved in the scheme, with Yang receiving one-third of the profits and Krick receiving two-thirds. Furthermore, sailor Yang

Jishui, through the introduction of the

Yiqi Travel Agency, colluded with crew members Lin

Shixing and Han Xingcai to privately carry 43 passengers, jointly earning 7,210,000 yuan from the passengers. Yang Jimu then offered 4,370,000 yuan to bribe the shipowner. At the same time, helmsman Yang Jingui, through his friend Yi Baojin, brought in 23 passengers, charging 250,000 yuan per person. After paying the ship 200,000 yuan per person, the remaining 50,000 yuan was split between Yang and Yi. In addition, Tang Shengsong introduced the loading of 700 bags of flour, charging 3,000 yuan per bag, and Jin Amao introduced the loading of 1,000 bags of rice, charging 15,000 yuan per bag. Two-thirds of this went to the shipowner, and one-third was equally divided among the entire crew. Moreover, the cook Jian

was reported to the waterway police branch, which arrested the entire crew and the over 130 passengers, transferring them to the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor, considering that from the shipowner to the crew, everyone on the

ship was corrupt and extremely unlawful, prosecuted them under Article 3, Section 6 of the Anti-Corruption Regulations. Although the defendants admitted to privately carrying passengers in court yesterday, too many people were involved, making it difficult to conclude the trial soon. The court adjourned the trial for a later date.

### The Greater Shanghai Evening News Workers Strike; Management Reports to the Municipal Authorities; No Agreement Reached, Preparing to Apply for Mediation

The city's English-language Greater Shanghai Evening News did not publish yesterday due to a sudden strike by printing workers. According to news released by the newspaper's party bureau: The strike occurred after the issuance of a one-month New Year's bonus and the first half of this month's salary. The workers did not apply for a strike in advance, demanding a week off during the period, or double pay if they did not take a week off, as well as a loan of 300,000 yuan per person. The newspaper's president, Gaul Tsungch'un, issued a statement to the workers, stating in brief: "The municipal authorities have informed this newspaper that there are no official holidays during the Lunar New Year period, so this newspaper has decided to only take one day off on Lunar New Year's Day. Regarding the New Year's bonus issue, this newspaper has already issued one month's double salary and cannot issue any other special subsidies or loans. As for this strike incident, this newspaper intends to apply to the municipal authorities for strict handling and is prepared, if necessary, to close the factory and reorganize with the consent of the municipal authorities." The workers suspended work twice yesterday but resumed work shortly after. After learning that the management had no intention of making concessions, they formally went on strike. The newspaper's management has reported the situation to the municipal authorities and is preparing to apply for mediation if direct negotiations cannot be quickly established.

### Joint Celebration by Shanghai Garrison and Police Scheduled to Be Held at Yiyuan Garden

The army, navy, air force stationed in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Municipal Police are planning to hold a Spring Festival celebration at Yiyuan Garden on Albert Road on the 23rd of this month to connect emotionally and exchange knowledge, as the Spring Festival is approaching. In addition to inviting party and government officials, social dignitaries, and distinguished ladies to dine together, there will be entertainment programs such as dancing,

singing, and movies to entertain the guests. The event is bound to be lively.

### Adjustment of Pawnshop Interest Rates

The Municipal Council had suggested to the Municipal Government to add public pawnshops and adjust the interest rates of paste-on vouchers or public pawnshops. Yesterday, the Municipal Government's reply was received, and the Social Affairs Committee made its fifth decision, which was to set the period for six months. If there are difficulties in turnover, the Municipal Bank should adjust it. The handling fee for each pawn of 15 cents has been ordered to be changed to seven cents, and the interest rate of 27 cents has been changed to 20 cents, which will be notified by the Social Affairs Bureau for implementation soon.

### One Year of Public Land Survey; Recently Concluded; A Total Area of 6,764 Mu Received; Registration Is Currently Being Processed to Complete Legal Procedures

[Report from Our Newspaper] During the current Municipal Council meeting, someone questioned the Land Administration Bureau about the handling of the city's public property and requested that all public land be leased to citizens at a low price to solve part of the housing shortage problem. This reporter inquired with Yang, the secretary of the Land Administration Bureau, about the public land survey. The following is what Yang reported: The public land survey has been going on for a year now. At the beginning of the implementation, the archives of the public property in the old two concession areas were incomplete, and the land registration in each district was extremely chaotic, creating many difficulties. It was not until recently that it came to an end. It has now been determined that there are 1,249 parcels of public land in the 18 districts that the city has received, reaching over 2,100 mu. The public registration of the above public land is currently being processed to complete the legal procedures.

Enemy and Puppet Sales of Public Land

Regarding the enemy and puppet's disposal of public land, it has been verified that during the period when the enemy controlled the Bureau of Works, from December 8, 1941, to the end of July 1943, the enemy disposed of and sold 97 parcels of public land, totaling 158 mu, 8 fen, and 7 li. The puppet government sold 137 mu, 9 fen, and 4 li of public land from August 1, 1943, when it "took over" the two concession areas, to August 1945, when the War of Resistance was won.

Vichy Government Period

During the Vichy government period, the former French Municipal Council sold public land. From February 23, 1943, when the French government announced the abandonment of its special rights in China, to May 19, 1943, when the national government announced the cancellation of French privileges in China, to August 1, 1943, when the French Concession was handed over to the puppet government, a total of 27 parcels, totaling 56 mu, 2 fen, and 3 li and 9 hao were sold. The French Municipal Council did not transfer 48 parcels of public land, totaling 323 mu, 3 fen, and 5 li and 4 hao.

Puppet Government's Disposal Deemed Invalid

Regarding the handling of the above public land, according to Article 3 of the "Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the puppet government's disposal of public land is deemed invalid. Except for public land that has been released for agricultural land and the contract holder is a self-employed farmer

cultivating the land, according to Article 4, the contract holder may be required to complete the contract procedures again within a limited time and without payment. The rest should be publicly announced and taken back by the Party and Government.

Regarding the validity of the disposal of public land during the enemy-occupied Municipal Council period, after

receiving instructions from the Executive Yuan: "During the

Government's

occupation of the Public Concession, the enemy's

occupation

has

been

deemed

invalid, but the

terms

of

the

sale

should

be

reviewed

by

the

Assets

and

Debt

Liquidation

Committee

of

the

Concession

to

determine

if

there

are

any

flaws

and whether the disposal was

voluntary. If there are any flaws, the case should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for a ruling to revoke the disposal." Regarding the disposal of public land by the former French Municipal Council, after

receiving instructions from the Executive Yuan: "After the National Government announced the cancellation of French privileges in

China on May 19, 1943, the disposal should

be

deemed

invalid.

The public land

not

transferred

by

the

French

Municipal

Council

is

currently

being

reviewed

and

transferred

by

the Assets and Debt Liquidation Committee of

Concealing Public Land, Rewarding Reports

The above is a general overview of the Bureau's work in surveying public land over the past year. In the future, we still hope that citizens will report concealed public land. The reporter can report to the Bureau in writing with a brief map of the location and boundaries of the public land, the name and address of the encroacher, and the history and usage of the public land. The Bureau is currently planning to reward reports of concealed

public land and has submitted the plan to the Municipal Government. The plan stipulates that if a school is found to have concealed public land, it will be given a bonus of 20% of the land's value.

### It is Easier to Change Mountains and Rivers Than a Person's Nature; Released in Two General Amnesties, Yet Commits Robbery Again

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, Chief Shi of the Laoza Branch personally led officers and soldiers, patrolling the territory in a jeep, and searching suspicious pedestrians. When they reached the entrance of the Natural Hotel on Zhifu Road, they noticed a Western-dressed man acting suspiciously. Chief Shi ordered the officers to

get out of the car to search him, but the man suddenly turned and fled. The officers immediately pursued him and eventually managed to arrest him with a gun. A Mauser pistol and eight rounds of ammunition were found in his possession. He was taken to the station for questioning. It is reported that the man is indeed a notorious robber. Twenty years ago, he committed a robbery and murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released in a general amnesty, which reduced his sentence to fourteen years. Recently, he was released again in another general amnesty, and only a few days later, he committed another robbery.

### Strange Car on the Roadside; License Plate Found to Be Forged; Evading Inspection, Speeds Away; Police Officer Opens Fire, Accidentally Injuring a Pedestrian

[Report from Our Newspaper] At approximately 8:10 p.m. yesterday, a patrol team of the Jing'an Temple Branch spotted a black-plated car parked on the side of the road between Fuhuangdu Road and Jiaozhou Road, with the license plate number 17578. As they were about to approach for inspection, the driver disobeyed orders and immediately started the engine, speeding away. At that time, the officers gave chase, firing three shots in a row. The car escaped without a trace. The stray bullet wounded a pedestrian, Wang Xiaotang (26 years old, from Huangyan, a coppersmith), in the right shoulder. Fortunately, it was only a skin wound, and the bullet fell with his coat. He was taken to the Civilian Hospital for treatment by passersby. The branch reported the incident to the General Bureau. After investigation by Section Chief Lu Xia of the Vehicle Section, it was learned that the car was owned by Guo Qiong, the factory director of the Yongan Textile Factory (resident of No. 12, Lane 479, Beijing Road). Guo Qiong was ordered to report to the bureau. He claimed that the car was still at home and had not been out, so the license plate must be forged. The branch is currently continuing its investigation.

### Shanghai Briefs

The Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association will hold its winter plenary meeting at the association's clubhouse at 3 p.m. tomorrow, with entertainment programs such as Bai Yang's recitation and Guangguanghui's music. Mayor Wu will also attend.

Yan Jiagan, the director of the Finance Department of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday. At around 5 p.m., he went to the Central Bank to meet with Governor Bei to discuss the financial situation in Taiwan Province.

National Art Professor Zhang Liangshan's exhibition of more than 200 watercolor and ink paintings will be held at the Daxin Company Gallery starting on the 20th.

### Storytelling and Ballads

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Among Shanghai's entertainment options, listening to storytelling is relatively quiet. The gongs and drums in the theater are unavoidably deafening, and watching movies may cause eyestrain. Therefore, a group of quiet people go to the storytelling venue to spend their time, sipping tea while listening to the story, which has a unique flavor. Moreover, the seat prices are not expensive. A thousand yuan for tea allows one to sit for two or three hours, making it the most economical option.

Storytelling is divided into Pinghua (評話) and Tanci (彈詞), commonly known as "big stories" and "small stories." Pinghua is based on the rise and fall of dynasties and the success or failure of battles. They are mostly stories of heroes and righteous men. It is all oral storytelling, and the narrator must perform all kinds of roles, from the main character to the clown, with both form and spirit to be considered excellent. Tanci uses the Sanxian (三弦) and Pipa (琵琶) to accompany the narration, and sings and portrays the romantic stories of talented scholars and beautiful women in vivid detail, which can also be captivating.

Suzhou is the main base for storytelling. Most of those engaged in this profession are Wu people. Their industry organization, called the "Guangyu Society (光裕社)," has a long history. Later, the Zhejiang faction created the "Runyu Society (潤裕社)," to compete with the Guangyu Society, but because people generally prefer to listen to the soft language of Wu, its power ultimately could not match that of the Guangyu Society. In the past, most storytellers were men. The term "female storyteller (女說書)" mostly referred to famous courtesans who entertained guests. The beautiful voice of a woman is naturally moving and most suitable for singing, so female storytelling also became an organization, called the Puyu Society (普餘社), forming a three-way balance with Guangyu and Runyu. Sometimes, men and women partnered, or husband and wife sang together, or father and daughter performed together, which was quite popular. It was not until the establishment of the Pinghua and Tanci Research Association that the boundaries between the three were broken.

Storytelling is popular in the Jiangnan (江南) and West Zhejiang (浙西) areas. Whether in cities or towns, they can be found, but due to language barriers, they cannot gain a foothold north of Changzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, or south of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province. In Shanghai, it was only a novelty in amusement parks in the past. Although there were a few teahouse-style storytelling venues, the audience was mostly small citizens. Since the rise of radio broadcasting, storytellers have become popular, because Tanci is most suitable for broadcasting. The sound of the stringed instruments can be heard everywhere and at any time.

Storytelling relies on radio broadcasting, attracting many distinguished people, which in turn motivated those with a good business sense to set up new-style storytelling venues. Places like Nanjing and Dongfang are crowded with people. Although storytelling is primarily based on listening, radio is ultimately not as vivid as live performance with singing and instrumental accompaniment in portraying the characters in the story, so radio broadcasting does not affect the business of storytelling venues. After the War of Resistance, radio broadcasting declined for a time, and the storytelling venues became even more crowded. The storytelling venues that had previously closed down reopened one after another, and many new ones were also established. There are now more than 20 storytelling venues in the city, among which the Huiquan Building on Shilu Road has the longest history, spanning six or seven decades. The Cangzhou Storytelling Venue on Chengdu Road has a spacious venue and comfortable seating, making it the most luxurious in terms of equipment. Among the various forms of entertainment with local characteristics, storytelling can also attract many patrons.

Southern people like Tanci, while northern people prefer Dagu (大鼓, a type of ballad). There are many kinds of Dagu, such as Beijing-style Dagu, Pear Blossom Dagu, Eight-Cornered Fast Talk (八角快書), and so on. In Shanghai, there are only occasional opportunities for them to rise to prominence, but they cannot last. In the past, they were only attached to amusement parks as

minor attractions and did not have independent venues. At that time, there were two places for Dagu, one was in the New World (新世界), where drum kings like Liu Baoquan (劉寶全), Little Black Girl (小黑姑娘), and Zhang Shaoxuan (張少軒) sang, and the other was in the Great World (大世界), where Xue Dawang (薛大王), Old Dwarf Gourd (老矮瓜), and Little Jiuling (小九齡) performed.

In 1932, Huang Chujiu (黃楚玖) changed the site of his clothing store to a Beijing-style storytelling venue, which was the first time northern Dagu was performed independently in Shanghai. At that time, in addition to the main performers Bai Yunpeng (白雲鵬) and Little Black Girl, there were also Eight-Cornered Fast Talker He Zhichen (何質臣), Yueqin player Yang

Qin (楊

琴), and comedian Dagu player Shanyao Dan (山藥旦), which was a very neat lineup, and the attendance was not bad. Unfortunately, it only lasted for two months. Later, drum stories were also performed at the Tianchan Teahouse near the racecourse on 4th

Road and downstairs at the Greater China Hotel. Especially when drum king Liu Baoquan came to Shanghai to perform several times, it was a

sensation for a while.

Liu Baoquan's achievements in the art of Dagu can be said to be unprecedented. His voice was a natural gift, high-pitched, clear, and mellow, and coupled with his

expressions and movements, the audience was filled with vigor. Listening to his performance of "Ningwuguan (寧武關)" was exciting and maintained, singing "The Great Western Chamber (大西廂)" was graceful, romantic, and extremely meticulous, with language and actions both vivid and lifelike. Moreover, he was very strict with himself, abstaining from smoking, gambling, alcohol, and

sex, so when he came to the south for the last time in 1939, although he was already 71 years old, his spirit was still

vibrant and his voice was still loud. Except for the

patch of white, bald hair on the back of his head, he did not look like an old man over seventy years old.

### Heaven Favors Us: Dense Fog Arrives Late, First French Aircraft Safely Lands in Shanghai, Here for Inspection to Open the Sino-French Air Route

[Our Dispatch] Air France has specially dispatched a plane E-BBDE from Paris for a test flight and inspection to open a Sino-French air route. The plane departed Saigon at 6:30 AM yesterday and safely arrived at Jiangwan Airport in Shanghai at 2:30 PM amidst light rain. It is the first French aircraft to arrive in China after the war. The plane is a DC-4 four-engine giant, with a silver-white fuselage, painted with blue stripes and a Pegasus logo, which is quite beautiful. The cabin has 44 leather seats. Yesterday, it carried 11 company commissioners and 7 people including pilots, co-pilots, radio operators, and attendants. French officials and shipping companies from the city sent personnel to the airport to welcome them, and many young ladies presented flowers to express their gratitude. The atmosphere was filled with laughter, and the arrival was smooth. Shortly after landing, the city was shrouded in dense fog. The plane is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 19th of this month, fly to Saigon, and return to France. As for the official opening date, it is still pending a decision from the Paris headquarters. The above picture shows the French plane arriving in Shanghai. The picture below: is the flight attendant. (Photo by our reporter)

### Heavy Fog Envelops Capital Airport, Three Aircraft Land Safely One After Another, Zhou Zhirou Congratulates Pilots at the Scene

[United Press Nanjing, 16th] Two China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes (carrying a total of 22 passengers) and a US Army C-54 transport plane (one of its four engines already damaged) landed safely one after another within half an hour at Nanjing Airport, which was enveloped in heavy fog on the morning of the 16th. Air Force Commander Zhou Zhirou and Brigadier General McNair, head of the aviation group of the US Military Advisory Group, were both at the airport observing the cooperation between the ground control tower and the crew members on the Army transport plane, enabling the safe landing of this giant plane which was already damaged, on the runway.

At that time, the fog was very dense, and the runway was almost indistinguishable from the airport management office. One minute after the transport plane landed, CNAC C-47 No. 50 transport plane, carrying 11 passengers from Shanghai to Hankou, also emerged from the thick fog and landed at the airport. Twenty minutes later, CNAC Shanghai-Beiping flight C-47 No. 54 transport plane, carrying 11 passengers from Shanghai, intending to go to Beiping via Nanjing and Qingdao, also landed on the runway in adverse weather conditions. Although the weather was gradually deteriorating, the pilot still kept the plane in the air, waiting for the Army plane to land first, to avoid a mid-air collision. The Army plane, piloted by Lieutenant Owens, was carrying supplies from Shanghai to Chengdu to supply the US military graves registration team in West China when one engine was damaged. Because it was far from Jiangwan Airport, it was forced to land at Nanjing Airport. Both CNAC planes were piloted by Chinese crew members and are currently staying in Nanjing, waiting for the weather to clear. Zhou inspected both planes and congratulated the pilots for their high skill in flying in such dangerous weather, and discussed why they took off in such adverse weather conditions. The two planes were originally scheduled to land at Ming Palace Airport, but due to low visibility, they switched to landing at the military airport.

### Notice to All Areas: Suspension of Flights to Shanghai

(Another dispatch) Due to the adverse weather conditions, which were unfavorable for flying, China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation immediately telegraphed all areas to suspend flights to Shanghai for safety reasons. However, the flights from Shanghai to various areas yesterday were still normal because the weather was still good in the morning.

### Shanghai-Taiwan Flights Resume, Cheng Shih-kuei and Others Return to Nanjing and Shanghai

Cheng Shih-kuei and two other members of the Ministry of Education's Taiwan Education Inspection Group, who arrived in Taiwan on November 28th last year to inspect education throughout the province, left Taiwan today to return to Nanjing. Wu Chin-hang and six other National Assembly representatives from Sichuan Province and Director Xu of the Tianjin Haihe Engineering Bureau also returned to Shanghai on the same flight.

### Further News on the Miss Sung Case: Miss Zhu Calls, Says Company Was Careless

Although the company sent personnel to search the crash site, Zhu's body was not found. Therefore, when he was placed in the coffin, only a thigh was used as his body. Unexpectedly, half a month later, a villager named Wang from Zhangjiazhai caught a fish in the Beihe River near the crash site. He was overjoyed to find a big fish in the net and hurriedly pulled the net out of the water. To his horror, he saw a corpse with a blurred face and missing limbs. He was horrified and abandoned the net to report to Li Xiang-zhou, the head of the 11th bao in the area. Li immediately went to investigate with the villagers and lifted the fishing net to the shore again. After careful inspection, although the corpse's face had rotted, the clothing was still there, including a flannel shirt and pants, a grass-green jumpsuit, and only one foot with a yellow leather shoe. This was generally consistent with the body sought by Central Air Transport Corporation. Therefore, he reported the information to the Yin-hang police station of the competent police sub-bureau, which telegraphed Central Air Transport Corporation. The company sent two staff members, Xu Yao-dong and Yang Zan-chen, to accompany the prosecutor from the district prosecutor's office to conduct an examination.

### Valuable Fur Goods Belonging to Five Traitors, Auction Date May Be Postponed

[Our Dispatch] The Enemy-Puppet Property Clearance Office recently decided to auction off the fur goods of traitors. It is learned that this batch of fur goods belonged to Zhou Fo-hai, Sheng You-tan, Qian Da-jun, Jiji Qu (wife of Li Shi-qun), and She Ai-zhen (wife of Wu Shi-bao).

There are a total of 229 pieces of fur goods, divided into 25 groups, with 7 to 8 pieces or more than 10 pieces in each group. The bottom price for each group ranges from 7-8 million yuan to 8-9 million yuan. There are valuable silver fox, mink, otter skins, and a tiger skin. They are divided into fur robes, coats, and cheongsams.

The auction date was originally set for the 26th of this month, but because that day is the fifth day of the first lunar month, it may be postponed to the 28th. The viewing dates are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 19th and from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 20th at the China Bank Building, 8th floor, The Bund.

### Reader Consultation

(1) Taking a Concubine to Continue the Lineage

Tang Mo-yun asks: I am middle-aged and have no children. In the 32nd year of the Republic, I married a woman named Zhu as a concubine. The following year, she gave birth to a son, who unfortunately died last spring. Since then, her attitude has changed drastically. Initially, she claimed that she and my wife were not getting along, and she has been living in her mother's home for a long time and has not returned since. She does not reply to my letters. I ask: Given the above situation, is her leaving without returning illegal? After she leaves, do I still have to bear her living expenses? If I have no choice, can I file a lawsuit?

[Lawyer Zhu Ya-kui answers] Legally, there is no status of a concubine, only a cohabitation relationship. You should try to persuade her to return. If the woman surnamed Zhu is still unwilling to come back, you are not responsible for her living expenses, but you also cannot apply for compensation for any losses.

(2) Cleverly Enticing Cohabitation

Wu Jun-de asks: Mr. A is now 48 years old and has a wife and three sons. At the age of 36, he met an 18-year-old girl, B. B's parents died early, and she was raised to adulthood by her foster mother. At that time, Mr. A, seeing that B was intelligent and beautiful, used various means to collude with B's foster mother to induce her into cohabitation. This has been going on for twelve years. Later, as B grew older, she realized she had been deceived, but she could not escape Mr. A's control. Now there are several legal questions, please answer them: (1) Is Mr. A's cohabitation with Miss B legal? If Miss B insists on breaking off the cohabitation relationship but is rejected, what means should she use to deal with it? (2) If Miss B does not seek Mr. A's consent and elopes to marry another man, is it legal? (3) If Miss B elopes alone but is still monitored by Mr. A, can she sue him for obstructing her freedom of movement? (4) If Mr. A refuses to allow her to leave and hires a lawyer to provide legal protection, is it valid? (5) If Miss B elopes privately, can Mr. A sue her for elopement and file a lawsuit?

[Lawyer Zhu Ya-kui answers] (1) The cohabitation relationship is not legal. If Miss B insists on breaking off the relationship but is rejected, she can request a court ruling. (2) Yes, but when eloping, she may not take any items other than her own. (3) Yes. (4) It should be judged according to the actual situation. (5) If she did not take any items other than her own, then of course no crime can be established.

### To Facilitate the Collection and Settlement of Public and Private Funds, the Central Bank Issues New Customs Gold Notes in Denominations of 250 Yuan and 500 Yuan

[Our Dispatch] In order to gradually recover the flat-printed notes issued during the war and to facilitate the collection and settlement of public and private funds, the Central Bank has begun to issue new versions of customs gold notes in denominations of 250 yuan and 500 yuan.

Also present were Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, and Wang Zijian, Director of the Secretariat, among others. There were three important decisions:

(1) Approved the "Cotton Yarn Inspection Standards and Grade Regulations," which stipulated the following inspection items: (1) moisture content, (2) weight, (3) strength, (4) burning degree, (5) water and impurities content, (6) uniformity and color, (7) hanks content, (8) warp length, (9) packaging weight and tube yarn appearance.

(2) Stipulated the price difference for 20-count yarn grades: The purchase price for Grade A yarn was $1,975,000 per piece (standard 400-pound yarn). For 20-count yarn with quality inferior to Grade A, the worst grade was reduced by 2.5% of the highest purchase price. By analogy, the lowest purchase price for 20-count yarn was $1,777,500.

(3) Regarding the proposal to purchase Pudong waste cotton: It was resolved that state-owned and private yarn factories should purchase as much as possible, and the Textile Control Committee would negotiate loans with the Four Banks Joint Treasury.

Furthermore, it is learned that the Central Trust Bureau's initial allocation of rayon has been approved at this week's regular meeting of the sales agent. It was tentatively approved to allocate one-sixth of the total allocation to each industry in December of last year. The approved amount for the silk weaving industry was one-sixth, or 457 cases and 5 packages, and for the ribbon weaving industry, it was one-sixth, or 30 cases and 5 packages. As a result, 208 applicants from the silk weaving industry were allocated 322 cases of Toray rayon, with an allocation price of $2,770,000, totaling $891,940,000. However, there was still a surplus of 135 cases and 5 packages, and no applications have yet been received from the ribbon weaving industry. It is said that because most manufacturers have already closed for the Lunar New Year holiday since yesterday, the demand has sharply decreased, so the bureau has not yet approved the allocation of rayon to various industries for this month.

### Tea Market Trading Listless During Year-End Account Settlement

As the Lunar New Year approaches, the tea industry is also settling its accounts, so supply and demand have weakened in recent days, and trading has declined. However, in terms of market sentiment, holders of goods still hold an optimistic view of the prospects for overseas trade, so there is little sign of fluctuation. The prices of various types of black and green teas have remained stable and unchanged. As for various domestic sales green teas such as Dragon Well, Dafang, and Baozhong, since sales in the Tianjin area have become stagnant, they only rely on slight sales in this city, so the process is not active, and prices are stable with a hint of softness.

[Another Dispatch] Currently, countries such as the United States are still eager to purchase Chinese tea, but because there is a large gap between the selling prices, exports are extremely sluggish. Tea merchants are facing financial difficulties and cannot sustain themselves for long. They have repeatedly requested the government to purchase tea to provide relief. It is now learned that the initial steps are gradually being taken. It is said that the purchase amount will reach 60,000 piculs. In recent days, various tea firms and tea companies in this city have submitted the quantity of tea in stock and the production cost to the authorities, and it is hoped that the authorities can provide funds within days to help them tide over the Lunar New Year.

### Central Bank Exerts Effort to Suppress Gold Prices; Slight Setback Seen

Yesterday, gold prices were still subdued by the Central Bank's control. Trading opened around $3,710,000, and reached a high of $3,730,000, but was immediately suppressed by the Central Bank. Initially, prices remained stable around $3,700,000, and at 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 92 bars at $3,700,000. Afterwards, supply repeatedly strengthened. Although buyers resisted, they eventually succumbed near noon and prices hovered around $3,670,000. In the afternoon, trading once fell below $3,650,000. The next day's trading opened higher due to rumors of a large currency issue, reaching a high of $3,750,000. The Central Bank continued to exert pressure, and prices retreated to around $3,700,000, down $15,000 from the previous close. The prices of jewelry gold and silver dollars remained unchanged. Financing was still stable, and interest rates remained around 1.5%. Foreign currencies also saw stable fluctuations. In the morning, the black market price for US dollars was still $6,500 to $6,600, but this price was difficult to exceed. At noon, it fell to around $6,400. In the afternoon, gold prices rose slightly. As a result, the closing price was still down $150 from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were initially weak, but then stabilized. The general trend was still hovering around $1,250, and the result was similar to the previous close. Yesterday, Hong Kong dollar exchange rates traded frequently between $1,220 and $1,230. Indian rupees were between $1,470 and $1,490, and British pounds were around $1,930,000, but there were transactions only in name.

### British-Owned Yarn Factories Granted Permission to Order Foreign Cotton

[Our Report] The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the British-owned yarn factory, Lanchang Company, Mr. Brown, and the General Manager of Ewo Yarns, Mr. Loper, visited Mr. Liu Wenteng, the Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, yesterday to discuss issues such as purchasing foreign cotton and how to adapt to the current textile control policies. Mr. Brown and Mr. Loper stated that they were happy to fulfill all the obligations of Chinese yarn factories. As for the foreign cotton they needed, they requested permission to order imports. Mr. Liu responded with two points: (1) It is hoped that British-owned yarn factories will join the Six-District Cotton Textile Association so that they can enjoy the same rights and obligations as the member yarn factories in China. (2) If the two British-owned yarn factories are willing to report their production volume to the association from January 1 of this year, and the government purchases half of it, then they can enjoy the right to apply for foreign cotton. They can directly contact the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee.

### Brewing Price Increases for Oil Allocation; Raw Material Prices Rise, Increasing Production Costs; Factories Will Shut Down for the New Year and Workers Will Take Their Usual Holiday

[Our Report] According to news from the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office: The office is advancing the allocation of oil that was originally scheduled for the days before the Lunar New Year to be completed before the 15th of this month due to the approaching Lunar New Year. However, recently, out of the seven private oil pressing factories that originally participated in the joint allocation, only Dadexin, Dayouyu, and Dachangxin are still participating due to factory shutdowns and restructuring. Therefore, the originally planned allocation of 500 piculs per day has been reduced to only 300 piculs. To make up for the shortfall, Mr. Zhang Chao, the chairman of the office, visited Mayor Wu some days ago and proposed that state-owned factories make up for the shortfall. Mayor Wu agreed in principle. Yesterday, Chief Ji of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau consulted with Mayor Wu and then reached an agreement with the China Vegetable Oil Factory to allocate an additional 1,300 piculs of oil to make up for the shortfall. It is reported that retail stores that received an oil allocation amount on the 15th but have not yet received the allocated oil in kind will be directly notified by the China Vegetable Oil Factory to receive their allocation within days.

Furthermore, according to a person in charge of the Shanghai Oil Pressing Industry Association, the price of raw materials for oil pressing has been rising faster than the price of edible oil recently. The current negotiated price for edible oil is still based on the price implemented at the end of November last year. At that time, soybeans were $27,000 per picul, but the market price of soybeans has recently risen to $40,000. In addition, labor costs have also increased by 50%. Besides, when adding transportation costs, interest, and taxes, the cost price of soybean oil is close to $190,000 per tank. The association is currently calculating production costs in order to apply to the authorities to adjust the negotiated price based on the facts. It is said that the price of oil in Yuanshan and other places has also reached $180,000. Therefore, if this city maintains the old price, the oil allocated to this city will likely flow to other places. The number of oil allocations from each factory will still be maintained at 500 piculs per day, and this number will be allocated until the 18th of this month. During the Lunar New Year, the oil pressing workers in each factory will, as usual, return to their hometowns for ten to fifteen days, so each factory may have a short-term shutdown.

### Import Goods Under US$500 Exempt from Import Permits; Prohibited Goods Still Banned; Revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade Implemented

All goods carried in the luggage of incoming passengers, except for those prohibited from import as listed in Appendix (4) of the measures, are temporarily allowed to be imported without an import permit, which has been handled accordingly. It has been learned from the Jiang Customs that the Supreme Commander, in accordance with the objects subject to duty in passengers' luggage drafted by the Executive Committee of the Temporary Management Committee for Turn-Over, which belong to the items listed in Appendices (2) and (3) (A) and (B) of the measures, whose total value does not exceed US$500, or its equivalent value, do not require an import permit, but for passengers coming from Hong Kong and Macau, the limit is HK$200. Passengers coming from foreign countries via Hong Kong can bring goods subject to duty, and the standard for duty-free is also a total value not exceeding US$500, or its equivalent value, which will be implemented one month after the order is received. The items listed in Appendix (4) should be prohibited from import and will still be handled according to the regulations. It is learned that after receiving the order, the customs will implement it from January 30.

### Raw Materials Rise in Unison; Insurance Powder Price Surge Intensifies

In the raw material market, as traders have all settled their year-end accounts, the market price of raw materials has been rising uniformly in recent days. Users, expecting even greater increases after the Lunar New Year, are vying to buy in before the end of the year. Insurance powder has already exceeded $500,000 per package. Bleaching powder, the market price for American goods yesterday, has reached between $6,200,000 and $6,300,000 per barrel. The market price for bleaching powder was over $7,000,000 in January of last year, but after a large amount of goods arrived, the price fell to between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000 per case, and now it has recovered to the price at that time last year.

### A Collection of News on Woolen Fabrics

(1) The woolen fabric industry and the Western clothing industry, in view of the pressure of high-interest loans, are experiencing a large number of account disputes and bankruptcies, and they are wary of each other. Various taxes are heavy, and public and private expenses are huge. The cost of capital is high, and the profit is meager. Stocks have been decreasing year by year, and they all feel that they are in a dilemma.

(2) The import trading firms of woolen fabrics, previously faced with difficulties in government allocation of foreign exchange and the difficulty of applying for import permits, and later suffered from the strike of the woolen fabric manufacturers in this city, who reported to the government to ban the import of woolen fabrics, cannot place orders in the short term, and most of them are full of hidden worries.

(3) A field survey of various stores in the woolen fabric industry shows that, except for large-scale, large-capital families who have close contacts with factories and special power relations who remain silent, all other stores and shops, as well as the Western clothing industry, are opposed to the ban on woolen fabric imports. The reasons are that the production colors are not complete, the factories seek profits, the allocation is uneven, and the market prices will inevitably rise sharply. Non-insiders and ordinary stores must be indirectly controlled by large wholesalers, so many businesses will inevitably be unable to operate.

### Shortage of Hardware in Guannei; Abundant Supply from Northeast

There is a great lack of hardware and equipment in Guannei, so the Northeast has been exporting a very large amount of hardware to Guannei recently.

Other items such as nickel ingots, black pliers, welding rods, wire nails, carbolic acid, caustic soda, mica coal, white ceramic tiles, and washbasins have also been exported in considerable quantities. Among them, there was a request to export 18,000 willow trees, but it was not approved because the Northeast needed them greatly.

### Rice Market Sales Slack; Flour Stagnant, Edible Oil Active

A total of 4,500 to 4,600 piculs of rice arrived in the city from north and south. Although the supply was scarce, due to tight financing, sales remained sluggish. Early in the morning, the price of japonica rice in the north market was firm, but it weakened in the afternoon. The south market tended to soften. As a result, both markets became weak. There was little supply and demand for indica rice, and there was no rise or fall. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice had brisk sales and rose by one to two thousand dollars. Local oil factories continued to purchase Northeast soybeans and Yangtze River soybeans, and the prices rose by three to five hundred dollars. However, Doudou remained mediocre. High-quality Teodou was continuously procured in Nanyang, and the market remained firm. The price of adzuki beans remained unchanged, and there was little change in cowpeas. The sales of sesame seeds were not smooth, and the market softened. There was demand for shelled peanuts as the Lunar New Year approached, and local merchants purchased them from each other. Actual sales were quite strong, and the price rose by two to three thousand dollars. Trade in soybean cakes and pomace oil was sluggish, with a nominal firm price and a hidden decline. Flour was weak and declined, and foreign flour and domestic flour both fell by five to six hundred dollars. Miscellaneous flour was also quite stagnant. The oil market was slightly mixed. Sales of unrefined oil in barrels were brisk, and the price rose by one to two thousand dollars. Unrefined oil in baskets was mediocre. Refined oil was similar, but sesame oil from small carts remained brisk and continued to rise by three to five thousand dollars, reaching a new high price. At the close of the market, vegetable oil factories sold a lot of unrefined sesame oil and refined oil, and the situation was stable.

Jiaotong University Girls Encountered a Powerful Enemy for the First Time

In the first match, Jiaotong University's women's team played against the Green Team. The referee was Zhang Jianbing. The veteran players of the Green Team, Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, and Liu Zhenbao, all played. The female generals of Jiaotong University seemed flustered when they encountered a powerful enemy for the first time. Liu Zhenbao of the Green Team scored with a free throw, opening the record. Huang Mingyuan then put in two goals under the basket. Zhenbao and Shujian scored continuously. Zhang Miao and Wang Zujun of Jiaotong University took two long shots, but both fell out of bounds due to insufficient strength. In the first quarter, the Green Team had eleven points, and Jiaotong University had zero.

However, Huang Mingyuan and Wang Weizhen of the Green Team became even more rampant. Wang Zujun of Jiaotong University scored a free throw. At the end of the third quarter, the Green Team had an absolute advantage with 38 to 4. In the last quarter, the female generals of Jiaotong University tried their best to fight, and the battle was extremely exciting. The Green Team's score dropped sharply. As a result, the Green Team won a great victory with 42 to 6.

Jiaotong University Fought Hard and Once Headed

In the final match, the men of Jiaotong University met the veterans of Hualian. The referee was still Zhang Jianbing. Ni Ziqi, the captain of Jiaotong University, made a free throw first, opening the record. Wu Chengzhang returned the respect with one point. Yang Xiehe of Jiaotong University was small and specialized in attacking from the bottom, and he succeeded. They led 3 to 1. Chen Xuechong put the ball in, and Zhuo Guorong made a free throw. Jiaotong University's offensive was also fierce. Yuan Peiyuan sent the ball in with one hand, and they tied at 5. Shen Yang and others suddenly became active and scored two goals, making it 13 to 9. Jiaotong University headed for the first time. Hualian counterattacked, leading 19 to 15 in the first quarter. At the beginning of the second quarter, the two sides were in a tug-of-war, each with their own gains. In the first half, Hualian led by 33 to 29, leading by two and a half goals.

Hualian Veterans Finally Won a Great Victory

After the break, Hualian's lineup changed greatly. Li Zhenzhong entered the arena, strengthening both offense and defense. Jiaotong University had no power to fight back. As a result, Hualian won 51 to 30. In the last quarter, the veterans felt that the overall situation was set and did not need to score, so they attacked less and defended more. The young generals of Jiaotong University did not give up the opportunity. Shen Beizhang and Yuan Peiyuan made many contributions. When the time was up, Jiaotong University was defeated by Hualian with 44 to 60.

### Using Fresh and Clean Blood Transfusion to Forge a New Jiangsu

— Zhenjiang, 2nd Quick Dispatch. Our Reporter, Kou Xianglin

Jiangsu is like a patient recovering from a long illness. It not only needs active treatment and surgery but also needs post-operative recuperation. The Communist army in northern Jiangsu is fiercely burning the torches of cruelty, starting to expand the so-called "liberated areas." For several months, our people in northern Jiangsu have been unanimously demanding to return home actively and to reorganize the tens of thousands of acres of fertile farmland that had been destroyed by the Communist army. After the National Army began a defensive counterattack, the Communist army could not withstand a single blow. Gao Bao and Huai Gong along the canal line were abandoned, and important strongholds along the Tongyu line were abandoned. Lian Gao also fell into internal strife and was abandoned. It was like the withering of leaves in winter. At this point, the clear prospect of the situation in northern Jiangsu has shone before our eyes.

Provincial Cadre Training Corps Establishes Training Class for Transferred Military Officers

The Jiangsu Provincial Cadre Training Corps, in order to seize this prospect and await the arrival of reality, established a training class for transferred military officers on December 1, under the four major principles and objective requirements of establishing a new era, a new Jiangsu, new cadres, and new tasks. About 815 people selected from the 17th Officer Corps of Wuxi, 83 people from the Provincial Security Command, and 37 officers and men from the corps' excess personnel participated in the training, totaling 935 people. This group, survivors of eight years of bloody resistance against the Japanese, stepped into the Provincial Cadre Training Corps without hesitation to receive transfer training, hoping to unite the three million Jiangsu compatriots to restore and build a glorious new Jiangsu.

Days passed, ten days, twenty days. Zhenjiang society was still as calm as a stagnant pool. On the road, one occasionally saw two or three polite figures wearing soldiers' uniforms, some even wearing glasses, hurriedly stepping into bookstores or department stores to select and buy what they needed, and then hurriedly walking back. Talkative shop assistants began to discuss, "I think these must be the transferred military officers we welcomed last time." "How do you know?" "I think your eyes are simply not working. They are wearing soldiers' uniforms, but are ordinary soldiers this neat? They are polite and very courteous. I can tell at a glance that they are officers." "If they are officers, why are they wearing soldiers' uniforms and not wearing collar insignia?" "You are really stupid, they are receiving training; they are students." This was the only ripple. The people of Zhenjiang seemed to have long forgotten the existence of the transferred military officers.

On the afternoon of December 24, every newspaper office and Jinghu reporter stationed in Zhenjiang received an invitation from the Provincial Cadre Training Corps, stating that the transferred military officers of the corps, in order to express their gratitude for the warm welcome and generous assistance from all walks of life in the provincial capital, had specially arranged a tea party on the 26th.

That afternoon, with drizzling rain, the reporters took the welcoming car straight to the 35th Standard outside the East Gate. A red silk soft plaque was hung at the entrance of the training center, with beautifully written artistic characters "Welcome Leaders from All Walks of Life and the Press in the Provincial Capital to Visit and Guide the Corps." The walls were covered with brightly colored welcome slogans. The car stopped in front of the auditorium. More than a dozen transferred military officers wearing red silk sashes raised their hands as if welcoming distinguished guests, leading the reporters to their Zhongshan Room. The room was decorated exceptionally neatly. Three rows of tables were arranged in a long, slender "mountain" shape, with the stage forming the base of the mountain character. The red, blue, and white tablecloth was matched with simple and elegant potted flowers. In front of each seat was a paper bag containing tea and snacks, and inside the bag was a small leaflet wrapped around four Morris cigarettes. The leaflet contained a concise and enthusiastic welcome speech. Can you say that the officers are unrefined? They are so attentive. At 2:15, all the guests arrived, more than a hundred people in suits, military uniforms, Zhongshan suits, and long robes, truly representing "soldiers and civilians."

Defenders of the Nation Will Become Pillars of the Country

The tea party began without any ceremony. A young officer, Cao Ziqiang, served as temporary chairman, delivering a clear and enthusiastic welcome speech, and expressing their wishes: "We must inherit the spirit of resistance against Japan, build a new Jiangsu, and complete the great task of nation-building." Although he didn't use obscure language or quote classical texts, his attitude was as elegant as a scholar. Next, the Director of Education, Xu Wentian, gave a speech, reporting on the preparation and training process of the transfer training. He promised that this group of transferred military officers would not disappoint the government and the people, "In times of war, they are the defenders of the nation; in times of peace, they must be the pillars of the country."

Continuing were the representatives of the transferred military officers, Zuo Zhiren and Sun Zhejun, who began to report. They told everyone from their own perspectives: "How has the government treated us unfairly? Shedding blood and sweat to fight for national survival is the sacred mission of Chinese men. There must be demobilization after mobilization. After the reorganization of the troops, the government organized officer corps for us, still paying salaries, and established training institutions to teach us transfer skills. We can only be grateful and excited." "We hope that society will give us more help and encouragement." Next were speeches from the guests. Finally, the reporters also especially liked to speak, "During the war, we met on the battlefield; in the future, we will walk together on the road of nation-building." After the tea and snacks were eaten, dusk gradually enveloped the earth. In the drizzling rain, we still took the original car back to our respective nests.

The 35th Standard: Incubating New Cadres

The 35th Standard is a sacred place worth remembering. There, cadres who will be sent to various counties in Jiangsu to build the cradle of a new Jiangsu are being incubated. On the day of departure, the reporter made a very detailed visit and interview, and I hereby report as follows:

Stepping through the gate is a large parade ground with sports equipment such as basketball. More than twenty white-walled thatched houses are built around it. Walking south out of the large walled circle, there is another earthen enclosure, also with more than a dozen white-walled thatched houses. This group of demobilized military officers is active within these two walled circles.

This group is divided into ten classes: civil affairs, finance, construction, society, land and food, accounting, health, land administration, security, and air defense. Except for education, almost every department of the provincial and county administrative departments has a class. The largest class is the security class, with 251 people, and the smallest is the health administration class, with only about 20 people. The various subjects are too complex to calculate, from public opinion organizations to banning opium and drugs, from national finance to bacterial disinfection, from river and sea engineering to horticulture... it is almost a compilation of social sciences and natural sciences. All the lecturers are mostly heads of departments and bureaus of the provincial government or famous scholars from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places.

A Simple Timetable Shows a Tense Life

Here is their daily timetable: get up at 6:00 a.m., assemble at 6:30 a.m. for flag-raising, morning exercises, and a 20-minute motivational speech, breakfast at 7:10 a.m., from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., four regular classes, each lasting 50 minutes, with only 10 minutes of rest between classes, lunch at 12:10 p.m., from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., three regular classes, from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., extracurricular activities, or small group discussions and other standardized activities, dinner at 6:10 p.m., from 6:30 p.m. to 8:20 p.m., self-study, and then go to bed at 9:00 p.m., that is to say, from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., they are living a tense life every moment.

Can they handle such a tense life? The answer is definitely yes. Not only can they handle it, but they are still finding things to do even during the ten or twenty minutes of rest. As long as it doesn't rain or snow, as soon as class is over, basketball, football, and badminton will never stop for a moment. The recreation and cultural groups in the Zhongshan Room are their happy gardens. The ping-pong ball is hit halfway, and the class bell rings, so they put down their rackets, "Two, three, remember to come back after class," chess pieces are moved a few times, and they rush to class, he greets the administrator, "Comrade, please don't mess up the chess pieces, we'll be back after class," more than twenty newspapers are often surrounded by dozens of people watching.

"Pihuang" is the most popular entertainment. A Peking opera instructor is often pulled to the point of exhaustion, but he has a solution. He adopts Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "little teacher system." Self-study class is relatively free. In the evening, the gongs and drums of the Peking opera troupe in the Zhongshan Room are beating loudly. The jinghu and sanxian rarely stop. "Pull for me to sing, Xipi Daoban," Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou, all types are available. They line up to sing.

Ideological and Political Work Does Not Allow a Moment of Rest

The ideological and political instructors are very good at planning. They are like monkeys in a stable, unwilling to let anyone have a moment of rest. Their idea is "If tension is not enough, it is relaxation." They divide one month into four central training weeks. The first week is the organization week. In addition to dividing classes and forming teams, they also organize various ball teams, reading rooms, music and drama groups, and various competition units. Moreover, they also help the transferred military officers form alumni associations. These items are all successful activities carried out in their spare time. The second week is the practice week. All organizations are stepping up their activities according to plan. The third week is the competition week. Complex competition scenes unfold. After the flag-raising on Monday, the tug-of-war competition begins. Each group of twenty people hangs red and yellow sash belts, and the battle lines are clear. With a sound of the silver horn, the two sides fight each other. Cheerleaders cheer from the side, "Use your strength! Huh! Ha! Use your strength, Hang Yo!" One minute, two minutes, neither side gives in. The competitors pull until their faces are red and their ears are red, and the cheerleaders shout until they are exhausted. Suddenly, a gentleman shouted from the crowd, "Kill!" Immediately, people's faces became serious and their muscles tensed up: "Kill!" "Kill!" The sound shook the sky, and fire flashed in their eyes, madly shouting "Kill!" They tasted the life of killing enemies in those years. "Classmates: this is tug-of-war, this is not a battlefield, why are you shouting kill?" "Yes, this is not a battlefield," "Haha! It's really feverish." A burst of laughter, people returned to rationality, and the competitors laughed until they bent over. The silver horn rang again, deciding the outcome of the first match. For a whole week, people were busy competing in a round-robin basketball competition. The fourth company often won, because there were two old players on their team, Wen Yun was the basketball representative of Liling District in Hunan, and Zhang Hongjun was a first-class athlete in the Jiangsu Provincial Games, who had both been on big stages and shown their skills. They felt that the internal competition was not enough, so they wrote to the Jiangsu Medical and Political College to challenge them, but the reply said that they were too busy with their studies and would learn from them another day. The ping-pong match was a fierce battle for a week. In the end, Zhuang Yan and Sun Tongxue won first place. His strategy was a "patience" character, accepting adversity and not challenging, deeply understanding the essence of using softness to overcome strength.

Small Group Discussions: Records are More Than a Foot Thick

Small group discussions were also held twice. Because there were not enough houses and instructors to allocate, they were divided into 36 small groups to discuss the topic of "Common Sense and Specialized Skills." One student said, "Our country's officialdom has always only paid attention to generalists and neglected specialists. Real water conservancy experts and architects are regarded as subordinates and treated as minor officials. This trend has not ended yet. For example, the Huai River Guidance Committee, the Yellow River Conservancy Committee... I think..." "Chairman, I have some opinions, to supplement, European and American countries rely on their science and precise division of labor, they live better than us. In the war, we recognized the advantages of others, but our administrative staff are still handling affairs with common sense. If this continues, we will only fall further behind. We must understand science and value specialized skills in order to avoid the weaknesses of a government without intelligence and laws that cannot be relied upon." "I think European and American countries are progressing, the whole world is progressing, whether we like it or not, China must also progress to become scientific and specialized, otherwise, we will be led by the nose, and end up like India, which would be terrible. I think administrative staff should have abundant common sense, and especially specialized skills." "Yes, the world is progressing and becoming specialized, and China must also be like this. If we cannot progress and cannot specialize, then we will fall behind"... This is a very small part of one of the 36 groups. The records of all the small group discussions are more than a foot thick.

Every Saturday night, there is a get-together held in the auditorium. This group of transferred military officers has everything prepared, it can be the sonorous and passionate Shandong drum, or the soft and charming Suzhou ballad, swords, spears, knives, halberds, boxing skills and wrestling, violin, harmonica, English songs, everything is available. The most popular is Peking opera. The corps is equipped with gongs, drums, and other stage equipment. As long as they borrow a set of costumes, they can perform various operas. They like to put "Bie Ji" and "Zhaojun" together. They sympathize with the suffering Wang Baochuan, but it doesn't matter, people will always come back. Several female leads in the Grand Theatre have been hired twice, but drama cannot be performed because the time is too short and the curriculum is tight, so there is no time to rehearse. Every Saturday, people enter the auditorium with the joy of children celebrating the New Year, and happily spend two to four hours. A month of intensive training ended on December 28. Now, they are busy with distribution for practice. The distribution areas and work departments are mostly based on each person's ability and aspirations. The provincial government's departments, bureaus, and county-level institutions north and south of the Yangtze River will add this group of fresh and clean blood. They are shouting: "We must inherit the spirit of resistance against Japan, build a new Jiangsu, and complete the great task of nation-building."

### Exploration of the Huainan Railway

— Wuhu, 5th Dispatch. Our Special Correspondent, Kang Feng

In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Huainan Railway, which connects the Huai River and the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, with more than 200 kilometers of plains, designed a plan in the Nanjing National Government's Construction Committee. After six years of surveying, construction, and laying tracks, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, a locomotive puffing black smoke dragged trains began to run on the Jianghuai Plain, transporting rice, grains, livestock, cotton, cloth, general merchandise, and passengers. The capital of this railway was 6 million yuan. The starting point was Yuxikou Station, across the river from Wuhu on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the terminal was Tianjia'an Station on the south bank of the Huai River. This railway was named Huainan. The fertile Chaohu Lake and rice granary area between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, as well as the grain area in the Huai River Basin, all benefited from the completion of this railway, which resulted in lower export costs. This allowed the economic foundation of 40,000 square kilometers between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers to be consolidated and improved.

In just over a year, this railway was automatically destroyed in the winter of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China because it became a battlefield for the war against Japan. The bitterness of the initial retreat and destruction can still be vividly described by several veterans of the Huainan Railway, such as Hu Weizhong and Deputy Director Ning Shufan, but these have all become permanent relics. When Director Wu Jingqing led several receiving committee members, including Hu Weizhong, to receive the railway in the winter of the thirty-fourth year, the railway, which had not been seen for eight years, had changed its route, except for the Jiulonggang Railway Bureau, which still maintained its original appearance.

Became the Tianbang Branch Line

After the Japanese occupied the Huainan Railway, because the initial motivation for building this railway was to smoothly transport coal from the Datong and Huainan coal mines, and these two coal mines did not have time to be completely destroyed, and the Japanese needed coal, they decided to use the railway as a special coal transportation line. Originally, the route from Tianjia'an to Yuxikou could transport coal to the Yangtze River port and then transfer it upstream to Anqing, Jiujiang, and even Wuhan, but the smooth transportation of abundant grain between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers was also the main factor in building the road. The Japanese prioritized military affairs. Since the production and import of gasoline could not meet the needs of naval vessels, and the number of Japanese transportation and coal-fired ships on the Yangtze River was increasing, the need for Huainan coal became an important stronghold in the Japanese military and industrial mines. Therefore, rather than exposing the route to the 200-kilometer Jianghuai Plain controlled by Chinese guerrillas, it was better to turn northeast at Shuijiahu Station, parallel to the Huai River, and head towards Bengbu, an important station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The Japanese did what they said. The 88-kilometer Tianbang branch line from Tianjia'an via Shuijiahu to Bengbu became the new Huainan under Japanese control. Its role was to continuously transport coal every day, with rolling black trains going to supply Japanese warships to bombard the Yangtze River basin and the unyielding countryside that the Japanese wanted to destroy.

New Look of Huainan

When Director Wu Jingqing came to receive this only 88-kilometer railway, only 28 kilometers from Tianjia'an to Shuijiahu were passable. Deputy Director Ning Shufan said that he could laugh at himself, a complete Huainan Railway Bureau agency had only 28 kilometers of railway to manage. In five months this year, this group of transportation cadres tried every means to repair the 60 kilometers from Shuijiahu to Bengbu. On June 1, this section of the roadbed, which had been built and then destroyed by the Japanese, was relaid with rails and trains began to run. From then on, two mixed passenger and freight trains and two coal trains departed from Tianjia'an to Bengbu every day. Similarly, two mixed passenger and freight trains came from Bengbu. Two empty coal trains also hurried to load coal and leave.

I saw the current appearance of the Huainan Railway again at Shuijiahu Station. This station only has one side platform. The station building is a low wooden house built by the Japanese. I saw Stationmaster Huang Chongren holding red and green flags standing on the platform to assist in directing. A mixed passenger and freight train from Tianjia'an to Bengbu entered the station. I counted from beginning to end, one second-class passenger car, one third-class passenger car, twelve 15-ton iron-sheet carriages, inside were fourth-class passengers and chickens, ducks, tobacco, cotton, miscellaneous grains, and other commercial goods, and finally twelve 30-ton open carriages loaded with coal, a heavy train of twenty-six carriages!

After more than ten minutes of passengers and goods getting off and on the train, I saw this train roaring and heading to Bengbu. This is a sign of good times. Although many people were drowned and many houses were washed away in the Huai River Basin this year, this 88-kilometer "iron-made Huai River" parallel to the Huai River is smoothly transporting a batch of good people on the Huai River who are seeking a way to survive! The Huainan Railway currently has 15 locomotives and more than 200 passenger, freight, and coal cars. Eight locomotives are running on the railway every day. The mixed passenger and freight train I saw at Shuijiahu Station had a total of twenty-six carriages. The total number of carriages transporting coal, goods, and passengers on the railway every day is more than 150. Calculated in this way, the utilization rate of transportation equipment on the Huainan Railway is superficially about 60%.

In fact, those locomotives and carriages that have not been running are basically faulty, so the Huainan Railway Locomotive Factory has an endless amount of work to do. Moreover, the trains running on the road need to be checked and repaired after a certain period of time.

This locomotive factory is located in Jiulonggang, where the Railway Bureau is located, opposite Jiulonggang Station across the railway tracks. Factory Director Liu Xinmin and Director of the Locomotive Department of the Railway Bureau, Lu Fengshan, have both worked in many other railway locomotive factories. Entering the factory, one is fascinated by the sight of the belts turning the lathes and the sound of workers hammering steel.

Deputy Director Ning Shufan led me to look at each part in detail, but a person who has not spent a lot of time and energy on mechanical work cannot absorb and remember these colorful images all at once. However, after this visit and inquiry, I came to understand some common sense about locomotives. For example, a complete locomotive is divided into two parts: the boiler and the coal-water car. In the locomotive factory, the firebox plate of the boiler of a locomotive was too thin due to long-term use and had decayed. This locomotive was driven back to patch the firebox plate to prevent the boiler from exploding and causing the train to stop on the road, blocking the continuous traffic. The Locomotive Department has mechanics at each station on the entire line to check the locomotive and passenger and freight car parts at any time. A careful passenger will find some workers covered in oil stains when the train they are riding enters and exits the station, bending down to look under the car as if looking for something important. Those are the people from the Locomotive Department checking the wheel axles for the safety of passengers and traffic.

The locomotive's coal car water tank can be filled with ten tons of water, which can only supply the consumption of 80 kilometers of driving. After driving 80 kilometers, it is necessary to stop at a station with a water tower to add water in order to continue driving.

The reason why train traffic can avoid accidents is absolutely related to the Railway Bureau's strict implementation of the train inspection and repair system. The phenomenon of automobile traffic breakdowns is so common because there is no strict inspection and repair system implemented in automobile traffic administration. Although the Huainan Railway is currently an inland short-distance coal transportation line, it has never had an accident since it was opened to traffic, and the trains are absolutely on time. This has fully demonstrated the business spirit of a modern enterprise: Jiunenggang Locomotive Factory and the Locomotive Department's mobilization are the main reason for it!

The Jiulong Machinery Factory was a pile of scrap iron and garbage when it was taken over. The factory shed was an empty frame. First, the roof was repaired, and then the factory floor was paved with cement and the empty slots for repairing cars were repaired. The factory floor was repaired, and in April of this year, passenger and freight cars could be repaired and some minor work could be done. In October, locomotives could be brought into the factory for major repairs, but it still lacks the most important piece of machinery and equipment, which is the 50-ton crane. The Huainan Railway Bureau hopes that the General Administration can allocate a large crane for their use, otherwise, when they repair the wheel axle part of a locomotive, lifting the boiler and the frame will take too long because it is done by manpower. In terms of work efficiency, it is neither compatible nor economical.

The waste materials left by the Japanese have been used and transformed by the machinery factory into six passenger cars and twenty freight cars. It is a poor country's poor method. You would never think that this is the masterpiece of the machinery factory workers when you sit in a passenger car made of waste materials. I saw with my own eyes the technicians spraying paint on a passenger car, and another new car was completed.

There is a one-ton capacity iron melting furnace in the sand casting room, and preparations are still being made to build a three-ton furnace. Parts of the locomotive are cast here for use. The train aspect has entered the era of pure domestic goods, and there is no need to rely on others like steel rails and bridges.

### The Prospect of New Huainan

The Huainan Railway itself is not content with just transporting coal on the 88-kilometer Tianbu line to illuminate Nanjing, Wuxi, and warm Shanghai. The Huainan Railway is capable and has extra capacity, desiring to contribute to the overall economy of the Jianghuai region!

The restoration of the old Huainan railway line, from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou, a distance of 210 kilometers, is the most immediate dream of the Huainan Railway's first step. Every Huainan Railway employee is thinking about the day when the train on this railway can speed to Hefei, to Chaoxian, and finally stop at Yuxikou on the rolling Yangtze River. That will be when the Huainan Railway can fully display its strengths!

The Huainan Railway Public Works Department is working on restoring the old track. The head of the department, Mr. Li Jingshu from Jiangxi, has experienced the difficult mountain crossing and valley spanning projects when building the Qian-Gui Railway. Restoring the Huainan Railway is something that can be done with eyes closed. Therefore, Mr. Li has no worries about the restoration project and only hopes that the materials needed for the restoration will be allocated as soon as possible.

As early as half a year ago, the bridge piers of the four railway bridges along the Huainan Railway line had already been built with steel-reinforced concrete. The longest Zhegao River railway bridge by Chaohu Lake, 110 meters long with 19 piers, was also built early on. The Ministry of Transportation has also agreed to allocate 8.1 billion yuan in construction funds, of which approximately 500 million yuan is needed to rebuild the Yuxikou wharf. The first project to commence is this wharf because, as soon as the leftover materials from the US military, including railway tracks and bridge materials, arrive, Yuxikou will immediately need the wharf to unload these materials brought by large ships.

Mr. Li Jingshu described the upcoming Huainan Railway restoration project:

"We plan to start construction in three locations as soon as the materials arrive. Materials will be transported from Shanghai via the Jinpu Railway to Shuijiahu Station on the Huainan Railway to be laid towards Hefei. Materials will also be transported from Shanghai via the Yangtze River to Yuxikou, across from Wuhu, to be laid towards Guoxian. Furthermore, materials will be transported by small wooden boats from Yuxikou to support Guoxian. Working simultaneously from these three points, we plan to lay five kilometers of railway per day at each point, totaling fifteen kilometers. Thus, the entire 210 kilometers can be connected in just fifteen days. Of course, the time spent erecting the four railway bridges will take longer, and transporting materials to the construction sites will take even longer. Our plan is to guarantee complete operation within six months of receiving the materials."

The second dream of the Huainan Railway is to have the Huainan Railway branch off at Shenjiaxiang Station, seven kilometers from Yuxikou, and run south to reach Erba, directly across from Wuhu. From Shenjiaxiang to Yuxikou is only seven kilometers, but to Erba is eighteen kilometers. Why will the future Huainan terminus be changed to Erba? Readers must note that the water distance from Yuxikou to Wuhu, across the Yangtze River, is approximately fifteen kilometers, while Erba is directly across from Wuhu on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, only two kilometers apart, just like Pukou directly across the Yangtze River from Xiaguan in Nanjing.

Because this 18-kilometer rerouting project from Shenjiaxiang to Erba runs almost parallel to the Yangtze River current, the roadbed height must exceed the Yangtze River water level during the 1931 flood by more than six meters to ensure traffic during high water. Now, the survey of this future new line has been completed. The terrain in the 18-kilometer area along the entire line is above the high water level of 1931. Therefore, the roadbed filling project will only need to be raised by five meters. However, the filling project and the construction of a large bridge (12 meters high, 180 meters wide) across the Cao Yun River on this new section of road are quite large. It is estimated that the cost of this short new road will not be small, but the transportation system often considers permanent benefits and is willing to spend a huge amount of money at one time, so the construction of this new section is inevitable.

After the Erba new line is completed, the direct distance from Erba to Wuhu across the Yangtze River is 1.3 kilometers, and the diagonal waterway is 2.1 kilometers. Landing on the Wuhu riverside at a point above the Wuhu Chajishan Hospital, and then building a two-kilometer branch line from the landing point to connect with the Jiangnan Railway's Wuhu riverside station, the joint transportation of Huainan, Jiangnan, and Jinpu can be connected without hindrance. The beautiful scene of the Chengping ferry transporting passengers and the Changjiang ferry transporting trains between Nanjing and Pukou can also be reenacted in Erba, Wuhu.

Ning Shufan said that after the Huainan Railway is restored, it will certainly have extra capacity to contribute more to Anhui's transportation. For example, the buses currently running on the Huainan Railway roadbeds from Shuijiahu to Hefei, and from Hefei to Yuxikou, can be rerouted to the Hefei-Luan line, so that the tea from the tea gardens in the Dabie Mountains of western Anhui can be sold more conveniently. Buses can also run from Tianjia'an to Shouxian. Small boats can still run from Tianjia'an along the Huai River to Fengtai, Zhengyangguan, so that the Huai River basin's grains can be transported via the Huainan Railway to Wuhu or Bengbu Pukou for export.

At that time, the Huainan Railway can truly exert its great power to transport goods between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, like an iron horse full of energy, running non-stop for the economic improvement of the Jianghuai Plain!

### Footprints in Vietnam

— January 1st Dispatch from Hanoi, by Jiesun

Recently, the Khmer Revolutionary Party killed several French missionaries. As a result, when the French army entered Battambang, several monks in the temples were "lottery winners," as a reprisal, their corpses lay scattered, stained with blood. Everywhere on the walls were slogans written by Khmer revolutionaries in Chinese, Khmer, Siamese, English, and French: "Armies of invaders are not welcome," "Imperialists are the public enemies of small nations," a contrasting comparison with the truth.

The number of overseas Chinese in the Four Provinces reaches 200,000, with Battambang accounting for almost half. Two-thirds have already moved into Siam territory. In addition to real estate, important properties have also been moved into Siamese territory. Those who remain there are often robbed and killed. The French side has repeatedly stated that they are fully responsible for protection, but they have not taken any effective measures. Our consulate general in Saigon sent Deputy Consul Xu to Battambang to negotiate with the French side, but after the negotiation, there was no follow-up.

At night, residents hide in their homes, afraid to take a single step or leave. French soldiers also huddle in their camps, afraid to go out. The sparse sound of mallets, along with the distant barking of dogs, makes one feel as if they are in a desolate village, further increasing the terror and desolation.

Land transportation from the Four Provinces to Sogou and Saigon has been completely cut off. After attending the handover ceremony, I visited General Dai Zhongji, a trusted aide to the French government representative in the Four Provinces. With his various assistance, I was able to leave Battambang and stay in Phnom Penh on a French military plane.

Phnom Penh is the capital of Cambodia. That day was the birthday of Cambodian King Sihanouk. French dignitaries from Saigon and our Consul General in Saigon, Yi Fengzao, and others came to offer their congratulations. The scene was grand and extraordinarily lively. It was a scene of peace and prosperity. However, the suburbs are full of forts, and people are panicking. Many wealthy overseas Chinese businessmen have already moved to Saigon.

Under the Cambodian King, there are prime ministers and ministers of all kinds. It can truly be said that although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. At a reception, I was able to have a conversation with the Cambodian King. When I mentioned the current situation of French-Vietnamese relations and Ho Chi Minh's role in Vietnam's struggle for independence, he did not say a word. He only praised the generous treatment he received from France when he was in Paris. He also emphasized that the recovery of the Four Provinces was entirely the result of France accepting his request. The French directorial technique can be said to be quite clever, and Sihanouk's performance is also quite realistic.

In Saigon City and on the Mekong River

After the grand ceremony ended, the guests dispersed, and I left Phnom Penh. The highway from Phnom Penh to Saigon is still passable. However, the Vietnamese people's will to resist the French is very firm. They often abandon their fields and carry their wives and children deep into the interior, and then fight with their lives. Along the highway and in places that the French can reach, nine out of ten houses are empty. No signs of life for miles. Overturned vehicles are everywhere. French soldiers ambushed and killed are often heard of. In the suburbs of Saigon, many houses have also become scorched earth. This highway line belongs to the territory of Kien Giang Province. In the cities of Fengtian, Ruling, Fengho, and Jinggong in the province, during the early days of Japan's surrender, they were burned, killed, and plundered by British-Indian troops, followed by battles between French and Vietnamese troops. Tens of thousands of overseas Chinese are still displaced and struggling, living in uncertainty. Everyone is in danger, and the situation is extremely miserable.

Within half a year, I have been to Saigon three times. Although it is still wearing the cloak of a commercial port, in fact, it is like a large military camp. In the Mekong River, gunboats, transport ships, and aircraft carriers cover the harbor. In the urban area, military vehicles come and go, one after another. Tanks and armored vehicles often appear for demonstrations. Airplanes also circle in the air from time to time. French soldiers rampage, appearing to see themselves as conquerors. The Saigon urban area is vast, and the commercial area is most developed in Dike, six miles away. With 200,000 overseas Chinese, Dike is a purely overseas Chinese commercial district. However, with harsh regulations and the French implementing economic monopoly policies, the market is greatly affected. However, at the same time, overseas Chinese spent 30 million Vietnamese dong to build a New Jinshan Entertainment Center, which has the largest dance hall in the Far East, and a casino comparable to Monte Carlo in the East, Macau. Opium dens are lined up, and brothels are everywhere. Decadence and shamelessness, imperialists have always been the best at using these to numb the people of the colonies.

Many important agencies of the National Government in Vietnam are located in Saigon; after the establishment of the "Southern Republic Provisional Government," it was also made the capital. Since the French-Vietnamese situation became urgent, French Colonial Minister Moutet, Far East Army Commander Hua Wei, and Resident Commissioner of Vietnam, Darshan Lian, successively arrived in Saigon. He then issued an order that every night from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning was curfew time. During the curfew, there were no pedestrians on the streets. Residents were often broken into by armed personnel, who committed rape, robbery, and did everything possible. The greatest sufferers were our overseas Chinese. The Consulate General of our country in Saigon receives reports, and the case files are more than a foot thick. I once asked Consul General Yin Fengzao about this, how the negotiations were going, and whether the French side had the sincerity to prevent such incidents from happening. He simply said, "It is still not optimistic." One can also see how difficult it is to negotiate these cases.

During my three days in Saigon, I obtained the consent of the French side to take a military plane to Haiphong. According to the French officer traveling with me, the Jibi Airport, where the plane landed, was occupied by Viet Minh troops when the French-Vietnamese conflict first broke out on November 19. It was not until November 27 that Colonel Daibolié led parachute troops, along with fighter squadrons and ground armored regiments, to participate in the battle before it was regained by the French army. Shell casings were all over the ground, and the hangars were covered with bullet holes, which gave a glimpse of the intensity of the fighting at that time.

In every street in the urban area and along the Mekong River, French troops installed gun emplacements everywhere, holding their ground. French warships also removed their gun covers and aimed at the urban area. Most of the important buildings were damaged, and most of the civilian houses were destroyed. Everywhere there were broken walls and remnants of fire that had not been extinguished. There was not a single pedestrian to be seen, only tanks patrolling back and forth. The Yongdian Power Plant has not yet been repaired. At night, the entire city is plunged into darkness. Viet Minh troops constantly concentrated artillery fire on the urban area, and Viet Minh troops lurking in the urban area set fires and fired guns everywhere in response. The atmosphere of terror was chilling.

Brief Stay in Haiphong

After the conflict, the Viet Minh Committee issued a declaration calling on the Vietnamese people to be calm, united, and quickly make effective preparations. Vietnamese newspapers also severely criticized Darshan Lian. The "Minzu" newspaper said, "He is the destroyer of French-Vietnamese national unity." The conclusion stated, "If Darshan Lian returns to Vietnam, the blood of the Vietnamese people will undoubtedly flow again."

According to official statistics, the losses of overseas Chinese were: 59 dead, 51 injured, 193 arrested, and 502 missing. Property losses: 23 houses were completely destroyed, 59 were partially destroyed, plus the total value of goods and other losses was 25 million Vietnamese dong. However, based on observations, the losses of life and property are probably not limited to this.

Haiphong originally had 80,000 overseas Chinese, and more than 2,000 people from neighboring areas gathered in Haiphong. Everyone was anxiously like ants on a hot pot. Leaving or staying were both impossible, and they lived in uncertainty. The suffering, stained with blood, is really beyond the imagination of those who have not experienced it!

During my two days in Haiphong, I managed to obtain a pass from the Viet Minh side. In the dim morning, I entered the defense area of the Viet Minh army. Because they had been notified in advance, as soon as I arrived, five Vietnamese youths, three men and two women, armed with weapons, escorted me deep into the interior.

The railways and highways have been destroyed. Residents along the line are stepping up the construction of fortifications and also intensifying evacuations. I saw with my own eyes that they even sacrificed their only beds, door panels, and even the carts that the carters regarded as their only property, to be used as obstacles. The emotions were tragic and passionate, moving and worthy of song, which was touching.

### An Overlooked Gynecological Disease: The Truth About Leukorrhea

— Cheng Yanjia

Speaking of leukorrhea, most people think it is something women should have, especially married women, nine out of ten have it, so there is no need to worry about it. Others think that leukorrhea is a very common gynecological disease, and there is no need to consult a doctor, just use the medicine introduced by friends or advertised on the advertisement to get a quick cure. In fact, both of these views are wrong. Leukorrhea is a white secretion flowing out of the cervix and vagina. This secretion is sometimes just a physiological phenomenon, such as in the premenstrual period or during pregnancy, due to hormonal imbalance or increased physiological function, the secretion also increases. But in many cases, leukorrhea is a pathological phenomenon. Leukorrhea itself cannot be called a disease, but it is a symptom of many gynecological diseases. Now let's talk about several common diseases that increase leukorrhea. (This article is limited to the vagina and cervix) Before we talk about it, we should first know the physiological structure of the vagina and cervix.

The surface of the vagina has a layer of mucous membrane, which is similar to the skin and is composed of stratified squamous cells. There are no glands in the vagina, so its secretions actually come from the cervix and uterus. During the period when the ovary is active - from puberty to menopause - the chemical reaction in the vagina is weakly acidic (PH4-5.5). This weak acidity is due to a type of acid-producing bacteria called Doderlein's Bacillus, which ferments liver starch in vaginal epidermal cells to produce lactic acid. The degree of acidity is sufficient to prevent the growth and reproduction of general bacteria, because general bacteria are not suitable for survival in acidic environments, so maintaining an acidity of PH4-5.5 is very important. So how can we continuously maintain weak acidity? Originally, the amount of lactic acid depends on the amount of liver starch in the epidermal cells, and the amount of liver starch in the epidermal cells depends on the activity of estrogen in the ovaries. Therefore, before puberty and after menopause, estrogen decreases, liver starch also decreases, and the vaginal reaction changes from weakly acidic to alkaline. During this period, if external bacteria invade the vagina, it is easy to cause inflammation.

The cervix is like a strait, it connects the vagina and the uterus. The mucous membrane near the vagina is still composed of stratified squamous cells, but the mucous membrane in the tube is composed of a single layer of tubular cells. The cervix has many glands, and the ducts open to the surface, so it can discharge secretions into the vagina. This secretion is a colorless, alkaline mucus, which usually blocks the cervical canal, so things in the vagina are not easy to invade the uterine cavity.

After understanding the physiological structure of the vagina and cervix, we can separately talk about several main diseases that increase leukorrhea.

(1) Vulvovaginitis

Leukorrhea in girls before puberty is mostly pathological. The reason is that gonorrhea or pyogenic bacteria are transmitted into the vagina. The transmission methods are nothing more than direct contact with contaminated clothes, bathing, etc., or due to finger transmission, or even due to improper sexual behavior. The symptoms are red vulva, and sticky purulent leukorrhea flows out of the hymen and vagina. If the secretions are examined under a microscope or cultured, the exact type of bacteria can be known. The treatment methods are nothing more than chemical therapy such as Neosalvarsan or penicillin, local irrigation, and injection of estrogen. As for the principle of using endocrine treatment, it has been mentioned in the above physiological section that it is to enhance the production of lactic acid and thicken the vaginal epidermal cells, which can strengthen the resistance to bacteria. The treatment results are mostly satisfactory.

(2) Senile Vaginitis

Senile vaginitis, as the name suggests, of course occurs in elderly women. It usually occurs after menopause, the activity of the ovaries decreases, estrogen gradually stops, and the mucous membrane in the vagina also degenerates, and the epidermis thins. Therefore, not only is the resistance to external bacteria weak in terms of tissue, but also the chemical reaction secreted in the vagina becomes alkaline due to the decrease in estrogen and the sharp decrease in lactic acid production. As a result, bacteria multiply and cause inflammation. The symptoms are diffuse redness and swelling of the vagina and a large increase in leukorrhea, but it is seropurulent. The treatment method is to locally irrigate with warm water or mild disinfectant, and at the same time inject estrogen. The principle is similar to the treatment of childhood vaginitis, so the results are very significantly effective.

(3) Trichomonas Vaginalis

During the reproductive period of women, due to the activity of estrogen, it is not easy to get vaginitis except for a disease called trichomoniasis. So what is trichomonas? Trichomonas is a flagellate protozoan, which can be seen under a microscope, shaped like a pear, with hairs on the outer circle, and abnormally active. The transmission method is direct contact with contaminated objects or sexual intercourse. The symptom is a large increase in leukorrhea, light yellow in color, and foamy. If you take a drop of leukorrhea and dilute it in salt water and examine it under a microscope, you can immediately see trichomonas. This kind of leukorrhea is very irritating to the skin, causing the patient to feel itchy and restless day and night. Treatment methods (1) Use a powder sprayer to spray anti-trichomonas drugs such as silver compounds, arsenic compounds, or Vioform powder on the vaginal mucosa, and at the same time insert the same type of suppositories into the deep part of the vagina every day. (2) Irrigate the vagina with lactic acid every day, and then insert acid-producing suppositories into the deep part of the vagina to maintain the acidic reaction of the vagina, because trichomonas is also not easy to grow in acidic environments. The treatment results are uncertain. Some patients can easily be completely cured, but some patients often relapse, so the treatment should not be interrupted.

(4) Simple Vaginitis

This kind of inflammation is mostly because the vaginal mucosa is irritated, such as long-term use of uterine pessaries or local use of strong drugs. Generally, ignorant women sometimes want to have an abortion after pregnancy, so they put all kinds of drugs or irritants into the vagina. Sometimes, the medicated water used for vaginal douching is too strong, causing damage to the mucosa. The symptoms are milky white discharge, many of which have a foul smell, and the vaginal mucosa is even ulcerated. Because there are putrefactive bacteria present, the patient feels dryness and itching in the private parts, etc. The most important treatment method is to remove the source of the disease, and then irrigate the vagina with a mild disinfectant. The result is good.

(5) Acute Cervicitis

The cause of acute inflammation of the cervix is nothing more than the invasion of gonorrhea and the deepening of pyogenic bacteria into the wound after the cervix is torn during childbirth or abortion. The mucous membrane of the cervix reacts and eventually becomes inflamed.

The symptoms are increased leukorrhea, yellow and tough, painful urination, frequent urination, bleeding from the cervix and erosion, so diagnosis is easy. As for determining what kind of bacteria is the source of the disease, just examine the leukorrhea under a microscope or culture it to know. Treatment methods include chemical therapy and preventing excessive fatigue such as dancing and long-distance walking. The results of early treatment are satisfactory. If it is ignored and not treated, then the inflammation is easy to spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes.

Chronic cervicitis is a very common gynecological disease. Usually, as long as there is increased leukorrhea and the cervix is ruptured or eroded, it can be diagnosed as chronic cervicitis. However, recently, gynecological experts have examined it in detail, cultured the leukorrhea, and examined the tissue sections of the cervix under a microscope, and could not find any bacteria present. So many so-called chronic cervicitis are not formal inflammation. This phenomenon is mostly because the cervix is injured after childbirth. At that time, bacteria may have invaded, but it healed quickly. However, the secretory glands of the cervix are overgrown and the secretion increases, but the nature is not purulent but mucoid. At the same time, the patient has a feeling of falling and back pain, etc. The purpose of treatment is not to eliminate bacteria, but to destroy or reduce the overgrown cervical glands. Therefore, the secretion can also be reduced. Treatment methods: (1) Use electrocoagulation to necrose the overgrown glands of the cervix and cervical canal; (2) Use zinc chloride to electrolyze and chemically burn the cervix and cervical canal; (3) If the cervical laceration is very severe, then the wound should be sutured or cervical amputation should be performed.

(7) Cervical Cancer

The source of cervical cancer is controversial, and its true cause cannot be determined at present, but local chronic irritation is generally considered to be a factor. Cancerous tissue grows from the squamous cells of the cervix, or from the columnar cells of the cervical canal or glands. According to statistics, cervical cancer is the most common female cancer. Usually women between the ages of forty and fifty are most likely to get cervical cancer; but people in their twenties and sixties can also get it. The symptoms in the early stage are only a small amount of watery leukorrhea, and occasionally there is blood in the leukorrhea, especially after contact. Unfortunately, patients often neglect to seek medical treatment at this stage. In the second and third stages, there is a large amount of leukorrhea, yellow glandular discharge with a foul odor, which is because the cancer grows and there is necrosis, rot and infection. At the same time, there is a lot of bleeding. In the fourth stage, the growth of the cancer spreads into the pelvic connective tissue, nerves, and bladder or rectum, so there are abdominal pain, leg pain, back pain, constipation, painful urination with blood, and significant weight loss. In the early stage, the diagnosis of cancer is not easy, because the symptoms are not obvious, unless a biopsy of the cervical tissue is examined under a microscope to determine.

There are two treatment methods: (1) Perform surgery and add radiation - first perform surgery to completely remove the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and pelvic connective tissue, and then use radium needles and deep X-ray irradiation. This method can only be applied to first-stage patients. The so-called first stage is that the growth of cancer is limited to the cervix itself; (2) Do not perform surgery, but only use radium needles and deep X-ray irradiation. Recently, radiation therapy has been gradually improved, so the treatment results are very good, because this method is not limited to first-stage patients. According to a 1938 report from sixteen radiation treatment centers, using five years without recurrence as the standard, an average of twenty-seven out of one hundred cervical cancer patients (ranging from first to fourth stage) can live for five years without recurrence after radiation treatment. If it is divided into stages, then 57% of first-stage patients do not recur within five years. Only 5.5% of fourth-stage patients do not recur within five years. It can be seen that the prognosis of the same cervical cancer is very different between the first and fourth stages, so early diagnosis and early treatment are so important.

There are many other causes of leukorrhea, such as cancer of the vagina and vulva, uterine cavity diseases, etc. Due to space limitations, I can only mention them briefly here. In short, the increase in leukorrhea is sometimes just a mild inflammation, but sometimes it may be a sign of some serious diseases. Therefore, we should correct the past erroneous concept of ignoring leukorrhea. I advise all female compatriots that when you find leukorrhea, it is best to see a doctor for a check-up immediately. If it is mild inflammation, it can certainly be cured immediately; even if it is the most terrible cervical cancer, early treatment can also achieve good results in more than half of the cases. But do not cause serious consequences due to being too lazy to check, or delay the opportunity for treatment due to a fluke mentality. Qiao Shumin

### Sex and Mental Illness

— Zhu Hanying

Whether in China or Europe and the United States, in the past, knowledge about "sex" was viewed from a religious or moral standpoint, and was considered obscene and shameful for noble people to ask about. Therefore, for thousands of years, we have been forbidden to know knowledge about "sex" under this erroneous traditional concept, resulting in many sexual psychological abnormalities. In the past thirty years, European and American countries have established enlightened new concepts and promoted sex education and sexual hygiene, but China is still shrouded in a strong old concept. This is what the medical and educational circles should pay attention to.

We know that all living things have the instinct of "reproduction". Lower organisms have "reproduction" but no "sex"; higher animals have "reproduction" and "sex" at the same time; but the sexual desire of general animals only exists during the age of reproductive capacity, while the existence of human sexual desire is not necessarily during the reproductive period. Many scholars admit that boys and girls have spontaneous sexual desire, such as infants sucking breast milk, which has a pleasant feeling, because the mouth is also one of the sensual parts in adulthood, and boys have a good feeling towards their mothers. If a third party divides his mother's love, he will be jealous. Similarly, girls also have a good feeling towards their fathers. Luo Ci made a detailed statistic that the age of the beginning of sexual feeling for boys is probably between five and fourteen years old, and the age of the beginning of sexual feeling for girls is between eight and seventeen years old.

After boys and girls mature physically, both parties must choose a suitable partner. Young people in the period of passionate love contain a little "madness", thus producing more or less amorous affairs. The Emperor of England and Mrs. Simpson are an example of this. This kind of state does not belong to abnormality in psychology. Then, what kind of mental abnormality does the commonly talked about "lovesickness" and "infatuation" refer to? Briefly described as follows:

"Lovesickness" occurs in patients with an introverted personality. He or she likes to satisfy his or her desires with contemplation and dreams. Therefore, he or she lingers in bed, enjoying his or her fantasy and hallucinatory life. It is commonly seen in patients with schizophrenia (Scleizonereuia). Patients with "infatuation" mostly have an extroverted personality. He or she often decorates his or her face, hair and clothing to make people very dazzling, likes to be close to the opposite sex, and openly expresses admiration. Sometimes he or she writes letters to strangers of the opposite sex, or falsely declares "engagement at a certain place on a certain day", etc. It is commonly seen in patients with mild mania (Hypomauia).

It is generally believed that the right medicine for the two diseases is "marriage". In fact, a psychologically healthy person will not develop mental illness no matter how great the stimulation he suffers, unless there is an innate psychological unsoundness. Therefore, marriage can only cure a very small part of the mild "lovesickness" and "infatuation" patients. This part of the patients will recover naturally even without the marriage procedure. If we adopt the past method of high abstinence, religious figures proclaim the venting of sexual desire as offending the gods, and moralists denounce it as vulgar and shameless, but the results are just the opposite. Then we abandon abstinence and adopt indulgence, but sexual desire is not appetite. The solution requires a partner, so under laissez-faire, many actions of infringing on others will inevitably be staged, resulting in various events that violate the law. The only method is to start instilling sex education from childhood. The most appropriate person to fulfill this responsibility is none other than the mother. The most common curiosity of children is to understand the differences in the physical structure of men and women. They must be answered naturally. It is to take the method of co-bathing with parents and children from childhood, so that morbid curiosity can be avoided. At the same time, pay attention to sexual hygiene, such as having a regular life, mainly vegetarian food, cold baths, no extravagance, avoiding all strong physical and mental stimulation, being careful in making friends, working diligently, and doing more exercise. This can prevent children with "psychopathic" to develop sexual mental illness in adulthood.

### New Knowledge in the Medical World

Oral Plasma Liquid for Newborns

Looking at modern medical literature, among the problems of many newborns, especially those with congenital deficiencies or premature infants, there is a very important and difficult problem to solve, which is the weight loss after birth, and even after many days, they cannot restore to the weight at birth.

Various new feeding recipes, such as high protein content, are also helpful, but they are not satisfactory.

Transfusing the mother's placental blood to the infant through the umbilical cord can indeed prevent the weight loss after birth, but the procedure is quite difficult and cannot be easily done under normal circumstances.

We know that the nature of plasma is very similar to colostrum. Its protein can penetrate the intestinal wall of the infant and be absorbed. Feeding infants with it can indeed prevent the weight loss after birth.

According to a report by Dr. John F. Loehle, he used plasma liquid to feed seven premature infants, and their weight did not decrease at all, but once the plasma was stopped, the weight decreased.

He also made a feeding experiment on twins: the older one was breastfed by the mother; the younger one was only fed sugar water, and within 24 hours, he gasped and had fever. Oxygen was used to treat him for a total of 16 hours, but it was still ineffective. Then he was given plasma liquid, and the situation improved greatly within an hour. After that, he continued to feed plasma liquid and breast milk, and later he overtook his brother in weight. Dr. Luo Er was interesting, he stopped feeding the younger one plasma liquid and switched to feeding the older one. In a few days, the older one was in the lead.

In addition, he also tested two other pairs of twins and four other premature infants, and the results were remarkable. What is noteworthy is that there is usually vomiting with general artificial feeding, but after taking plasma liquid, vomiting stops. It can be seen that plasma liquid itself does not have the side effect of irritating the gastric mucosa, and may have an anti-vomiting effect. The future infant feeding method will be improved, or it will be based on protein containing high amounts of plasma.

What should be the dose of feeding plasma liquid? According to Dr. Luo Er's experience, the usual dose is 10 cc (c.c.) per kilogram of body weight, orally every two hours. If the weight does not decrease or even increases after 24 hours, then give it orally every two and a half hours, for two consecutive days, and then change it to once every three hours as appropriate.

Dr. Luo Er used human plasma. (Original article published in J. Pediat 28:145, 1948) In my opinion, can pig plasma and cow plasma also be used? Please ask domestic pediatricians to try it. I am inconvenienced in my travels.

### A Brief Discussion of Venereal Diseases

Venereal disease is a byproduct of failed sexual encounters for humanity. It possesses a subtle yet formidable contagiousness, and a gradual, progressive destructiveness. Its primary source is sexual intercourse, hence it is commonly known as sexually transmitted diseases, or venereal diseases. However, infection from other sources occasionally occurs as well.

Generally speaking, venereal diseases include five types: syphilis, gonorrhea, chancroid, granuloma venereum, and granuloma inguinale. Some also include condyloma acuminata (genital warts). Among them, syphilis and gonorrhea are the most important. Syphilis is more serious, while gonorrhea is more prevalent, almost five or six times more common than syphilis. The other types are mostly localized, with less impact on the entire body. Granuloma inguinale is more common in tropical regions. Although it cannot be said to be absolutely nonexistent in China, actual cases are rare.

Gonorrhea – After contracting the disease, the initial sensation is irritation of the genitals, followed by a discharge of white secretions, commonly known as "white turbidity" or "leukorrhea." Afterwards, the patient experiences pain during urination, with increased frequency. After several weeks, the symptoms gradually disappear. This phenomenon does not mean that the disease has healed itself. In fact, acute symptoms may reappear at any time. With repeated infections, the body's response causes the affected area to develop a significant amount of fibrous tissue, similar to scar tissue. As a result, men may experience urinary obstruction, requiring the use of instruments to forcibly clear the urethra several times a year for the rest of their lives. In women, the fallopian tubes may become blocked, resulting in permanent infertility. Sometimes, the bacteria may spread through the bloodstream to the joints, causing arthritis, or to the heart, causing serious heart disease.

Gonorrhea bacteria can be found in the secretions of the patient's genitals. Their transmission can be broadly classified into four types: (1) direct transmission through sexual intercourse, (2) transfer of secretions from the hands to the eyes, causing blindness, (3) transmission to the genitals of young children from unclean cloths or washing utensils, and (4) infection of infants during childbirth through contact with the infected birth canal. Transmission through toilets, cups, or chopsticks is usually less likely, as these bacteria die quickly in dry and cold environments.

Due to differences in physical constitution, the suffering experienced by men is more immediate and apparent than that experienced by women. As a result, women often do not pay attention to or seek treatment after contracting the disease. Some women, even knowing that they have gonorrhea, deliberately ignore it because they are not currently suffering from its effects. These women are dangerous sources of infection.

Syphilis has existed in China for over four hundred years. Initially, it was limited to coastal port areas and was relatively rare. Now, it is very common even in remote inland areas. This is a dangerous phenomenon. The progress of syphilis medicine is only about forty years old (since the discovery of the syphilis spirochete). The invention of Salvarsan ("606") in 1902 and the recent advances in chemotherapy have provided the tools to vigorously pursue prevention and treatment.

The initial symptom of syphilis is a painless, indurated chancre. It usually appears on the external genitals in areas prone to injury, and can be detected about four weeks after infection. This is commonly called a "hard chancre." The chancre will heal on its own after five or six weeks. The following one to two years mark the secondary stage of syphilis. During this stage, the syphilis bacteria are carried by the bloodstream to various lymph nodes, causing swollen lymph nodes, a skin rash (syphilitic roseola), sore throat, bone pain, etc. These symptoms can be mild or severe and may disappear on their own. However, the disease gradually enters the tertiary stage in five to twenty-five years. The syphilis bacteria spread from the lymph nodes to internal organs, the aorta, heart, liver, bones, nerves, and brain. The symptoms vary depending on where the bacteria concentrate and cause damage, leading to heart pain, heart failure, blindness, dementia, neurological disorders, etc.

Syphilis is usually transmitted directly through sexual intercourse. However, doctors or nurses may occasionally become infected through accidental contact with patients. Infected mothers, unless properly treated, can easily transmit the disease to their fetuses. Such infants, if left untreated, may survive for ten or twenty years, but they are often intellectually impaired or crippled.

Salvarsan ("606") can cure syphilis, but only in its early, secondary stages. And it can only be effective with proper medical treatment. The earlier the treatment, the better the outcome. Patients in the initial stages, especially women, often do not pay attention to it because they have not yet experienced pain, and they miss the opportunity for a complete cure. Furthermore, some patients have a superficial understanding and self-medicate, or are deceived by quack doctors, receiving only partial treatment. Although the immediate suffering may subside temporarily, the disease will recur later in a more severe form, causing great harm. Doctors often use blood tests to detect latent syphilis. However, this does not mean that blood tests can definitely confirm its presence, as the sensitivity of these tests is only about 85%. In other words, only 85 out of 100 true syphilis patients can be identified through blood tests. In the earliest stages (before six weeks after infection), or in the latest stages (a portion of the tertiary stage), or after partial treatment, the blood serum syphilis reaction (Wassermann or Kahn test) is often negative.

From the above points, we can see that venereal disease is truly a terrible tragedy. The only sure way to prevent it is to avoid sexual contact with infected individuals, especially illicit sexual encounters. Of course, illicit sexual encounters and venereal disease transmission are not necessarily directly related. However, prostitutes, because of their numerous clients, have a much higher chance of contracting the disease than ordinary people. Private prostitutes are almost more likely to be infected than licensed prostitutes. These are all facts.

Using a rubber condom or topical antiseptic (ordinary soap and hot water are sufficient to kill external bacteria), or taking oral or injectable prophylactic bactericides, before sexual intercourse with a woman with venereal disease can reduce the chances of infection significantly, but it is not absolutely certain. Syphilitic ulcers can still appear on areas outside the condom. Moreover, men often use them improperly when drunk. Antiseptics can temporarily suppress the initial symptoms, but they often allow the bacteria to penetrate deeper, causing more serious problems later. The use of such methods in the military is understandable due to the extraordinary circumstances, but it is definitely not suitable or safe for the general public.

Other important points to note are early and complete treatment. If patients can eliminate their infectivity during the later stages, then the chances of infecting others can be greatly reduced. This includes how to encourage patients to see a doctor, how doctors can provide complete treatment, and how to ensure that patients continue to complete a rational and complete course of treatment. Everything is related to psychology, technology, and education.

Now let us examine how to deal with venereal disease? Promiscuity and drunkenness are the main contributing factors. Education and welfare initiatives are far better than any preventive measure. The licensed prostitution system has often failed in countries around the world, because the tighter the management of prostitutes, the more afraid they are of losing their jobs due to illness, and they become private prostitutes instead. Furthermore, doctors only examine prostitutes three times a month, which takes very little time. A certificate proving that they are disease-free cannot completely guarantee that they do not have venereal disease. This is an academic problem. Unless there is good control over the population registry, legal regulations for patients who violate treatment protocols to supplement the deficiencies of education, and appropriate medical personnel providing complete treatment, along with daily disinfection and prevention, the chances of transmission can be reduced. The same applies to patients among the general population.

In conclusion, venereal disease is recognized as dangerous, and everyone needs to recognize the seriousness of venereal disease transmission. They must control their own intellect and identify their goals, and not seek pleasure and contract the disease. If this is not possible, then they should choose their partner carefully and use their wisdom to prevent it. Finally, if they have discovered that they have venereal disease, they need to treat it thoroughly and completely, and never harm others or delay their own treatment. Only in this way can we achieve disease prevention through treatment, and ultimately achieve ideal social hygiene.

### Passing the Three Barriers

— Ruosi

After passing the Gregorian New Year barrier, we face the Lunar New Year barrier, barrier after barrier difficult to pass, making life and death a concern.

Chinese people have been living a dual life for about ten years, celebrating the "Foreign Winter Solstice" (Christmas) and then the Chinese Winter Solstice; taking holidays for the Gregorian New Year and also resting for the Lunar New Year, enjoying the benefits of both. This is not a big deal; but when the New Year barrier comes in duplicate, forcing people to cross the barrier twice, the financial and business sectors are crushed by the squeeze of funds, which is a bit overwhelming.

The other day, the Chinese Theater performed the complete "Red Mane Steed." Xue Pinggui had passed two barriers but was still not out of danger. Only after running to the third barrier did he dare to turn around and sing a duet with Princess Daizhan, who was as urgent as a "top-speed rickshaw."

Shanghai is no different. The term "squeezing through" the New Year barrier, with the word "squeezing" used, shows how rushed, urgent, and desperate it is.

I hope everyone can squeeze through steadily, at least not getting overturned. If you get overturned in the first or second barrier, you won't be able to run to the third barrier, and where will you get the status to sing a duet with Princess Daizhan? Not to mention a grand reunion at the Dengdian ceremony.

### Source of Knowledge

— Cheng Chen

Talking about the compilation of the "World Almanac"

The "World Almanac" sells 600,000 copies annually. The 1947 edition was published in the first week of January. The editor is Eastman Irwin, a tall, white-haired, green-eyed journalist. He takes on this most burdensome job in the United States, and it cannot be neglected in the slightest. In the thousands of pieces of information collected in the almanac each year, even the smallest error will anger scholars everywhere, causing many questions and criticisms.

In the libraries of major cities around the world, the "World Almanac" is used so frequently that the corners of the book are curled, stained, and torn. Two or three copies need to be replaced each year. Sometimes, a page or two are torn out to prove a certain fact, resulting in incomplete copies.

Not only do libraries need to purchase a copy of the "World Almanac," but businessmen, teachers, students, writers, lawyers, and civil servants also need one in hand. Editors feel that their desks are incomplete without this almanac.

The "World Almanac" is sold all over the world. Peking University in China also has past editions of the almanac from before the war. Since 1885, old almanacs have often been consulted in courts to resolve certain issues, such as which day the tide was highest or the moon was fullest in a certain month of a certain year.

In addition to regular statistics on population, elections, sports, commerce, etc., the almanac also gathers world news and anecdotes. Want to know which internal organ of the human body is the heaviest, the liver or the brain? Just check the "World Almanac." The liver weighs 1600 grams, and the brain weighs 1400 grams. How many horses and donkeys are there in the United States? In 1945, there were a total of 12,305,000, a decrease of four million in ten years. How many calories does a woman need each day? 2500 calories. How many bacteria are there on a fly? Six million. The brightest lighthouse in the United States is in Navesink, New Jersey, with a luminosity of 9 million candlepower.

The almanac also includes various records, such as the price of ham before 1900, which state is the main producer of whetstones and oilstones, how to identify counterfeit currency, the total length of streets and roads in the United States, the total number of stillbirths in New York City, what day of the week was July 4, 1776, and what is the appropriate gift to celebrate a second wedding anniversary.

Do you want to test how long it takes to reach the ground by jumping off the Royal Building? Just look up the speed of falling objects. The answer is nine seconds.

Irwin is often asked strange questions on the radio. As soon as one answer is given, another question comes up. The inquiring phone calls drive him crazy. One housewife asked him how long the blood vessels in the human body are. He shouted madly, "Madam, they are 100,000 miles long!"

During the war, the "World Almanac" was sent to lonely American soldiers in the farthest corners of the world. They often corresponded with Irwin and asked questions. Once, two American soldiers in the South Pacific argued about which city, New York or Chicago, had the longest public transportation line. Later, Irwin proved that New York was in first place when all the streetcars, buses, and elevators were included.

The "World Almanac" is published by the World Telegram, and it is now in its 61st year. In the first 20 years, it gradually developed to annual sales of 300,000 copies. In 1937, Irwin took over as editor and greatly improved it, emphasizing entertainment and timeliness, deleting unnecessary text, and adding information on food, nutrition, and science.

Every year in May and June, the "World Almanac" editorial office sends letters to authorities and experts in all fields around the world, soliciting materials. Recipients include mayors, government officials, principals, chambers of commerce, and other organizations that can collect data. The FBI, the Department of Commerce, and the Army and Navy all help him.

Irwin has no fixed standard for selecting materials, relying entirely on his experience to decide. As a result of his efforts, sales have doubled.

### A Lama Discusses Tibet

— Pan Chenglie

Qinghua University invited an alumnus who graduated from the school ten years ago and is now a lama to give a lecture on the afternoon of January 10. Because he has lived with Tibetans for eight years, what he has seen in Tibet is more than what we generally know and more accurate.

This lama is named Suonan Jiacuo. He also has a Chinese name. The most striking thing is his unique clothing: a dark red woolen monk's robe, with a long red woolen belt tied around his waist, dragging to his feet. The front of the robe is woven with brocade, but the sleeves are so short that they almost slip off. In such cold weather, his arms are still completely exposed. Outside, he wears a dark red woolen cloth, twelve feet long, wrapping his body, but his right hand is always often exposed. These fabrics are all Tibetan-made.

Although the clothing is so strange, he speaks very pure Beijing dialect.

Still holding a string of black and white prayer beads in his hand, he began his introduction to "The Current Situation in Tibet."

The living Buddhas of Lamaism, which the Tibetans believe in, are not completely the same as the "Buddhas" in Buddhism. Lamas with high morals and scholarship can become living Buddhas. Therefore, there are many living Buddhas. Sometimes there is one in a small monastery, and large monasteries often have dozens of them. Believers who believe in the karma of the three lives have absolute faith in the reincarnation of living Buddhas; when a living Buddha dies, his many disciples beg him to come to this place again in the next life to guide them and continue the unfinished business of his current life. The living Buddha agrees, and sometimes tells his disciples which family or which place he will be reincarnated into in the next life. So the disciples go to look for infants born within forty-nine days of his death, believing that this must be the reincarnation of the living Buddha; but sometimes there is only one such infant. They then use various methods to test which one is the true living Buddha: such as asking the child to identify the utensils used by the living Buddha in his previous life, or observing the child's appearance and intelligence. When he reaches the age where he can leave his family, he is taken back to the temple to do the unfinished work of his previous life. In this situation, the number of living Buddhas will never decrease due to death, but only increase, so there are more and more living Buddhas there.

The lives of Tibetans are very simple. They only have one sheepskin garment throughout the year. Five sheepskins can make a garment; but because it is too long, they tie it around their waist with a belt, lifting up the part that is dragging down. The part above the belt is so wide that it becomes a bag, and they put commonly used items such as rice bowls inside. In hot weather, their arms are exposed; in cold weather, they wrap them up with their clothes. At night, they take off their clothes and spread them on the ground, and people sleep on them, so that half of it serves as a mattress and half as a blanket.

When eating, they use their hands and have no chopsticks. The bowl is made of wood. When eating, they first fill it with tea, pour a layer of butter on top, blow the oil aside first, drink the tea below, then pour in the ground naked barley flour, mix it with the remaining oil, mix it with water, and knead it into small cakes to eat.

They often offer decades of savings to the living Buddha, whom they regard as a god, and the living Buddha simply touches their heads, and that is it. Everyone has very little property, and it is clearly divided, such as which bowl belongs to the husband and which pot belongs to the wife. People collect all their property and give it to private individuals or everyone, or offer it to the living Buddha.

The marriage system is mostly monogamous, but there are also polygynous and polyandrous marriages. Polygyny is probably practiced by rich people, who live separately with their several wives. Polyandry is practiced by several brothers who marry one wife together to avoid many inconveniences when dividing the family property. When children are born, people do not value who the child's father is, so there is no dispute between them about whether the child was born to the eldest brother or the second brother.

In politics, Tibet rarely accepts the jurisdiction of the central government. When Britain wanted to extend its sphere of influence here, the Tibetans often used the protection of the central government to reject British demands, and sometimes used it in the opposite way. It is said that, from the Tibetan point of view, they also have unavoidable difficulties!

How can we establish a deeper connection between Tibet and the central government? Relying solely on transportation, political, or military power is not enough. In addition to starting with these simultaneously, the most important thing is to communicate their culture. There is now a Lama school on the border of Qinghai, and the funds are allocated by the state. This can be said to be one of the works of communicating culture.

### Beggars Welcoming the Spring (Part Two)

— Huang Jiamo

Sending New Year's Gifts

Beggars in the local gang have a heroic act of giving gifts during New Year's Eve. They carry a yellow basket, containing an empty red paper envelope and a tuft of chicken feathers, pretending to send New Year's gifts. Fortunately, no one will accept their "generous gifts," but the "foot money" has to be given. The beggars honestly and impolitely state it in their songs. It is truly humorous. The lyrics say:

"Coming, coming, sending gifts to celebrate the New Year!"

One wild chicken, a package of soup fruit.

Although there are few gifts, they reach every household!

Accept nothing, just give some pocket money and run.

The east family opens a golden hand,

Business will be good all year round."

Playing the Mud God

The beggar holds a broken bowl in his left hand, full of mud. With a small firewood stick in his right hand, he begs for money by playing the mud god, singing as he dances:

"The mud god arrives, business is good.

Good luck comes, earn silver ingots.

The mud god touches, the business is booming.

(When singing, smear a little mud on the forehead.)

The mud god jumps, business in the real shop is even better. (Make a jumping gesture.)

Today, beg for some fortune money,

Respectfully celebrate the New Year for the shop."

Sweeping the Foreigner

This is a long New Year's song of local beggars, flattering to the extreme. They hold a flower broom and wear a straw ring on their heads. They run to people's doors in strange costumes and sing. Although the song is vulgar, it is excessively flattering. However, everything is carefully considered, and in the words and lines, one can experience the thoughts of a talented man of the Jianghu during the late Qing Dynasty. The lyrics say:

(1) "Sweeping the foreigner, not sweeping for many years.

The Qianlong Emperor gave me Lu Axiao,

Telling me to go everywhere."

(2) "Sweeping everywhere - sweeping into the old lady's room.

Building the front three halls in front, building the back three rooms in the back.

Building a ventilation pavilion in the middle."

(3) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom! Sweeping the old lady's seat.

Guests come and go often, and sixty-four pairs are not enough."

(4) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom! Sweeping to the old lady's bowl cabinet.

The door of the bowl cabinet rings, bringing out the four dishes for dinner.

Plus a bowl of spicy eggplant sauce, preserved chicken, preserved duck, and preserved pork belly."

(5) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom! Sweeping to the old lady's rice bridge.

The green dragon comes to manage the rice vat,

The white dragon comes to manage the wine vat,

The yellow dragon comes to manage the granary."

(6) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom, sweeping to the old lady's pigsty.

Raising pigs, as big as cows. Pig ears dyed, like wind bags.

Pig tails, like brooms."

(7) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom

Sweeping to the old lady's chicken coop.

Golden chickens will fight with phoenixes."

(8) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom

Sweeping to the old lady's stove cabinet.

The rice cooked is like steamed buns.

The meat cut is square.

The fish fried costs two fees."

(9) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom

Sweeping to the old lady's chest of drawers.

The first drawer opened, and the silver bills keep coming.

The second drawer opened, and gold and silver hit the wall."

(10) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom!

Sweeping to the old lady's cradle.

Kneading cotton silk in a ball, weaving cloth like cotton silk.

Selling it in Xiaoshan's lower street, steel coins earn nine thousand nine.

Selling it on the upper street, one thousand is also easy to collect.

Large copper coins, buying fish and meat in real bags.

Small steel coins buy old wine.

Phoenixes and wealth for tens of thousands of years."

### Love Savings Box

— Jianhua translated from the New York Daily News

Dr. Firth of New York has been praised by the academic community for his contributions to sexology. His many works, such as "Studies in Sex," "Sexual Life in the Early Years of Marriage," and "The Origin and Trends of Kissing," have been widely circulated and welcomed by men and women from all walks of life. On the 24th of last month (December), the doctor and his wife held their silver wedding anniversary, with more than 200 guests attending. At this grand banquet, the doctor and his wife publicly revealed two secret things: a "love savings box" and a "love exhibition."

Opening the Lottery in Public

Since the day of their marriage, the doctor has specially made two wooden boxes, called love savings boxes. If the doctor wants to dream with his wife, he must put five US dollars into Box A; if the doctor's wife also suddenly feels the need, she must also put five US dollars into Box B; if both parties feel the same need at the same time, then each pays five dollars, indicating fairness. For more than forty years, there has never been a single interruption. On the day of their silver wedding, the doctor opened the boxes in public, receiving a total of 24,600 dollars, which shows the strong love between the couple. However, the savings in Box A were one-sixth more than those in Box B.

Love Letter Exhibition

The doctor's wife, named Macmillan, was very famous in social circles forty years ago. More than twenty young men fell under her spell, and love letters requesting marriage were sent continuously. At that time, the wife's attitude was neither close nor distant. Her heart was unknown to whom she would incline. It was not until she married the doctor that everyone understood that the doctor was the one chosen. Since the day of her marriage, the wife has received a total of more than 500 love letters. On the day of the silver wedding, a refined room was opened to display all the more than 500 love letters to the public. The handsome young men who wrote to the wife in the past are now mostly old guests with frosty temples and white eyes. When they saw their love letters, some laughed silently, and some were embarrassed. However, the doctor's wife was still innocent and frank, and hospitably entertained them, seemingly as if it had nothing to do with her heart.

Here and Now

### Convenient Handling

— Wenfang

Recently, in Shanghai, bundles of banknotes, although printed with military patterns and sealed well, often have a few small notes running out of the large notes. This kind of trick of replacing notes is ingenious.

If the money passes through my hands, how can I not skim some off?

"Shanghai is full of gold" is not a false statement!

### Restoring Brightness

Electricity restrictions will be lifted next month, outdoor neon lights will also be revived from April, and the "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame" on the top of the International Hotel can once again shine brightly.

Will the darkness in the dark layers of Shanghai be reduced at that time? Still need to be tested!

Behind the Scenes

### Mrs. Perón of Argentina (End)

— Zuo Xi

A Mysterious Young Woman

Although the Nazis in Argentina are still conducting "underground" political activities, they have been able to resume semi-official activities under the guise of charitable causes. For example, when asked what Mrs. Perón's greatest interests are, she replied: "I am organizing women's relief associations, nurseries, orphanages, and providing clothing and medicine to relieve the poor and sick."

Her Leading Group

The best social service organizations led by Mrs. Perón are all organizations run by Germans, such as the German Charity Association, the German Women's Charity Association, the German Evangelical Association, the German Poor Relief Association, and the German State Council Association. Although these organizations are theoretically under government control, they are actually staffed by officials appointed by the Nazi High Command, led by Nazi Party members, and maintain contact with former Argentine Nazi Party members.

There is no doubt that Perón enjoys the support of the Argentine working class. However, these workers are not independent, educated workers like those in North America. According to reports circulated by the Perón opposition during the election campaign: "These workers are assassins bought from the industrial army outside the Argentine capital, most of them carrying weapons supplied by Perón, and they receive a subsidy of ten to fifty pesos for every eight people. Food and drink are reimbursed at public expense, and they are given the impression that they can do whatever they want and will not be punished in any way."

Lotte in the "St. Louis Express Mail" compared the methods used by Perón and Hitler. He said that Perón's "gang" is young and poor, exactly the same stuff Hitler used to organize terrorist groups, but Perón's "initial ideological tool" is the fear and distrust of Americans that Latin Americans have harbored for years. The Peróns were the first to recognize that this anti-American sentiment could be used as a political weapon.

Most importantly, Perón's labor relations are handled almost entirely by his wife, and it has been rumored that Mrs. Perón may soon officially become Latin America's first female labor minister.

Mrs. Perón's social activities have been criticized by the opposition, but she doesn't care, or pretends not to. Talking about her social life, she said: "I have very little time to participate in social activities, and even less time to watch dramas, movies or go to concerts. I spend most of my weekends with my husband on our farm, where I am a humble housewife, cooking his favorite dishes for my husband and taking care of all the housework."

Active in Diplomatic Circles

Mrs. Perón has also made a name for herself in diplomatic circles. Recently, she attended a banquet at the American Embassy. This was the first time an Argentine president's wife had attended an embassy banquet since the rift in US-Argentine relations.

What is Eva Perón's motive for boldly seeking power? What are her ambitions? Perhaps some clues can be found in her remarks. Recalling her opera career before she met Perón, she said: "The greatest excitement in my life was when I played the roles of great historical women such as Queen Isabella, Catherine the Great, and Elizabeth." (Excerpted and translated from "Reader's Digest" January issue)

### Gambler

— Ling Yun

It was getting late, and the sun had withdrawn its last feeble, withered yellow rays; the already dim sky became even darker; the north wind also chimed in, becoming even more piercing, sliding down from the valley in front, emitting a mournful trembling sound, and the earth shivered.

A crow circled a few times in the sky, perched blankly on a large camphor tree opposite Han Abing's house, flapping its wings and croaking a few times.

"Pah!" Abing spat subconsciously, turned around and walked into the kitchen.

"Mom, godmother! It's like a nunnery!" Abing was blinded by the smoke as soon as he stepped into the door, stamping his feet and feeling resentful.

"Hey! It's New Year's Eve, why are you still so angry!" His wife, choked by the smoke, with tears streaming down her face, was squatting at the stove, plucking chicken feathers.

It wouldn't have mattered if Abing hadn't seen it, but the sight made him even more annoyed! "With a woman like you, you can't even raise chickens properly, raising them into this shape!"

His wife stood up abruptly and tossed the chicken, which had only a handful of bones left, onto the stove table! She spat and said:

"Only a family like yours would say that! Other people have rice and wheat, but your family can't even find chaff, and you still want to eat fat chickens, you're so lucky! You might as well stay at Huang Laoqi's house all day..."

Abing raised his eyebrows, wanting to explode, but he had nothing to say; he shrugged his shoulders and went to the thatched cottage next door.

The cold, whistling wind, like a snake's tongue, slipped in from the gaps in the tiles, caressing Abing's furry cheeks, feeling strangely cold, which couldn't help but make Abing shiver, and his mind suddenly became much clearer! "Damn it, I don't know which evil spirit has been following me this year. I clearly calculated that I would jump to the Azure Dragon, but I always get the Triple White Tiger; the house flips out a One for population, but I always bet on something else; that's not even worth mentioning, but I always lose to Huang Laoqi, he's not easy to mess with; didn't I already say this morning that he wouldn't let me off the hook today, that's really damn..."

Thinking of this, Abing immediately felt irritable! "Really damn!" He flipped the greasy hat that was pressing on his eyebrows to the back of his head and paced around the room repeatedly.

Sure enough, at dinner time, Huang Laoqi sent Lin Gen to call Abing over, followed by Xiangfu, who was working in the township office. Abing's wife saw that the three people were acting suspiciously and was about to rush over to ask what was going on, but the three of them ran off in a puff of smoke.

At night, Abing came out of Huang Laoqi's house, and it was already the third watch; Xiangfu followed behind him; several wild dogs were barking and following closely behind; Xiangfu kept scolding the dogs, and also kept scolding Abing for not walking straight!

Along the way, there were a few houses with brilliant candlelight shining through the cracks in the doors; sometimes a burst of firecrackers would be set off in the dark, with sparks flying everywhere; but all of this was just a blur in Abing's eyes.

When he got home, Abing asked Xiangfu to wait under the eaves for a while, and he walked into the house and went to the inner room, his wife followed him in.

"What are you doing?"

"Nothing!" Abing replied, raised his buttocks and just crawled into bed.

His wife understood in her heart, hurriedly threw the child in her arms onto the bed, freed both hands, and grabbed Abing's arm. The child was originally sucking on the nipple, his eyes were drowsy and he was about to fall asleep, and was frightened by this, and couldn't help but cry loudly.

"Let go, it's none of your business."

"You heartless wretch! You might as well kill us mother and daughter and be done with it. Who did you mortgage this lifeline to..."

Abing stuffed the land deed in his hand haphazardly into his arms.

The woman hurriedly came to grab it, Abing took the opportunity to push her hard, the woman fell to the ground, shouting like a pig being slaughtered; but she still grabbed the corner of his clothes.

"Aren't you letting go!" This made Abing unable to be gentle—"Slap, slap!" Abing's strength was quite strong, and the woman's face had already been hit a few times crisply.

The woman didn't have much strength after all, and with such a struggle, Abing broke free and ran out.

"Abing! Are you dead? Why aren't you coming out soon!"

Xiangfu was straightening his voice and shouting outside.

Anecdotes of Writers

### Mark Twain

— Bo Fu

There is a historical society in the United States that collects many souvenirs about writers. Among the many documents, there is an envelope that is most interesting. The addressee is clearly Mrs. Mark Twain, but a line is added next to it: "Misopened for wanting to know the contents—Clemens" (Mark Twain's original name was Samuel L. Clemens).

### Night Hunt

— Zhang Baihuai

The old man couldn't help but sigh. Although memory, like a poet's fairy tale, once again led him back to the garden of youthful strength, in the most beautiful ending, he finally saw himself wearing a white raincoat in the violent wind and rain; as if with infinite emotion, he then lit his long bamboo pipe.

"Ah, now, there are no good hunting dogs, and no good gunmen." He said.

What kind of mourning and sadness is the old man's heart feeling for his past glory at this moment? The starlit summer night turned into a silent fertile land, on which, who knows what kind of harvest the imaginative young people have had?

Those are undoubtedly a series of brave hunting stories. People will completely believe this loyal old man, but they will also ask him with surprise why the past events of decades ago are still so fresh and intimate?

We have no experience at all. People who grow up by the sea only have the colors of shells in their memory; and people who grow up in the valley are used to embracing the mysterious forests and rivers.

The old man is proud that he sang a young song because it has extraordinary significance in his life. He is interested in rambling on, saying how he killed a fat wild boar, and accurately saying the weight of the prey and the heroic posture when he carried it home. He said how a fierce tiger dug out the eyes of a hunter and broke the arm of the strongest villager; and how he was lying in the sorghum field on a silvery moonlit night, holding his breath tightly, waiting for the prey to come...

"When I was young, I had so much strength!...Ah, it was so interesting!"

We can imagine the old man's mood. All that has already been lost forever, he must also be unusually happy, but what is regrettable is that there will still be another kind of twilight feeling hidden behind that past happiness.

While he was patching up the fragments of his story, I remembered a winter night. At that time, I had just arrived in this desolate valley, and I had not yet seen the day and night here; one time, looking out the black window, taking a deep breath to relieve the fatigue of the day, I suddenly heard a sharp cry like a wail from the mountain, and in the homeowner's reply, I knew that the prey had fallen into the trap they had set.

They had already raised torches and carried ropes up the mountain. A prey the size of a yellow dog was dragged back. In the light of the torches, sharp bayonets were thrust into the throat, and someone was holding a bowl to hold the hot fresh blood, and they unhesitatingly poured it into their stomachs like drinking tea.

"Can this cure some disease?"

"Yellow muntjac blood, the best for stomach problems!"

We were surprised.

The stars of the summer night are shining with silvery white small flower buds, like leaking from the fingers of angels. On the clay field near the stream, people's interest is moving towards another kind of fresh event. The old man said that there are man-eating orangutans in a certain mountain. When orangutans catch people, they will laugh until they faint. From here, their conversation turned to the ethereal gods of mystery and ghosts....

I listened to the rain all night in the small building, and a few more fallen leaves were added this morning; the wild geese did not return, and the empty steps were covered with green moss.

Slowly draw your eyebrows, and often lean on the railing to look; holding hatred is Hengbo's eyes, and the lamp flower mistakenly thought it was him.

Winter Night

It is such a quiet night, there is not a sound around, and everything on the earth has been thrown into the arms of the god of sleep. There is a faint hook of the moon in the sky, and there are two or three gray-white clouds beside the moon, and a few not very bright stars sparsely dotted, which makes the cold night more desolate. The wind is like a thief, coming lightly, and by the time you know it, it has quietly left, leaving you with a piercing feeling.

Occasionally, one or two barks of dogs can be heard from afar. The barking sounds like a wail.

Hunger

Hunger is the torment of the poor, and those who are born in comfort rarely know its taste.

I am afraid of it, this cruel torture! My body is emaciated because of it, and my face is yellow because of it.

When the stomach is empty, golden flowers emerge in front of the eyes, the golden flowers flash on and off, and they are messed up. As a result, the eyes go black and nothing can be seen, only a buzzing sound can be heard in the ears. Cold sweat is coming out in spurts, and the hands and feet have lost their strength. I can't arrange for it, and they have nowhere to go.

Die! I have had the idea of ​​suicide more than once, but I am also looking forward to the future.....

### About Li Xiucheng

— Bao Yu

Loyal King Li Xiucheng was a powerful pillar of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Because of his resourcefulness and bravery, he repeatedly made outstanding achievements. However, later the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's foundation was shaken due to various reasons. Despite his efforts, he could not reverse the decline. As a result, after the fall of Nanjing, the Loyal King was captured and killed, which many people lamented.

However, in the winter of the 28th year, when we were fighting guerrillas with Mr. Wang Yifan in Shuyang, northern Jiangsu, we inadvertently met a "grandson of Li Xiucheng" in the countryside (near Yangkou) while visiting residents. He was a farmer in his seventies and was a little deaf. The surname reported was Zhao, and I can't remember the name now. After we talked, he revealed to us his identity that he usually didn't want to reveal—he was the grandson of Li Xiucheng. He also said that after the Loyal King was arrested, Zeng Guofan tried his best to persuade him to work in the Xiang Army. The Loyal King never agreed, and Guofan, because he cherished his talent, couldn't bear to kill him, so he secretly sent him to the countryside in Shuyang, where he hid his name and worked as a farmer to live out his days.

We were very surprised to hear this. Mr. Yifan also inquired about other related situations. He said that because he was young at the time, he was not very clear. But in the end, he repeated in a firm tone: the Loyal King was not killed.

Later, when we returned to Xinghua, Mr. Yifan specially wrote an article and published it in a magazine there, which attracted the attention of the general public in the guerrilla area.

Today, seeing in the newspaper that there are battles in Shuyang, I am reminded of this incident a few years ago.

Everyone must want to know the truth about the death of the Loyal King, but was he really killed? Now I will make a superficial analysis:

In Zeng Guofan's memorial to the emperor, he narrated that after Li Xiucheng was captured, he was tightly imprisoned in a cage and escorted to Nanjing, where he was still worshiped along the way. Guofan was afraid that he would be hijacked by "bandits" on the way, so he did not send him to the capital, but "executed" him in Nanjing. (Only the general meaning is recorded from memory)

Such a big "major criminal" as Li Xiucheng, of course, needs to be escorted to the capital and executed after careful interrogation, but Guofan "executed" him "nearby" on the grounds of "fear of being hijacked by bandits," which seems to be suspicious; but Zeng Guofan was so loyal to the Qing court and did things so "cautiously," even if he loved Li's talent, we would never believe that he could have such great charm and dare to secretly release this "dangerous person."

At the same time, Li Xiucheng was the most heroic leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. After the fall of Nanjing, he escaped with Fu Tian, ​​prepared to fight to the end. His spirit is worthy of our admiration. If he was arrested and released, could he hide his name in a remote village and live quietly for the rest of his life? This is absolutely impossible.

At that time, we also suspected that this "grandson of Li Xiucheng" was probably not real. He deliberately borrowed the name of Li Xiucheng to raise his status. But such suspicion may be superfluous, because he is a rough farmer, why would he do this?

This old man is a descendant of Li Xiucheng, there is no doubt. But his statement that Xiucheng was "not killed" may be a kind of mental comfort.

I don't know if this old man is still alive now? I miss him.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 153

— Ye Jingfeng

Sure enough, like a thunderbolt, more than a dozen people responded in unison with "fearful emergency attack." Under the dim moonlight, Tsurumi quickly saw that on this small square, some were under the shadow of the houses, and some were at the foot of the trees. There were ten or so piles of people, large and small, fighting to the death there; one group of people were in all kinds of urgent mixed clothes, but one group was uniformly dressed in black short clothes, and even their heads and faces were covered in black; this was the formal fighting uniform of the Black Dragon Society members. In a blink of an eye, Tsurumi saw that the Black Dragon Society members outnumbered the other side by a few people.

"Everyone stop"! Tsurumi ran to the middle of the square and shouted loudly. He was really confused at this time. The members of the Black Dragon Society are of course warriors from Beppu, and there is no need to hesitate. So, who are these people who came here? As for the "Green Field Society," it's a completely fabricated smoke screen. According to the plan, the comrades on our side didn't have this clause of fighting in such a big way. It was just an ambush of a few hidden knives and arrows from all directions, ready to rescue a few people who went to the basement to search for seven secret letters. So, where did this group of killers jump out from? So Tsurumi planned to first find out the origin of the target, and then find a way to solve the problem.

But despite Tsurumi's loud shouts, neither side paid any attention. This made Tsurumi a little angry; the situation was quite embarrassing. Seeing that he had shouted a few times, but still no one paid attention, he challenged, "Tsurumi Tama is here, please teach me."

"Ha, fearful emergency attack"! This was a voice that fell from mid-air—a very familiar voice. Tsurumi turned his head slightly in the direction of the voice, and in just a blink of an eye, he first saw from the ground that there were two or three figures on the edge of the large building projected under the moonlight. He knew that someone was watching the battle on the roof, and listening to the voice, it seemed to be the double-dumb man. Looking up at the roof, he saw that there was indeed someone standing by the railing on the roof platform.

Just in this moment when Tsurumi turned his head, he suddenly heard someone shouting loudly behind him, "Hai!" This voice was wide and sandy, and also夹着some childish voice: the two words shouted were also common spoken language used by Bushido, expressing acceptance of the challenge. Then he heard the voice say, "Let you taste the means of 'Hirano Munen'"! The sound had already reached Tsurumi's side.

Tsurumi knew that someone from the opposing side had come out, and seeing that the momentum was very fast, he should have turned his head to fight back with his sword; but he was not flustered, but turned his body around, aimed at the figure on the roof, held the precious sword with both hands, bent down, and gave a ninety-degree bow; on the one hand, he expressed his composure and paid tribute to the figure; because he knew that there must be a guard among these three figures; on the other hand, because he had skills in kendo, he also wanted to deliberately show off in front of these people. Just as he was about to finish bowing, the sound of footsteps was already approaching, and at the same time, he heard the person coming shout "Ha!" In this shout, Tsurumi had already taken a step, flipped over, the sword light reflected the moon, a small flower, and the opponent's weapon met head-on.
