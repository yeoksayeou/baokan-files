### National Army Advances on Multiple Routes Towards Linyi:
### Su-Lu Battlefield Sees "Pushing Mill" Tactics,
### Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's Forces Face Encirclement

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 3rd] The current Su-Lu war situation is developing into a highly interesting "pushing mill" tactic. According to General Luo, a respected military observer here: the Su-Lu war focuses on Xuzhou. The National Army considers the areas east and west of Xuzhou as two major operational theaters, while the Communist forces, led by Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, are based in southern and southwestern Shandong respectively. As of the evening of the 2nd, Zhang Lingfu's unit, formerly under Wang Yaowu, had recaptured Tancheng on the 1st and was advancing towards Linyi, the Communist stronghold in Shandong, only 30 li away. Another unit, led by Hao Pengju, had also crossed the Yi River and arrived at a designated location, awaiting orders to advance. The Communist forces in Linyi are clearly wavering. This concerns the southern Shandong front. As for the southwestern Shandong front, Liu Bocheng's Communist forces, including the 4th and 5th Columns, are harassing the periphery of Minquan and Dangshan, heading south. In this operational situation, the National Army is encircling from southeast to northeast of Xuzhou, while the Communist forces are encircling from northwest to southwest of Xuzhou, forming a highly interesting "pushing mill" tactic. Although the situation is tense, we consistently maintain a favorable position. Barring unforeseen events, our forces should be able to directly strike Linyi within three days. Conversely, Liu Bocheng's flanking attack on Xuzhou was anticipated and guarded against. This move by the Communist forces is merely a waste of manpower. At this point, General Luo smiled and said that if the Communist forces avoid a decisive battle and retreat into the mountains, it would reveal that their self-proclaimed Zaozhuang victory was nothing more than that. The National Army considers it only the opening act of the Xin'an Battle.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] After the National Army recaptured Tancheng, it formed a "horn-like" position with the garrison at Lincheng on the Jinpu Railway. The five regiments of Zhang Guangzhong's local Shandong military district, the guard brigade from Zaozhuang, Zhang Jianxin's 10th Division from Yi County, as well as Zhang Huating's New 7th Division and Zhang Zhen's 10th Column and Xie Xiangjun's 10th Column in Lincheng and Sihuzhen, are all within the National Army's encirclement.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] After their defeat near Tancheng in southern Shandong, the Communist forces in Linyi are showing signs of wavering. Military transport by the Communist forces is extremely busy on the roads from Linyi to Yi County and Zhucheng. Large numbers of handcarts and wagons have been requisitioned from the populace in recent days to transport food and provisions from Linyi to the rear. Furthermore, to reinforce Linyi, the Communist forces urgently need over ten thousand troops. These are moving south from Mengyin and have already reached the vicinity of Qingtuo Temple, 35-8 li north of Linyi.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The National Army, advancing north beyond Tancheng in southern Shandong, reached Shatun, over 40 li north of Tancheng, this afternoon. The main force of the Communist forces on the banks of the Yi River is collapsing towards Linyi. Chen Yi clearly intends to avoid a decisive battle with the main forces, planning to flee to the Yi-Meng mountain area.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The three columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces, roaming the border areas of Henan and Anhui, invaded Luyi, Haoxian, and elsewhere on the 3rd, encountering a counterattack from a certain unit of the National Army.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 3rd] Recent dispatches from the front lines state that the well-equipped National Army is advancing towards the Communist stronghold of Linyi in southern Shandong along three routes: southeast, southwest, and due south. The city is expected to be recaptured soon. The southern route National Army, after capturing Dabu, 35 miles north of Tancheng, yesterday, is rapidly advancing north. Dabu is 30 miles north of Linyi and 15 miles from Lijiazhuang. After withdrawing from Tancheng, the Communist forces reorganized at Lijiazhuang. The southeast route National Army is rapidly advancing from Ganyu, which is only 38 miles from Linyi. The southwest route National Army is heading directly towards Linyi from Heierzhuang. To impede the National Army's offensive, Liu Bocheng's Communist forces are intensifying activities west of Xuzhou in the eastern part of Henan province. After capturing Zheshan, they have moved into the areas of Xiayi and Yongcheng. The National Army in southwestern Shandong still occupies Jining, Jinxiang, and Heze, but has withdrawn from Shanxian, Caoxian, and Dingtao.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Liu Songfeng, the magistrate of Tancheng County, led personnel into the city on the 3rd to resume official duties and expedite emergency relief efforts.

### No Changes in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway:
### Communist Forces Concentrated in Four Towns Around Baoding,
### Traffic Efficiency on the Pingjin Railway Greatly Reduced

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] There are few changes on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. Reports of the recapture of Dongchangshou are inaccurate. Prices in Shijiazhuang are skyrocketing, with a box of ten cigarettes costing 5,000 yuan. Communist forces are concentrated around Baoding. There are over 3,000 Communist soldiers in Baicheng Village and Xiaoqian Village southwest of Baoding, over 4,000 in Wangjiaqiao, Dazhuang, and Caoqiao southeast of Baoding, over 3,000 in Zangcun and Yincun east of Baoding, over 4,000 in Maguanying on the west bank of the Cao River north of Baoding, over 2,000 in Wuhou southwest of Baoding, over 10,000 in Wuchengzhen, over 10,000 in Shaozhuang, Wucun, and Heilongkou east of Xushui, about 20,000 in Tanghu and Gushan northwest of the city, and over 7,000 in Dawangdian, Suichengzhen, and Xiefangying west of the city. Telephone communication with Baoding is still disrupted. Sun Lianzhong is still ill. Furthermore, after the bridge between Huailai and Kangzhuang on the PingSui Railway was destroyed the night before last, the railway bureau is rushing to repair a temporary bridge. The Pingzhang train remains suspended today.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Baoding, 3rd Dispatch: The National Army south of Shijiazhuang has shifted to a more advantageous position. Xin'an is still under National Army control. The situation in Zhengding has eased. Communist forces near Xushui north of Baoding are still watching for opportunities to attack. There are also reports of fighting in the Yu Jiazhuang area today.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] After failing to seize Zhengding, the Communist forces that occupied Dingxian County are rapidly redeploying north of Shijiazhuang, with a portion of their main force attempting to encircle Huolu and cut off the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan transportation line, isolating Shijiazhuang. The National Army is now fully prepared and is engaging the invading Communist forces. Armored trains are patrolling the line (between Shijiazhuang and Zhengding Touquan) for defense. The situation in Shijiazhuang-Zhengding is now stabilizing.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The Communist forces who have been sabotaging the Pingjin Railway in recent days have mostly fled towards Xianghe after the arrival of the National Army. Strong units of the National Army are rushing to Sanhe to intercept them. The repaired Pingjin roadbed is still soft and only single-track, greatly reducing traffic efficiency. The train from Tianjin to Beiping, which departed at 8:00 AM this morning, only arrived at 6:00 PM tonight. Small groups of Communist forces continue to harass the periphery of Beiping. Communist forces were active in Xinyizhong Street west of Beiping and Tucheng north of Beiping last night. Over two thousand arrived in Dongying Village southeast of Daxing last night. Over a thousand also arrived in Zhai County between Tongxian and Shunyi. Commodity prices in Beiping City have soared due to the war, particularly in the past two days. American flour has reached over 130,000 yuan per bag.

### The United States Envoy's Ordinary Social Interactions
### Unrelated to Government Reorganization

Zuo Shunsheng Expresses Reorganization Opinions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The U.S. envoy hosted a lunch for Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party on the 3rd. According to Zuo, it was an ordinary social gathering. The envoy expressed displeasure at external reports that his activities were related to the reorganization of the Chinese government. It is said that he is responsible for the duties of the U.S. Ambassador and cannot interfere in Chinese internal affairs. The reporter visited Zuo in the evening, asking for his views on the Youth Party's participation in the reorganized government and its relationship with the Communists. Zuo said that the Youth Party's participation in the reorganized government should not be based on the military progress or retreat of the Nationalists and Communists. The reason why a decision has not yet been made on the steps for participation is that it is "easy to say but difficult to do", so it is still under discussion before a decision can be made. The reporter asked whether the method of reorganizing the government would be comprehensive. Zuo said: Yes. At the same time, he said that the government has no objection to this. Finally, the reporter asked that if the Democratic League and the Chinese Communist Party are not able to participate, how will the veto issue be resolved? Zuo said: This is

### Ministry of National Defense Adjusts Structure:
### Establishes Committee for Organization and Structure Adjustment,
### Principle Decided to Reduce Staff by 20%

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Ministry of National Defense has established a committee for reviewing organizational and structural adjustments, headed by Lin Wei, to handle the situation due to the significant difference between the originally listed military expenditure in the national budget for the 36th year and the approved amount. This is in order to save expenses, in addition to continuing the second phase of the troop reduction and reorganization in accordance with the army reorganization plan. Since its establishment, the committee has held meetings to research the matter repeatedly. It is rumored that this adjustment is under consideration, and it has been decided in principle to reduce staff by 20% across the board. To ensure the effectiveness and usefulness of the implementation, it is not the most serious thing.

### Shanghai Commercial Tycoon
### Discusses Economic Situation

Prices are Fighting Inflation

[Our Report] Yesterday, this reporter visited a prominent figure in the Shanghai business community to inquire about his views on the current situation. He said: Because the Chinese Communists firmly reject peace talks, the hope for domestic peace is very slim, which is very regrettable. If the internal strife is prolonged, China will lose its international standing obtained after eight years of hard fighting, and the good opportunity for reconstruction and development will disappear with it. For the sake of national construction and the interests of the nation, everything is hoped that the Chinese Communists will change their policies, strive for political goals through political methods, and abandon the current destructive policies. I am not a member of the Kuomintang, but from the standpoint of the people, I support Chairman Chiang's policy of national reconstruction and development, and the government's use of military force to restore transportation is also a necessary measure. Touching on the current economic situation, he said that inflation has entered a vicious circle stage, and the soaring prices after the New Year are mainly caused by this.

Government Controls Rice:
Can Adopt Rationing System

The government has now adopted a suppression policy. Leaving aside gold, the municipal government is making its best efforts regarding rice in Shanghai. I believe that in addition to finding ways to increase supply, a rationing system must be adopted. Since the municipal government has a large amount of rice in its control, it can distribute rice to households based on residence permits. Otherwise, the price of rice will rise daily, and poor people will suffer from being unable to buy rice. Britain has not abolished the rationing system since its victory to date, which can serve as a reference for our country. The source of coal is not lacking, and with proper handling, it should not be too difficult to resolve. In summary, the current price suppression policy is fighting against inflation, and the people must remain calm and not panic too much. Under today's circumstances, the restoration of the economy to normal is definitely not something that can be achieved in the short term.

The Media Should Use its Power to
Crack Down on Illegal Activities

At the same time, the responsibility of the media at this time is very heavy, because today society's emphasis on newspapers is not the same as before the war. Newspapers should use their great power to assist the government in controlling prices, crack down on illegal activities, and must not, in their reports, fuel the flames and create panic among the people.

### The China Changchun Railway Issue
### Is Still Under Negotiation

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] Regarding the China Changchun Railway issue, the former British Consulate in Shenyang issued a message stating that the China-Soviet negotiations have reached an agreement, hoping to sign it in Beijing, and that some Soviet employees will join the work of the China Changchun Railway. This has now been confirmed to be inaccurate. There are currently more than ten Russians on the railway, some of whom are Soviet citizens, but it is true that China and the Soviet Union are discussing the matter in Nanjing. Relevant parties on the railway said that reaching an agreement between the two sides is not as fast as rumored. Liu Zhe, the Director of the Railway, is scheduled to come to Changchun from Shenyang within three days to inspect.

### Anhui Provincial Government Allocates Ten Million Yuan
### Sends Personnel to Console Guoyang

### After We Vigorously Implemented Import Licenses
### American Merchants Claim to Have Suffered Discrimination
### Demands that the US State Department Clarify

[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] It has recently been learned from here that representatives of major American firms stationed in China have recently sent a telegram to the State Department, describing the situation of being discriminated against in doing business in China, requesting clarification. It is claimed that since China promulgated new import regulations, some people have used political pressure to cause discriminatory treatment in business. The main facts are:

(1) American business representatives stationed in China are no longer able to obtain import licenses for goods beyond the fixed quota, while general semi-political or semi-governmental companies use their relationships to occupy a certain market share.

(2) These companies are also using political and other pressures to absorb agency firms and pre-emptively plan business plans that American companies started months and years ago.

Since the promulgation of the sewing-in restriction regulations on November 17 last year, American merchants have not been able to obtain import licenses for goods worth more than $5,000. As a result, heavy industrial equipment urgently needed for China's reconstruction, although ordered up to 18 months ago, cannot obtain import licenses. At the same time, independent Chinese merchants and American firms also suffer losses because applications for exchange settlement and licenses are delayed in being approved. Contracts blocked due to lack of licenses include the following goods:

(1) Tens of thousands of spindles urgently needed by Chinese cotton mills. (2) Wool spinning machines. (3) Steel urgently needed for buildings. (4) Mining machinery, deep well pumps, cranes, etc., which are urgently needed by China. (5) Machinery needed for steam power plants. (6) Aviation equipment for building airfields. (7) Railway equipment and wheels urgently needed for repairing transportation. (8) Wood pulp, newsprint, and wood. (9) Machines for manufacturing tung oil, sesame oil, vegetable oil, and other edible oils.

Although China claims to be eager to revitalize private industry and restore normal trade, it is being hindered by these policies, and it violates the commercial treaty recently discussed between China and the United States.

### Self-Reliance and Development of the Rural Economy
### Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Have Little Impact

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] This reporter Fang visited Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, on the evening of the 3rd to discuss the current domestic economic situation. Xu said: We do not need to overemphasize international relations or worry about the rise and fall of gold and US dollars. In fact, the smooth path for China's economy lies in developing the rural economy, facing reality, and relying on self-reliance. Fluctuations in foreign exchange have little impact on the national economy. The reporter asked, there are widespread rumors that if the US$500 million loan cannot be established, the domestic economy will encounter a major crisis, how will the government deal with it? Xu said: We should clarify the views, and do not need to take this as a problem, we can definitely rely on self-reliance.

### Liao Yaoxiang Talks to Reporters
### No Problem in Receiving Dalian
### Deputy Commander Zheng Inspects the Defense of Nongjiang

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] Commander Liao Yaoxiang said to reporters: There is no military problem in receiving Dalian, and both land and water routes can be used. If administrative personnel are willing to lead a small number of police officers, they can go to Dalian to carry out the receiving work. Due to the treaty and friendly relations, the Soviet army will definitely not be able to obstruct it, and at the same time, it cannot support the Communist army.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] Liao Yaoxiang said that the only urgent task in the Northeast at present is to earnestly promote county administration, so that the Communist army south of the Songhua River will have no room for activities, otherwise there will be no way to do anything. The power exerted by the people of the Liaodong Peninsula is the best example. Administrative personnel need to take responsibility.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] People here are quite anxious about the fact that the Dalian receiving personnel are far away in Beijing and Shanghai and have not yet arrived.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The Soviet army in the area south of Shihe and between Lushun and Daitong seems to be two divisions, about 20,000 people. If the National Army advances, they may withdraw to Lushun and the areas stipulated in the treaty. The Communist army south of Shihe and in Dalian claims to have 50,000 people, but at present, they no longer have a large amount of power, and the supply and transportation are very difficult.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The National Army's front line is at Zhangjialu, seven miles south of Putian. Pulandian has stabilized. The Communist army on the front is in a deserted area between the National Army and the Soviet army. Without special assistance, it will be difficult to survive. In short, the Communist army here has reached the end of the road, and it is predicted that there will only be two ways out in the future: one is to concentrate generally the power and try to break through the blockade, and the other is to retreat to the islands on the sea, such as the Changshan Islands.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The Far East Peninsula can currently be regarded as the land of happiness in southern Liaoning. The place is peaceful, and specialized goods are coming and going around the clock. This achievement is due to the efforts of the Sixth Army Corps to assist the local government in organizing and training the people to strengthen local self-defense forces, so that the Communist army's activities have been rendered powerless.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 3rd] Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, and his senior staff officer Liu Dexing arrived here by special train at 1:00 PM today. Chairman Liang Huasheng and the commander of the garrison welcomed him at the station. After alighting from the train, Zou went to the Songhua River Hostel to rest.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, Senior Staff Officer Liu Gaocan, and Xing, etc., took a car to Nong'an at 9:00 AM on the 2nd for inspection. Many local garrison leaders, county magistrates, and people all arrived at the station to greet them. Deputy Commander Zheng delivered a speech of about half an hour to the public, and went to the front line to inspect. In the afternoon of the same day, he returned to Changchun by car at 5:00 PM. Also, Deputy Commander Zheng and his party are scheduled to go to Jilin for inspection on the 3rd.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] The Communist army in the Fatha Men Baiqitun area east of the Qita Mu River has gathered more than 30,000 people and has the potential to cross the river and commit crimes again. Sun Liren's army has arrived at the front line to defend Qita Mu.

Today, he personally saw it, and there is indeed a loophole, but today the US side has withdrawn, and the Military Mediation Department will be dissolved accordingly, and there is nothing illegal about it.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] The representatives of the government side of the Military Mediation Department are currently still very busy because they have to assist the withdrawal of the Communist Party and US personnel.

[United Press, Beiping, 3rd] The US liaison group stationed in Yan'an is about to withdraw. The US has had representatives stationed in Yan'an for over two years, and this is now coming to an end. The departure of the US liaison group will sever Yan'an's last contact with foreign countries, as no other country has sent envoys or observers to the area. The US liaison group consists of two officers and one soldier and will leave Yan'an in accordance with the US policy of withdrawing from the Military Mediation Department. US military personnel and their families are currently awaiting the State Department's announcement of its withdrawal from mediation efforts in China, so they can begin to depart. They are currently concluding their affairs and flocking to the famous antique district of Beiping to purchase antiques.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] Ye Jianying has received instructions from Yan'an today, ordering him to take full responsibility for the withdrawal of personnel from the Military Mediation Department. Today, the Communist Party spokesman said that their withdrawal could be completed in two weeks. Personnel from the Changchun branch will be evacuated first, but when this can begin depends on the availability of US aircraft. As of today, the US has not made any notification.

### Criminals in Fujian Granted Amnesty and Reduced Sentences; Over One Hundred People in Two Fuzhou Courts; Taiwan, Pingjin, and Shaanxi Also Release Criminals

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 3rd] The Fujian High Court has formally received the decree on amnesty and reduced sentences for criminals and has instructed all local courts to implement it. It is estimated that approximately thirty people in the High Court and around one hundred people in the Fuzhou District Court meet the criteria for amnesty and reduced sentences. This group of released prisoners can now become new citizens.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] Prisons throughout Taiwan Province released criminals on the 3rd in accordance with the amnesty decree. The First Prison released the first batch of eighty-four criminals who did not require assistance on the afternoon of the 3rd. There were also twelve theft offenders who could have been released on the 3rd. However, because they had been sentenced to life imprisonment under Japanese law in the past, even though the highest penalty for theft under our country's law is only five years of imprisonment, the Taiwan Provincial High Court could not decide whether these twelve people could also be pardoned and has telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions. The Taiwan Provincial Government has allocated 400,000 yuan, the Taiwan Provincial High Court has allocated 400,000 yuan from the prison food budget, and the Taiwan Provincial Protection Society has also allocated 200,000 yuan, totaling one million Taiwan dollars, to assist the 4,492 released prisoners throughout the province. The full amount was distributed on the 3rd.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] The Hebei High Court and local courts have successively released most of the pardoned prisoners. The First Prison released 147 people, the Second Prison released 182 people, 124 people were released on bail, the District Court detention center released 145 people, and 742 people were released on bail, totaling 1,340 people.

The Hualien Port Bureau has decided to complete the port repair project within three months by concentrating manpower and resources, otherwise the port will become a derelict port. The total cost of emergency repairs is estimated at NT$100 million. Due to the large amount, it is planned to raise NT$30 million first to build the most important parts. Hualien Port is a man-made seaport facing the Pacific Ocean, originally known as Huilan Port, because the water flows back and forth and the waves are turbulent.

### Speculation Resurfaces in Jinan; Prices Rise Generally, Market Stagnates; Over 600 Businesses Announce Closure

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] A speculative wind has hit Jinan. Since the Spring Festival, the grocery, tea oil, grain, and coal industries in the city have suffered heavy losses due to sluggish sales. According to investigations, over 600 businesses have officially announced their closure. All industries are now eagerly hoping for the military to expand and the market to expand, so that this situation will not continue to worsen and gradually improve.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] Today's market conditions in Jinan are 20% to 40% higher than at the end of the year. (1) Agricultural products: no market for wheat, millet (per 100 jin) 40,000 yuan, raw rice 55,000 yuan, cotton 21,000 yuan. (2) Industrial products: flour (per bag) 40,000 yuan. After the Executive Yuan reviewed and approved the price (35,000 yuan), the black market gradually disappeared. 20-count Fengshan cotton yarn 2.55 million yuan, raw oil 124,000 yuan per 100 jin. Oil mills have not yet started work, and raw rice has increased in price. The recent outlook is not for a decline.

This year's red market is generally bullish. The reasons are: (1) Stimulated by the issuance of customs gold certificates, speculators are taking advantage of this to stir up trouble. (2) The gold price is rising sharply, breaking through 550,000. (3) After the industrial and commercial sectors passed the New Year, most are taking a wait-and-see attitude. (4) Agricultural product reserves are not large, and prices are rising in other areas. (5) The "heavy goods, light currency" concept of merchants has revived. (6) Idle funds are causing trouble, and speculation is resurfacing. (7) The price of American goods is rising, and domestic goods are rising. In short, the prices of various goods are rising sharply, but with weak social purchasing power and high interest rates, the market is becoming increasingly sluggish. The difference in gold prices between Chongqing and Shanghai remains significant.

### Civil Aviation Meteorological Authorities Closely Consult and Coordinate; Meteorological Equipment at Airports to be Strengthened

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] In view of the recent series of aircraft accidents, most of which are related to meteorology, the Civil Aviation Administration, in addition to (1) accelerating meteorological communication, (2) strengthening meteorological equipment at each airport, and (3) increasing the number of daily observations, has recently consulted with the meteorological authorities on how to closely coordinate to make navigation safer. It is reported that the two sides are still in preliminary discussions. In principle, the two sides agreed that the meteorological authorities should assist the Civil Aviation Administration in carrying out forecasting work at various central stations. According to informed sources, the most difficult aspect of meteorological work in China is the lack of instruments. The instruments ordered from the United States will not arrive until May or June of this year. Although there are some meteorological instruments among the surplus materials, it is still necessary to conduct a survey in Shanghai to determine whether they can be used. Furthermore, the meteorological undertakings in China are far from the standards of Europe and the United States, and the establishment of meteorological stations throughout the country is uneven. The relevant authorities are planning to increase the number of radio stations in North China and the Northeast, so that meteorological information can be widespread throughout the country.

### Essential Points for Compiling Annual Final Accounts: Executive Yuan Orders Subordinate Agencies to Comply

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Executive Yuan has issued an order to all ministries, commissions, provincial and municipal governments, and the Northeast Headquarters Political Committee to comply with the essential points for compiling annual final accounts by central agencies. These points were jointly decided upon by the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, convening accounting personnel from central agencies and representatives from auditing bodies. The essential points are as follows:

A. Compilation Deadline: (1) Agencies that have not yet compiled and submitted their final accounts for the 33rd year of the Republic [1944] should have their second-level responsible agencies complete the compilation by the end of February of the 36th year of the Republic [1947], and submit three copies to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and another copy to the responsible first-level agency.

If the first-level agency itself has not yet compiled and submitted its final accounts for the 34th year, it should be completed within the aforementioned deadline and submit three copies to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The final accounts of agencies directly under the National Government should be compiled and submitted according to the aforementioned deadline. The final accounts of the national treasury, military expenditures, and the overall revenue final accounts should all be compiled and submitted to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics by the end of March.

### Editorial: The Crux of the Dalian Problem

When Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui spoke with reporters in Nanjing yesterday about the issue of taking over Dalian, he stated, "Small problems cannot be discussed until the big problems are resolved. Recently, the municipal government sent people to inspect Dalian City. There are 40,000 to 50,000 Communist troops within the city, and Soviet troops are not stationed there. The city lacks food, and some people have starved to death." Gong continued, "I have also frequently met with Ambassador Petrov in Nanjing. The ambassador has asked when we plan to take over, saying that both land and sea routes can be used. The problem lies with the Communist troops. If only a small number of people are sent, the takeover cannot be achieved. If troops are sent to assist, a major conflict with the Communist troops will inevitably occur." According to news reports, the focus of the Dalian takeover is: (1) How the Sino-Soviet parties jointly manage the Japanese industries that are to be taken over; (2) How the Sino-Soviet parties jointly maintain law and order. It is said that the latter has been resolved, while there are major differences of opinion on the former. At the same time as the Dalian mayor's statement, news from the United States also raised our concerns about the Dalian issue.

U.S. Republican Senator Bridges recently issued a statement on U.S. foreign policy, stating, "The Soviet Union's activity in another corner of the world is also worthy of attention. The plundering of Manchuria has set back China's development by several generations. A great power stood by while China fought a desperate battle, only joining the war in the week that Japan was defeated, and now it controls China's ports, railways, and cities. It was American pressure that made China give up most of its land and sovereignty. In return, Moscow clearly promised to help the Chinese National Government and its army take over the rule of Manchuria and other regions. Therefore, the United States cannot be indifferent to Russia's failure to fulfill its promises and its treatment of China not as an ally but as if it were a defeated country." At the same time, the Howard newspaper of the United States stated, "We have already seen the Moscow-style 'coalition government' in places like Poland and Yugoslavia, and we do not want to see the emergence of such a coalition government again. It is necessary for the United States and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement in the Far East, but first, the U.S. and Soviet troops in Korea, Manchuria, and the liberated areas of China must be withdrawn, so that the people of each country can freely organize their own governments according to their own needs and aspirations. For the United States and the Soviet Union, this is the only truly democratic way to solve the Far East problem."

Now that the United States has declared that it is abandoning mediation and preparing to withdraw its troops stationed in China, and the takeover of Dalian has not even begun to show promise, it is truly regrettable. According to the Dalian mayor's statement, there are no Soviet troops in Dalian, but there are 40,000 to 50,000 Communist troops. According to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 1945, the Soviet Union has an obligation to assist the Chinese National Government in taking over the rule of Dalian, but for more than a year, the Soviet Union seems to have not only failed to provide the aforementioned assistance, but has also allowed a military regime that resists the Chinese government to be established in Dalian, which is a very regrettable matter. As for the reported point of how the Sino-Soviet parties should jointly manage the Japanese industries to be taken over, this really should not become a problem. According to reason, the Japanese industries in Dalian should be taken over by China, and that should not be a problem. If, in fact, the Japanese industries in Dalian have been completely changed beyond recognition over the past year or so, that can also be resolved through negotiation, and it seems that this should not delay the takeover of Dalian.

Regarding the Dalian issue, it is still remembered that on the 3rd of last month, the US government sent a note to the governments of China and the Soviet Union requesting that the two countries implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty agreement on Dalian, so that Dalian could return to normal under the administration of the Chinese government. In this note: "The United States government recognizes that this issue should be resolved through direct negotiations between China and the Soviet Union, but for the general interest, the United States must consider itself responsible for raising this issue with the two governments directly concerned." At that time, this newspaper published an article urging China and the Soviet Union to implement the agreement on Dalian: "It is hoped that the Soviet Union can reflect on itself, cherish the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and earnestly fulfill all treaties between China and the Soviet Union." However, it has been more than a month since the aforementioned note was issued, and the takeover of Dalian has still not become a reality.

According to the statement of the mayor of Dalian, he maintains regular contact with Ambassador Petrov, and the Sino-Soviet representatives are once again meeting in Pulandian, so the progress of the takeover of Dalian has not stalled. Given the recent statement by the United States that it is preparing to withdraw its troops stationed in China, we hope that in order to fulfill the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, except as stipulated in the treaty, the Soviet Union should also withdraw its troops stationed in China as soon as possible. As for the anti-government armed regimes in the Soviet sphere of influence, they should not be allowed to exist and should be eliminated in a timely manner. Then, the takeover of Dalian can be realized in a timely manner.

Vortex River County Suffers Particularly Severely from Communist Army Looting

The Anhui Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has transported a large batch of materials to the counties for relief. The provincial government has dispatched Fan Ren, Director of the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, to go within days to handle relief work in the disaster area and inspect municipal affairs in various counties. Chairman Li believes that Guoyang has suffered particularly severely from the Communist army's looting this time, and has donated 10 million yuan to increase relief for Guoyang. Li Guanghao, Director of the Security Headquarters, will take the funds to distribute and comfort the people.

[Our Newspaper Hefei Report] Guoyang was invaded by the Communist army this time. From the night of the 6th to the 10th, the National Army drove them back. When the Communist army was leaving, they kidnapped more than 4,000 local youths and looted all the businesses in the city, setting fire to more than 200 houses and relief supplies. Now, the people of the entire county are eagerly awaiting relief.

[Our Newspaper Bengbu Report] After the expansion of the war in southern Shandong, refugees from counties such as Teng, Fei, Tan, and Lin, unable to bear the Communist army's harsh treatment, have left their homes and villages to escape south. As of the end of January, more than 430 people had arrived in Bengbu via Xuzhou. They are living in the model elementary school on Gongyuan Road. Mayor Li Pin and others have asked the Anhui Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate flour for relief. However, the allocation was stopped after only five days.

### UN Security Council to Reopen Today, US and Soviet Views Remain Distant

Disarmament and Atomic Energy Control Cases Face Another Test

[United Press, New York, 3rd] The United States has a firm stance on the issues of universal disarmament and atomic energy control, which will face another test at tomorrow's Security Council meeting. However, judging from the current situation, its progress may not be smooth. First, the Soviet Pravda stated that the US atomic energy control plan seems likely to be rejected. All five countries with veto power in the Security Council, except the Soviet Union, have accepted the US plan, so this statement by the newspaper is equivalent to the Soviet Union preparing to obstruct it. Second, the US plan was presented to representatives of other countries in advance, and many expressed indifference, which aroused strong opposition from the Soviet Union. However, despite the unfavorable situation, US Representative Austin does not intend to change his original intention. Austin's plan was drafted after meetings with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall. It is reported that Washington has received full reports on the preliminary discussions between Austin and the representatives. The Soviet Union insists on retaining the veto power when sanctioning any country that violates atomic energy control, while the United States has repeatedly stated that it should be abolished. Austin's plan includes three points: (1) Establish a disarmament committee, which must not interfere with the work of the Atomic Energy Commission or deal with any weapons of mass destruction; (2) First set up a drafting sub-committee to define the scope of work of the disarmament committee; (3) At the next Security Council meeting, discuss the report submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission.

[Agence France-Presse, Baltimore, 3rd] US Senator Tydings recently stated in a radio address: Even if atomic bombs are prohibited, they will still be used in the event of war. Since the United Nations cannot regard atomic bombs as illegal during the period of peace between two wars, it should find a way to eliminate this weapon once and for all. This matter should be resolved in conjunction with the general disarmament issue and should not be dealt with separately.

### Truman's New Approach: Resolving International Disputes Through Normal Diplomatic Channels; Marshall to Visit Germany and Austria En Route to Moscow; Bevin Does Not Plan to Fly to Moscow

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd Radio: The Three-Power Summit Meeting was a system adopted by the late President Roosevelt during the war. According to reliable sources, President Truman has abandoned this system and advocates using normal "diplomatic methods" or foreign ministers' meetings to resolve international issues. Although President Truman declared that if Stalin and Attlee could come to Washington, a Three-Power Summit Meeting could be held, in reality, President Truman believes that even a Three-Power Summit Meeting in Washington is unnecessary. He believes that he should meet with the leaders of various countries individually and cannot exclude France. In addition, senior officials of the US State Department are against summit meetings, believing that such meetings are tantamount to diplomats overstepping their bounds. They also pointed out the following reasons why such meetings should not be held: (1) Summit meetings should only be held during wartime; (2) Summit meetings may cause rumors of secret treaties; (3) Summit meetings are not suitable for democratic countries, but only beneficial to dictatorial countries such as the Soviet Union; (4) Summit meetings are actually a formula for the Soviet Union to divide the world.

### Soviet Attitude on Austrian Peace Treaty Unclear

Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference Encounters Obstacles Again

[Our Dispatch] London, 3rd Radio: The British Foreign Office expressed optimism about the prospects of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference, believing that the conference has been half completed. However, the American observation does not think so, believing that the Soviet Union is deliberately delaying the signing of the Austrian peace treaty.

[United Press, London, 3rd] The prospect of concluding the Austrian peace treaty seems to depend on whether the Soviet Union is willing to make concessions at the Foreign Ministers' Conference this week. According to reliable sources, the three main obstacles to the current work on the Austrian peace treaty are (1) the handling of industrial property in Austria and Germany, and (2) how to ensure that Austria will not merge with any country in the future. It is learned that whether the Soviet Union is willing to withdraw its troops stationed in Austria within ninety days after the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty can be decided this week. If the Soviet Union is willing to do so, the other three powers will not hesitate to withdraw their troops, and the French army is willing to withdraw even earlier.

Truman stated that this point is necessary for the repatriation and supply transportation of troops stationed overseas and is related to the issue of repatriation. Truman stated that if various controls continue to be extended, the date of their abolition should be done as soon as possible.

[United Press, Miami, Florida, 2nd] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov stated today in a speech to the Miami branch of the US-Soviet Friendship Association that the shadows that have recently darkened US-Soviet relations do not truly reflect the state of affairs between the two great nations. The new war panic in 1946 was created by "certain political groups" to promote a new war, sow anxiety and suspicion, and facilitate exploitation. Former British Prime Minister Churchill is one of them, who has appeared openly or coyly, engaging in organized obstruction and advocating "alliance" against the Soviet Union. Novikov also emphasized friendship with the United States, saying that the Soviet people greatly admire and will never forget the assistance and brilliant achievements of the American people. The friendship between the people of the four countries, who played an important role in the struggle to defeat the common enemy, should shoulder a greater mission in today's peaceful times.

However, the reason for Morlière's return has not yet been revealed, but it is known that Laune and his senior military and political advisors reviewed the situation in Vietnam for two hours last night, after which the order to recall Morlière was issued. Although French Colonial Minister Moutet stated that the above meeting was to discuss transportation and the evacuation of overseas Chinese, according to French media observers, the French government believes that the time to resolve the Vietnam issue peacefully has matured. Although the French army has achieved initial success, one observer believes that the French government intends to adopt a policy of compromise with the Viet Minh government, replace the military governor with a civilian official. The replacement of Dalat and other officials is one of the main demands put forward by Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh.

[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd Radio: The French and Vietnamese authorities in northern Vietnam are each reinforcing their troops in Hanoi and taking strict measures to consolidate their positions. The Viet Minh radio broadcast an order for troops in various regions to adopt a scorched earth policy, while the French ordered the conscription of men aged 18 to 50 in Hanoi to form security teams to assist the French army in combat.

### Various Aspects of the Anglo-French Alliance

If the United Kingdom and France can formally conclude a treaty of alliance, it will contribute to maintaining the security and peace of Europe, but its significance is not as great as the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The recent ambiguity of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the treaty has made many European countries uneasy.

After French Prime Minister Blum visited London, he announced the news that the United Kingdom and France would conclude an alliance treaty, which seemed a bit sudden. But the agreement itself is not surprising at all. The British and French governments have repeatedly expressed their willingness to conclude a treaty of alliance, but it has not been successful because the French cabinet insisted on putting forward conditions before the negotiations.

The Process of Anglo-French Treaty Negotiations

When this issue was raised shortly after the liberation of Europe, because General de Gaulle was very unhappy about the events in Syria and Lebanon, he insisted that these two issues must be resolved first before he would consider negotiating the treaty. Not only that, he further wanted Britain to support his proposal to separate the Rhineland and the Ruhr area from Germany. But Britain was unwilling to buy this.

De Gaulle resigned last year. The acting [Prime Minister] Gouin was very much in favor of concluding a treaty. However, Bidault was still the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, and he still insisted that Britain must support France's demands on the Rhineland before the treaty could be discussed. As a result, to the regret of Gouin and the British ministers, the proposal for the treaty was once again abandoned. Bevin reported in the House of Commons that "the alliance between the two countries must be based on mutual friendship without conditions." Blum took a broader and more realistic attitude towards this issue, so that the original problem was no longer a problem.

The Three Great Powers of Europe Form an Integrated Whole

Unless unexpected difficulties arise, this Anglo-French negotiation should be very brief. Because everyone believes that the Anglo-French treaty should be in the same format as the Anglo-Soviet treaty and the Franco-Soviet treaty. After the Anglo-French treaty is signed, the three great powers of Europe can help each other in the event that Germany rises again in the future. However, people can't help but ask this question: Is this three-nation alliance system as strong in fact as it is on paper? We must not ignore several disturbing signs: the most obvious of which is the Soviet Union, which occupies an important position in the triangular alliance. Recently, there has been a definite lack of enthusiasm for the alliance.

Bevin's True Meaning Was Misunderstood by the Soviet Union

First, when Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed extending the term of the Anglo-Soviet treaty from 20 years to 50 years, the Soviet government did not respond. Soviet newspapers instead asked, what is the value of this treaty, whether it is 20 years or 50 years? Recently, the official newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party even accused Bevin of denying the obligations of the treaty in his Christmas night speech, taking it out of context. In fact, what Bevin said was merely an explanation that British policy was not bound by American policy. He said that British policy is not bound by any country except to fulfill the obligations of the UN Charter. This meaning is very clear, especially since these alliances between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are definitely regarded by Britain as part of the UN system, and their obligations are of course within the scope of the Charter obligations.

But this sentence was misinterpreted by the Soviet Union to make the whole world—including Germany—know that at least part of the security mechanism is inactive, or that the Soviet Union has regarded this part as inactive. However, we note that if Moscow was truly worried about the meaning of Bevin's words, why did they not immediately ask Britain to "explain"? They did not ask or request an explanation, but suddenly launched an attack three weeks after the speech was published.

The Soviet Attitude Is Disturbing

We are not very clear about the motives behind the Soviet Union's actions. But one of the results is very obvious. In this way, it cannot but arouse the hopes of German nationalists. They think that the security mechanism may be just a façade. If Germany makes a considerable response to the Soviet Union's constant expressions of friendship, perhaps the Soviet Union will soon change from a caretaker to a friend, or even become a neutral country in the future when Germany has conflicts with Western countries.

In this way, the unsoundness of the European security system lies in the ambiguous attitude of the Soviet ally and Germany. If the Soviet Union can clearly announce its policy and accept the proposal to extend the Anglo-Soviet treaty to 50 years, it will strengthen European security more than the Anglo-French treaty.

### Unified Command of Military, Police, and Gendarmerie; Formation of Nine Inspection Brigades; City Divided into Eight Districts with an Additional Water Area; Hotel Inspections Limited to Completion Before Midnight

The city area is vast and the population large. The Garrison Headquarters Inspection Department, the Gendarmerie Regiment, and the Police Bureau each have their duties in maintaining public order, conducting inspections, and handling related cases. However, there are unavoidable overlaps. For example, regarding the night-time inspection of hotels, the military, police, and gendarmerie are all obligated to conduct inspections to prevent evildoers from hiding. However, ordinary travelers generally find this troublesome. It is now learned that Commander Xuan of the Garrison Headquarters, recognizing this, has decided to unify the military, police, and gendarmerie within the garrison area. Eight inspection districts and one water inspection district will be established within the area, jointly organized by personnel from the Inspection Department, Police Bureau, and the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment. Each inspection district will form an inspection brigade consisting of personnel from the military, police, and gendarmerie. The organization, tasks, and inspection methods are detailed in the organizational regulations of the Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters. After the inspection brigade is established, the Inspection Department, Gendarmerie Regiment, and Police Bureau will no longer conduct inspections independently. Hotel inspections are stipulated to be completed before 12:00 midnight.

Inspection Procedures Strive for Simplification

It is further stipulated that inspection procedures should be simplified. Ordinary people will be handled by the police, while military personnel will be handled by the gendarmerie. The inspection officers dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters are responsible for on-site command and supervision. The Garrison Headquarters has already drafted these organizational regulations for the inspection brigade and Commander Xuan reviewed and revised them yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. He has ordered his subordinates to establish all district inspection brigades by the 10th of this month and formally announce the organizational regulations for implementation.

District Division Already Determined

The division of inspection districts has been finalized. There are a total of eight inspection districts and one water inspection district: The first district includes Huangpu, Laoza, and Xincheng; the second district includes Hongkou, the southern part of the North Station, and the southern part of Zhabei; the third district includes Taishan and Chujiawan; the fourth district includes Yilian and Penglai; the fifth district includes Xinshi Street, North Sichuan Road, the northern part of the North Station, the northern part of Zhabei, Yangshupu, Yulin, and Tilanqiao; the sixth district includes Putuo, Jiangning, Jing'an Temple, Changning, and Xinjing; the seventh district includes Changshu, Xujiahui, and Longhua; the eighth district includes Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Yangsi; the water inspection district includes all rivers within the garrison area.

Bishop Yu Bin ascended the pulpit to praise the bishop's past management of diocesan affairs and to encourage the Shanghai Catholic Action Association to continue its efforts in charity and education in the spirit of the late President Bohong. Subsequently, Nuncio Liberati solemnly conducted a grand Mass. The Yixin Elementary and Middle School military band and the Catholic Salesian Society choir sang scriptures. The music was sonorous and the songs were bright. The ceremony lasted two hours. At the end, Nuncio Liberati, on behalf of the Pope, bestowed blessings on all the Catholics in the church. After the Mass, the Shanghai Diocesan Catholic Action Association and other groups and representatives of Catholics held a celebration in the auditorium. During the event, Lu Yinggeng raised his glass, representing all groups and male and female Catholics, to congratulate Archbishop Hui on his inauguration, wishing him good health and expressing the affection of all Catholics. Cheers resounded. Archbishop Hui then delivered a thank you speech and the event ended with photographs.

### Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Representatives Reschedule Trip to Nanjing for This Morning

[Our Newspaper] The delegation of the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, Luo Weiji, Zhou Shouyu, Hu Richou, He Shouyan, and Secretary Shi Zuolun, originally scheduled to go to Nanjing last night, have changed their trip to an early train this morning due to ticket issues. They plan to stay in Nanjing for about a week, intending to appeal for assistance to the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Overseas Department, and the Central Party Headquarters.

### Shanghai-Philippines Flights of Far Eastern Air Transport to Resume Soon

Far Eastern Air Transport of the Philippines was ordered to suspend flights after the "Miss Luzon" accident. It is now learned that the suspension period has expired and all Far Eastern Air Transport flights, except those to Shanghai, have resumed. According to a responsible person at the company's Shanghai office, flights between Shanghai and the Philippines will also resume in the near future.

(Another report) For Sino-French air transport affairs, China National Aviation Corporation has decided to dispatch aircraft to Bangkok and major cities in Vietnam in the near future to inspect routes and various facilities, in order to decide on the opening of air routes. According to personnel from the French airline's Shanghai office, after the initial inspection mission of the China National Aviation Corporation is completed, the French airline will send aircraft for a second trial flight to China to discuss the date for the simultaneous opening of air routes by both China and France.

### 49 Airfields Planned Between Guangzhou-Nanjing and Chengdu-Shanghai Routes; Pilots Consider it Impractical

[Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation flight personnel recently organized a pilots association, including 65 American pilots, co-pilots, navigators, and radio operators, and 150 Chinese personnel. The association held its fourth regular meeting last night to discuss the Civil Aviation Administration's recently proposed flight improvement plan and other related civil aviation matters.

The association submitted a letter to President Chiang, President Song, Minister Yu, and Director Dai three weeks ago, suggesting that the wireless communications and all aviation facilities along all routes should be planned, closely coordinated, and operated by the government. Any licensed aircraft should be able to land at any airfield in case of emergency. The Civil Aviation Administration announced a plan last Friday to build 49 small airfields along the Guangzhou-Nanjing and Shanghai-Chengdu (including the Kunming branch line) north-south and east-west routes. This can be seen as an indirect response to their suggestions. However, this plan is estimated to take ten months to complete, and experienced pilots believe it is too wasteful and impractical.

### Second Batch of German Overseas Chinese to be Repatriated Mid-Month; Each Allowed to Take US$200

[Our Newspaper] The second batch of German overseas Chinese will be repatriated to Germany on the 16th of this month. The relevant foreign affairs authorities in the city have made the necessary preparations, notifying all German overseas Chinese to get vaccinated and ordering them to find guarantors to avoid any unexpected incidents. Those who fail to find guarantors will be housed in the British barracks on Great Western Road as a gathering place before boarding the ship. Each person is allowed to take US$200 when leaving Shanghai, and the amount of luggage will be determined according to the amount of luggage taken by German overseas Chinese repatriated from Tokyo. It is understood that there are still over a thousand German overseas Chinese remaining in China, mostly employed by various agencies. In the past, there was a German overseas Chinese concentration camp in Jiangwan, but it was closed after the first batch of repatriations last year, so there is no longer a dedicated management agency.

### Repeatedly Proven Effective in Ancient Books; Foreign Reporters Go Wild Trying to Stand Eggs on the Night of Lichun (Start of Spring)

[Our Newspaper] Today is the Lunar Lichun (Start of Spring) in China. According to ancient Chinese books "Tongtian Jian" and "Kexue Huajing", eggs can stand upright on this day, regardless of size.

Yesterday at 11:45 PM, the moment of the start of Lichun, the home of Wei Jingrong, director of the International Propaganda Office in Shanghai, gathered many foreign reporters, including Randall from the United Press, Mrs. Wales from the International News Service, and Frank Shaw from Reader's Digest. They scrambled to stand eggs on the floor, with great enthusiasm, as if drunk, and were extremely excited.

According to Mr. Wei, eggs can stand at any time, but they are especially easy to stand at Lichun. During Lichun two years ago, he entertained foreign reporters at his home and demonstrated standing eggs. The foreigners were very excited. After "Life" published the photos, it caused a sensation throughout the United States. To this day, the enthusiasm has not waned. According to reports, eggs in New York have been bought up by "standing egg guests."

Eggs can stand not only on dirt, but also on cement, floors, tables, glass, mirrors, and cups.

The time required to stand an egg varies. Some happen by chance, and stand as soon as they are placed down. Others require one or two minutes of patience and effort. Of course, there are also those that stand after an hour. According to the reporter's observation, the first requirement for standing an egg is calmness.

As for the reason why eggs stand on this day, there is no definite answer, and the great scientist Einstein once dismissed the "egg can stand at Lichun" theory as nonsense.

The reporter has heard several explanations, which are mentioned "for what it's worth." One theory is that the air density is particularly dense at Lichun, so it is easier to stand. Another is that a "yang energy" rises from the ground before and after "Lichun". Still another theory is that the yolk condenses and sinks. But these are mostly unreliable theories. The correct explanation still awaits scientific research. (The photo shows the enthusiastic scene of standing eggs, taken by this newspaper)

### Bandits Invade Xinqiao Town; Self-Defense Corps Surrounded and Disarmed; Shanghai Police Bureau Orders All Branches to Assist in Apprehension

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, more than a hundred bandits suddenly rushed from the direction of Songjiang to Xinqiao Town in the suburbs of Songjiang. Armed with light and heavy machine guns, new-style Mauser pistols, and other weapons, they surrounded the self-defense corps stationed in the town. Although the corps members discovered them at the time, they were outnumbered and ultimately had over twenty large and small firearms confiscated and fled. Afterwards, the person in charge of the corps reported to his superiors, requesting assistance in apprehension. After receiving this information, the patrol police of the Longhua Police Bureau urgently reported to Branch Chief Lu Bihu. Due to the seriousness of the situation, he telegraphed the General Bureau to report. The police then returned the order to all branches in the city to pay close attention to assisting in the apprehension.

### Zhang Lianhang Released from Prison After Serving Sentence

His defense lawyer, Tang Huaiqun, presented evidence stating: According to an investigation by the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce, there is no person named Jiang Weicheng, only Ge Jiangzhen served as the pseudo-director of the bureau in the county, which proves that the defendant is taking the blame for others.

### A Lucky Survivor from the Disaster; Paul Vreede's Condition Improves; To Be Sent Back to the United States in Six Weeks

[Our Newspaper] Paul Vreede, the only survivor of China National Aviation Corporation Flight 145, which crashed in Tianmen County, Hubei Province, on January 28, was only 14 months old. He was flown to Shanghai by special plane and suffered only a hip injury. He is currently being treated at Hong En Hospital.

[Our Newspaper] After the bodies of the deceased passengers of China National Aviation Corporation Flight 145 from Shanghai to Chongqing were transported to Hankou, some were buried locally yesterday, and the company will assist the remaining family members who wish to transport the bodies back to their hometowns. Ten Chinese and foreign family members residing in Shanghai boarded a free flight to Hankou the day before yesterday to handle the aftermath.

[Another report] When the reporter visited a spokesperson for China National Aviation Corporation yesterday and asked whether the company's board of directors could adopt and implement the suggestions from various sectors to improve flight safety facilities, he said: The most difficult thing is the lack of funds. The country is too poor and many plans cannot be realized. As for the rumors that the company's general manager, Shen Deshe, had resigned to take responsibility, the spokesperson flatly denied them.

### Post Office to Launch Registered Mail with Declared Value Next Month

[Our Newspaper] After resuming insured parcels, the Shanghai Postal Administration will launch registered mail with declared value from February 1. The maximum declared value is 50,000 yuan, and it is not limited to airmail. Registered mail with declared value can be sent to all large and small locations with domestic postal services. For items exceeding 50,000 yuan, insured parcels will be used. In addition, the postal district delivery system planned by the bureau has been decided to be implemented from February 1. Currently, it is training personnel for this system and printing various charts for distribution to citizens. After this system is implemented, it can save half the manpower.

### Health Bureau Exhausted; 100,000 Tons of Garbage; Still Uncleared

[Our Newspaper] The city's garbage and feces problem has not yet been properly resolved. The Health Bureau will invite all relevant parties to convene a cleanliness conference in mid-February to discuss improving transportation methods and management systems. It is heard that commercial cleaning companies may be contracted to transport the waste.

According to the Health Bureau, the city currently has only two-thirds of the garbage transportation tools and three-fifths of the workers it had before the war. Based on the commodity price index for the second half of 1946, the funding is only two-thirds of what it was before the war. However, the amount of garbage produced has increased by one-third compared to before the war. The Health Bureau is limited by funding and cannot expand its work. Sanitation workers are paid low wages, so they often solicit liquor money from merchants during the holidays. Although public notices have been issued to strictly prohibit this, it is feared that it will still be difficult to avoid in reality. Therefore, it was previously suggested that a cleaning surcharge or cleaning tax be established to improve the treatment of sanitation workers, so that they can work with peace of mind and increase work efficiency. This tax is also established in many inland cities. However, it was ultimately rejected by the City Council. Before the war, there was one sanitation worker for every 500 residents in the city, but now there is one for every 800. During the enemy and puppet period, a total of 100,000 tons of garbage accumulated in the ruins of Nanshi and Zhabei, but due to funding limitations, it has not been possible to clear it to this day. Currently, it can only ensure that no more is added.

### Restrictions on Electric Heating to be Lifted; Giant Generator Arrives in Shanghai and is Installed; Electricity to Increase by More Than 30,000 Kilowatts Next Month

[Our Newspaper] The 22,500-kilowatt generator of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which was shipped to the United States for repairs last year, arrived here a few days ago and has been installed. It is currently being tested. It will be officially generating electricity in a week. However, due to the limited number of boilers in use and the need to repair some old generators, the electricity increase at that time will only be six or seven thousand kilowatts.

The company's high-pressure boilers and generators will not be repaired until the end of this month. After all work is completed, the city's electricity supply can be increased by more than 30,000 kilowatts.

It is understood that the restrictions on the use of electric heating may be lifted in mid-March.

### Agricultural Woman from Nanhui Dies Tragically; Coffin Moved to Shanghai for Re-examination; Truth of Death Revealed; Determined to Be Drowning

The case of a husband allegedly murdering his wife in Nanhui County, which caused a sensation, was re-examined yesterday morning at the Tongren Yuantang Mortuary on Linsen East Road in Shanghai because the local judicial authorities lacked the equipment for re-examination.

The case involves Sun Meigen, a 41-year-old farmer from Sunjiaqiang Circle in Northwest Tanzhi Bridge Town, Nanhui County (who served as a pseudo-township chief during the enemy and puppet period), who married Ms. Gu, also known as Gu Xiaomei or Gu Jinying, 42 years old. The couple had been married for 24 years. They had a very good relationship and had three sons and two daughters, all of whom were grown. Sun was fond of women and had an affair with Min Xinjuan, the wife of carpenter Ah Qi, when he served in the pseudo-government. He rented a house outside and lived with her as husband and wife, treating his first wife as a thorn in his side. On the morning of December 6 last year, Ms. Gu was suddenly found dead in a nearby creek. Township Chief Zhong Bin reported the case to the Xinchang Public Office, which forwarded it to the county judicial authorities. On December 8, personnel were sent to the countryside to examine the body. The examination found no injuries on the body and determined that she had drowned. After reporting the situation, Gu Yubing and others, relatives of the deceased, believed that the deceased had told her nephews and nieces that "I will surely die of illness, never commit suicide." Her sudden death was definitely murder, and her husband was avoiding them. They petitioned the judicial authorities to request a re-examination to clear her name. The judicial authorities approved the re-examination and had the body transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang Mortuary in Shanghai. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Wei Ligong, director of forensic medicine at the local prosecutor's office, and forensic doctor Gong Ziwei, arrived at the scene for the re-examination. The county judicial police chief and the corpse's relatives also arrived to watch. The morticians then removed the body, which had been blackened, from the coffin and placed it on a wooden platform. Forensic doctor Wei and others dissected the body, removing all the heart and lungs. After the procedure was completed in one and a half hours, the morticians were ordered to prepare the body for burial. At that time, in order to understand the truth of the death, the relatives asked Director Wei whether the deceased was thrown into the river after death or drowned while alive. Forensic doctor Wei replied that based on the observations, the body was determined to have drowned while alive, for the following reasons: (1) When the body was found floating in the creek, the back was facing up and the abdomen was facing down, which is the opposite if the body was thrown in after death. (2) The current examination found water in the lungs and stomach of the body. If the body had been thrown into the river after death, there would be no water in the lungs and stomach.

### Large Quantities of Seafood Smuggled; Customs Investigating

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the situation of the customs seizing large quantities of smuggled goods, the reporter interviewed Shen Shikun, deputy commissioner of the anti-smuggling section of the Shanghai Customs, who said: The seizure of smuggled seafood is indeed the case, the value is very large, and it involves more than two ships. The smuggled goods were transported from Korea. The details are currently under investigation. Shen also said that Shanghai's smuggling incidents have gradually decreased recently due to the strict anti-smuggling patrols of the customs. Shen previously suggested to the Ministry of Finance that severe criminal penalties be imposed on smugglers, but has not yet received a reply. Shen said that if this measure can be formulated, it is believed that it will have a positive effect on preventing smuggling.

### Six Suspected Traitors from Ningbo Deny Accusations; Trial Concluded Awaiting Judgment

[Our Newspaper] The High Court heard the cases of six suspected traitors yesterday morning, all of whom were accused of abusing their power to oppress the local people in Ningbo during the period of its occupation by the enemy and puppets. (1) Liu Bin, from Ningbo, studied in Japan in his early years. When Ningbo was occupied, he served as a translator in the pseudo-Towns Joint Association and provided intelligence work for the enemy Gendarmerie. (2) Cai Yanbang, from Taiwan, served as a translator in the enemy Gendarmerie. (3) Huang Zhifang, from Ningbo, claimed that in order to cover up underground anti-Japanese work, he served as the director of the pseudo-Security Brigade Office. After the victory, he maintained order in Ningbo under the order of Yu Jimin, the special commissioner of the Sixth District of Zhejiang, and denied that he had extorted property from the people by relying on the enemy and puppet forces. (4) Sun Liangui, a warrant officer of the pseudo-Ningbo Security Brigade, stated: "In order to facilitate business, I nominally held the position and did not actually work." (5) Wang Jian, originally a soldier in the 17th Division of the National Army, was injured and went to Ningbo for treatment. He was arrested by Sun Liangui and served as a secret agent for the enemy Gendarmerie. (6) Lin Yifu, a former policeman in Shanghai before the war, set up a flour company and a firewood shop in Ningbo after its occupation, providing supplies to the enemy's field warehouse. The above six people appeared in court yesterday morning to be tried. They unanimously denied the points in the indictment. Rebuttal lawyers Qin Shouzhang, Cao Lin, Ge Zhi, Fang Zhong, Xia Gengkai and others defended. Chief Judge Liu announced the conclusion of the debate in the case and set the sentencing for the morning of the 10th.

In addition, a typhoid vaccination certificate is also required.

### British Expert to Seek Welfare for the Blind Arrives in Shanghai via Hong Kong Today

[Report from our Newspaper] Sir MacQuetzy, a British welfare expert, has recently been invited by the Executive Yuan to come to China to assist the government in planning to prevent blindness, treat blindness, and provide welfare services such as relief and training for the blind. The Executive Yuan authorities have assisted the Ministry of Social Affairs in jointly operating the Reconstruction Center for the Wounded, located within the Executive Yuan's 15th Branch District. They have also provided relief supplies and funds to more than 80 units of institutions for the wounded and disabled.

### Two Senior Customs Officials Investigated for Alleged Embezzlement of Enemy Property

[Report from our Newspaper] Ding Guitang, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, was previously reported to have embezzled materials worth 100,000,000 at No. 340 Dengtuo Road. After Liu Bingyi, the Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office stating that he would send Qian Zongqi, a Tax Commissioner in the Secretariat of the Commissioner of Customs, and Han Zhaoshu, a Deputy Tax Commissioner, to testify, Qian and Han arrived at the court yesterday in response to the District Prosecutor's Office's subpoena. They stated that the enemy materials in question were received from the Goods Receiving Committee of the Three-Party Army. The list did not specify the quantity of scrap iron. When sold, the quantity was published in the newspaper based on the information from a confidential report. The quantity was recorded only after weighing after the auction. The Supervisory Yuan had investigated this matter and concluded that there was no suspicion of fraud. It was also stated that Ding Guitang was not responsible for handling this matter. The handling prosecutor will now conduct further investigations into the auction house in order to first clarify the exact quantity of scrap iron and then begin the investigation. Sun Zhuting, the original informant, also went to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, but Sun left when Qian and Han left. Sun also intended to additionally accuse Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong. The District Prosecutor's Office ordered him to submit a supplementary statement for review.

### Social Services Reader Consultation

Legal Inquiries

Debt Dispute

Chen Liang asks: I borrowed 300,000 counterfeit yuan from a friend in July of the previous year, promising to repay it within half a month, and used my check as collateral. Due to my business losses, I was unable to repay it on time. A month later, I raised 300,000 counterfeit yuan and first returned the principal, and begged to pay the interest later. Now my friend suddenly asks me to return 600,000 National Currency, saying that the 300,000 counterfeit yuan previously paid can only be used for interest. I would like to ask: (1) How should the current counterfeit yuan be converted into legal tender when repaid? (2) Should it be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration? (3) If handled in accordance with Article 12, please provide the relevant provisions regarding my debt.

[Lawyer Qin Liankui's Answer] According to the law, payments made to repay debts are applied first to interest and then to principal. However, if the creditor agrees to receive the principal first, it can also have the effect of repaying the principal. Now the check issued by the debtor is still held by the creditor, so it is difficult to recognize that both parties agreed to repay the principal in the litigation. However, the loan and repayment are only more than a month apart, and the payment made by the debtor has reached nine-tenths of the loan amount. There is absolutely no such high interest rate. Even if there is no agreement to repay the principal first, it should be applied to repay the principal in addition to repaying the interest. The creditor's claim to apply all of it to interest is also inappropriate. As for lending 300,000 counterfeit yuan and wanting to receive 600,000 legal tender, why not ask him what the basis is? Now I will answer your three questions separately: (1) The conversion rate of counterfeit currency to legal currency is 200 to 1. (2) It is possible to apply Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration for the court to make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment. (3) The legal text of that article is: "If, after the establishment of a legal act, due to reasons not attributable to normal affairs, the situation changes, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court should fairly measure it and make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment, or change other original effects." This article was seen in the Tai Lan on October 19, 35.

### Investigating Fire Files, Compiled and Submitted to the Mayor for Review Firefighters' Fingerprints Must Be Sent to the Police Station for Identification Today Secret Report Box to Be Opened Publicly the Day After Tomorrow

[Report from our Newspaper] The focus of the investigation into the Seymour Road fire case will now shift to the review of administrative justice and the formulation of prevention and remediation plans. On the administrative side, the Investigation Committee has submitted a portion of the organized files by Chairman Ge Kexin to Mayor Wu for review. Ge Kexin said: After reviewing the case files, the mayor expressed many feelings and will provide specific opinions. The police station has also sent the files related to the dereliction of duty and detention of personnel to the Municipal Government Secretariat for submission to Mayor Wu. On the judicial side, the five firefighters suspected of dereliction of duty who were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the Jiangning Road Police Station the day before yesterday were also interrogated by Prosecutor Zhang in court. The testimonies of the defendants were obviously evasive. Regarding prevention and remediation strategies, Zhang Da, the Chief of the Inspectorate of the Police Station, said: "The Investigation Committee plans to launch a general fire prevention inspection by citizens immediately. It is generally believed that the dilapidation of houses and the damage to fire-fighting equipment during the eight years of Shanghai's occupation were innate shortcomings that allowed the fire to spread. Therefore, it is imperative that each household conduct a detailed inspection of the electrical wires, stoves, and combustibles in their homes and make repairs." Ge Kexin also scheduled to visit various fire stations the day after tomorrow. He said: "Although we are laymen in fire-fighting work, a field visit may be of some help."

At 4:00 PM yesterday, the Investigation Committee asked Lu Fengqian, a teacher at Seymour Road National Elementary School, at Cai Baoshang's residence. It was said that he did see a short, stout man gesticulating and talking about firefighters stealing at the back door of the school. The stout man said: "I personally saw a Chinese military policeman standing next to the fire because the firefighter's pockets were full. He punched him, and a small clock fell out. The military policeman kicked the firefighter again, and other things fell out." Although this statement was denied by military policeman Song Zhipeng the day before yesterday, Lu Fengqian said that he might be able to find this stout man nearby and verify it.

Today's Work

The investigative work that still needs to be carried out today is: (1) Order the firefighters who participated in the rescue work in Xizhou to complete the fingerprinting and send it to the identification section of the police station for inspection today, so that it can be known whether the fingerprints left on the wooden cabinet are related to the firefighters. (2) The mayor ordered Zhang Da to supervise the overturning of the fire site from today, and to carefully inspect the ashes that can be used as a reference. Zhang Da estimated that this work can be completed within three days.

Hoping for Secret Reports

In addition, the Investigation Committee strongly urges disaster victims and neighbors around the fire site to bravely submit information they have heard and seen by submitting letters to the secret report box in front of Shunchang South Goods Store on Seymour Road. In order to show impartiality, the Investigation Committee sealed a key to the secret report mailbox in an envelope yesterday, which was signed by each investigation committee member for safekeeping. The mailbox is scheduled to be opened publicly at 10:00 AM on the 6th.

### Five Firefighters Begin Interrogation

[Report from our Newspaper] The five firefighters, Dai Guangrong, Shang Zhikui, Li Chengjun, Cai Zhiying, and Huang Shiqi, who were suspected in the Seymour Road fire case, were detained by the police station on the handwritten order of Mayor Wu, and were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office at 2:40 PM the day before yesterday. At that time, it was a weekly holiday, and the duty prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Zhang Zhenyuan, briefly questioned the case and ordered them to be detained. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the handling prosecutor, Shen Zushou, formally opened the court for investigation. It was reported that the five firefighters all denied taking advantage of the fire to rob and claimed that they were not at the scene when the fire was spreading. They went to the fire scene on the second day of the Lunar New Year to take over the shift. As for taking towels, they claimed that others gave them to wipe the faucets. The court adjourned at 4:20 PM. The five firefighters are still being held in the detention center. Prosecutor Shen said that the five defendants did not admit to taking advantage of the fire to rob, which was expected. The Prosecutor's Office will do its best to investigate to get to the bottom of the matter. Another interrogation may be conducted today, but the current investigation process is not convenient to publish.

### Disaster Victim Carpenter Lu Cries to the Investigation Committee Cannot Endure Sleeping in the Open Demands Exemption from Demolishing Sheds

Lu Shijun, a resident of No. 425 Wuding Road (the coppersmith shop where the fire started), a carpenter by trade, went to Cai Baoshang's residence yesterday to cry to the Fire Investigation Committee. After the fire, daily necessities such as houses, furniture, clothes, and quilts were all burned to ashes. Because there was no place to live, he built a shed on the fire damage to avoid the wind and rain. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works ordered him to demolish it within seven days because it violated administrative regulations. Lu said that the shed was built with the help of relatives and friends with sparse amounts of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Once forced to move, he will have nowhere to live, and his family will suffer from sleeping in the open. Therefore, he especially cried to the Investigation Committee, hoping that the authorities could understand their unfortunate situation and make special concessions.

Lu was also reluctant to reveal whether the firefighters had robbed, saying that he had personally seen firefighters fighting each other, one wanting to drag the faucet to the rubber factory to irrigate, and the other refusing to let go. As for other situations, because they were not witnessed, hearsay could not be used as evidence.

Lu reported that when he was rescuing sundries in the fire, he claimed that he rushed into the raging fire a total of four times. The first time he rescued a quilt, the second time he rescued a bicycle, the third time he rescued a rickshaw, and the fourth time he rescued a piece of salted pork. The chairman suddenly asked: "Did you rescue the diamond ring?" Lu was stunned and didn't know what to say for a moment. Because Disaster Victim Representative Wang Yunfu's Miss Wenying reported in public at the Atlantic Asian Vegetable Agency reception yesterday afternoon that she had rescued two 18-carat diamond rings, Ge was joking with Lu Shijun about this.

### An Old Uniform Worth Pondering

Also, Yan Ze, a disaster victim at No. 27 Wuding Road, found a uniform in a pile of clothes the day after the fire. Yan suspected at the time that it was left by a firefighter after robbing his clothes. After being sent to the Investigation Committee and transferred to the Criminal Division of the Police Station for investigation, it was not a firefighter's uniform, but an old police uniform, which may have flowed to others through the hands of old goods stalls. However, since it was at the fire site, it must be related to the fire. The police station may not find it difficult to find out who is wearing it, because the old number is still attached to the clothes.

### Fire Breaks Out in Hair Salon's Loft Baby Burned to Death

[Report from our Newspaper] At about 12:15 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the New New Hair Salon at No. 108 Xinzha Road. Black smoke billowed, and the fire was very fierce. After the fire station reported it, it immediately ordered the pump troops to rush to put out the fire, which was quickly extinguished. It was estimated that a part of the three-story building was burned down, and a two-month-old baby was found burned to death. The cause of the fire was said to be a cooking fire.

At Huade Elementary School, No. 64 Xicang Road, Nanshi, a fire broke out carelessly at about 6:30 PM yesterday. Although snowflakes were falling, the flames were very fierce and did not abate. After the firefighters bravely rescued, it was extinguished until 7:30 PM. As a result, two and a half school buildings were burned down.

### Rear Area Restoration Factories Actively Resuming Work and Production

### Reporting Underground Money Shops 30% of Fines as Reward

[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the case of the Social Affairs Bureau strictly investigating underground money shops on previous orders, the Bureau submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation on how to reward the whistleblower. Now the Ministry of Finance has sent a reply to the Municipal Government stating that: "Those who privately establish banks and operate banking businesses in violation of the Regulations on the Administration of Banks, Article 19, should be ordered by the Ministry of Finance to cease operations and be fined. Regarding rewarding informants, 30% of the fines can be awarded to the informants, subject to the Ministry of Finance's approval."

### Taikoo Puxi Wharf Workers' Dispute Deadlocked

Shengjing Ship Overloads and Unloads Cargo

[Report from our Newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Puxi Wharf warehouse workers have been fighting for work since the 26th of last month. The foreman Zhou Ruisun led more than 100 workers to the wharf warehouse to demand work. The current foreman Chen Shanyu's side refused to give in, resulting in a dispute. On the 1st of this month, the Shengjing ship arrived at the port and docked at Taikoo Puxi Wharf No. 3. At 4:00 PM, the hatches were opened to unload the cargo, and Zhou's workers waited at the wharf to fight for work. The two sides had another dispute. Later, the police brigade and military police arrived to suppress the situation, and it was calmed down. The ship also stopped unloading. The day before yesterday, the ship planned to unload again, but unexpectedly, the workers had a conflict, and the police fired shots, and they dispersed. As a result, both sides were injured, and the ship stopped unloading again. Yesterday, for the sake of the ship's schedule, the company changed the unloading method, using barges to unload in the outer stalls and load them into the Yangtiedu warehouse in Pudong. Both sides were helpless, and the conflict remained deadlocked.

### Unsatisfied with Five-Year Sentence Reduction Yu Xiangyan Petitions for Retrial Presents New Evidence Based on Two Points

[Report from our Newspaper] In the railway material corruption case in the Jinghu area, "Director's Wife" Yu Xiangyan was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment in the first instance by the District Court, which was later reduced to ten years by the High Court. Yu Xiangyan then hired lawyer Wang Boxian to petition the High Court for a retrial. Her petition cited Zhang Bokang's testimony in the first instance of the District Court, "In the material purchase comparison table, the director often did not approve it, and then Zhu Biwen and Zhang Kaiyuan, the clerks in our section, told me that I could communicate with the director's wife. Later, I went to the director's wife's place and found out that the wife wanted money. At that time, the section had already received a commission of 2.8 million, and I sent 1 million to Du Xiangyan." Based on the above testimony, lawyer Wang defended Yu on two points: (1) "Inciting the demand for bribes for official duties." The establishment of an incitement crime requires that the person has no criminal intent, and the determination arises from the instigation of the instigator. Even if Yu Xiangyan received 1 million yuan sent by Zhang Bokang, it was after Zhang Bokang received the commission, and it was not an incitement. At most, it is only a question of whether she knew about it and received stolen goods, not the question of inciting the demand for bribes for official duties. (2) Ding Shuhui's testimony is consistent with Zhang Bokang. The review court believes that Yu's testimony is no different from Ding's. In fact, in the first instance of the court, there was no discussion of commission distribution. All were spoken in Mandarin. And he claimed, "The court failed to consider such important evidence..." It is also heard that in addition to the above reasons for applying for a retrial, Yu Xiangyan has new evidence to present.

### Car Dealership Fires Drivers Labor-Management Dispute Arises

[Report from our Newspaper] Shunfeng Car Dealership laid off 22 drivers due to sluggish business. The severance pay issue has been negotiated repeatedly, and the labor side agreed to reduce it to 420,000. The capital side believes that those who have served for more than one year can be paid two months' severance pay (which is exactly 420,000), but two of the 22 drivers have not completed one year and also demanded the same payment, which the capital side refused to allow, and the labor side insisted, thus forming a deadlock.

### Young Girl Scolded, Contemplates Suicide Married Woman Swallows Ash After Spat

[Report from our Newspaper] Mao Lili, a 19-year-old girl living at No. 14, Lane 563, Dongdaming Road, Hongkou, had a slight rebuke from her father over family matters after dinner yesterday and became distraught and contemplated suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered early and sent to the hospital for treatment by her family.

### Disaster Victims of the Great Fire Host News Reporters, Hoping for Thorough Investigation and Strict Punishment of Unlawful Firefighters, Landlord Orders Relocation, Appealing to the Press for Sanctions

[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of the victims of the fire at No. 660 Seymour Road, Wang Wenying (daughter of Wang Yunfu), Yan Ze, Zheng Zaijian, and Jin Zhengxueqing, hosted a press conference at the Atlantic Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday. They expressed their hope that the authorities would thoroughly investigate and severely punish firefighters for dereliction of duty and unlawful behavior. Furthermore, they appealed to the public for sanctions against the landlord of No. 660, who recently published a notice ordering all residents of the lane to relocate within ten days, disregarding the suffering of the disaster victims. Regarding the truth of the fire and the unlawful behavior of the firefighters, the representatives seemed hesitant to speak freely, only stating that they would await the investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office and the Investigation Committee. Miss Wang Wenying was relatively frank and outspoken, but when reporters asked if it was true that firefighters had extorted gold bars, she replied that she had only heard about it. The speeches of each person are recorded below:

If it Burned Completely, There Should be Traces

Yan Ze reported four points: (1) In this fire, the firefighters clearly did not make an effort to rescue, otherwise the entire lane would not have been burned down. He hoped the authorities would thoroughly investigate. (2) There is a strong suspicion that firefighters took the opportunity to rob during the fire, as it is a fact that the victims' property disappeared. At that time, there were many soldiers and police, and outsiders could not enter. If it burned completely, there should be traces. He hoped that firefighters who took the opportunity to rob would not be tolerated and should be severely punished according to the law. (3) The landlord of No. 660 has ulterior motives and recently published a notice ordering tenants to relocate within ten days. In addition to hiring a lawyer to negotiate with him, he hoped that society would jointly sanction him. (4) This fire can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. Many victims have been displaced and are homeless. They should be compensated according to the law and should be given relief based on the situation. The Municipal Government has now organized an investigation committee to investigate. The truth will come out one day. Now, the victims have jointly elected Wang Yunfu, Jin Zhengxueqing, and himself as representatives. Please provide guidance at any time.

### Miss Wang Delivers an Impassioned Speech: Who Would Use a Gun to Shoot Me? The Bullet is Really Not Worth It

Following Yan Ze, Wang Wenying, daughter of Wang Yunfu, reported, saying: "Compensation for fire losses should be given as a matter of course, but now the government is too poor, and in fact, businesses and industries do not have the money to do it well, so it is fundamentally impossible to compensate us, so we'll talk about it slowly. As for taking the opportunity to rob during this fire, there are several points that can prove it. First, the hose is the most important tool for firefighters. How could it be pressed underground? Clearly, they were doing something else. Second, how could a firefighter's uniform be found in someone else's home? Presumably, they grabbed the clothes and didn't want the uniform. Third, that day was the first day of the New Year. The firefighters probably didn't get tickets to the theater, so they intentionally watched the good show of the big fire. This show was watched for thirteen hours, and they had food and drink, enjoying themselves. Fourth, the fire was extinguished once, but then it reignited. What is the reason for this? Isn't it because the extortion was unsuccessful? My father and others are afraid of trouble, afraid that their lives and property will be completely destroyed, but I am not afraid. I am a woman. Who would use a gun to shoot me? That bullet is really not worth it. Our home has been burned down, but we shouldn't burn down our morality and personality. We should tell the truth. It is useful for society and for the country. Shanghai is like a dark and complex family. I am the little sister. You are all family members. We should manage this family well."

### Why Was the Water Released Before the Nozzle Was Installed? Who Led the Trial Department?

Zheng Zaijian, residing at No. 27, raised three questions: (1) When the fire was about to be extinguished at the coppersmith's shop, why didn't the firefighters move the water pipe to the home of Wang Yunfu at No. 29 to reduce the heat? (2) When No. 29 was burning, why didn't the firefighters dismantle the tin roofs of neighboring houses such as No. 25 to avoid the spread of the fire? (3) At that time, when the firefighters were spraying water, the nozzle was not yet installed, and the water had already been released, making it impossible to connect the hose. Who was the leader? Did the fire chief come to the scene to direct?

Finally, Miss Wang Wenying stood up again to add information, and reporters asked questions. She said that the next day when she returned home to visit, there were no soldiers or police guarding the fire scene, and she heard a firefighter say: "The early shift was carefree, we are out of luck." Her family had at least sixty boxes, but the excavation of the fire scene yielded no traces. She had her own "private money," three large banknotes and ten small gold lockets, etc. The large banknotes were placed in the lower layer of the iron box and had disappeared. The gold lockets, etc., were still there. As for the total value of the family's losses, she had heard her father, Wang Yunfu, say that people don't believe that pig bristles are worth 2 billion yuan, but in fact, his life savings are three times this amount.

### Suppressing Rice Prices: In Addition to Selling Siam Rice as Much as Possible, White Rice is Also Sold at Negotiated Prices, Market Was Monitored Yesterday, and Formal Transactions Were Scarce

[Report from Our Newspaper] The authorities have great confidence in suppressing the rising rice prices. Yesterday, a total of 16,080 bags of Saigon rice were sold, including 6,990 bags in the Nanshi market and 9,090 bags in the Beishi market. The price was still 63,000 yuan per stone. Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu went to the Bank of China to meet with President Song to inquire about suppressing rice prices. It is reported that in addition to unlimited sales of Siam rice, the government will also sell Wuxi white rice in large quantities at negotiated prices starting today. Mayor Wu said that rice prices can be suppressed within one or two weeks.

Yesterday, because the authorities sent personnel to monitor the market, white rice could not exceed 69,000 yuan per stone for the whole sale price and 76,000 yuan for the retail price, otherwise, they would be severely punished. Therefore, there were no transactions. There was some trading in the black market outside the market, and the prices were chaotic.

Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday that the rumor that the black market price of white rice had reached around 100,000 was not accurate. According to the report from the municipal government's investigation in various districts, the highest black market price of white rice yesterday was 88,000 yuan, and those dealers who exceeded the negotiated price will be severely punished. Mayor Wu also said that there is no need to worry about the source of foreign rice in the future, because according to the current storage volume, it can be maintained until the end of August. He hopes that citizens will eat more medium-grade rice, because medium-grade rice is both nutritious and cheaper.

### Flour Prices Allowed to be Adjusted, Edible Oil Prices Not Allowed to Change Within Two Weeks

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu convened talks with people in the edible oil and flour industries yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was decided that the new negotiated price of edible oil would remain unchanged for two weeks. The new negotiated price of flour will be implemented from today.

The edible oil talks were held at 4:15 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Those present were Ji Mingzhai, Qiu Liangrong, Zhang Derun, Li Tingdong, Xie Yuxiang, Zhou Weibai, Zhang Chao, etc. On the oil pressing industry side, they requested the authorities to allocate soybeans at a flat price. Mayor Wu has agreed in principle, but the implementation details will be determined after consulting with President Song. However, the new negotiated price of edible oil shall not be changed for any reason within two weeks.

The flour talks were held at the same location at 4:30 PM. Those present were the Director of the Food Department, Rong Yiren, Xi Debing, Qian Shouchun, Wu Limen, Zhu Maoqiu, Zhang Chao, Gu Zhunian, etc. After discussion, it was decided to adjust the negotiated price of flour. The price of domestic flour is 30,000 yuan per bag (original price 25,000 yuan), and the allocated price is 31,500 yuan per bag. The price of foreign flour is 46,000 yuan per bag (original price 37,000 yuan), and the allocated price is 48,000 yuan per bag. The allocation of flour by various flour mills will come to an end today. Starting tomorrow, the Food Department will supply domestic flour for allocation.

### Oil Market Remains Tight, Soybeans Unavailable

Yesterday, the rice market had very few arrivals, with only 260-270 stones in both the North and South markets. There were still no transactions in the market. Only Baiyuan and Yinyuan were slightly traded, and the prices rose sharply by 4,000-5,000 yuan. The Social Bureau has decided to allocate white rice to meet the actual sales of rice shops. Oil factories continued to supply the oil market as usual. Qing oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil did not rise or fall, while raw oil was actively digested, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and remained tight.

### Quorum of Tea Price Appraisal Committee Not Reached, Meeting Adjourned

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Tea Price Appraisal Committee failed to hold a meeting yesterday because the various tea organizations had not yet submitted the list of representatives. It is reported that the members of the Appraisal Committee will be composed of one representative from each of the Central Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Tea Group of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the Tea Export Industry Association, and the Tea Association, and three representatives from the Southeast Tea Region United Association.

The prices of other grades of tea will be estimated according to this ratio. After the prices are determined, the Central Bank will provide funds and the Central Trust Bureau will purchase the tea.

### Tea Market Shows Slight Improvement

Yesterday's tea market: sales negotiations were still lively, especially for green tea, such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which were more enthusiastic. However, because the holders were more determined and intensified their efforts to maintain prices, trading was not optimistic.

### Buying Spree Intensifies, Gold Market Sees New High Prices, US Dollars Also Pulled Up by 400 Yuan

Yesterday, spot gold prices soared as the Central Bank's supply was limited. The morning opened at 4.09 million with sales, and once rose from 4.06 million to 4.1 million. The Central Bank slightly supplied, but was blocked. Later, it hovered between 4.07 million and 4.09 million for a long time. The Central Bank allocated 1,200 bars at a price of 4.08 million. There was still a lack of honor or disgrace afterwards. It was not until after 11:00 that it gradually stabilized. When the price of 4.1 million was broken again at noon, a buying spree suddenly broke out. The Central Bank happened to have no supply, so it rose sharply. At noon, it jumped to a high price of 4.25 million, and then slightly stabilized. In the afternoon, the Central Bank had even fewer sources of supply for deferred delivery. Tianjin reported a sharp rise. For a time, the buying spree was in full swing. Gold shops announced the closing of the market after 4:00 PM. The new peak reached 4.45 million, resulting in a sharp increase of 340,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry was 445,000. Silver dollars rose slightly. Secret interest was between 15% and 18%.

There were no special characteristics for foreign currencies. The black market price of US dollars in the early morning was 7,500 to 7,700.

### Entirely Relying on the Assistance of the Gold Market, Chinese Stocks Turned from Weak to Firm

Chinese stocks were stimulated by the gold market yesterday, turning from weak to firm. The morning opened slightly lower. After the opening, numbers 14 and 91 were accepted, and deferred delivery once rose slightly to 830 yuan. Number 16 tried to sell spot Yongsha, and numbers 224, 235, 89, 76, and 172 were also sold. The market situation gradually went downstream, but it mostly hovered because the gold price was still good. Number 156 supplied spot Yongsha fiercely, and the spot delivery fell to 803 yuan, while deferred delivery was still hovering at 818 yuan. After 11:00, the assistance of the gold market caused a buying spree. Numbers 89, 4, 35, and 99 all entered spot Yongsha, while numbers 224, 14, 108, and 171 entered deferred Yongsha. At noon, the spot delivery rose to 832 yuan, and the deferred delivery saw a high price of 842 yuan. Number 95 sold and then slightly stabilized. The result was that spot Yongsha was flat compared to last Saturday, while Huafeng, Qinxing, Xinguang, and Xinhe fell slightly. Meiya and Jingfu each fell by half a percent. The trading volume of cold stocks was still small, and the price continued to decline slightly. In the later market, the gold market was even more bullish. Numbers 83 and 204 came in, and deferred Yongsha was raised to 855 yuan. Numbers 84 and 231 sold high, and Number 76 also sold after entering, and it still showed a setback. Numbers 198, 152, 154, etc. all entered, and deferred Yongsha rose to 856 yuan. The spot delivery reached a high price of 847 yuan. Numbers 84, 199, 4, 89, 22, and 176 continued to supply, falling back to within 850 yuan. Xinya once reached the limit up. The gold market had only gains and no losses. Before the close, it presented a seesaw situation. The result was that spot Yongsha, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng rose slightly compared to last Saturday, while Meiya, Xinhe, and Jingfu fell slightly. The trading volume of cold stocks was sparse, with honor and disgrace intertwined. Deferred delivery of Yongsha, Huafeng, and Xinguang rose slightly, Xinhe fell slightly, Meiya had no transactions, and the stocks outside the market, such as Dasheng, continued to make progress.

Foreign stocks were very peaceful yesterday, and the market price did not advance but slightly declined. The result was that steel stocks were flat compared to last Saturday, while the rest showed slight declines.

### The Market is Filled with Buying Voices, Coal Prices Continue to Soar

The coal market for all types of bituminous coal was filled with buying voices. Sellers shouted prices higher and higher, especially for lump coal, which was even tighter. Baimei Jiaozuo lump coal has not arrived since the New Year because it was heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs was taking over. The current market price has been shouted up to 950,000 with no goods. Zahuangji lump (ie, Xinhongji lump) also needs 900,000 yuan. Qinghongji lump (ie, Laohongji lump) is shouted at 1 million yuan, still short. Other low-grade white coal lumps, such as Baoqing, Fengjie, and Laolong, were transported in small amounts, with trading prices between 760,000 and 800,000 yuan, and the transaction volume was quite active.

### Costs of Raw Materials and Labor Increase, Cotton Cloth Prices Also Adjusted, Rising by 10% to 16% Compared to Previous Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the recent rise in cloth prices, the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee convened an extraordinary meeting at the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon. Those present were Pan Shihao of the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, Yan Guangdi of the Six-District Cotton Textile Association, Dong Jiufeng of the Cotton Cloth Association, Wu Shufang and Chen Jiazhen of the Textile Construction Company, Liu Jingji of the Municipal Council, and Liu Wenteng of the Textile Management Committee. Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration of the Social Bureau, served as the chairman. Because the allocated price of cotton yarn for textile construction has already risen by about 16%, and other wages have also been higher than before, it was decided to adjust the negotiated price, which will be implemented from today:

(1) The factory wholesale price of 12-pound white fine cloth is adjusted from 102,000 to 118,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 114,000 to 132,000. An increase of 16%.

(2) The factory wholesale price of 12-pound white twill is adjusted from 98,000 to 107,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 109,000 to 119,000. An increase of 10%.

(3) The factory wholesale price of 9-pound raw color drill is adjusted from 122,000 to 134,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 136,000 to 150,000. An increase of 10%.

(4) The factory wholesale price of 12-pound raw color fine cloth is adjusted from 140,000 to 162,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 156,000 to 180,000. An increase of 16%.

The Review Committee also believes that since the Textile Management Committee has abolished the price limit control on cotton yarn, and the allocation of yarn by the Textile Construction Company also fluctuates with the market, it is believed that to control prices, it is necessary to control materials. To stabilize cotton cloth prices in the city, it seems that the material management agency should make appropriate arrangements in accordance with the country's economic policy. This point is submitted to the Municipal Government for referral to the Textile Management Committee for verification.

Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, because the Textile Construction Company sold a small amount to the cloth shops, the manufacturers were waiting to see, and the door shops were selling very smoothly. The customer groups were also strongly searching, causing the market to rise. The price of Longtou fine cloth rose sharply by 5,000 yuan per piece. The price of AAA color balls rose by 9,500 yuan, and the price of Wufu was shouted up to 125,000 yuan. The price of dark blue Shilin cloth also rose accordingly. However, the spot price of Luohan Tu Shilin cloth was flooded, and the price fell instead. The rest of the cloths were firm.

### Textile Construction Opened Yarn Sales as Usual, Applicants Were Very Active, Opening a Total of More Than 4,000 Pieces

[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the China Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual yesterday due to the fluctuating yarn prices in recent days, the applicants were twice as crowded, with a total of more than 4,000 pieces. As a result, 1,718 pieces were allocated to manufacturers and 670 pieces were allocated to yarn shops, for a total of 2,388 pieces. The number of applying households was 988 for manufacturers and 670 for yarn shops. In terms of allocation, large manufacturers were mostly allocated as planned, while small factories and yarn shops were slightly reduced. The selling price of each yarn count has increased by 16% compared to the previous price. However, it is still about 10% lower than yesterday's market price.

### Gold Prices Stimulate People's Hearts, Yarn Market Initially Weak, Then Rose

Yesterday's yarn market initially declined and then strengthened. In the early morning, because many bulls in the industry took profits, the price was lower than last Saturday by 50,000-70,000. Then, because the gold price was reported higher, new buyers took advantage of the cheap price to absorb the market, and the price gradually rose. The initial price of heavy-weight Shuangma was 3,035,000, and the final transaction price was 3,100,000. Ordinary 20-count yarn was particularly firm, with a price about 20,000-30,000 yuan higher than last week. The flower prices rose repeatedly, and people's hearts were still high. The future is very promising.

### Coal Transport Ship

Foreign Merchant Ship Lease Expires, Fuel Management Committee Changes to Leasing Domestic Vessels

[Report from Our Newspaper] The lease term of 150,000 tons of coal transport ships leased by the Fuel Management Committee from foreign merchants will expire at the end of this month because the government has opened the navigation period for foreign ocean vessels. It has been decided to gradually return the leases and lease domestic vessels as much as possible. The longest lease term for foreign vessels leased by the committee will expire around the end of June of this year. At that time, if the actual situation permits, all foreign vessels can be returned and replaced by all leased domestic vessels. As of now, the committee has leased one vessel from Shou Kang Company, the "Tian [blank]" (about 10,000 tons), and one vessel from Zhongxing Company, the "Fuxing" (about 7,000 tons), to participate in coal transport work at various ports. The committee's coal transport volume in January was still 110,000-120,000 tons. The coal production volume in the current coal-producing areas has not decreased, but the transportation capacity is uncertain. The monthly coal consumption in this city is about 160,000 tons. The current transport volume is about 60%-70% of the required volume. Fortunately, the coal storage volume in this city is often maintained at around 100,000 tons, so it can still regulate the needs of various sectors.

### Soap Prices Rise Endlessly, Cigarettes Show Slight Retreat

The market situation for cigarettes and candles continued to be firm and excellent yesterday. The prices of all grades of goods have been made to unprecedented new highs. Among them, soap prices rose more sharply. The price of Guben was 157,000 yuan per box, and the price of Arrow Knife was 156,700 yuan. Except for the price of 100 pieces of Huang Xiangmao which was fixed, the rest all saw new prices. The prices of high-quality matches continued to rise, while the prices of lower-quality matches turned flat. Cigarettes have risen to their peak. The appetite of customer shops has turned sluggish. Holders are willing to sell at the market price, and the market situation has slightly retreated.

### Factory Silk and Satin Rise Sharply, Rayon Shows Slight Retreat

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau did not allocate rayon to the silk industry this week because the industry has not yet submitted the total number of application forms required. It is reported that the allocation price of rayon will not change recently.

The market price of factory silk rose by 100,000 yuan for all grades because the gold price rose and people's hearts were invigorated. Rayon rose too much over the weekend, so it showed a slight retreat yesterday. The silk satin market saw a sharp rise as soon as it opened in the morning. The factories took the opportunity to sell high, and the market situation softened slightly. Meiya bedspread was 3.2 million, and Dacheng had transactions at 3.05 million.

### Bystander's Perspective: If Production Exchange Rates Are Not Rectified, Export Markets May Be Completely Destroyed

Observations by American Businessman Mr. Harvey

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Mr. Harvey, Far East Manager of Macy's Corporation in New York, also representing several department stores, spent two months in Shanghai, visiting various factories, but achieved nothing. He stated that if the Chinese financial authorities do not take strict measures within two months, they will lose the opportunity, and export markets, which are the main source of their foreign exchange, may be completely destroyed. In reality, China has already lost the chance, and its export hopes, except for a few items like tung oil, will be close to zero. Markets for manufactured goods, which were largely supplied by China before the war, have been completely seized by other countries. Puerto Rico, Mexico, India, Switzerland, and Italy are now selling Chinese-style products in the United States, with prices only one-third of those in China. Porcelain, which had a large export volume before the war, is now being produced in California. Pottery is also being imported into the United States from Mexico. Coarse cloth and carpets, which were traditionally supplied by the country, are now being exported by Puerto Rico. India is also manufacturing Chinese-style carpets. As for lace, embroidery, and matting, their sales in the United States will also be replaced by Switzerland and Italy. The main obstacles to restoring Chinese exports are high labor and material costs, lack of transportation, and unrealistic legal exchange rates. The official exchange rate for US dollars is 3,350 yuan, while the black market rate is around 7,700 yuan. The market price of various manufactured goods in Shanghai, calculated in US dollars, is ten times higher than before the war. Although American importers are willing to accept prices two to three times higher than before the war, it is difficult to expect transactions above ten times. Moreover, the current price fluctuations are too large, making business even more difficult. The market price of hemp cloth has risen by 40% in a week, while the exchange rate has hardly changed. The difficulties faced by American merchants in Shanghai are truly shocking. Packaging costs may even be more expensive than the goods themselves. The lack of interest from producers also leaves American merchants helpless. Many buyers, due to the uncertainty of when the situation will improve, are unwilling to wait here for long and have already packed their bags to return home. Only a few remain here, hoping that the authorities will find a way to remedy the situation within two months to salvage it. Currently, the main victim is still China. Although the American public lacks Chinese goods, they can easily find them in other markets. American merchants are still paying attention to Chinese goods and are willing to buy them here, but the prices must be reasonable, and there must be a supply of goods.

### Tinplate Prices Skyrocket; Road Leather, Aluminum, and Tin Are All Profitable

The market price of tinplate continues to rise. No. 26 large tinplate has surged by 2.5 million yuan, reaching 7.5 million yuan per box. No. 24 iron is still in short supply, with reports of asking prices reaching 900,000 yuan per sheet. Small tinplate has also jumped by 50,000 yuan per box. Packing rope for strapping has also suddenly risen in price after the Spring Festival, with the price per ton exceeding the price at the end of last year by 1.5 million yuan. All these goods are in short supply due to scarce arrivals, and inventories are decreasing daily. Those holding inventory are unwilling to sell because they cannot replenish, so they are asking for high prices.

The lead and tin market, since the opening after the Lunar New Year, still shows a tight situation with high asking prices. Those holding goods are unwilling to let go, resulting in few transactions. Although the market situation for other copper products is still stable, it is said that arrivals are still extremely scarce.

### Basketball League: Renyu Defeats Encas, V Team Wins over Jiashen, Xuebai Wins over Li Team; Tonight, Hualian Plays All Blacks

[This newspaper] Three games of the basketball league were held at the City Gymnasium yesterday. Although it was snowing heavily and the weather was cold, hundreds of spectators still attended. As a result, in the women's group, Xuebai defeated the Li team 57-14, in the Group B2, V team defeated Jiashen 41-34, and in Group B1, Renyu defeated Encas 32-22. A brief account of the battles is as follows:

Women's Match

In the first women's match between Xuebai and the Li team, Weng Xiaoyun of the Li team opened the scoring with a free throw. In the first quarter, Xuebai led 9-3, and ended the first half with 20-10. After the change of ends, Xuebai had even more freedom to play, ending the third quarter with 42-16. In the last quarter, Wang Xiu of Xuebai fouled out five times and was replaced by Qian Mengyue. But the battle was still one-sided. In conclusion, the Li team suffered a crushing defeat with 14 points to Xuebai's 57.

Second Match

In the second match, V team met Jiashen. Zhuang Yikai of V team scored first, but Tao Yingshi of Jiashen returned the favor, and Sun Moxi added another assist, giving Jiashen the lead. Wang Nianci of V team made a shot and a free throw, and the Yi Rong and Yi Kai brothers added icing on the cake, while Zhu Mingxing skillfully shot the ball into the bullseye, 12-8, and V team took the lead. Jiashen called a timeout, which proved effective. Moxi and Yingshi controlled the whole game, 14-13, and Jiashen took the lead again by one point. The first half ended with a tie of 16 points each. After the change of ends, Hou Yongkang of Jiashen tossed the ball under the basket, Tao Yingshi made several consecutive hollow shots, and Sun Moxi scored another two points. V team only scored two points through Zhuang Yikai, 27-20, and V team was behind. So they made major adjustments to the lineup, which proved effective. Zhu Mingxing was promoted three levels in a row, and Zhuang Yikai added flowers with a long shot, 31-29, taking the lead again. The battle between the two sides was extremely tense. At the sound of the buzzer, Jiashen lost 34-41.

Main Attraction

In the main attraction, Renyu and Encas took to the stage. Encas had been defeated by Renyu in a charity match. Yesterday, they fought very hard. Wang Huaiting of Renyu threw a hollow shot from the center line, setting the record. Kai Luosiji of Encas returned the favor. Huaiting hit from the sides, and Wu Xinyun and Yao Wenhua assisted in the tyranny, giving Renyu the lead. Baolai, a tall player from Encas, tossed a ball under the basket, and Wu Xinyun returned the favor. Renyu called a timeout, and Wu Xinyun launched another attack. Yao Wenyi skillfully scored, 28-15, and Renyu was still far ahead. Encas replaced Fleck with Kebeng Qigu, which did not help the situation. With the last four minutes remaining, the score was 31-21. The battle was fierce, and the intensity only increased. Ao Chailiao of the foreign team and Wang Huaiting of Renyu both fouled out five times. The game also ended, with Renyu defeating Encas 32-22.

### Three Basketball Games Tonight: Hualian Plays All Blacks

Three basketball league games will be held today starting at 5:30 pm at the City Gymnasium. Tickets are 2,000 yuan upstairs and 3,000 yuan downstairs.

The first match is the women's group Qianghua vs. Li team. The level of both sides is similar, and the outcome is unpredictable. The second match is the Group B2 Huayang vs. Indian. Huayang is made up of the Pang team and has been winning all battles since its debut. The Indian foreign soldiers and young players are bound to suffer defeat. The main attraction was originally the Group A1 Renyu vs. Hailuqing, but Hailuqing has not returned from their expedition to Guam, so the match has been changed to a make-up game between Hualian and All Blacks. Hualian are all veterans of the battlefield, but Wu Chengzhang has not recovered from his illness and will probably have difficulty playing today. All Blacks have not been in good form recently, and the situation is likely to be dire. The schedule is listed below:

Qianghua vs. Li team (Women's Group) 5:30

Huayang vs. Indian (Group B2) 6:30

Hualian vs. All Blacks (Group A1) 7:30

### Crossing North America in Five Days and Nights, Ten Thousand Miles (3)

— Ma Shuqing, Sent from San Francisco

A Special Correspondent in America's View: Chinatown, San Francisco

A Dwelling Like a Large-Scale Museum: The Best Chinatown in the World

January 18th Airmail

San Francisco’s Chinatown is the best Chinatown in the world. At least, from my travels in Europe and America, I have come to this conclusion.

The Chinatown in Calcutta is the dirtiest. During British rule in India, it was often considered a source of infectious diseases. The Calcutta municipal government often restricted white people from entering Chinatown in the summer. When American troops were stationed in Calcutta, the military forbade soldiers from eating or drinking casually in Chinatown. In the summer, many streets and alleys in Chinatown were truly filled with foul odors.

Later, traveling through Europe, I saw that the Chinatown near the "Gare de Lyon" in Paris was not clean and tidy enough. The Chinese community in Berlin, although relatively clean, was too small and did not even have the specific designation of "Chinatown." The Chinatown in Hamburg, located on Schmuckstrasse, left me with the impression that many Chinese families lived in "cellars" (underground levels lower than the road). The Chinatown in London’s East End, a base for Chinese sailors, also seemed scattered and disorganized.

After arriving in the United States, I visited the Chinatowns in New York and Chicago. New York's was not only dirty but also reeked of "dried fish stench." Unpaved Chinatown streets were filled with the sound of heavy trucks all day long. New York tour companies, skilled at doing business, create beautiful verbal "advertisements" for New York's Chinatown, but in reality, this often "disappoints" tourists. As for the reactions of tourists after seeing New York’s Chinatown, and what they think of the Chinese people as a result, that is another matter.

I only visited Chicago’s Chinatown twice. I greatly admired the palace-style building initiated by Mr. Mei Youzhuo and others: the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association. It is magnificent, elegant, and can represent a part of Chinese culture. However, only when I stepped into San Francisco this time did I discover the culmination of Chinatown.

First Impression: Like a Museum

My first impression of San Francisco’s Chinatown was: It is like a large-scale Chinese museum. The entire Grant Avenue, except for a small section at each end that is not considered part of Chinatown, is entirely filled with "Chinese-centric" storefronts. Large gold-lettered signs in both Chinese and English, and dazzling neon lights at night, give visitors a fresh feeling. Chinatown has a lot of Chinese antique stores, called Art Stores in English. These antique stores contain cultural relics and utensils from various dynasties in China. An old man named Zeng, who has lived in Chinatown for a long time and is knowledgeable about antiques, told me: There are many treasures from the Han and Tang dynasties in Chinatown, but items from the Shang and Zhou dynasties are very rare.

Because I am an "outsider," I cannot distinguish between fakes and priceless national treasures. I believe that many Americans who are interested in oriental antiques – the old men and women who often linger and admire in front of shop windows – are simply looking out of "curiosity." Clever antique merchants display statues of Guanyin (Goddess of Mercy), embroidered skirts from the Qing Dynasty, and even ancestral portraits used for worship before the introduction of "photography" to China, in glass cabinets, allowing Westerners with completely different customs and habits to appreciate and marvel at them little by little.

Chinese Restaurants: Good Cooking, Fair Prices

Besides the dozens of antique stores, the most common are Chinese restaurants. The largest include "Far East Cafe," "Great China," and "Shanghai Low," among others. Chinese restaurants in San Francisco not only cook well but also offer fairer prices than elsewhere. Their cooking is mostly Cantonese-style, but with a touch of "sweet and sour" flavor from Jiangnan and Zhejiang. According to friends in San Francisco, the restaurant business was extremely good before the end of the war due to social unrest, but it has declined significantly this year.

Based on my rough observations, Chinese restaurants in San Francisco are indeed not as busy as those in New York. New York has a larger population and more Chinese students. Many Columbia University students eat two meals a day in Chinese restaurants. Although San Francisco also has Chinese students, they mostly live across the river in Berkeley. The "Chinese" who live here mostly cook at home for economic reasons. In addition, with so many restaurants, the business volume is quite dispersed, and the chances of being "fully occupied" are rare. Therefore, many restaurants in Chinatown pay considerable attention to Western customers, earning more money from "chop suey" and "chow mein" than from elaborately prepared Chinese dishes.

### Import and Export Trading Companies: Focused on Hong Kong

San Francisco has more than sixty import and export trading companies, most of which are located in or near Chinatown. Mr. Zheng Bingshun's "Yu An Company," led by Mr. Zheng Bingshun, a leader of the Chinese community in San Francisco, is the most authoritative. According to Mr. Zou, there were only twenty or so companies engaged in import and export trade in San Francisco before the war, and now there are considerably more. Among the current sixty or so, most are operated by people from Guangdong, so the import and export targets are naturally concentrated in Hong Kong. The same is true for Chinese remittances. Mr. Zheng sincerely said, "This issue is worth paying attention to. The abnormal existence of Hong Kong’s sovereignty has a great impact on China’s economic construction!"

On the day Mr. Zou Bingshun invited me to "afternoon tea," Mr. Mei Youzhuo happened to have come to San Francisco from Chicago. Mei’s visit was to discuss the issue of organizing the Guangzhou Public Bus Company. It is said that the purchase of public buses is currently very difficult. If the public bus company were to open, Guangzhou would need at least three hundred buses, but American car merchants are unwilling to deliver three hundred cars on the same day. This is a practical difficulty in an era of production disconnection.

That day, we discussed many practical problems in the economic and educational aspects of the American Chinese community. Also present were Mr. Chen Liren, the Secretary-General of the Canadian branch of the Kuomintang, and Mr. You Yongzeng, a community leader in San Francisco, among others. After hearing many concrete facts, I felt that there were indeed many hidden worries in the Chinese community:

Out of 20,000 Overseas Chinese, 2,000 "Return to China"

The history of the Chinese community in America is only about a hundred years old. The first Chinese set foot on the New World of America, and the first place they encountered was San Francisco. In the decades before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese relied on labor and their habit of diligence and thrift, building their livelihoods from scratch. This continued until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the war years, and even during the years when China and the United States fought side by side, it was the golden age of the American Chinese. Chinese laborers had high-paying jobs, and Chinese restaurants and shops made a small fortune. However, once the abnormal prosperity of the war ended, the situation changed significantly.

Many Chinese missed their homeland, of course, their parents, wives, and children were there. In the past year or so, among the more than 20,000 Chinese in San Francisco, more than 2,000 have already "returned to China." The total number of overseas Chinese who have already returned to China and are preparing to return from the United States and Canada is about 20,000. However, the younger generation from China does not have the opportunity to come out. Immigration laws limit the number of Chinese immigrants to one hundred and five per year. "Even if one hundred and five people come every year, the future of the Chinese community is still bleak!"

Difficulties in Chinese Education Form a Serious Problem

Chinese education is also a problem that cannot be solved no matter how hard one thinks about it. Currently, there are nine overseas Chinese schools in Chinatown, San Francisco, that also run primary and secondary schools. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association runs the Chinese High School; the Kuomintang Party Headquarters runs the Jianguo Middle School; the local associations run the Yanghe School, the Nanchiao School, and the Confucius School; and the churches run the St. Peter's School, St. Mary's School, Concord School, and Gimbalen School. There used to be a Baptist School, which closed several years ago. The common difficulties faced by these schools are the problem of teaching time, the problem of teachers, and the problem of textbooks.

All children of overseas Chinese born within the territory of the United States are citizens of the United States. American law has the right to compel American citizens to receive American education. Therefore, according to law, children of overseas Chinese should receive American education. Chinese language instruction in overseas Chinese schools only occupies an ancillary position. Therefore, class time is mostly in the afternoon or evening, and students use tired minds to receive tutoring education, so the efficiency is naturally not high. In addition, there is a lack of teachers, and the teachers are all poorly paid. Due to the lack of excellent and suitably graded teaching materials, many overseas Chinese children still cannot recognize a few Chinese characters after studying for several years.

The Generation of Overseas Chinese Students is Heading Towards "Americanization"

In any case, the younger generation of overseas Chinese students is slowly drifting away from the Chinese community. Their environment and education are making them more and more "Americanized" every day. Mr. Liu Boji of the National Daily said very bluntly: "Stop hoping that they will return to China to serve!" Deputy Consul Wu Qianghua, one day, talking about the marital situation of overseas Chinese in Chinatown, said: Diligent young overseas Chinese are unwilling to marry overseas Chinese girls because these girls have all learned "Americanization," and even learned the American women's way of divorce!

Many people worry about the future of the young overseas Chinese seedlings. They say: These little overseas Chinese have learned the smooth talk of Americans, but have not learned the courage, diligence, and ambition of Americans.

However, some people feel that it is not pessimistic. Mr. You Yongzeng, one of the community leaders, said: If Chinese cultural groups can pay attention to this issue, and use the methods and spirit of foreign missionaries running schools in China to run overseas Chinese education here, it can still be effective. He believes that it is very inappropriate for the government to manage overseas Chinese education, as it will arouse the dissatisfaction of the American authorities.

### The Closure of the Chinese Aircraft Factory Reflects the Crisis in the Economic Lifeline of Overseas Chinese

The urgent matter lurking in Chinatown today is probably not education but economics. The American Chinese community has never had the large capitalists like those in Southeast Asia. Although the general material life of the American Chinese is better than in other places, their economic lifeline is still passively dependent on American economic institutions. During the war years, the entire American economy was abnormally prosperous, and the Chinese community also benefited a little. However, once the war ended, many Chinese laborers lost their well-paid jobs. The "Chinese Aircraft Factory" led by Zheng Bingshun, which was funded by the Chinese community and manufactured aircraft bodies for the American military, opened in 1944 and is currently in the process of closing down. Originally, there were five hundred workers, three-quarters of whom were Chinese laborers, and now they have all been laid off separately. I heard from the people in charge of the factory that they originally hoped that the Chinese government would help or take over, but the Chinese government did not have that much money. Later, they once changed to manufacturing radio receivers, but because competition was fierce and there was no room for profit, they finally decided to close down.

The aircraft factory is just one example of the economic situation of the overseas Chinese.

"Overseas Chinese are lovable!" For three years, I have traveled to every corner of Chinatown in Europe and America, and I always have the same feeling. On my second day in San Francisco, Consul General Zhang Zichang told me many stories of overseas Chinese eagerly donating. Then, he said: "More than ten years ago, when I first became a diplomat, I disliked Chinatown when I saw it. But now, I have changed my mind, I have become a loyal lover of Chinatown, I love everything about Chinatown!" (At the Washington Hotel in San Francisco)

### Proposal to Change the Lunar New Year to Farmers' Day

— Dong Shijin

The current Farmers' Day is based on the recommendation of the National Agricultural and Forestry Administration Conference held in March of the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941]. It was originally set as February 5th and later changed to the Day of the Beginning of Spring. Although it has been promoted for several years, it has ultimately failed to interest the general farmers. I believe that if Farmers' Day is to be followed willingly by the general farmers, it must suit rural customs and meet the farmers' mentality. Therefore, I propose to use existing festivals, change their names, and not set up separate regulations. Among the various existing festivals, the Lunar New Year is the most appropriate. The reasons are as follows:

(1) Suitable for Folk Customs: The custom of celebrating the Lunar New Year is still widely followed among the people and cannot be eliminated, nor is it necessary to eliminate it. If it is changed to Farmers' Day, there is no need for government promotion. Naturally, it will become a habit and be celebrated grandly. However, some people may dislike the fact that the date cannot be fixed on the calendar. In fact, this is not a problem at all. The current Farmers' Day already has no fixed date, and there are many similar precedents in European and American countries. Easter is the first Sunday after the full moon following the spring equinox, and Thanksgiving in the United States is the last Thursday in November. Their dates are different every year.

(2) Contains Profound Meaning: The custom of celebrating the Lunar New Year not only does no harm but also has the beautiful intention of thanking nature and ancestors, which is spiritually consistent with Christmas and Thanksgiving in Europe and America. Therefore, the first important thing during the New Year is to offer sacrifices and thank Heaven, Earth, and ancestors, with sincerity and reverence that surpasses other festivals. Secondly, it is a time of rest and entertainment after the agricultural harvest and before the start of spring plowing, which is also essential for farmers who work hard all year round.

(3) Shows Sharing Joy with the People: The general public often feels that government measures often fail to consider folk customs. Taking the New Year as an example, although strict prohibitions have not been imposed in recent years, government agencies must continue to work as usual, and schools are not allowed to take holidays. This not only shows that the government is disconnected from the people but also leads to the malpractice of perfunctory hypocrisy. In fact, the government has not done its job well, the classes are not well taught, and at the same time, people cannot enjoy themselves to the fullest. It can be said that one move results in several losses. However, since the Lunar calendar has been abolished, it is not necessary to continue using the name of New Year. But if this day is designated as Farmers' Day, then national agencies and the people can celebrate together and enjoy themselves together.

(4) Preserves National Customs: Every nation has its own special customs and habits. These customs and habits are a part of the nation's history and culture, which must be preserved and promoted. However, in the past decade, when learning from Europe and the United States, some people in our country have often abandoned the common historical culture and harmless customs and habits. This not only destroys the characteristics of the nation but also is a loss to the world's culture. Now, if the Lunar New Year is designated as Farmers' Day, it will not conflict with the calendar system, and the most ancient and universally observed customs of our nation can also be preserved.

(5) Shows Respect for Agriculture: When we talk about respecting agriculture, we definitely do not mean to despise industry. Today, the Chinese people seem to unanimously agree that the development of Chinese industry must be based on agriculture. Therefore, valuing agriculture is tantamount to valuing the foundation of industry. In any case, China is still an agricultural country. Agriculture is China's most important industry, and farmers are the largest part of the Chinese people, as well as the most hardworking producers. This situation cannot be fundamentally changed in a short period of time. Now, if the most solemn festival in the nation's history is designated as Farmers' Day, it can express the state's profound intention of respecting agriculture and rewarding farmers.

We propose this date not to add another festival in addition to the New Year, but to simply give it a different name. As for the methods of celebrating this festival, all kinds of old customs can be followed, with solemnity, reverence, and joyful celebrations as the main focus, rather than holding other ceremonies and gatherings. However, at this time, the general public has more leisure time. After the main festival, various recreational activities and exhibitions can all be held in addition.

Women and Family Published Every Tuesday

### My Family's Economy

— Chen Youjing

Every couple ultimately hopes for a happy family life and wants to increase family happiness. However, the only major obstacle to family happiness is economic problems. Economic shortcomings can lead to the breakdown of marital affection and even the pain of "divorce!" Therefore, I would like to put forward a few suggestions:

(1) Management: That is to say, it must have the following three conditions: 1. Live within your means, 2. Balance income and expenditure, 3. Appropriate financial management. Living within your means means that couples should base their daily household expenses on their own economic income. Balancing income and expenditure means making accurate budgets so that income and expenditure are suitable. Appropriate financial management means that on the one hand, it is necessary to take into account the minimum living standard, and on the other hand, it is necessary to plan for unexpected expenses. If management is appropriate, there will be no overspending, no possibility of debt, and no worry about digging a well only when thirsty. If the husband's income is low, it can be steadily overcome, otherwise, even if the income is high, it may be stretched thin. This is because of the reasonability or unreasonability of the plan.

(2) Increase Revenue: If the couple is not disabled and has the ability to produce, it is best not to "sit idle and consume resources." They should seek a suitable occupation and engage in family side business. On the one hand, it can supplement household expenses, and on the other hand, it can promote wealth. With economic affluence, the emotional bond between couples will naturally increase.

(3) Cooperation: First of all, it should be noted that there must be no selfishness between husband and wife. Both parties should understand each other's economic situation so as not to increase the economic burden. Sincere and frank cooperation can resolve economic difficulties. Couples have an obligation to the economy. One party cannot indulge in pleasure and spend arbitrarily, while the other party suffers hard and counts every penny, creating an imbalance of happiness and hardship. On the contrary, it cannot compensate for economic leaks and losses. If there is surplus income, it should be saved up to prepare for emergencies. If you encounter unemployment, you can also reduce the burden and not worry. If you want to reach the point where everyone eats when there is food and everyone uses when there is money, then opening up the finances will naturally provide a solution.

(4) Thrift: Labor prevents starvation, and frugality prevents greed. The most important thing in a family is thrift. How can we be thrifty? 1. Within the scope of not hindering work, it is best to operate yourself and not hire servants. On the one hand, you can save money and avoid being annoyed and the harm of skimming oil; on the other hand, you can increase experience in cooking and sewing and not rely on others. 2. Make an effort to eliminate unnecessary socializing, improper entertainment, and bad habits, because these can deplete the economy and even cause crime as a result of economic panic. 3. In the event of major events such as weddings and funerals, you should carefully consider your economic capacity, and try to save as much as possible under the principle of thrift, and don’t try to save face.

(5) Correct: A couple's love must not contain vanity or be tempted by money. They must have a spirit of sharing weal and woe. Because once there is vanity, it will create a luxurious lifestyle, wasting money. When the other party is earning money, they will not cherish it, and once there is no income, they will inevitably discriminate, resulting in discord between the couple, turning into a marriage of "firewood and rice." One must recognize clearly that hard-earned money is not easy to come by. Cherishing money is protecting the other party.

We must know that a reasonable family economy can maintain family happiness and can promote a fulfilling life for the couple. Therefore, couples should thoroughly pay attention to this important family issue! (Gratitude)

### The Complete Laws of the New Family

— Anna

No matter where you live, big or small, you must have your own family.

Never grumble and say annoying things before eating, and avoid doing so after meals.

Often avoid endless quarrels and incessant debates. In fact, the things you're fighting over are not worth making a fuss about.

Always compromise with each other. This is the best "antidote" to divorce.

Real sympathy and mutual understanding.

Respect each other's elders and friends.

Treat the construction of your family as a religious belief in God. Always treat your partner with a spirit of forgiveness, and you will feel the happiness of a fulfilling family.

Have you followed the above?

### How to Correct Stuttering

— Yin

Usually, the speech organs of a three- or four-year-old child are mostly unable to manipulate smoothly. There are a few words that they have difficulty expressing, and there are a few sounds that they often cannot pronounce correctly. Sometimes these words cause them to hesitate and develop a stutter.

If this happens, do not immediately train them with the correct sound or continuously. Saying it to them once is enough. Don’t try to teach phonetics to such a three- or four-year-old child. There is no need to train them in any way of speaking. You should focus your attention on the sounds of words that are easy to cause stuttering. This stutter is often easily confused with a serious speech defect, causing some avoidable troubles.

Children are prone to stuttering when they begin to speak continuous sentences. When this happens, watch your eyes, do not look at the child's face, and show that you are busy with something else, although you are secretly listening to them.

Stuttering is because the part of the child's mouth used for speaking uses too much force, thus stopping them. If he can have time to adjust, he will repeat it, saying what he wants to say slower and clearer than before. It is useless to ask him to stop and correct the pronunciation of that word. He is trying to express an idea in his mind. When that idea is stopped because you correct his pronunciation, the tongue resistance increases, only making the stutter more serious.

If the child gets stuck on a word and can't go on, look at him gently and calmly, and then say, "I see you have been busy enough this morning. Now go drink a glass of water, I'll wait here to listen to you."

You shift his attention and give him plenty of time to recover his emotions. You give him an atmosphere of calm trust, and he will feel at ease. The tension that causes stuttering will then slowly relax, and he will speak much better. There are very few children with real speech defects. If such a defect is found, a specialist should be consulted immediately for diagnosis and treatment.

When speaking to children, speak clearly and slowly. Do not use baby language. Do not praise slang with a smile. Slang is not a funny thing. If you don't correct it when they are young, it will be difficult to change when they grow up. At this time, you should say this word clearly once. However, there is no need to train them continuously. Children imitate the language in the family. As long as it is good language, their words will naturally become better. Give them plenty of time to learn.

### Sponge Cake

— Gui Shi

One of the New Year's Foods

Sponge cake, its shape and size vary, but its origin has the same method as a pastry called "Ding Sheng Gao" (Victory Cake); its texture is fluffy and soft, not as hard as New Year cake, and because it cooks quickly when steamed, it has always been used by discerning housewives. Now, let's roll up our sleeves and try it out.

Ingredients—Three parts rice flour. One part red beans (cooked but not cracked). Two parts glutinous rice flour. Two parts white sugar.

The above four ingredients are the basic components for making the cake, and their proportions can be adjusted according to needs. Other ingredients such as lard, black dates, walnut meat, bean paste, rose petals (available in tea shops), etc., can be added according to personal preference.

Equipment—A small steamer about eight inches in diameter with a lid, and a container for holding the flour.

Instructions—Take three parts of rice flour, mix it evenly with two parts of glutinous rice flour in a container, add boiling water to dissolve two parts of white sugar, and mix it into coarse salt-like fine particles. Then add one part of cooked red beans (without the liquid) and mix well. Then spread it on a slightly heated steamer cloth, with a thickness of no more than one inch being the best. Add lard, black dates, roses, etc., on top to create a beautiful pattern. Once everything is ready, place the steamer in an ordinary iron pot with water and steam it for about ten minutes. When the lard on top starts to melt, that indicates the cake is cooked. If you like to make layered cakes with filling, it's the same process. Just add half of the flour mixture first, steam it until cooked, then evenly spread a layer of bean paste on top, and then add the remaining flour mixture. When you cut it open, it will have a bean paste layer.

### Blind Nipple Ancient Medical Method

— Yun Yi

"Blind Nipple" is a common name, which refers to a nipple that is inverted and not firm, preventing the baby from suckling. This is due to a localized lack of development, similar to a congenital condition.

Although the method of using walnut shells for prevention and treatment is a good one, it is regrettable when it cannot be used during the late stages of pregnancy or after childbirth.

Now, based on experience, and in accordance with the academic principle of impartiality, I record a prescription below, hoping that experts in the field can provide guidance and that patients can use it.

I have been practicing traditional Chinese medicine for many years. One patient came to me with this condition, close to her delivery date, and hesitant to try the above-mentioned treatment. I prescribed a herbal formula for her, instructing her to take three doses. The patient followed the instructions and took three doses, and the nipple protruded, to her great joy. Since then, I have tried it on several others with similar success. The original prescription is listed below: (Adjustments to the formula can be made as needed).

Honey-fried Astragalus membranaceus (8 qian), Cinnamomum cassia (1 qian), honey-fried Cimicifuga rhizome (1 qian 5 fen), Xiang Da Danggui (3 qian 5 fen), Angelica dahurica (1 qian 5 fen), stir-fried Anemarrhena asphodeloides (2 qian), Akebia trifoliata (6 fen), Bupleurum chinense (1 qian 5 fen), Platycodon grandiflorus (1 qian 5 fen), Gleditsia sinensis (3 qian), Fucus thallus (1 qian). Decoct in water and take warm.

### Vanka

— Written by Chekhov, Translated by Li Mengfei

(How many children joyfully receive gifts during Christmas; how many children longingly gaze upon bleak emptiness during Christmas.)

Nine-year-old Vanka Zhukov had been an apprentice to the shoemaker Alyakhin for three months. On Christmas Eve, he did not go to bed. He waited until the master and his wife and the senior apprentices went out to mass before he took a small bottle of ink and a pen with a rusty steel nib from the master's cupboard. Then he spread out a folded sheet of paper in front of him and began to write.

Before anything else, he decided to write his first letter. He looked furtively at the doors and windows and glanced at the dim icon. On both sides of the icon's wooden frame hung shoetrees. He sighed deeply and sadly. He knelt on the stool with the letter spread out on it.

"Dear Grandfather Konstantin Makarich," he wrote. "I am writing a letter to you. I wish you a Merry Christmas and God bless you. I have no father or mother, you are all I have."

Vanka looked up at the window, which reflected the light of his candle, vividly outlining his grandfather, Konstantin Makarich, who was the night watchman at Mr. Zhivarev's estate. He was a short, thin old man, but remarkably vigorous for his sixty-five years. His bloodshot eyes were always smiling. He spent his days lying in the servants' kitchen, always joking with the cook. At night, he wore a large sheepskin coat, carried a wooden staff, and paced his beat, followed by two dogs with drooping heads, a female called Kashtanka and a male called Vyun. The female dog was so called because of her black fur and slender body, which resembled an eel. Vyun was a rare, docile male dog. He looked at strangers as kindly as he looked at his master, but people did not believe his gentleness, believing that beneath his obedience and humility lay more malicious intent. No one was better than him at stealing a piece of leg of lamb or sneaking into the kitchen to steal the farmer's chicks. More than once, his hind legs had almost been broken. He had also been hanged twice, and every week he was whipped almost to death, but he always revived.

Vanka's grandfather always stood by the door, squinting at the bright red window of the village church, his feet stamping in his high boots, teasing people in the garden. His wooden staff hung from his belt, and he huddled himself against the cold, coughing with an old man's dry cough. He often pestered the maids or the cook.

"Would you like a pinch of snuff?" he would ask, taking out his snuffbox and offering it to the women, who would take a pinch and immediately sneeze.

The old man would laugh and shout like a madman:

"Sneeze it out, or it will freeze your nose!"

He would also put a little snuff on the dogs' noses. Kashtanka sneezed, twitched her nose, and ran away in a rage. Vyun politely refused the offering, just wagging his tail. It was truly a beautiful climate, with no wind, just a clear, frosty night. The white roofs of the entire village, smoke was rising from the chimneys, the trees were adorned with silver frost, and there were thick piles of snow everywhere. You could see the vast expanse of white. The bright stars in the sky twinkled brightly, and the Milky Way stretched across the sky, as if it had been carved from white snow especially for this festive season.

Vanka sighed. He dipped his pen into the inkwell and continued to write:

"Yesterday I received a severe beating. The master dragged me into the yard by my hair and beat me mercilessly with the boot last, because I fell asleep while rocking his brat's cradle. This week, the mistress ordered me to wash a herring, and I started scraping it from the tail, so she picked up the herring and poked the tip of it into my face. The senior apprentices also tease me, taking me to the tavern to drink vodka and making me steal the master's cucumbers. The master beats me mercilessly, regardless of whether I live or die. There is no good food; breakfast is bread, lunch is thin porridge, and supper is bread again. Tea and sour cabbage soup are only for the master and his wife to drink and eat as much as they want. They make me sleep in the entryway, and I cannot sleep at all when their dead brat cries, because I have to rock the cradle. Dear Grandfather, for God's sake, take me back to our village home, I can't take it anymore… I bow down to you, I will pray to God forever and ever. Take me away, or I will die…"

Vanka's lips trembled, and he wiped his eyes with his dirty fist, sobbing.

"I will send you tobacco," he continued to write, "I will pray to God for you. If I have done anything wrong, then whip me like that gray goat. If you really think I can't find work, I will ask the manager. For God's sake, let me shine boots, or let me replace Fedka as a shepherd. Dear Grandfather, I can't stand it anymore, they will abuse me… I want to run away to our village, but I don't have boots, and I'm afraid of the severe frost. When I grow up, I will take care of you, no one will want to hurt you. When you pass away, I will pray for the peace of your soul, just like praying for my mother Pelageya."

"About Moscow, it is a large city, there are many houses of the rich, many horses, but no sheep, and the dogs are not very vicious. Children don't wear star badges at Christmas, and no one is allowed to sing in the choir. Once, I saw a shop window with fishing rods, hooks, and ropes hanging for sale at low prices. Those hooks are very convenient for catching any kind of fish. There is also another fishhook that can catch a one-pound catfish. There are also shops selling guns, with guns like the one used by the master. I reckon a gun must cost a hundred rubles. The butcher shops have quail, partridge, and hare, but who hunts them, or where they run from, the shopkeepers don't want to say.

"Dear Grandfather, pick a golden walnut for me from the master's Christmas tree and hide it in my green box. Tell the mistress Olga Ignatievna that Vanka asked for this walnut."

Vanka sighed and looked out the window again. He remembered how his grandfather used to run into the forest to cut down a Christmas tree, taking his grandson with him, how happy those times were! The frost cracked and crunched under his grandfather's feet, and Vanka stepped the same way, before cutting down the Christmas tree. His grandfather smoked his pipe, took a pinch of snuff, and made fun of the poor, frozen Vanka… The little fir trees stood still, adorned with frost, not knowing which one was waiting to die. Suddenly, a hare jumped out from somewhere and plunged into the snowdrift… His grandfather could not help shouting:

"Catch him, catch him, catch him! Ah, you short-tailed devil!"

After the Christmas tree was cut down, his grandfather dragged it to the master's house, and they began to decorate it. Mistress Olga, Vanka's most glorious friend, was busy with it.

When Vanka's mother, Pelageya, was still alive, Mistress Olga always gave him pieces of candy cane, and when she was free, she taught him to read and write, to count from one to a hundred, and even played four-group dancing games. When Pelageya died, they sent the orphan Vanka to the kitchen to be with his grandfather, and then from the kitchen, they sent him to the shoemaker Alyakhin in Moscow.

"Come quickly, dear Grandfather," Vanka continued to write, "I beg you, for God's sake, take me away from here. Have pity on a weak orphan. Here, they beat me and starve me to death. I cannot tell you how sad I am, I am always crying. One day, the master hit my head with a boot last, and I fell down, beating me half to death. My life is so miserable, not even a dog’s…….. I send my regards to Alyona and one-eyed Yegorka and the coachman, but don't let anyone take my harmonica. Your grandson Ivan Zhukov, dear Grandfather, must come."

Vanka folded the paper into four and inserted it into an envelope bought with a copper coin he had asked for before dinner. He thought for a moment, dipped the pen into the black ink bottle, and then wrote the address:

"To the village, to my Grandfather." Then he scratched his head, thought for a moment, and added: "Konstantin Makarich." He was very happy that no one had interfered with his writing. He put on his hat and ran out into the street without his sheepskin coat.

He had asked the poultry vendor before dinner, and he knew that the letter had to be put into the mailbox, and from there, they would deliver the letters to all locations. The drunken postman would drive a carriage ringing a bell from door to door. Vanka ran to the first mailbox and slipped his precious letter through the slot.

An hour later, he was comforted by hope and slept soundly. In his dream, he saw the stove, and by the stove sat his grandfather, with his bare feet, reading the letter to the cook, and Vyun wagged his tail around the stove.

Remembering Old Friends in the New Year, Using Huang Jikuan's Rhyme

The waters and trees are clear and bright, the evening lotus is gentle;
In a small pond, the flickering candlelight sends new poems, how many maple leaves are inscribed, twenty years of fate are not over, on Cuiwei Peak,
forest birds, flying across Penglai, the blue sea surrounds, white clouds linger.
Drunk and carefree, warm fragrance floats like snow, filling the wine, the spring waters of the great river flow eastward, green grass on both banks, not waiting for the moon to be full and the flowers to be in full bloom, speaking of leisure, old friends spend the night together, several times the songs of woodcutters, several times the dragons sing, several times the apes howl.

### Lonely Flickering Candlelight

Looking back at Yunhe, the rugged peaks embrace the small mountain city, the flickering candlelight illuminates the snow-filled poems, how much pure joy is known, two years have passed.
Thinking of my guest, the birds scatter, the remnant winter is the same, the old scenery lingers in my mind, and I dream in vain.
Like the sea of Shanghai, the only way to relieve sorrow is to add wine often, the green remnant of the lotus is followed by yellow flowers, the courtyard is full of dry grass, do not say that leisure is good, it is also difficult to find, several times playing with the pen, several times immersed in contemplation, several times long howls.

### Anticipated Dream

Every night

I look forward to

Having such a dream—

Dreaming of

My deceased mother, alive,

I nestle in her arms

Crying bitterly, confiding

My grievances

There are gentle, kind,

Comforting hands

Pressing on my forehead,

There is sympathy, sadness,

Tender tears

Falling on my face,

We face each other

Completely, shedding

Moving tears

Our tears merge

Like our bloodline

——Every night

I look forward to

Having such a dream.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 158

— Ye Jingfeng

This auspicious interpretation of "eight" is also a product of China; it seems based on the saying "If you want to prosper, you can't do without eight." Apart from this, I can't think of any other brilliant theories. Now that Pingzi has instructed you to pay attention to the secret of "eight," to be honest, you have to use a Japanese mind to figure it out. Fortunately, you already have several explanations, so why not say them out and let everyone discuss them?" Tsurumi continued his explanation.

"I think these few that I have figured out are not sufficient. Just now, didn't we send a telegram to "〇Twelve"? It also contains this item. Perhaps he can give us a more satisfactory answer. As for the first one I figured out, I'm afraid the "eight" that Pingzi is referring to is the "Eight Major Forward Secret Stations for the Promotion of the Greater East Asia Program" drafted by the General Staff Headquarters!"

"When was this announced?" I asked.

"It hasn't been announced yet. I only saw the final draft, which was also obtained from the department by a colleague."

"The so-called Greater East Asia Program...?" I haven't heard of this term before.

"This is a new contribution from the Fifth Column. In fact, it is an old tune from Ito Hirobumi's time; nothing more than "To conquer the world, one must first conquer East Asia," and so on. Although the war on the mainland has already been launched, in the eyes of Konoe and the young officers, this move is only the prelude. According to them, occupying China is not a problem at all. The most important thing is to deal with the countermeasures against Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The main way to counter them is to first establish eight forward secret stations!"

"Eight?" I was a little skeptical that eight seemed too few.

"Yes," Tsurumi changed his cigarette, "exactly eight secret bases."

"Roughly speaking, they are nothing more than Hong Kong, Haiphong, Singapore..."

"Don't guess wildly. Your thinking doesn't fit Japanese logic. Let me tell you – first, to deal with the Soviet Union; the Soviet trans-Eurasian railway, the closest stronghold to Japan, is Chita..."

"What?" I thought Tsurumi was wrong.

"Chita," Tsurumi repeated.

"That's not right..." I objected with confidence, "Didn't you say the Soviet railway's closest stronghold to Japan?"

"Correct."

"How can it be Chita? Even elementary school students know that the Soviet trans-Eurasian railway terminus is Vladivostok; it is also the closest to Japan."

"Haha, haha!" Tsurumi laughed wildly.

"What do you mean?" I was a little unconvinced.

"Old Brother," Tsurumi said with a smile, "you underestimate Japan too much! At least, you don't know how crazy the Japanese military is!"

"Oh!" I admitted that much.

"Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese Ministry of Defense, with Tokyo as the center, has long covered all parts of the mainland with a circle of two thousand five hundred kilometers. The outer edge of the defense has already extended to Mongolia and the eastern coastal areas of China. Now, according to them, this large circle has already become a two-layer inner circle. You, old brother, are still dreaming!"

"Oh!" I admitted that I was indeed dreaming.

### Endless Tricks Keep Coming: Banknotes Turned into Marble

— Gao Wuhong

After the victory, we often see many "clever" tricks, which make people clap their hands in amazement. Everyone who has seen them has already remembered them, so there is no need to mention them again. Now let's mention something fresh. "The more it changes, the more magical it becomes," with the wonder of "transformation to perfection," it is exactly: "Endless tricks keep coming."

We have already "learned" the "patterns" of "Golden Award Steel" and "Gold Turned into Shit." Here, I want to introduce to you a set of "novel magic," which is: "Banknotes Turned into Marble." According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Hong Kong on the 31st, Hong Kong newspapers reported on that day that the Central Bank had previously commissioned the printing of 500 yuan banknotes in the United States, 500 boxes. After printing, they were shipped to India and stored for a considerable period of time before being shipped to Shanghai. Recently, 300 boxes were shipped from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou. On the 30th, when they arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong, it was discovered that 30 boxes of banknotes, worth about 80 million yuan, had been stolen. The Hong Kong Central Bank officials discovered when they opened the boxes that the banknotes had "disappeared" (probably by airplane). They were replaced by marble made in India. In addition to the marble, a women's short coat was found in one of the ten boxes. The Hong Kong Central Bank representative said: "It is not yet certain whether the banknotes were stolen in Shanghai, Hong Kong, or Guangzhou; but it is believed that the theft occurred in India." His "logic" is: "Since the boxes contain marble made in India, the theft "must" have occurred in India."

It seems that this "strange case" will again end without resolution. Even if there is an investigation, the "discovery" is already late, the location of the theft is difficult to "investigate," and nothing can be traced.

Eighty million yuan is a "small" amount, but banknotes can be turned into marble, plus a women's short coat. This set of "novel and eye-catching" "magic" is worth mentioning, so that everyone can appreciate it. China has such "skilled" "magicians"!

The "peep show" of "Gold Turned into Copper" and "Gold Turned into Shit" has not yet been debunked, and now a set of "Banknotes Turned into Marble" has been staged in quick succession. "How many tricks," the Chinese people's "visual enjoyment" is not shallow. If these kinds of things all become "unsolved cases," the "performers" will become "more skilled and daring," their courage will become stronger and stronger, and the "patterns" will "change more and more magically." In the future, who knows what "new tricks" will be "transformed" out?

### A Small Czech Village Receives a Windfall (Part Two)

— Translated from "International Digest" by Jia Yuan

Six Million US Dollars Distributed to All

Of What Use is Gold When Life is Precarious?

So this seasoned officer—whose name is not recorded in the Czechoslovakian government's files—said to his sergeant: "Who knows if I'll be alive tomorrow? Who knows if I'll see Berlin? Let's distribute this money to the villagers."

Then, he said: "Sergeant, you take care of this. Find a way to give a share to every man, every woman, every child. Ask everyone's age and give them one thousand Koruna (Czech currency) for each year of their age. I think that should be enough to distribute."

Residents of Sasstin Village Instantly Became Millionaires

After solving this difficult problem, he lay down on a cot and fell peacefully asleep.

On this bright spring day, the docile residents of Sasstin Village suddenly became millionaires. The amount distributed that day totaled 300 million Koruna (equivalent to six million US dollars).

In the first few hours, the villagers of Sasstin were completely stunned. They couldn't believe their extraordinary luck, unable to determine if it was real or a dream. Larger families received as much as fifteen to twenty thousand "Koruna." Everyone ran to the shops like mad, spending to their heart's content.

In an instant, Sasstin became perhaps the fastest place for inflation in history. A shave, which originally cost three Koruna, now cost three thousand. The village's entire economy fell into chaos. Everyone became rich, workers refused to work, factories completely shut down, and merchants sold all their inventory at exorbitant prices.

Too Much Cash, Prices Soar

After the stores in Sasstin Village sold out their inventory, the villagers rushed to nearby towns and villages, causing prices in those places to soar as well. The northeastern corner of the Czech Republic seemed to have experienced a financial earthquake, with Sasstin as the epicenter.

However, the villagers were not foolish enough to spend all of their newly acquired assets at once. After the initial excitement, many people hid the remaining money, burying it in gardens or cellars.

In mid-May, the head of the Bratislava bank inspected the missing banknotes in the vault and discovered that the lost money was scattered in Sasstin. However, the bank could not force the public to return the funds, so the Czech government asked them to voluntarily hand them over, to see how patriotic they were.

Villagers Patriotically Donate to the Government

Then, an unbelievable thing happened: the villagers of Sasstin began to dig up their gardens, unearthing 115 million Koruna to return to the government. The remaining 185 million Koruna was probably scattered in other towns and villages.

Today, Sasstin has returned to its former tranquility, with pastoral scenery just as it was before. But the villagers will never forget the extraordinary windfall that came a year and a half ago.

### Old but Vigorous, Gray-Haired New Groom: Interesting Stories of Li Shizeng

— Jin Xia

Mr. Li Liying (Shizeng), a well-known figure in academic and political circles, is one of the respected elders, along with Wu Zhihui and others. Mr. Li, who is nearly seventy years old, suddenly married Ms. Lin Shanshan yesterday, shaving his head to become a new groom, which is a widely celebrated event, not letting Xiong Bubi and Mao Yanwen and Wang Zhengting have all the attention.

In the past, Mr. Li advocated simplicity in diet, preparing two dishes and one soup for each meal. Hence, there was the saying: "Li Shizeng's meal isn't as good as Dr. Zheng ____'s cigarette."

Overseas Chinese in Europe and America mostly open tofu shops. It is said that in Paris, the "world capital," there is also a "Chinese Tofu Company," whose shareholders are mostly important figures from our country, and Mr. Li Shizeng once served as the manager of the company.

In addition to traveling overseas, Mr. Li spends his days studying knowledge with other scholars. The "World Academy" at 393 Rue de Saisons in Shanghai is a place he frequents.

According to people close to Li Guangsheng, Mr. Li often strokes his beard and writes books leisurely at the "World Academy." Every time he sees a woman, he always squints and sweeps his eyes across, expressing his disgust. Even the servants working in the academy were not allowed to bring their female relatives to stay overnight. Has this strange temper changed today?

When the Pacific War broke out, Mr. Li was in Hong Kong. Before the Japanese invaders entered, he took the last plane and went straight to Honolulu, escaping danger.
