[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 22nd] Military sources report that on the 21st, the National Army in eastern Henan completed another powerful counter-offensive, achieving major victories. Ningling and Qiao counties were recovered on the morning of the 22nd. Furthermore, over 3,000 Communist troops in western Henan had previously stirred up trouble along the Xin'an and Mianchi railway lines, attempting to disrupt the security of the Haixi section. After days of concerted attacks by the National Army, they were unable to carry out their railway sabotage plans and fled across the north bank of the Yellow River on the night of the 21st.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The National Army in western Shandong recovered Yuncheng at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. The Communist troops fled north across the Yellow River. The mopping-up operation in the triangular area between the Yellow River and the Grand Canal in western Shandong has now come to an end.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The pursuit in western Shandong is progressing smoothly. A certain National Army brigade, advancing from Juye and Jiaxiang in three routes to pursue the remnants of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces in Yuncheng, has linked up with another National Army unit after crossing Yuncheng, forming an encirclement of Yuncheng. The Communist troops in Yuncheng are fleeing north in disarray.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] According to a war correspondent from this newspaper accompanying the pursuing troops in western Shandong, the National Army's offensive in western Shandong quickly recovered Juye and Jiaxiang, leaving the Communist troops no time to coerce innocent civilians. Three million refugees on the brink of starvation have been rescued.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] The National Army recovered Dancheng, southwest of Luyi, on the 20th. The Communist forces under Wei Fenglou fled northwest of the county, possibly to join forces with Zhang Taisheng's troops.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Over 1,000 Communist troops in the Yucheng and Yancheng areas of northern Shandong launched an attack on Qihar outside Jinan on the night of the 21st. By the morning of the 22nd, they had been repelled by the National Army.

Communist Troops' Breakout from Mountainous Areas Blocked; Fierce Fighting Continues North of Xintai

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The focus of the war in Shandong Province has now shifted to central Shandong, the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. The Communist forces invading Laiwu and Tushikou have increased to over 50,000 on the 22nd. In the 50-kilometer area north of Xintai to Qingshiguan, fierce fighting has raged for the past two days, resulting in heavy Communist casualties. In addition, over 10,000 Communist troops are now advancing from west of Mengyin towards Tai'an. The Communist forces' intention is clearly to cut the Jiaoji Railway and threaten Jinan. There have been no changes in the fighting in southern Shandong.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Communist troops attempting to break out from the northern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains were still being intercepted by the National Army in the Azhuang area (5 kilometers north of Tushikou) on the 22nd. The fighting is extremely fierce.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Communist troops south of the Yellow River have reached their last days. News this morning indicates that the remnants of the Communist New 1st Division and the 2nd Security Brigade, fleeing towards Tushikou north of Laiwu, have been defeated by the National Army and are being annihilated.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] After retreating from Xintai, the National Army in southern Shandong has joined up with another National Army unit, completing a counter-encirclement on the Laiwu-Xintai line. Another powerful mobile force of the National Army is increasing pressure on the Sishui line, where the remnants of Chen Yi's forces are concentrated. Therefore, the Communist troops that have once again infiltrated Xintai have essentially re-entered a trap. According to military observers speaking to reporters, if Chen Yi's remnants do not repent and surrender as soon as possible, even if they avoid annihilation, they will starve to death in the mountainous areas of southern Shandong, where no grain remains.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] On the 22nd, the central Shandong battle continued to focus on the triangular area between Laiwu, Tushikou, and Azhuang (10 kilometers south of Boshan). The combat zone has extended to the Hei Yu and Dazhai areas north of Tushikou and the Qingshiguan area southwest of Boshan. Fierce fighting raged all night on the 21st. The situation in Dazhai, Hei Yu, Azhuang, and Qingshiguan is unclear. At this time, the National Army in the Xintai area, due to the overly exposed position of their front lines, retreated and concentrated in Laiwu city, bravely blocking the invading Communist troops. However, the Communist forces continue to increase in strength, and the intensity of the siege is unprecedented, making the situation in the city extremely serious. As for the Communist troops attempting to support this front, attacking Zhangdian, the Jinling Towns east and west, and the Mashang railway stations from the night of the 20th, after being repelled, only carried out disruptive attacks on the night of the 21st and the morning of the 22nd, which have been repelled. Furthermore, due to the excessive damage to the communication equipment along the Jiaoji Railway, the extent of the damage to the railway on the night of the 21st could not be determined immediately, and passenger trains continued to be suspended on the 22nd.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] The prelude to the central Shandong battle has begun. Fierce battles broke out simultaneously along the Jiaoji Railway and in Pi County in eastern Shandong on the night of the 20th, with the Communist forces using up to nine divisions, five brigades, and local units, totaling over 100,000 troops. The National Army is also resisting with all its might, and the fighting is fierce, the first such intensity since Linqu. The National Army in Yexian in eastern Shandong, due to the exposed position of their front lines, has been ordered to withdraw. After fierce fighting, Shahe Town was also abandoned on the 22nd, while intense fighting continues in Huipu.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] According to statistics from the Bureau regarding the sections of the Jiaoji Railway damaged by Communist troops from the 20th to 4:00 PM on the 22nd, 28 sections of track were destroyed, along with 7 bridges and 5 kilometers of telecommunications lines. The damage between Zhangdian and Yangjiazhuang (east of Yidu) was the most severe. The Zhangdian-Jinan section was repaired and reopened to traffic by 3:30 PM on the 22nd. Based on the current situation, direct special trains between Jinan and Qingdao will probably not be able to operate in the short term.

### Sun Lianzhong Shares His Thoughts

Expresses Determination to Open the Baoding-Shijiazhuang Section

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Sun Lianzhong's leg ailment is gradually improving after electrotherapy, and he can already walk around the house. He is expected to resume office in a week. Sun met with reporters at his private residence at 10:00 AM on the 20th and spoke for an hour. He stated that the Eleventh War Zone is determined to open the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway, but the Communist troops only suffered a loss of one-third of their strength after the battle of Yaocun, so the security of the Beiping-Baoding section is still difficult to ensure. Sun then recounted his thoughts over the past year, stating that military and political affairs in Hebei Province can be divided into two periods: the first eight months after the victory were spent handling the reception of prisoners of war, and the military and political work gradually began to unfold in the following eight months. However, eastern Hebei had just been recovered when troops were transferred to the Ping-Sui Railway due to the battle of Zhangjiakou, which later led to insufficient troop strength, the failure to restore order in central Hebei, and the inability to ensure traffic on the Ping-Bao line. As a native of Hebei, he felt ashamed to face his hometown, but he had a clear conscience towards the government.

Furthermore, the draft contains explicit regulations on bank regulations, for example, the Ministry of Finance may not issue any laws or regulations without legal basis. Another feature is that banks will be able to compete freely and be eliminated freely without restrictions in the future.

### Legislators Sun and Mei Discuss Production Loans

[Our Newspaper Report] Previously, it was reported that the "Financial, Economic, and Commercial Law Report" of the nine-member subcommittee of the Finance, Economics, and Commercial Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan. Legislators Sun Jiulu and Mei Shuzeng told reporters that this report had not been approved by the general assembly and was purely a private publication. They also believed that when discussing the issue of gold and US dollars in this report, attributing the surge in gold and US dollars to production loans was a far-fetched argument. The two further stated that the current Chinese industry is not yet able to stand on its own, so how can it be destroyed again? At a time when private funds are flocking to speculation, if the government authorities do not provide factories with loans for relief, then the factories will inevitably collapse completely. If we talk about stabilizing prices, if we have no production ourselves and rely solely on dumping foreign goods, it is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. To say that production loans have caused the surge in gold and US dollars is also impossible in reality, because the factories were too busy taking care of themselves last year to worry about other things. Therefore, this claim seems to refute itself.

### Soviet Troops Withdrawing from Dalian; Large Numbers of Locomotives Being Transported Away on the China Changchun Railway; 50,000 Communist Troops Gather North of Dalian

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] The Dalian Shipyard has been destroyed. Sixty locomotives of the China Changchun Railway have also been transported to Vladivostok by Soviet ships. Soviet troops in Liushutun near Dalian are also withdrawing. It seems that the Soviet troops intend to complete the withdrawal before the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 10th to avoid criticism from other Allied countries. Therefore, the Dalian issue, which has attracted worldwide attention, seems to be on the way to resolution.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] Soviet troops in the Liaodong Peninsula may completely withdraw to Lushun before March 10th.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] The Soviet Union has obtained our consent to establish a consulate general in Shenyang. It is heard that we have also agreed on the candidate for Consul General. Yifukin, the Soviet commercial representative in Shenyang, went to Beijing a few days ago, which may be related to this matter, as Yifukin is currently acting as a consul.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] There are about 50,000 Communist troops north of Dalian, with sufficient ammunition and good equipment. They own two arsenals and have seized a large amount of materials to be transported. This is actually a supply base for the Southern Liaoning and Shandong and Hebei military regions. It is generally speculated that there will be fierce battles between the National Army and the Communist Army south of Pulandian.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] The 3,000-man 11th Brigade of the Communist Army, which attacked the Benxi Salt Factory, has been resisted by the National Army, and troops have been mobilized to complete the encirclement.

Harbin's Economy Plunges into a Vortex of Collapse; Prices Soar and Stores Close Down

[Central News Agency Changchun 22nd Dispatch] Harbin City has fallen into an economic collapse under the surge of the Communist Army's "Northeast Bank Notes". According to a merchant from Harbin recently, the price of grain in Harbin has broken the 70 yuan per catty mark for sorghum. Major stores are also closing down one after another due to liquidation struggles. The "Northeast Trade Bureau", which controls the entire economy of Songbei, has established five companies in Harbin City, including Minsheng and Harbin, to monopolize the purchase of all daily necessities. The actual value of the puppet Manchukuo hundred yuan currency has surged. One hundred yuan of Manchukuo currency can now be exchanged for two hundred yuan of "Northeast Bank Notes". Therefore, the paper money issued by the Communist Army has depreciated sharply in Songbei and the speed of circulation is increasing daily. Prices are soaring, with cigarettes being twice as expensive as in Changchun, and coarse cloth costing 400-500 yuan per foot. The people's livelihood is declining and has reached its peak. The merchant also said that the Communist Army is currently arresting and transporting more than 10,000 unemployed people in Harbin to the north for unknown purposes. Also, the park on Still Tenth Street, which has been called the "People's Slaughterhouse" of Harbin for years, has added more than 2,000 new corpses since the New Year. At the beginning of this month, he witnessed a young intellectual of about 20 years old being executed in the park's ditch under the charge of being a "Central Beard".

### Our Official Sources Cite Specific Facts Condemning the Philippines' Anti-Chinese Policy; Inconstancy Leads to the Stalling of Negotiations

[Central News Agency Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] When a Central News Agency reporter inquired about the current relationship between China and the Philippines, the anti-Chinese measures of the Philippine Congress, and the recent stalling of Sino-Philippine negotiations, our official sources unanimously expressed regret over the recent anti-Chinese attitude of the Philippine government.

Overseas Chinese Make Great Contributions

When meeting with reporters, official sources stated that there was no legitimate reason for the Philippine government's anti-Chinese policy, saying that the efforts of overseas Chinese in the Philippines over the decades have made great contributions to the development and prosperity of the Philippine Islands. During the Japanese occupation, not only did the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Philippines suffer great losses, but also many overseas Chinese joined the Philippine guerrilla forces to fight side by side. They made considerable sacrifices and contributions to the liberation of the Philippines and the common victory of the Allied countries. The Chinese people felt sincere joy at the birth of the Republic of the Philippines and the achievement of complete independence, and earnestly hoped that the birth of this new nation would enhance the friendship between the peoples of China and the Philippines. However, the realization of this hope seems to have been delayed due to the attitude of the Philippine government.

Only Overseas Chinese are Affected

When reporters continued to inquire about the specific facts of the Philippine government's anti-Chinese policy, they learned the following: (1) The Filipino Labor Bill in the Philippine Congress forces overseas Chinese to employ Filipinos to account for 60% of all employees. (2) The Filipino Retailer Bill in the Philippine Congress will make it impossible for overseas Chinese retailers to survive. (3) The quota for Chinese immigrants to the Philippines was already too low, and there is now a plan to reduce it by nine-tenths of the original number. Finally, there is the Filipino Hawker Bill passed by the Philippine Congress, which will seize all the stalls of overseas Chinese hawkers and give them to Filipinos. The implementation of this bill has been temporarily suspended only because the overseas Chinese filed a complaint in the Manila District Court. Official sources have repeatedly stated that allowing the establishment of stalls or refusing it is different from seizing stalls that have been operated by thousands of overseas Chinese for a long time. The establishment of overseas Chinese stalls has a long history, and they have been painstakingly managed to achieve their current scale. The livelihood of most overseas Chinese depends on this. The establishment of this bill will actually deprive overseas Chinese of their right to survive. Although the bill nominally applies to foreigners in general, only overseas Chinese are actually harmed. This kind of discrimination harms the interests of both China and the Philippines. What we should pay attention to is that this bill did not exist before the Philippine Islands became independent.

Do Not Understand the Philippine Attitude

Regarding the suspension of Sino-Philippine negotiations, official sources said that the Chinese government could not understand why the Philippine government adopted this attitude. The negotiation of this treaty had reached the stage where it could be signed. However, the Philippine government unexpectedly overturned all the agreed points and put forward proposals that were unrelated to and contradictory to the original case. Before the treaty is formally signed, it can be slightly modified. However, from the diplomatic practice of treaty making, clauses that have been agreed upon by both parties should not be proposed to be overturned without sufficient reason. Otherwise, agreeing today and overturning tomorrow is fickle, which will not only prevent negotiations from succeeding, but also make the other party embarrassed. Official sources believe that this action is inconsistent with the Philippine government's statement of hoping to promote Sino-Philippine relations. However, the Chinese government still hopes that the Philippine government can prove its goodwill with facts so that the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines can be protected and the negotiation of the Sino-Philippine treaty can be completed smoothly.

Philippine Cabinet Discusses Reply

[Central News Agency Manila 22nd Dispatch] Local Philippine official sources said that the Philippine government's reply to the first note from our Minister to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, may be submitted to the embassy today. It is said that the reply was discussed in yesterday's cabinet meeting, and the cabinet meeting fully supported it. Although the content of the reply has not been announced, it is generally believed that it will be consistent with the position taken by Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino in his statement to the press two days ago.

### US Liaison Group in Yan'an Decides to Withdraw on the 5th of Next Month

[United Press Beiping 22nd Dispatch] The US Liaison Group in Yan'an will also leave Yan'an on March 5th after the CCP personnel withdraw from Nanjing, Chongqing, and Shanghai. This withdrawal date was decided by Colonel Rumbaugh, director of the Liaison Group, and Colonel Walter, former US Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters. Walter flew to Yan'an with Hua Jian on the same plane yesterday. Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other CCP leaders welcomed them at the airport. Ye hosted Walter and his party for lunch. Mao Zedong did not attend but indicated that he could meet with the US personnel if they stayed overnight before returning to Beijing. According to US officers who returned to Beiping, the atmosphere in Yan'an is heavy and completely different from the optimistic atmosphere a year ago when Ye came to Beiping to take office as a member of the Executive Headquarters. Last November, most of the CCP agencies withdrew for fear of government troops attacking Yan'an. They have now returned, but the situation is still tense.

### Our Overseas Chinese in Hanoi Not Affected When Viet Minh Troops Withdraw; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Telegram Commending Consul General Yuan

[Central News Agency Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] Diplomatic news: When the Viet Minh troops withdrew from the Chinese-Vietnamese area of Hanoi, they did not damage the area in order to respect our neutrality, so overseas Chinese suffered almost no losses.

The French military authorities also assisted in supplying the Chinese area with rice, water, medicine, and other items, and congratulated the Consul General on the success of the peaceful negotiations. Now that the various situations in the area have stabilized and there is no fear of accidents, it can return to normal. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs praised the Consul General for repeatedly risking entering and leaving the Chinese-Vietnamese area and negotiating with both France and Vietnam appropriately, so that the overseas Chinese in the area were spared from disaster, and sent a telegram to commend him.

### Canada to Repeal Chinese Immigration Act

Currently Submitted to Parliament for Discussion

[United Press Ottawa 21st Dispatch] According to Canadian Prime Minister King, the Chinese Immigration Act passed in 1923 will be repealed. From now on, Chinese people in Canada will be treated the same as other Asians without racial discrimination. Everyone can be treated according to the ordinary regulations of the Immigration Act, and there will no longer be a special clause for Chinese people. However, it will still be considered an immigration bill by parliament. If passed, all Chinese people who have obtained Canadian citizenship, whose wives and unmarried children currently living in China are not allowed to reunite in Canada, will be allowed to enter. As for non-Asians who want to enter Canada, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

### UNRRA China Office Reveals Erroneous Information

American Newspapers Write Articles Condemning It

[Our Report] San Francisco 22nd Broadcast: Howard's newspaper recently condemned the erroneous report regarding the Chinese government's request to UNRRA to allow it to sell relief supplies on the black market, saying that the inaccurate information was revealed by the UNRRA China Office, whose staff have always been hostile to the Chinese government. The newspaper also said that the method of converting relief funds to purchase consumer goods and selling them to the public was suggested to the Chinese government by UNRRA staff, apparently out of dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Shanghai Office. The newspaper also accused totalitarian countries supported by the Soviet Union of selling relief supplies on the black market and using the proceeds to subsidize government expenditures, but UNRRA turned a blind eye. UNRRA subsidized the finances of some countries with "post-war relief" materials, while discriminating against other countries, China being a clear example.

### Hunan's Reconstruction and Construction Achievements Ranked First Among Four Provinces

Xie Yingzhou Talks in Hankou

[Our Newspaper Hankou 22nd Dispatch] Xie Yingzhou, Vice Minister of Justice, recently came to Hankou after inspecting the provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan. According to his speech, although Hunan Province suffered terrible destruction, the reconstruction and construction were enough to be the crown of the four provinces. The main driving force was that the relief supplies were mostly used for construction. For example, the Hunan Relief Sub-Administration allocated materials worth 2 billion to build four major prisons in Changsha, Hengyang, Changde, and Xiangtan, and allocated blankets and flour to the Changsha District Court Detention Center and the Ex-Prisoner Protection Association. Therefore, the prisoners in the prison all received blankets and nutritious products, and their food and clothing enjoyment was only seen by prisoners nationwide. Xie also said that although there may be some controversies in the distribution of materials, it is indeed an achievement to break the scope of passive relief and actively support construction.

### Tragic Massacre Occurs in Chengde - Provincial Health Director Allegedly Held a Grudge Over Embezzlement Rumors - Shoots Deputy Director and Worker, Then Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 22nd] A tragic massacre occurred here last week. Dai Hongfu, Director of the Rehe Provincial Health Department, died by slitting his throat, Deputy Director Qiu Chongzhou was shot and injured, and a worker, Zhang, was shot and fatally wounded. There are conflicting accounts of the incident. According to reliable sources: Dai was from Andong, a graduate of Qilu Medical University. During the War of Resistance, he served as the director of a health station on the Yunnan-Burma Road. After the victory, he was appointed to his current position. Recently, there were rumors that Dai had embezzled medical supplies allocated by the Executive Yuan. This came to the attention of Chairman Liu, who inquired with Dai about the truth and instructed him to pay attention to the conduct of his staff. Dai became unhappy because he had long been at odds with Deputy Director Qiu Chongzhou and doctor Wang. He suspected that Qiu and Wang were secretly harming him. He became anxious and distraught. On the evening of the 6th, he obtained a pistol from Wang Chang, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, on false pretenses. Upon returning, he invited Qiu to discuss official business. As soon as Qiu entered the room, Dai pulled out the gun and fired, hitting Qiu in the face, causing him to fall to the ground. A worker, Zhang, heard the noise and went to investigate. Dai then fired five more shots in the courtyard, injuring Zhang in the abdomen. Dai returned to his room, while Qiu escaped through a window. When provincial and local authorities arrived on the scene, Dai was found lying on the ground, dead, with a wound on his neck, two inches long and over an inch deep. A shaving razor lay nearby, and blood covered the floor. The scene was extremely gruesome. According to Qiu, after seeing that Qiu was not dead, Dai attempted to kill him with a knife. Qiu was in a state of mental confusion at the time and did not know how Dai died. However, Qiu's palm had a knife wound running across it. After examination by the prosecutor, the nature of Dai's wound did not appear to be self-inflicted. Therefore, some suspect that Qiu disarmed Dai in self-defense and killed him. Qiu has gone to Beiping for medical treatment. The case has been transferred to the Chengde District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The truth of the matter is difficult to predict at this time.

### Addendum to the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan"

— Luo Qinghua

How to Guide Black Market Hot Money to Actively Support Productive Enterprises

Due to the soaring prices and economic unrest triggered by the gold rush, the central authorities have convened numerous meetings, finally culminating on the 16th of this month with the Supreme National Defense Council formulating an economic emergency measures plan, which has been promulgated and implemented by order of the National Government. The plan's contents address various aspects, and it is indeed targeted at the current reality and economic ailments, sweeping away the long-standing practice of treating the symptom rather than the cause. It can be considered an emergency measure that conforms to the situation and public sentiment. However, being an emergency measure, it inevitably leans towards temporary solutions. Its essence can be encapsulated in the phrases "strengthen control and tighten credit." The problem of rising prices stems from two factors: (1) scarcity of goods and (2) excess of currency. The treatment method for the cause of the illness is to control and tighten, which is beyond reproach. However, if unexpected economic assistance is not forthcoming, then mere control cannot be sustained. Throughout the entire plan, the emphasis on how to actively support agricultural and industrial production to increase the supply of goods has not been strongly emphasized. Attempting to control goods and promote exports may not be as simple as one might imagine. Therefore, whether this can stabilize the currency value and balance the budget is worth studying. Furthermore, regarding the tightening of credit, the "Measures for Controlling Financial Operations" only control the operations of national banks and legitimate banks, while the most fundamental and massive black market hot money is not clearly addressed regarding how to suppress or guide it. Although all steps that should be taken to suppress prices, such as suppressing speculation, prohibiting gold trading, prohibiting foreign exchange circulation, controlling prices and wages, supplying daily necessities, controlling financial operations, and revising foreign exchange management, seem to have been formulated, with clear guidelines and comprehensive measures, all of these are merely concurrent economic ailments and not the root cause of the illness. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War in the mid-War of Resistance, a large amount of black market capital has been separated from legitimate financial institutions, and this has increased over time, becoming the "economic cancer" of our country for many years. Any economic market disturbance is due to the "activities of hot money." However, there has never been a proper method of blocking or guiding it, which cannot be achieved by "managing banks" or "controlling financial operations." This time, the emergency measures plan still does not have a method for giving this countless black market hot money a place to settle, and the issuing of tools for increasing hot money has not stopped. The vicious power of black market capital has become more rampant than during the War of Resistance. If the root cause of the illness is not removed, we cannot help but worry whether all the price control plans can achieve the expected effect of treating the symptoms. Moreover, although the same economic ailments exist, the pathological factors and time environment are significantly different from the War of Resistance period. If we still use the "Price Restriction Regulations" and "Extraordinary Period Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Regulations" from as far back as two or even eight years ago, whether these old prescriptions, which were not very effective at the time, can cure the illness today is also worth considering.

This humble author has always believed that economic problems can only be solved with economic measures, and political pressure can only be used occasionally as a supplement to remedy shortcomings. Especially since our country's organization is inferior to others, and there is no definite operational control over the personnel, training, integrity, and skills of the regulatory agencies themselves, it is difficult to expect them to fully implement their duties if they rashly carry out their duties. During the War of Resistance, how many people yearned for the control and distribution policies of Britain and the Soviet Union, believing that it would not be difficult for our country to catch up. However, the results of the trial implementation were mostly unsatisfactory. Even the provinces and cities with the strongest control suffered the most from the lessons of failure. After a long period of serious examination, the plan was changed in the 32nd year of the Republic, and the industry associations were allowed to set prices under the supervision of the government. As a result, the achievements were relatively satisfactory. The past is not far away, and the memories are still vivid. Considering that under the banner of "Resistance First, Nation Above All," with the National Mobilization Law available for use internally and the war zone blockade line as its scope externally, the expected effects of control could not be achieved. Now, the environment and time are vastly different from the past, the seaports are open in all directions, human desires are rampant, and political discipline and commercial ethics have both gone bankrupt. If high-level control is to be implemented, its consequences can be predicted without even trying. Moreover, the reason for rising prices during the war was mostly due to the prolonged blockade of the four borders, the increasing scarcity of goods, and the imbalance between supply and demand. As for the present, most daily necessities are not felt to be in short supply, and the purchasing power in various places is consistently low. The closure of factories and stores this year and the downward trend of red goods both fully demonstrate the current state of widespread recession. Theoretically, at least in the current situation, there should not be a serious price problem. Solely due to the announcement of export subsidies and import surcharges on February 6, preparations were not made beforehand as an exception, and the quantity and price of gold sold off afterwards were also mishandled, resulting in a sudden increase in gold and banknotes, stimulating prices and creating a huge uproar, setting a new record in the ten years of the War of Resistance. We believe that this crazy price surge was an unexpected event that should not have occurred. Under the influence of panic, industry and commerce may have temporarily engaged in bandwagoning, but most of them were just putting on a show and transactions were very few. The scarcity of remittances from the inland since the beginning of spring shows that actual sales are not rising. This time, the price surge will not be suppressed and will soon fall back. Even if prices rise again in the future, the main reason will be the increased issuance of "hot money." This is different from the situation during the war and should not be ignored. Any plan, whether temporary or fundamental, should take the transfer of black market hot money into production and construction as the only way to proceed. Minister Wang Yunwu once said, "There is a kind of contradiction in Shanghai's industrial sector. On the one hand, there is a shortage of funds, and requests are made to the government to handle industrial and commercial loans. On the other hand, there is an abundance of hot money, and they compete to speculate in gold trading." This is indeed the actual situation. But it is not that industrialists and businessmen both run real businesses, ask the government for loans on the right hand side, and engage in speculation on the left hand side with an abundance of hot money. The post-war economic market has been divided into two camps. One side is legitimate industry and commerce, which has endured hardships and remained self-reliant during the War of Resistance. Since the victory, it has still adhered to its posts, and under high interest rates, high wages, and virtual profits but actual taxes, it still suffers from a shortage of funds and has no access to loans. Most of the other side are newly emerging tycoons who buy gold, play with US dollars, manage loans, play high interest rates, package government bonds, and speculate and hoard, doing everything possible without engaging in productive enterprises. As with the former, there is very little surplus capacity to engage in speculation. Speculative capital has always caused trouble and disrupted the market, which is the robber of legitimate industry and commerce. It corresponds with bureaucratic capital, being close but distant, and colluding with each other. Reasonably speaking, legitimate industry and commerce and legally established banks should be protected by the government, while speculative capital and bureaucratic capital should be subject to national law. But the opposite is often the case. Black market capital does not need to deposit reserve funds, does not need to pay any taxes, and has no labor disputes. Although the government has formulated various laws, speculators do not need to have a significant store number or legal accounts. Evasion and trickery are often beyond the reach of the law. The total amount of deposit reserve funds of Shanghai's banks in January of this year was 340 billion yuan. It can be seen that the total amount of deposits in the city's banks is only over 200 billion yuan. At the same time, the amount of black market funds outside the banks is impossible to calculate. Based only on the estimated external debts of the factories and stores that went bankrupt last winter (as reported in the news, the debts of the bankrupt factories and stores, including national banks and bank loans, account for only one or two tenths, and the remaining eight or nine tenths are high-interest black market loans), black market funds should account for eight or nine times the local deposits in the loan category alone. If speculation in gold, banknotes, bonds, and hoarding are combined, then the black market hot money is ten times the total amount of deposits in Shanghai, which is over 2 trillion yuan, which is not excessive. The state controls the credit of banks in every possible way, but the black market hot money, which is ten times the amount of bank deposits, cannot be controlled. If it is allowed to flow freely, it will be difficult to implement economic policies across the board and bring the economic market back on track!

Since the War of Resistance, many control measures have often been swallowed whole, without distinguishing between friends and enemies, resulting in indiscriminate destruction. In many cases, speculative groups have not been harmed in the slightest, while legitimate industrial and financial enterprises have been severely persecuted, unintentionally or intentionally, turning into fraudulent cases and causing hot money to increasingly deviate towards the black market. For example, non-financial institutions receiving deposits is prohibited, but the current "Management of Banks" has detailed penalties for violations by banks, while there are still no measures to suppress black market deposits. This time, the "Management of Financial Operations" in the emergency measures plan has extremely strict regulations for commercial banks, provincial and municipal banks, and even national banks are not spared, but it is impossible to say that it is not a major omission that black market funds are not mentioned at all. The author believes that the activities of black market hot money are the biggest obstacle to all economic measures. Since this has been a well-known fact for many years, the government must address the reality, formulate separate laws, and severely suppress it, thereby guiding it into legitimate financial institutions and investing it in productive enterprises. This is the most urgent task at present. On the one hand, the government must provide active guidance to legitimate banks in addition to control, so that they can have the strength to cooperate with national economic policies and complete their tasks. As for national banks, since they each have professional responsibilities, assisting agricultural and industrial production and promoting export trade, the use of bank funds should not be restricted too strictly. The author recognizes that the "Management of Financial Operations" seems to emphasize suppressing the black market funds that are disrupting the market under government control, and should not, on the one hand, allow the black market to operate, and on the other hand, target legitimate banks as the object of strict control. As for the national banks, they should also adhere to national policies, stand on the same ground as the Central Bank, divide labor and cooperate, jointly control the black market, guide hot money, support productive enterprises, and achieve the entire economic measures plan.

### New Stage Approaching in Indian Political Situation - Britain Promoting Joint Indian-Burmese Defense - Mountbatten Will Probe Indian Authorities' Opinions on Defense

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] After Britain's decision to withdraw from India by June 1948 at the latest, the situation in Burma has become increasingly important. According to well-informed sources, the British military in Burma intends to organize the future defense of India. After Burma becomes an independent country in the future, Britain intends to conclude a military agreement with it, stipulating that all officers and non-commissioned officers in the Burmese army will be appointed by Britons, in order to expand a group of capable personnel in the Burmese army, a part of which will be sent to support the defense of India in times of emergency, without weakening the Burmese army. The excessive expenditures incurred by this measure will be borne by Britain, and not supported by the Burmese treasury. According to this plan, India should have troops permanently stationed at vulnerable locations on the northwest and northeast borders. In the event of an invasion, these troops will be the first to defend and support for a considerable period of time, awaiting the arrival of British officers from Burma to take command of other Indian troops. The port of Karachi in the Sindh province of India should be fully leased to Britain. The major task of the new Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, is to reach an agreement with the Indian authorities on this issue. Marshal Mountbatten has selected General Ismay, the military advisor to Churchill's wartime cabinet, as a staff member. Ismay's mission is to probe the Indian authorities' opinions on defense issues. This plan was drafted by General Rawlinson, the former Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, in 1923 in order to prepare for any eventuality, and at that time it was only a hypothesis.

[Our News] London Broadcast, 22nd: According to reliable sources: Governor-General Wavell of India has resigned, and Churchill will attack the government's India policy. It is reported that Wavell had a meeting with Churchill before resigning. Churchill will fight with the government based on Wavell's factual report. Also, the Indian Ambassador to the United States, Elly, passed through London and delivered a letter from the Indian National Congress to Prime Minister Attlee, requesting the government to remove Wavell from office.

[Reuters, London, 21st] The new Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, has not yet completed preparations for taking office. He is expected to depart within the next week and has now established a temporary office within the India Office.

[Agence France-Presse, Calcutta, 21st] Since Prime Minister Attlee made a statement on British policy towards India in the House of Commons yesterday, Nehru, Deputy Chairman of the Indian Interim Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to Mahatma Gandhi today, asking him to return to New Delhi to lead the Congress Party to assume the responsibilities imposed on the Congress Party by Prime Minister Attlee's statement.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 21st] Governor-General Wavell of India met with Nehru, Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, today, presumably to discuss the Indian policy announced by Prime Minister Attlee. Members of the Congress Party and the Muslim League in the Interim Government also held separate meetings today to discuss this declaration.

### US Security Not Guaranteed - Needs to Maintain Strong Military Force - Vandenberg Opposes Excessive Cuts in Military Spending - President Orders Procurement of Atomic Raw Materials Abroad

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Vandenberg declared today at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the proposed budget cuts to the Army and Navy would jeopardize our country's efforts to achieve peace. Of the $37.5 billion budget proposed by President Truman, the House has decided to cut $6 billion, while the Senate advocates cutting only $4.5 billion. Now that Vandenberg has spoken out, it is hoped that this will be voted on. However, many senators still want ample time for discussion, so a vote will not be taken immediately. The earliest date for a vote is next Monday. Vandenberg also said, "This year is a critical juncture. We must act swiftly and decisively and can no longer retreat into a fragile shell in the guise of pacifists, especially since other countries are expanding their military forces." Democratic Senator Maybank also read a new report from Moscow stating that the Soviet military budget exceeds President Truman's proposed Army and Navy expenditure of $11.2 billion by $4 billion.

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] President Truman issued an order today authorizing the US Atomic Energy Commission to urgently purchase war materials abroad and import them duty-free. Although the types of these raw materials were not specified, the order allows the Atomic Energy Commission to procure atomic raw materials abroad.

### US Pacific Fleet to Hold Major Exercises, First Restoration of Combat Effectiveness Since the War

[United Press International, Pearl Harbor, 22nd] Admiral Towers, Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet, announced today that the US Navy will begin full combat exercises next week to restore the Pacific Fleet's combat effectiveness for the first time since the end of the war. All warships have departed from thousands of miles away and are taking their positions to participate in the exercises. Thousands of sailors will also gain initial experience in naval warfare. However, the ships under the command of Admiral Kirk, Commander of the Western Pacific Naval Forces, and the occupying forces currently in Japan, will not participate in these exercises. The shock suffered by the US Navy due to rapid demobilization has almost been completely overcome. Although the efficiency of the Pacific Fleet has not reached its peak as desired by the Commander-in-Chief, it has been able to function actively. One mobile force will depart from ports on the US West Coast on the 22nd and 23rd, led by the aircraft carrier "Boxer." Another force will assemble in Kwajalein, with the aircraft carriers "Princeton" and "Tarawa" as its backbone. These two mobile forces will conduct exercises against each other and will unite around March 10th, simulating an attack on the Pearl Harbor fortress.

### France Uncovers Political Conspiracy, Traitors Forge Documents to Frame Government Leaders

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] French police revealed today that they have uncovered an organization within the Fresnes prison near Paris, a concentration camp for French traitors, that was forging secret German police documents and leaking them to foreign governments to cause misunderstandings about French resistance and political leaders. The authorities are handling this case with extreme secrecy. The police officers ordered to carry out the search were only notified an hour beforehand. They immediately divided into 15 police cars and rushed to the camp in batches at midnight to search. As a result, 19 people were arrested, including 14 French citizens who had served as informants for the Germans and 5 former German intelligence officers. In addition, 5 people in Paris were arrested in connection with the case. It is rumored that some prison guards and lawyers of the French traitors were also involved. The warden, seeing a large number of people rushing in, thought that there was a prison break and urgently telegraphed the Paris police department. The latter sent police to the scene, and the two sides almost clashed. After explaining the truth, the first batch of 70 policemen surrounded the prison and took away 30 people according to the list of suspects. A number of forged documents were also seized. After interrogation, 19 people were formally arrested and will be charged with possessing foreign (German) documents and forging documents that endanger national security. According to the Ministry of Interior, the German spies in the Fresnes prison were still communicating with leaders who were fugitives. They also asked foreign countries to provide them with documents from German files to frame certain French political leaders, such as French Foreign Minister Bidault, who served as chairman of the National Resistance Movement Committee at the end of the German occupation of France, and former Prime Minister Gouin. Police also said that some of these forged documents have been leaked to the British and American embassies and consulates in Paris. Among the five people arrested in Paris, two were French women who served as couriers for the conspirators. According to police officers, the leader of the conspirators was familiar with French political life, and a German, a former leader of the German secret police, drafted the documents, which were typed by Germans outside the prison in the format of German official documents, then transported into the prison, where a Belgian engraver added forged official seals, and then transported out of the prison, attempting to place them in foreign embassy files, disguised as genuine German documents. The leaders of the case were Captain Cavalcanti, a former subordinate of Vichy intelligence leader Jean-Nan, and Klein, a former leader of the German secret police in Paris. The two were housed in separate rooms, one above the other, in the prison.

### Munich Beer Hall to Be Converted into a Nightclub

[Reuters, London, 21st] Leipzig Radio reported that Hitler's old haunt, the Munich beer hall, will be converted into a nightclub for American soldiers.

In November 1939, an attempt was made to assassinate Hitler with a bomb at the site.

### British Ship's Chinese Sailors Missing, US Immigration Bureau Investigating

[United Press International, Philadelphia, USA, 21st] The US Immigration Bureau is investigating the disappearance of 12 Chinese sailors from the British cargo ship "Magpie" today.

### The Complex Indian Question: Unity or Partition? The Entire Question May Be Handled by the United Nations

[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast: The British and Indian spokesmen at Lake Success expressed doubts about the British handing over India to elected Indians. As for the Indian question being handed over to the United Nations, it is considered a possibility.

[United Press International, New Delhi, 21st] A senior official predicted today that when Britain relinquishes control of India on June 1948, the entire Indian question will be submitted to the United Nations conference for handling. Very few observers believe that the Muslim League and the Congress Party can abandon their differences and form a central government.

Muslim League figures say that no solution can satisfy the Muslim League unless Muslims and Hindus are completely separated. As for which parts of India will be included in the future independent Muslim state, it seems that it will be submitted to the United Nations conference for discussion. Currently, the governors of the Muslim League control the Sindh province in the west and the Bengal province in the east. The former's major city is Karachi, and the latter's major city is Calcutta, which is also the second largest city in the British Empire. The Punjab in the northwest is currently ruled by a coalition government, and Muslim League representatives insist that the Muslim League will occupy it before the British withdraw. In this complex situation, dozens of questions arise that cannot be resolved by the British and Indians, and will likely be submitted to the United Nations.

After the partition of Bengal province, the Assam province, which is predominantly Hindu, will be separated from the rest of India. Both Bengal and Assam provinces will likely appeal to the United Nations.

The Northwest Frontier Province, ruled by a Congress Party governor, will also be cut off after the independence of Punjab province in the future. Furthermore, there are a large number of Sikhs and Hindus in the southern part of Punjab province, who may demand to secede from the Muslim partition regime. The western part of Bengal province is predominantly Hindu, as is its major city, Calcutta. These districts may request the United Nations to allow them to secede from the partition regime. However, the Muslim League insists that Calcutta and the western Bengal coal mining area are necessary for the partition regime. The state of Hyderabad is ruled by a Muslim prince, but its people are about 85 percent Hindu. On the other hand, the scenic Kashmir province, located on the shoulder of the Himalayas, is predominantly Muslim, but ruled by a Hindu prince.

After the British withdrawal from India in 1948, the various princely states may continue to maintain relations with the British government, but the Congress Party has long expressed its opposition to any plan that allows "small islands" within India to remain under British influence. New Delhi is neither pleased nor disappointed with the British government's statement.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 21st] The British statement yesterday did not significantly change the Congress Party's decision to establish an independent sovereign Indian republic. However, the Congress Party said that the famous Rajaji formula of 1944 may be the basis for further negotiations between the Congress Party and the Muslim League. According to the Rajaji formula, which was previously agreed to by Gandhi, a plebiscite of adult citizens would be held in the Muslim-majority areas of the northwest and east to decide whether to implement the India-Muslim partition plan. It is still uncertain whether the British statement will be beneficial to the continued work of the Constituent Assembly, which was not attended by the Muslim League.

Nehru's newspaper, "National Herald," did not welcome the British statement's reference to the possibility of transferring power to local governments, saying that "this move will be the beginning of unrest in India, not the end."

### Procedure for Discussions on the German Peace Treaty, France Proposes a Compromise Plan, Advocating the Establishment of Five Committees to Define Tasks

[Reuters, London, 21st] The Four-Power representatives at the German question conference today discussed the committee structure under the Foreign Ministers Conference. French representative M. Couve de Murville proposed a compromise suggestion to reconcile the views of the Soviet Union with those of the other three powers, but Soviet representative Gusev has expressed reservations about the compromise plan. The French plan would classify the committees into two categories: (1) Four standing committees on political, territorial, economic, and military matters; (2) An advisory and information committee. The former would be composed only of representatives of the four powers and could submit reports and suggestions to the Foreign Ministers Conference and the Foreign Ministers' representatives' conference. Each standing committee could establish subcommittees to study specific issues. Small countries directly related to the issue could also be invited to participate. British and American representatives expressed dissent to this last provision, believing that other small countries should also participate in the subcommittees, in addition to the directly related small countries. The Four-Power representatives discussed the French plan for a long time today, but without result. It was decided to submit the first part of the Soviet Union's procedural plan, that is, the provisions excluding the committee organization part, to the expert committee for review.

### Britain Plans to Ally with France to Jointly Cope with the Soviet Union and the United States

[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast: Britain is currently intensifying pressure to persuade France to conclude an Anglo-French agreement so that Britain can obtain a loyal ally at the Foreign Ministers Conference. At the same time, Britain intends to establish a Western European group, the purpose of which is to confront the Soviet Union in terms of offense, and to cope with the United States in terms of defense. The reasons are: (1) The United States has threatened the markets of Britain and France in Europe; (2) The United States is now extending its influence to the colonies of Western European countries.

### The American Garrison in Germany Will Be Completely Reorganized, General McNarney's Farewell Chaos

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st, United Press International] Lieutenant General Clay, who will succeed General McNarney as commander of the US occupation forces in Germany on March 15, announced today a comprehensive reorganization of the US occupation forces, which will gather most of the leaders in the army in Berlin. This reorganization will begin when Clay takes over McNarney's responsibilities. The head of the intelligence department will be transferred to Berlin, and the planning and implementation personnel of the supply and civil affairs departments will remain in Frankfurt. The reorganization of the army does not involve changes in personnel. Major General Keating will now succeed Clay as the US member of the Allied Coordinating Committee in Germany.

[United Press International, Berlin, 22nd] General McNarney, commander of the US occupation forces in Germany, is about to retire and will be succeeded by Lieutenant General Clay. McNarney created chaos on his departure, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the failure of the four occupying powers to fulfill their duties in implementing the Potsdam Agreement. McNarney advocated that the US military should relieve the military government of its responsibilities and that commissioners appointed by the State Department should take over the management. Germany need not be fully occupied thereafter, only key areas such as the Ruhr industrial area need to be occupied to solve the problem. This occupation should last from ten to fifteen years to see whether Germany has established a government sufficient to fulfill the peace treaty. In short, the US military's organization and training are not good at administration, and the occupying government is best led by commissioners.

### The Electricity Problem Is Increasingly Serious, the British Government Calls for Austerity

After a long period of bacteriological examination, it was proven that leprosy had been eradicated, and they were allowed to be discharged.

### Truman Asks Congress to Allocate Funds to Relieve Liberated Countries, China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Poland Are Expected to Receive Assistance

[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast: In view of the imminent end of the UNRRA's work, President Truman has requested the US Congress to pass a relief fund of US$350 million for the needs of relief to liberated countries in 1947.

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is approaching. President Truman today requested Congress to allocate $350 million for the 1947 budget for relief to liberated countries. Republican Congressman Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, immediately introduced a bill stipulating that countries receiving US aid should allow American journalists to report on its use. The committee is scheduled to discuss the matter next week. As for the actual allocation of funds, a separate bill is usually introduced later. This fund is in addition to the $300 million in the Army Department budget for relief to occupied countries such as Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea. In his message to Congress, the President did not list the names of the liberated countries that should be given aid. However, the State Department had previously announced that China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Poland all need to receive assistance in addition to UNRRA relief. When Congress passed the last donation of $456 million to UNRRA last summer, it stipulated "freedom of the press," which is similar to what Eaton proposed this time, and its main target was the Soviet Union.

### The Cause of Death of the British Education Minister, the Court Will Conduct a Thorough Investigation

### Supplement to "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" Continuation from page two "Weekly Forum"

We request that all departments utilize their functions, mobilize a broader range of manpower, each adhering to their posts, and assuming responsibility at all levels, to jointly achieve success and complete the economic reform movement that the entire nation is urging. Combining the above arguments, it is believed that the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" is indeed an urgent solution for the present, but it must be implemented to its fullest potential to resolve the economic crisis. The following summaries are proposed for reference by all parties:

(1) In principle, it is confirmed that the current situation of rising prices and economic instability is caused by factors such as inflation and backward production.

(2) In terms of policy, the fundamental approach must focus on increasing production and reducing currency in circulation. However, as a temporary measure to address urgent needs, all restrictive, prohibitive, and regulatory measures stipulated in the plan must be implemented immediately and effectively.

(3) During the implementation process, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises and financial institutions should faithfully adhere to national policies and assist government departments in jointly completing the mission. However, the government should also distinguish between good and bad, support the righteous and suppress the evil, and avoid superficial measures, lest they have the opposite effect.

(A) Temporary measures, focusing on reducing speculative capital:

(4) The government should formulate laws and reiterate the ban on operating banking businesses without approval. All underground banks, bill discounting companies, etc., should be strictly prohibited. Ordinary companies and firms should also be prohibited from accepting deposits. Violators will be subject to heavy fines and imprisonment. Depositors who deposit funds in illegitimate financial institutions will not be protected by law. Once discovered, they will be subject to fines or confiscation of deposits.

(5) Isolate usurious loans. Legitimate financial institutions (including state-owned banks) should provide low-interest loans to industries, farmers, and businesses based on their actual needs, eliminating the need to seek high-interest loans in the black market. This will narrow the avenues for black market funds, lower interest rates, and naturally encourage capital to flow back, be deposited in legitimate banks, and channeled into production.

(6) Legitimate banks should cooperate with national policies and operate in accordance with the law. The central bank and state-owned banks should provide economic assistance.

(7) To channel the large amount of speculative capital after the prohibition of gold trading, state-owned production enterprises should be reorganized as soon as possible, and stocks should be issued. A pilot project can be launched with the China Textile Industries Corporation (中紡公司). Select several factories, hire experts to evaluate and announce their prices, and entrust state-owned banks to issue stocks, guaranteeing principal and interest. Stocks can be publicly traded through the stock exchange. Once the stock issuance is fully subscribed, a shareholders' meeting should be convened immediately. The China Textile Industries Corporation authorities should immediately transfer operations to the board of directors and supervisors of the newly established fully private company. Other factories and state-owned enterprises can be handled quickly in a similar manner. Ultimately, this will absorb large amounts of speculative capital, freeze purchasing power, prevent speculation in physical goods, and increase government revenue to make up for the budget deficit.

(B) Fundamental measures, focusing on increasing production:

(8) Our country is an agricultural nation, and its exports have always been dominated by rural specialties. In recent years, due to frequent wars, the countryside has been devastated. Even in bumper years, food still needs to be imported. Cotton, tobacco, and other products that were once self-sufficient now rely heavily on imports, consuming a considerable amount of foreign exchange. The people's livelihood is declining, and the national economy is deteriorating. If this continues, what will become of us? Since the purchasing power of the countryside is extremely weak, the urban industrial and commercial economy will inevitably collapse. Therefore, restoring the countryside is a matter of utmost urgency. Since the War of Resistance, the countryside has been unstable, and rural men and women have flocked to the cities. If they are encouraged to return to their hometowns for employment, their houses are in ruins, and they need financial assistance for plows, farm tools, and seeds. However, this is the fundamental principle. Those who plan for the country should take a broad view and not hesitate. It is planned to start with the southeastern and southwestern non-military regions first. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Cooperative Treasury should jointly formulate an agricultural production increase plan, prepare a budget, and submit it to the National Supreme Committee for approval and implementation. Ultimately, rice, wheat, cotton, and other products should be self-sufficient this year, reducing foreign exchange expenditures.

(9) Rural export products, such as silk, tea, tung oil, bristles, cattle, sheep, hides, furs, medicinal materials, and minerals, should be handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Farmers Bank of China, together with the former handling agencies, such as the Resources Committee, the Central Trust of China, the China Silk Corporation, etc., immediately propose a plan and budget, and provide as much lending as possible according to the actual seasonal needs, without delaying the farming season. It is hoped that the average output this year will increase by at least onefold compared to last year, expanding exports and increasing foreign exchange income.

(10) After the aforementioned production increase loan plan is approved by the government, the Central Bank should allocate funds and instruct specialized institutions such as the Farmers Bank of China and the China Silk Corporation to be responsible for handling it, without neglecting the effort for fear of minor setbacks, and without hesitation or procrastination.

(11) Although adjusting the exchange rate has largely resolved the difficulty of internal and external price differences in expanding exports, future changes are uncertain, and optimism is not warranted. However, export trade must not be delayed due to any difficulties. Therefore, the Central Trust of China and China Silk Corporation and other institutions can still handle purchases and supply for export. As long as the method is fair, not monopolistic, and does not hinder free trade, foreign countries will have no excuse. If there are still internal and external price difference issues for ten export items in the future, the import and export linkage system may still be adopted at its discretion. Ultimately, the goal is to promote exports through various different and effective methods.

(12) There should be an overall plan for industrial production increase. For certain kinds of daily necessities and export goods, an ordering system can be adopted, following the precedent of the guest engineer, Mr. Gibson, considering the factory's production costs. Low-interest production loans should continue to be offered to isolate black market funds and reduce production and marketing costs. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office should investigate equipment and verify loans in advance, and the bank should audit it at any time to eliminate malpractices.

(13) Both agricultural and industrial loans may be agreed upon, as needed, to repay part or all of the principal and interest at the price of real goods, with both parties assessing a fair price according to the market.

(C) Price controls, based on industry price negotiations:

(14) Recognize the significant difference between current prices and wartime prices. In wartime, the main reason was the imbalance between supply and demand, and prices rose in a straight line. Therefore, preventing hoarding of goods was effective. Now, the main reason is excessive speculative capital and a decline in currency value. Preventing price manipulation is the focus, and reducing currency in circulation is the focus, while implementing price negotiations is a means. (According to last year's experience, a straight-line increase is no longer possible because interest rates are high and the supply of goods is unimpeded. Several price surges last year subsided naturally after a short period of time, and merchants no longer dare to hoard goods for profit). This is the difference between the past and the present.

(15) The government should announce price negotiation methods, using production, transportation, and sales costs plus legitimate profits as the price negotiation principle, and industry-wide control should be handled in accordance with the Industry Association Law.

(16) In accordance with the supply measures for daily necessities, the government should properly control material costs and control the market.

(17) To control finance, based on the deposit reserve box, the number of bank deposits is especially significant. Furthermore, in light of the recent crazy market turmoil, banks are as usual, and money is not very tight, able to control speculative capital. Therefore, in addition to formulating another bill (see item 1), banks should also automatically increase deposit interest rates to guide speculative capital. When deposits increase and costs decrease, banks should gradually reduce loan interest rates to cooperate with national policies. (Note) During this wave of instability, some newspaper headlines mistakenly referred to it as a financial panic. Even the written conversations of the civil and financial authorities were transmitted incorrectly and referred to it as "the shame of the banking industry," which is indeed shocking. Since the New Year, the banking industry has been stable as usual, and there have been few changes in depositors. During the crazy price increases, there was no rush to withdraw deposits, so money was not tight. However, it was heard that various banks were tight on funds because there were many depositors. It is not difficult to imagine who the large depositors of the banks are, so it is also clear who the major gold buyers were this time. Commercial banks themselves dare not buy gold and banknotes illegally, and most commercial deposits are small, so they are not enough to affect the gold rush. The truth is clear without investigation. In summary, this was clearly a gold and banknote rush that stimulated the price rush, which is almost known to everyone, but the deliberate distortion of facts, calling it "a financial panic," is difficult to understand. (End)

### Printing Counterfeit Money. Counterfeit Money Organization Cracked Down in the Countryside of Huzhou. Technical Workers Recruited in Shanghai and Escorted to Secret Work. Evidence Searched Out from Haystack and Empty Coffin.

[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Qingsun, Director of the Changning Road Police Bureau Branch in West Shanghai, reported to Police Officer Wang Jianhua of the Judicial Section a month ago that there was a counterfeit currency organization with a large amount of counterfeit money produced, the largest in the city, totaling more than 140 million yuan. After receiving the report, Director Wang ordered Deputy Director Shao Yuanbin, Section Chief Shi Jieren, and others to start the investigation. He dispatched a large number of police officers on January 29 to investigate, but found no clues. On the morning of the 15th of this month, he received a third confidential report stating that they were selling and buying counterfeit money mostly around the Bazilu area. Section Chief Shi led the police to investigate secretly. Later, at the back door of No. 5 Hong'anli, they discovered a man and a woman who were related to the case. They were paying 2 million yuan to another person to buy 7 million yuan of counterfeit money. The police arrested both parties and took them to the bureau for questioning. According to the male confession: his name is He Baorong, the woman's name is Sheng Wumei, and the other person who sold the counterfeit money is Mo Zhongsheng, also known as Zhu Zhenzhi. The case handlers

interrogated strictly and he began to tell the address of Mo's residence, which was No. 5 Yihou Li, Jijiazhai Road, Hongkou. He then led them to the address, and as a result, more than 10 million yuan of counterfeit money was copied from a small box in a large suitcase. Two bundles of banknote paper were found behind the bed, a paper cutter was found in the closet, and several copper plates were hidden in the lower layer of the water tank. Each counterfeit seal of the president and vice president of the Central Bank was placed in an iron plate hole under the stove. The exhibits were taken to the bureau together, and after further interrogation, Mo had no choice but to

confess to the real supply. It is said that the principal offender, Lu Jin'ao, is the Zhongxiao guerrilla commander of Huzhou. He lives at No. 137 Pubei Lane, Tongqing South Road. His accomplice, Chen Youren, is a senator of Wuxing. He is hiding at No. 80 Yuanyuan Hotel, Jiujiang Road. There is also Zou Yunfang, who lives at No. 423 Jianguo East Road. The police bureau successively arrested the above three people. According to Lu Jin'ao's confession: this matter started as early as a year ago and was initiated by Mo Taizhong and Zhang Wuhao (Zhang held a military post and had great potential), who is on the run. At that time, Zhang invested 1.3 million yuan, and Mo was responsible for technical responsibility. Lu entrusted a Yang surnamed person to make a model with Mo, but neither was satisfactory. Later, Mo invited a Lai surnamed person from Taiwan and Chen Ada to join in the making of the plate, but there was little effect. Later, Wen Jinghao was hired to make the plate,

and it was successful. He is staying at No. 5 Nanyangli, Zhejiang North Road. On the same day, he was arrested. According to him, the plate maker and technical workers recruited each time were escorted by Zhang to Huzhou, Wuxi and other places on the night train for secret work. Shanghai only has offices, and the factory is located in Jianshan, 60 miles away from Huzhou, Huzhou. According to the confession, at 3:00 p.m. on the 17th, Deputy Director Shao prepared a document and led member Wei Jinquan, police chief Li Wenbin, and policemen Gu Kunqi and Wang Dianxuan, escorted the two criminals Mo Zhongsheng and Chen Youren, and took a car to Suzhou, passed Nanxun and reached Huzhou. He submitted a document to the county police bureau, and they sent Inspector Li Jiaqing to accompany him. They took a three-plank boat through Chongzhao Town and Yueshi Town at night and arrived at Jianjiang Mountain. Because the ports and rivers in the area were vertical and horizontal, and bandits appeared from time to time, they searched everywhere, but could not find a way to start. At this moment, the factory staff Mo Achi, Li Weiji, etc. happened to pass by. Under the guidance of Chen Youren,

they were arrested and then confessed that there was a machine hidden in the haystack at No. 17, and there were parts (1) a printing press, including a complete set of accessories, (2) three sets of counterfeit copper printing plates, a total of nine pieces, (3) counterfeit copper seals of the president and vice president of the Central Bank, (4) a set of circular instruments, (5) a paper cutter, (6) six sheets of photographic paper, (7) four sketching pens, as well as dozens of pieces such as Shantou ink rolling tube small handsaw and small copper plate powder. When it was copied, 18.5 million yuan of banknotes with a denomination of 2,000 yuan were also copied. All of the above items were placed in the empty coffin on the mezzanine floor. The handling police officers brought the witnesses back to Shanghai and brought them to justice.

### Sacrificing Individual Enjoyment to Fight for Independence and Freedom: Four Sino-American Organizations Celebrate Washington's Birthday, Ambassador Stuart Delivers an Encouraging Speech to the Nation

[Our Newspaper] The American University Alumni Association, the American Association of University Women, the Sino-American Cultural Association, and the Shanghai Returned Students Association jointly held a Washington's Birthday celebration at the Ritz Restaurant at 7 PM last night. More than 700 Sino-American dignitaries and socialites attended, including Mayor Wu and American Consul General Davis. The meeting was chaired by Wei Zengfu, President of the Returned Students Association. On the left side of the hall, two pillars were erected, each adorned with the flags of China and the United States, shining in mutual splendor. The guests socialized and enjoyed themselves, the gathering lasting until late at night.

During the event, Wei Zengfu first delivered a speech explaining the significance of holding the joint celebration, and then invited Mayor Wu to introduce Ambassador Stuart. Mr. Wu briefly stated: "During this difficult and challenging time for our country, we do not need agitators; we need sages. We do not need diplomats; we need kind and friendly ambassadors. I feel deeply honored today to introduce to you a gentleman who was born in China, grew up in China, and has lived and shared hardships with us. A sage and mentor, truly a wise teacher as Confucius hoped for, a sincere and kind ambassador unprecedented in the history of Chinese diplomacy." Following this, Ambassador Stuart delivered a speech, using Washington's spirit of fighting for freedom and independence to encourage the people of China to sacrifice individual interests for the greater good of the nation. His entire speech was profound, moving, and won a standing ovation.

Ambassador Stuart's Warning: China's Real Enemies Are Illiteracy, Poverty, Disease, and Selfish Abuse of Public Office

Ambassador Stuart's speech, in brief, stated: "Although Washington's birthday is entirely an American holiday, it holds special significance for patriotic Chinese. In the commemorative spirit of the war we are in today, I would like to draw your attention to several aspects of Washington's career, which seem to have a special meaning for the current situation in China. In commenting on these situations, I ask you to apply your historical imagination to Chinese figures and problems.

We must not only think of Washington's contributions to the country throughout his life, but also of his own sacrifices. Because at that time, Washington could be considered the wealthiest and most comfortably situated person in all the American colonies. His residence had smooth lawns, and the house was filled with the most elegant furniture and decorations of that era, which could even be considered magnificent and luxurious by modern standards. He possessed all the comforts and enjoyments, yet he did not hesitate to sacrifice all of this for the dangers and uncertainties of the revolution.

Among his friends and contemporaries, there were many aristocratic figures as wealthy as Washington who dared not take such risks, preferring to maintain the colonial status. Many of them became 'collaborators' with the British army, much like those Chinese who collaborated with or worked for the Japanese a few years ago. From this, we can understand the temptations that Washington faced at the time, and his lofty ideals. The victory of China's War of Resistance against Japan is also due to the same noble characteristics of Chinese leaders, and Chinese patriots should feel proud of their similar fortunes, and I am equally proud of them.

What did Washington sacrifice everything for? He would probably say: for freedom or independence. What he had in mind was the self-government or democracy of the people, in which precious freedom is expressed. This concept of freedom is not found in books, but in the entire environment and tradition. When Lincoln mentioned the influence of the Declaration of Independence on him personally, he said: 'There is a sentiment here that will not only liberate the people of this country forever in the future, but also give hope to the world, giving everyone an equal opportunity.'

This idea has now been acquired by countless patriotic Chinese. The glorious ideals that created the first Kuomintang revolution and promoted the overthrow of the old Qing Dynasty have reappeared in the War of Resistance against Japan and various other national movements. China has now gained independence and has achieved a position of dignity and great potential power in the international community. The main problem in China today lies in achieving democratic government among the people, including the personal freedoms promised by the new constitution. However, in the struggle to bring these about, every Chinese patriot should take one thing as a prerequisite, and that is that he should be willing to sacrifice his own small self for the greater good, just as Washington did. China's real enemies today are internal difficulties, and overcoming these difficulties requires selfless dedication and courageous and optimistic determination. And this determination has been demonstrated in the past in resisting foreign aggression. China's real enemies are illiteracy, poverty, disease, and the selfish abuse of public office, including the personal interests of relatives and friends, as well as narrow and cruel partisan prejudices. China's hope lies in developing a new sense of national identity.

Seeing the special nature of the current national crisis, this lofty determination to put the nation first may be more influential in Shanghai than elsewhere, and I hope that those who have been educated in the United States will be the first to respond to this noble effort. In any case, I feel that the Americans here tonight will share my belief that our country sympathizes with the efforts of Chinese patriots in building a free, unified, peaceful, and democratic government."

### Shào Shìjūn's Antique Disappearance Case: District Procuratorate Summons Zhuāng Hèréng for Questioning

[Our Newspaper] After the victory, the former residence of the traitor Shào Shìjūn at 80 Àitáng Road was initially taken over by the General Affairs Section Chief of the City Party Headquarters, Dǒng Jiǔzhī, and staff members such as Zhuāng Jié, who were responsible for the takeover.

### British Blind Baronet Benefits the Similarly Afflicted: The Status of Blind People in China Is Still in the Second Stage, Hired to Come to China to Guide the Work of Rehabilitation and Education for the Disabled

[Our Newspaper] British blind welfare expert Sir Mackenzie, accompanied by Dr. Flowers, hosted reporters at the Executive Yuan yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. During the meeting, Ms. Liu Dewei of the Relief Department of the Executive Yuan introduced the two, saying: Sir Mackenzie was blinded in both eyes during the First World War and is currently an advisor to the Indian government. Dr. Flowers has worked in China for 20 years. The two are extremely interested in China, especially the welfare of the blind, so this time they decided to come to China in response to the joint invitation of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Social Affairs to guide the work of rehabilitation and education for the disabled.

Following this, Sir Mackenzie delivered a speech stating: The evolutionary status of blind people in society can be divided into three stages: (1) In the initial stage, the entire lives of blind people are spent in suffering, darkness, poverty, and being despised, with no one to care for them, as people generally believe that after becoming blind, they cannot engage in any work; (2) At this time, a small number of groups work for the welfare of the blind, and although they achieve some success, they encounter many difficulties; (3) Subsequently, widespread social organizations and government agencies pay attention to the welfare of the blind, trying to provide relief, education, and find ways to earn a living. China is currently in the second stage.

Two Million Blind People in India

Sir Mackenzie strongly advocated that blind people must be cultivated and can become useful talents. He also reported on the current environment for blind people in India, where, due to the tropical climate, people are stimulated by the hot sun and ash, which over time causes blindness, so it is estimated that there are approximately two million blind people in India. In the past sixty years, the government and social organizations in India have gradually worked hard for the blind, such as running schools, establishing workplaces, training handicrafts, and providing employment opportunities in society. Sir Mackenzie himself has been serving blind people in India for four years. In addition, he also works specifically for blinded soldiers, providing them with equal education and technical training. Many blind people are now able to do various jobs, such as knitting wool, cloth, and towels, making rattan chairs, tables, and baskets, typing, writing, and working as music technicians. Among them, two soldiers who were both blind and had both arms amputated were able to type. This technology is provided with specially made typewriters, with artificial wrists attached to the soldiers' arms, allowing them to type quickly and accurately.

Departing for Beijing Today and Traveling to Various Places

At the same time, the St. Dunstan's Blind Institute in London, England, is famous throughout the UK. It was founded in 1915 by the famous British journalist Sir Arthur Pearson, who lost his sight in 1909 and strongly advocated that blind people should also be given opportunities for vocational training, so he founded the institute. Sir Mackenzie himself is also a graduate of St. Dunstan's Institute.

After arriving in Shànghǎi, Sir Mackenzie has visited several blind welfare organizations in the city and is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing today, after which he will go to Chongqing, Chengdu, Beiping, Guangzhou, and other places to conduct inspections. He will prepare a report on the results of the inspections to discuss improvements, with the period in China set for two months.

### Wú Suìrén's Case Concluded: Claims Loan Purpose Was to Help Small Businessmen

[Our Newspaper] The District Court yesterday held another hearing to examine the case of Wú Suìrén, the former chief cashier of the Executive Yuan, who embezzled 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for interest-bearing fraud. After the debate was concluded, the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month. The defendant Wú Suìrén claimed yesterday that the purpose of privately lending public funds was to seek profit and to help small businessmen, so the interest rate was very low. He also said that he voluntarily surrendered after the case was discovered and asked the court to be lenient in sentencing. However, the prosecutor refuted that the surrender should be made to the court, not to the superior officer. In this case, the defendant only notified the superior officer after the case was discovered and cannot be regarded as a surrender. According to witness Zhōu Jīnfú, the loan was indeed made, and the original plan was to lend for half a month, but the money was recovered in eight or nine days. The defendant's lawyer had applied for bail, but Judge Shào Rénjié rejected it, and the defendant was still remanded in custody.

The robber took the opportunity to steal the cash and fled without a trace. Later, passersby discovered the incident and quickly summoned an ambulance to take him to the Gōngjì Hospital for treatment, but because the injury was to a vital organ, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

### Musings by the Basketball Court

Last night, Hwa Lien played with their full strength, with Da Li, A Di, Lao Bao, Xue Chong, and Xiang Cheng. This was likely Hwa Lien's strongest lineup. Although they won against Encas by four points, the performance was not ideal. The defense under the basket was not tight enough, and there were many wasted opportunities in the first half. Only Da Li and Lao Bao played up to their usual standards. Xue Chong was not at his best. The team seemed to lack practice, but his steady passing still made an impact.

The final match between Chen You and Zong Lin in Group B was thrilling. Chen You wore red, while Zong Lin wore green. Both teams adopted a man-to-man defense, with clear and fast movements, making for a spectacular display. The first half ended 9-9, evenly matched. In the second half, Chen You took the lead 15-10, the largest lead of the entire match. Zong Lin then overtook them 18-17. After that, the score fluctuated, remaining within three or four points. Chen You finally won the championship 25-22. Chen You's victory was due to their quick shots, drives to the basket, and more accurate shooting. In terms of teamwork, Zong Lin was actually

In another match in Group B, the Indian team showed rapid improvement, and it was very difficult for Pei Er to win. (Chang Nian)

### How to Transfer State-Owned Industries to Private Ownership - Initial Exchange of Opinions Yesterday - Massive Assets, Market Capital Difficult to Bear - Value to be Estimated First, Measures to be Drafted for Further Discussion

(Our Report) Regarding the method of transferring state-owned production enterprises to private ownership, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, convened the heads of relevant agencies yesterday for an initial exchange of opinions. The meeting began at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Bank of China Building on Renji Road on the Bund in this city and adjourned at 5:30 PM. The attendees included Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Qian Changzhao, Shu Yunjun, Liu Gongyun, Li Fuxun, Xu Jiyu, Tai Runqing, Chen Guangfu, Yang Xiren, and Xu Guangchi.

After the meeting, Vice President Weng told reporters that the meeting was convened according to Article 1, Section D of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan: All state-run production enterprises, except those in the heavy industry sector and those that must be operated by the government due to significant special circumstances, should be sold or sold to private ownership through the issuance of shares in order of urgency. Premier Song instructed the convening of the heads of relevant agencies to discuss the implementation measures. After today's meeting, it was generally believed that the assets of various state-owned production enterprises were too large, and the market capital might not be able to absorb them all at once. Therefore, it was proposed to focus on practical work steps. The relevant authorities in charge of each enterprise, such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Resources Commission, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office, should first estimate the value of the assets of their respective production enterprises, list detailed schedules, and prepare a written opinion on how to transfer them to private ownership. These should be submitted to the meeting for discussion, and then implementation measures should be decided. The next meeting is expected to be convened in about a week.

### Major Players Rush to Unload - Chinese Stocks Lose Color

The vigor of Chinese stocks decreased slightly yesterday. While influential figures and bank cartels pushed upwards, major players in the industry unanimously sold, leading to a tug-of-war. Ultimately, with the environment becoming increasingly unfavorable, fatigue was evident at the end.

The morning opened low, continuing the downward momentum from the previous day. Qinxing caused widespread selling because the opening price was unreliable, dropping from a high price to the daily limit. Deyong Yarn was aggressively sold, from 133, 152, 145, 97, 8, 137, 185, 28, and 223, falling to 2355 yuan. Numbers 171, 224, 76, 173, 178, 145, and 23, as well as retail investors, bought in. The bank cartels had healthy appetites. Deyong Yarn rose to 2500 yuan. Numbers 145, 198, 152, 125, and 223 sold out, falling back to 2390 yuan.

Numbers 152, 145, 223, 219, 224, 154, 76, 91, and 12 aggressively sold out, and the afternoon saw the decline intensify, falling to a low price at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Deyong Yarn, Xinyi, American, New Light, Jingfu, and Dongxing all fell by 10% to slightly more than 10%, Huafeng fell by 5%, and sluggish stocks such as Commercial Press and Sino-French rose slightly. Underwear brand Jinglun was flat. There were no transactions for Zhongsi, Wuhe, and Jiufu. The rest fell by 5% to 15%. Off-market stocks remained relatively stable.

### Bond Market Fluctuates - Few Transactions

Government bonds continued to fluctuate yesterday. Bonds A, B, C, and D initially fell before rising, and then weakened at the close. Type E initially rose before falling, with few transactions, totaling no more than 4 million yuan. Tongbing opened in the morning at 7500 yuan, fell to a low of 7300 yuan after opening, rose to 8300 yuan in the middle, and finally hovered around 7600 yuan.

### US Dollar Savings Bonds and Government Bonds - All Converted at the New Exchange Rate

Since the government announced the Economic Emergency Measures Plan and prohibited the circulation of foreign currencies, there has been much doubt about how to handle US dollar government bonds and US dollar savings bonds. Recently, a reporter learned from the Coinage Department of the Ministry of Finance that since the government promulgated the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations in February 1946, all US dollar bonds issued by the government are regarded as foreign exchange in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. Therefore, matured US dollar government bonds, US dollar savings bonds, interest coupons, and winning tickets can be exchanged for legal tender at designated banks according to the newly established exchange rate.

### This Year's Salt Loan Total - Increased to 140 Billion

In order to cooperate with government policies, regulate food for the people, and increase production, the Four Joint Offices specially organized salt loans last year, dividing them into the Shanghai and Chongqing regions to handle transportation, sales, and production matters. This year, salt transportation costs have increased significantly, and salt taxes have also been adjusted. The situation has changed greatly. The total amount of salt loans for this year should be increased. The Salt Administration has formulated the national salt loan amount based on the actual situation. It is understood that the total amount of production and sales loans in the Sichuan salt region has been revised to 80 billion yuan, and the total amount of production and sales loans in the Huai salt region is 62 billion yuan, for a total of 142 billion yuan. The Sichuan salt region includes the production and sales areas of Sichuan salt: (1) the Sichuan-Kang area, (2) the Hunan-Hubei area, and (3) the Guizhou area. The Huai salt region includes (1) the Lianghuai area, (2) the Shandong area, (3) the Hunan-Hubei area, and (4) the Anhui-Jiangxi area. It is also understood that loans for transportation equipment and warehouse construction are all included in the above loans. The Shanghai and Chongqing Silver Gardens will soon convene a committee meeting to discuss the allocation of production and sales amounts and report to the Four Joint Offices for final approval.

### Silver Shops Buying and Selling Jewelry - Money Situation, Management, and Storage - Director of the Coinage Department Says It May Be Difficult to Grant

(Our Report) A reporter interviewed Dai Mingli, Director of the Coinage Department, yesterday to inquire about the issue of jewelry sales. According to him, regarding the request of the silver industry to be allowed to buy and sell gold jewelry, Article 1 of the Measures for Suppressing the Buying and Selling of Gold prohibits the buying and selling of gold bars and gold jewelry, with violators being confiscated and forfeited to the government. Therefore, the request may be difficult to grant. Furthermore, regarding the request of the money exchange industry to be allowed to operate small-amount deposit business, the originally defined business scope of the money exchange industry did not include this item, so it also seems difficult to grant the request.

### Exchanging Waste Cotton for Textile Machine Parts - Relevant Parties Are Negotiating with Japan

(Our Report) According to estimates by people in the textile industry, China imported 20,000 spindles from foreign countries last year. It is estimated that 100,000 spindles can be imported this year, and it is hoped that 200,000 spindles can be imported next year. In terms of domestic manufacturing capacity, China currently produces 20,000 spindles per year, while Japan can produce 500,000 spindles, a huge disparity. It is understood that relevant parties are considering exchanging waste cotton for parts and accessories for cotton spinning machines from Japan. Before the war, Japan had 12 million spindles, and its supporting equipment, such as parts and accessories, matched this scale. Today, Japan's textile industry has shrunk to 3.5 million spindles, so there must be many remaining parts and accessories. China currently has about 1 million spindles received, but they cannot start operating due to a lack of parts. Therefore, if this barter trade can succeed, it will greatly contribute to the development of China's cotton textile industry. It is said that relevant parties have begun negotiations. The key to success or failure lies in the attitude of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo.

### Using Group Arbitrage to Attract Deposits - Securities Exchange Has Taken Measures to Suppress - Four Articles Stipulating Measures for Managing Arbitrage Transactions

(Our Report) The Shanghai Stock Exchange has made a statement regarding opening up arbitrage transactions. The original text states that the purpose of opening up arbitrage transactions is to guide floating capital into the right track. Brokers should adhere to the principle of buying and selling on behalf of customers and not use it as a method of managing funds. Recently, some individual brokers in the Exchange have published group arbitrage advertisements, revealing methods for guaranteeing interest and dividends, which are close to attracting deposits and are clearly in violation of Article 21 of the Exchange's Provisional Business Rules. Furthermore, arbitrage transactions must be completed on the floor. Transactions made through internal transfers may lead to abuses. In order to prevent problems and enhance the reputation of brokers, the Exchange has stipulated four articles of measures for managing arbitrage transactions, which will be implemented from today. The measures are as follows:

(1) Individual brokers of the Exchange who accept customers' entrustment for arbitrage transactions shall complete the transaction on the floor and shall not complete the transaction through internal transfers. After the transaction is completed, they shall hold the transaction note or list to the Auditing Section of the Business Department of the Exchange for stamping and certification.

(2) The accounts of individual brokers of the Exchange for items related to arbitrage on behalf of customers shall be displayed separately and marked with the words "arbitrage on behalf of customers" and shall not be mixed with other items.

(3) Individual brokers of the Exchange shall publish the account statements for each period to all clients when conducting group arbitrage on behalf of various groups.

(4) Individual brokers of the Exchange who conduct arbitrage on behalf of customers shall not guarantee interest or dividends on the principal delivered by the clients, except for the interest actually earned from arbitrage. The methods for proving the transaction note are as follows:

(1) Brokers shall not refuse to obtain a transaction note certified by the Exchange at the request of the customer. If the broker refuses to provide proof, the customer may directly request proof from the Exchange. If a transaction note is not certified by the Exchange, the customer may not claim priority to the surety money paid by the broker to the Exchange in the event of a dispute.

(2) Brokers have the obligation to reply to the Exchange for the corresponding floor account number of each transaction note and how the price was agreed upon.

(3) For transaction notes that do have corresponding floor accounts, the Exchange will affix the certification seal and the private seal of the person in charge (the impression style can be obtained from the Exchange).

(4) Transaction note certification matters will be handled by the Auditing Section of the Exchange (Room 120, Securities Building).

(5) Certification time starts at 9:00 AM on the day following the transaction day (including the after-market of the previous day).

### The Number of Firms that Suspended Operations Last Year - Chengda Bank and Jianguo Bank - The Ministry of Finance Revokes Licenses - Liquidation of Deposits Supervised by the Municipal Government and the Central Bank

(Our Report) The Ministry of Finance announced yesterday the revocation of the original approval for the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank and issued a statement as follows: The Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank both stopped exchanging after December 20 of last year due to a shortage of funds. The Ministry of Finance sent personnel to inspect and learned that the business of the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank was not normal even in normal times. Loans were extremely excessive, and managerial personnel misappropriated bank funds, evaded the payment of deposit reserves, and engaged in illegal activities such as buying and selling gold and foreign exchange. They also set up secret accounts to conceal the true state of assets and liabilities and engaged in illegal operations in an attempt to evade control. Furthermore, Jianguo Bank did not follow the regular business procedures for lending and there were many irregularities and secret accounts for recording income. When the money supply tightened and depositors made withdrawals, the two banks declared suspension of operations. In order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance ordered them to repay deposits within a specified period of time. They were also ordered to report all creditors and debtors to be reviewed and approved. However, the liquidation of the two banks' creditors and debtors has been in progress for more than a month, and there is still little progress. In order to show punishment and serve as a warning, the Ministry of Finance has revoked the original approval for the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank. The liquidation of deposits has been entrusted to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Central Bank for supervision to protect the interests of depositors.

A reporter interviewed Dai Mingli, Director of the Coinage Department of the Ministry of Finance, yesterday, who said that the Ministry of Finance sent letters to the two banks on January 29 of this year regarding the suspension of exchange by the two bank branches, instructing them to sort out all deposits and issued bank drafts within half a month from the date of the letter and to sort out all debts within one month. Later, on February 8, it received a reply from the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank stating that it was raising funds to sort things out. On the same day, it also received a reply from the Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank stating that it would comply with the order. However, it has not yet seen the liquidation completed.

It is reported that the Shanghai Branch of Chengda Bank was suspended from exchanging at the clearing house on December 23 of last year. The headquarters of the bank was established in Chongqing in 1940. The capital was 20 million yuan, and it recently planned to increase its capital to 500 million yuan. The chairman is Li Zushen. The general manager and manager of the Shanghai branch is Zhang Yuliang, and the deputy manager is Zhang Jinghan.

The Shanghai Branch of Jianguo Bank was suspended from exchanging at the clearing house on December 26 of last year. The bank was founded in Chongqing in May 1941 by Sun Linfang and others. The capital was 10 million yuan. On March 26, 1946, the Shanghai branch was established. On June 1, the headquarters also moved to Shanghai. On June 10, the Shanghai branch officially opened. In addition to the branch at 200 Nanjing Road, there are also two branches at 795 Nanjing West Road and 963 Linsen Middle Road in this city. The current chairman and general manager is Sun Linfang, and the manager of the Shanghai branch is Fan Yuqin.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Tighten

The sugar market trend continued to tighten yesterday. Green sugar rose by another 5,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan, and others also slightly improved. The Haohuo Oil Syndicate opened with 300 packages of extra green sugar at 133,000 yuan, and Shunde green sugar at 130,000 yuan. The Jian Syndicate opened with hundreds of packages of premium green sugar at 127,000 yuan. The Xinghua Syndicate opened with over 300 baskets of trade flour white sugar at 198,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, and second-grade at 180,000 yuan. Red sugar was at 150,000 yuan to 145,6000 yuan.

### Fine Cloth Sales Slightly Improve - Market Price Changes from Solid to Firm

The cotton cloth market opened steadily. Sales of 12-pound top-quality fine cloth improved slightly, once quoted at 147,000 yuan. Later, buyers sold off due to rumors, and the price immediately dropped by 2,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company supplied and sold Five Blessings fine cloth, with the price opening at 143,000 yuan, similar to the market price, which made people's hearts firm. Sales of colored cloth on the market were not strong, and dyeing factories were also reluctant to buy white cloth, resulting in a trend of firmness with a soft undertone in the market.

### Rice Transactions Are Not Strong - Oil Beans Improve in Appetite

Yesterday, a total of over 13,500 stones of rice arrived in the North and South rice markets, but market transactions were active but not strong. High-quality japonica rice was settled, and medium and low-quality rice continued to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Baiyuan rice followed the decline of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and Yinyuan rice showed a flat and weak trend.

Sales of flour turned weak, and the rise stopped and turned to a fall, falling back by a small 300 to 500 yuan to over 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran tended to fluctuate.

The Min Syndicate's sales of yellow beans were prosperous, and the local market was also active, extremely brisk, and saw another surge of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Nanyang bean cakes improved slightly in sales, and the Shantou and Xiamen Min Syndicate also moved, rising steadily and continuing to rise by 2,000 yuan.

The oil market's appetite turned strong, and actual sales were active. Raw soybean oil rose by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan, and sesame oil also increased by 10,000 yuan.

Hong Kong's sales of red beans are soaring step by step, continuing to rise sharply by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans remain temporarily flat, corn follows the rise of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, the sales of raw kernels in foreign factories are leisurely, and the price is neither good nor bad, but the medium and low-quality oil factories are buying very happily, rising by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Sesame is scarce and firm, and the situation is secretly tight. Broad beans turned weak, and black sesame soared by 10,000 yuan.

### U.S. Gold and Silver Import and Export Statistics

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] The U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced that for the week ending February 5, the United States exported a total of 103,033 ounces of gold, of which 87,999 ounces were imported to Argentina, 2,024 ounces to Germany, 6,809 ounces to Syria, 4,799 ounces to India, and the remainder to various South American countries. During the same period, imports of gold totaled 17,875 ounces, of which 8,247 ounces were imported from Saudi Arabia, 5,013 ounces from Nicaragua, 2,143 ounces from Mexico, 1,793 ounces from Canada, and the remainder from Latin America.

During the same period, exports of silver totaled 4,435,214 ounces, of which 4,160,977 ounces were imported to the United Kingdom, 191,594 ounces to France, 50,481 to Brazil, and 32,162 ounces to the Netherlands. During the same period, imports of silver ore and silver bullion totaled 435,708 ounces, of which 207,891 ounces were imported from Mexico and 112,538 ounces from Canada. Imports of pure gold and silver bars totaled 402,988 ounces.

### Flour Rationing Resumes

The five major flour mills in this city, Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, had temporarily suspended the sale of flour due to the exhaustion of raw materials and inability to produce. It is now learned that with the assistance of the authorities, the raw material supply issue has been resolved, and flour rationing will resume immediately. Each bag will still cost 30,000 yuan. According to another source, the government previously ordered a large amount of wheat and foreign flour from the United States. Currently, 50,000 bags of flour, loaded on the "Hede" of the Fulai Company, have arrived in China and are already at the Songkou port, expected to arrive in port tomorrow.

### Yarn Market Sales Remain Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market showed no signs of improvement, with actual sales still sluggish and morale lacking. However, in the early morning, ordinary 20-count yarn, such as the Liuma brand, after falling close to 3 million, was once again favored by the industry. After a scramble to clear out inventory, prices rebounded to around 3.1 million, resulting in a slight drop of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Waterproof Cloth Prices Rise

Sales of waterproof cloth have continued to be active in the market recently, with considerable actual sales in various locations along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. Prices have also been rising. First-grade goods are being quoted at 16,000 yuan per yard, and second-grade goods at 13,000 yuan. The standard for these prices is based on fluctuations in yarn prices and the factory's cost accounting.

### Export Green Tea Favored by Buyers

Due to unsuccessful negotiations on the TUNA agreement, the market for foreign-operated Qimen black tea remains quiet. However, green teas such as Chunzhen, Zhenmei, and Zhenmei needles, which are popular in Africa, are selling increasingly actively, and prices are relatively stable. There are currently over 700 boxes of aged Chunzhen Zhenmei, and Yutai Tea Company and Wuchang Tea Company are in negotiations with the suppliers. It is reported that the price difference is not significant, and an agreement is likely to be reached in early next week. As for domestic-only varieties such as Dafang, Longjing, and Shuangjing, sellers are stubbornly holding out, making it difficult for buyers to purchase, resulting in a stagnant market.

### Jianghai Customs Increases Late Declaration Fee

Regarding customs declarations by merchants in this city, the submission of declarations is often delayed due to time constraints. According to customs regulations, merchants who submit export declarations after the prescribed daily time are charged a late fee of 400 national currency per declaration. Currently, due to rising prices, merchants are not concerned about paying the 400 yuan fee. Therefore, the customs authorities have obtained approval from the Inspector General of Customs to increase the late declaration fee to 2,000 yuan per declaration. The new fee has already been implemented by the customs office.

### Japan to Exchange Transportation Equipment for Two Types of Chinese Raw Materials

[Report from this newspaper] According to sources, the barter trade between China and Japan is being actively promoted. In addition to pit props, which are urgently needed for the rehabilitation of major coal mines in the north, surplus transportation equipment from Japan is also urgently needed by China. After repeated negotiations between relevant Chinese authorities and General MacArthur's headquarters, concrete results have been achieved. It is reported that the headquarters has agreed to ship 300 locomotives and 2,000 freight cars to China within the next two years, in exchange for China supplying Japan with two types of raw materials. The principle has been decided, but the price issue is still under negotiation. As for what Japan hopes China will supply, the first priority is one million tons of salt. There has been much criticism from the outside regarding China supplying salt to Japan, believing that it will boost Japan's chemical industry. However, those familiar with the inside story believe that salt has a global market, and if China does not ship salt to Japan, Britain will ship African salt to supply them, which will not help and will only result in the loss of the market. Japan is also experiencing a shortage of vegetable oil, and the need will be even greater in the second half of the year. They also hope that China will supply them. In addition, it is reported that 20,000 tons of soybeans will also be shipped to Japan this year. Taiwan sugar is urgently needed by China itself, and although the other party has repeatedly requested it, we have not agreed to supply it. However, due to the high prices in the Japanese black market, some smuggling is inevitable.

### Abundant Pork Arrivals Lead to Price Weakness

[Report from this newspaper] Previously, due to continuous rainy days, the arrival of pigs was very limited, and the dismantling price of pork rose to 380,000 yuan per 100 market catties. With the recent clear weather, the supply from all sources has been abundant, and the current dismantling price has fallen to 310,000 yuan. The retail prices of lean meat and spareribs have not changed much compared to before.

### Industrial Raw Materials Show Mixed Price Trends

[Report from this newspaper] Trading in industrial raw materials has gradually begun, but the types and quantities traded are not yet very large. Caustic soda (Moon Brand) was traded at 5.5 million yuan per barrel, and liquid caustic soda (40 Baume) at 4.4 million yuan per ton. Soda ash continued its downward trend, with McCallie goods (80 kg per bag) priced at 220,000 yuan. Sodium sulfide was 4,000 yuan per pound, and zinc oxide powder increased by 2 million yuan per ton, with the current price at 10 million yuan. Triacetin is extremely scarce in the market, and only Indian glycerin has been traded, priced at around 1.5 million yuan per can (5-6 lbs).

### Leather Prices Rise, Sales Sluggish

[Report from this newspaper] Since the increase in foreign exchange rates, the import costs of grained leather have increased, and prices have risen sharply. Tree Brand grained leather has increased from 32,000 yuan to 55,000 yuan per square foot. Shunfeng grained leather has increased from 27,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan, and Jingangzan grained leather has increased from 26,000 yuan to 43,000 yuan. Arrivals of raw hides have become scarcer, and exports have begun, with prices also rising steadily. Raw cowhide has increased from 280,000 yuan to 450,000 yuan per 100 market catties, and large-sized yellow cowhide has increased from 550,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan. Actual sales of various goods are not very strong. It is reported that water buffalo hide in Hankou is 360,000 yuan per Sima dan, and yellow cowhide is 110,000 yuan per Sima dan.

### Nationwide Survey of Yarn Mill Equipment Shows 224 Factories, Including State, Provincial, and Private

According to statistics from the Shanghai Machinery Association, there are currently 224 yarn mills nationwide. These include 41 state-owned, 2 provincial-owned, and 181 privately-owned mills. The state-owned mills have 2.9 million spindles and over 38,000 looms; the provincial-owned mills have only 200,000 spindles; and the privately-owned mills have 2.68 million spindles and over 30,000 looms. Comparing state-owned and privately-owned mills, privately-owned mills have slightly more spindles, while state-owned mills have about half more spindles than privately-owned mills. The details are presented below for reference.

### Coal Capital Fushun

— Shenyang, 16th (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Han Qingtao

The Changbai Mountains run diagonally from east to southwest, and the remaining veins form undulating hills. After passing Fushun, they merge into the Liaodong Plain to the west. Fushun is located on the edge of this Liaodong Plain, backed by mountains and facing rivers, with a magnificent terrain.

The urban area is 20 kilometers long from east to west, bordering the south bank of the Hun River, and 6-7 kilometers long from north to south, with the river as the boundary. The Hun River meanders through the territory from the east, joining with the Wendao, Majun Dan, Liulin, Guchengzi, and other small rivers, and merging with the Taizi River before flowing into the Liao River and the Bohai Sea.

Fushun is bordered by Benxi to the south, Tieling and Faku to the north, Qingyuan and Xinbin to the east, and Shenyang to the west, with a distance of 80 li. The city covers an area of 91,123,050 square meters, surrounded by low mountains. The climate reaches -25 degrees Celsius in the coldest periods and around 37 degrees Celsius in the hottest periods. The freezing season lasts from early December to early March. According to statistics, rainfall has been gradually increasing, with an average annual rainfall of 1,000 mm.

Historical Treasure Land

Over the past 50 years, the blood, sweat, and labor of the Chinese people have built this modern city. The new facilities include wide asphalt roads, and most of the government offices are high-rise buildings. Electricity, telephones, and trams are all available. In the summer, there are fully equipped swimming pools, and in the winter, there are spacious and magnificent skating rinks. The city's sports field is grand in scale, with stands capable of accommodating 20,000 people. The indoor sports field is also very well-equipped. The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall can be considered the most sophisticated building in the Northeast, with a rotating stage. Fushun can be considered a very good city.

Fifty years ago, this place was extremely simple. It was just a desolate village on the south bank of the Hun River, sparsely populated with dozens of households, a purely agricultural society. Now, stepping out of the urban area into the rural countryside, one can still see prosperous mulberry fields and vegetable gardens, with considerable production that can be self-sufficient. In particular, the rice is of a Japanese improved variety, with round, large grains and a pure white color, especially of high quality. For the past ten years, this grain has been exclusively for Japanese consumption and not allowed for us Chinese to eat. Now, of course, you can enjoy it anytime, anywhere in Fushun.

Fushun, formerly known as "Qianjin Pass," is world-famous for its largest coal mine in the Far East. Later, due to this coal mine mother, it continued to nurture many sub-industries, creating a purely Japanese city. It can be said to be a great masterpiece of meticulous management and exploitation by the Japanese. After the enemy surrendered, Mr. Zhang Xinfu came here to take over and was killed, again attracting national and worldwide attention.

Standing on the edge of the "Open-Pit Mine" west of Guchengzi and looking out, it is three li wide and four li long, with an original coal seam of 125 meters. It is still billowing with "self-igniting" white smoke. Dozens of light coal transport railway tracks and spiderweb-like electric wires create a truly magnificent scene.

During the Ming Dynasty, this Fushun city was called "Suoyang City." When Qing Taizu rose up in Xingjing and extended his forces downstream along the Hun River, Suoyang City was the first to bear the brunt and was conquered. It was renamed "Fushun City," and the people of Fushun were thus "pacified and subdued."

Since the establishment of the Republic of China, we have not had the opportunity to personally control this Qianjin Pass. On the contrary, we remember that the Russians and Japanese fought here on our national territory. Two years ago, this fertile land was once again regarded as spoils of war and robbed. After the devastation, the population of Fushun has decreased by one-third, and the industry has only recovered to one-tenth or two-tenths of its pre-war level.

Coal Industry

People have been using coal for roughly 2,000 years, but large-scale mining began about 1,000 years ago, during the Goguryeo and Liao-Jin dynasties, for use as fuel in the manufacture of pottery. After that, dynasties rose and fell, and there were constant disturbances. It is feared that only the locals mined some for fuel.

In the 27th year of the Guangxu Emperor, Wang Chengyao, Yan Zhiyue, and others were approved by the Fengtian General to conduct small-scale mining. Later, due to weak financial resources, Russian capital was introduced. Three or four years later, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, and this treasure was seized by Japan.

The "South Manchuria Railway Company" was established in the year after the Russo-Japanese War (Meiji 40). Over the past 50 years, starting with coal mining, it has gradually expanded into various affiliated industries, forming a complete system. Initially, there were three pits: "Qianjin Pass," "Yangbaipu," and "Laohutai." Later, two new pits, "Dashan" and "Togo," were opened. Subsequently, "Laowan," "Longfeng," and others were gradually added, totaling eight pits, increasing production from 300 tons per day to 30,000 tons.

The entire mining area is 17 kilometers east-west and 4 kilometers north-south, with an area of 60.16 million square feet. The geological age is Tertiary coal seam, which becomes thicker towards the west, with the thickest part being 125 meters and the thinnest part being 15 meters. The coal quality is bituminous coal with long flames, with a specific gravity of 1.27 and an average calorific value of 6,960 calories. It is indeed a high-quality chemical raw material coal - low-temperature distillation, pharmaceuticals, dyes, light and heavy oils, combustible gases, ammonia, and so on are all contained within it.

Fushun is not only a coal and mechanical city, but also has highly developed affiliated industries. The first to be established was the oil shale distillation plant (oil production plant). Six or seven years later, an ironmaking plant was established, followed by a liquefaction plant, a lead production plant (light metals), an electrolysis plant (producing hydrogen and oxygen), calcium carbide production, and a water gas plant.

Other small factories, such as a sulfuric acid plant (absorbing ammonia gas from low-temperature distillation to produce sulfuric acid fertilizer), a black explosive plant, a refractory brick plant, and a coking plant, were all for the utilization of by-products, mostly small-scale manufacturing, for the use of the coal mine itself.

Of particular note is the "Machinery Factory," which is large in scale and well-equipped. Also noteworthy is the "Power Plant," which originally had a power generation capacity of 210,000 KW. Because 70% of the machinery was dismantled by a certain party, it can now only generate 50,000 KW. There is also a "Chemical Research Institute," which is also worth mentioning. By the time of the Japanese surrender, 15 major topics had been researched and contributed to enterprise chemistry. The equipment is also excellent. Then there is the coal mine hospital, which is probably comparable to the "Peking Union Medical College Hospital." In the past, graduates of the "South Manchuria Medical College" had to go through this hospital's internship to graduate, thus becoming the only training institution for medical talents in the Northeast.

Restorative Power

Fushun city is a metropolis of 200,000 to 300,000 people. In addition to 200,5654 Chinese people, there are 7,131 Japanese, 3,213 Koreans, and 12 other foreigners, totaling 210,6010 people.

Fushun has a total of approximately 3,600 stores, most of which can still be maintained. In addition to the Central Bank, financial institutions such as the Farmers Bank, China Bank, and Bank of Communications have also established branches. In addition, there are three private commercial banks.

Today, the recovery of industry and commerce is only one-tenth or two-tenths of what it used to be. Of the original 349 factories, including 83 larger ones, only 50-odd have resumed operations. Coal production is also only one-sixth of its former total production.

The people of Fushun have some criticisms about the Fushun Coal Mine, which was taken over by the Assets Committee. They say that the directors of the coal mine come and go, and they cannot devote their full strength to the work. In addition, some of the personnel taking over are too far removed from the workers, and their lives are not integrated, creating a gap due to the disparity in salaries. Moreover, the number of administrative staff is gradually increasing, while the number of workers actually doing the work is decreasing. This affects the work, weakens productivity, and also hides the crisis of labor unrest. We sincerely hope for reasonable improvements. Any negligence would be too great a mistake.

For the sake of Fushun, and also for the sake of Liaoning, for the sake of the entire Northeast and China, we must make the whole country pay attention to Fushun, restore and strengthen Fushun's coal mines and all industries. The people of Fushun even hope to set up the capital of Liaoning Province in Fushun, because putting a province's political center here may increase the power to restore Fushun!

Intermarriage with Foreigners - Paris, 6th (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Hong Fu

In the "Free Talk" column of this newspaper on November 8th of the 35th year, under the title "Thinking of Zhaojun," one example was used to illustrate that the qualities and virtues of Chinese and foreigners are fundamentally different. According to the practice of Chinese women marrying foreigners, Wang Zhaojun set the precedent. The English term for intermarriage is Exogamy, derived from Greek, while the term for bigamy is bigamy, which is the opposite of monogamy. Polygamy is called Polygamy, and polyandry is called Ply-andry. The material civilization of the West is indeed amazing, but unfortunately, the foundation of its spiritual civilization is far inferior to that of China. Its people do not know how to "endure" what others cannot endure, and a small encounter with a storm can easily turn into an incredible joke. Westerners only know Ego-ism and only seek the pleasure of the moment. However, the chastity, filial piety, and martyrdom of our Chinese are all Altru-ism, which is a special glory in the spiritual realm and cannot be understood by Westerners. During the Second European War, 50,000 Dutch women married Canadian soldiers, and France had 200,000 women without masters. More than 20,000 of them were formally married to foreign soldiers, and more than 30,000 sons and daughters had to be housed in mutual shelters. Earlier, when German soldiers occupied France, French men fled, and the remaining women mostly had affairs with German soldiers. Later, after the Germans retreated, they mated with American soldiers, resulting in more than 7,000 new brides who had to cross the ocean to America. Some of them divorced shortly after marriage. In Germany, the children born to German women and Allied soldiers had a larger appetite than ordinary German children. German women were unable to support them and often sold them to the government. German women in labor camps who became pregnant during the war often had surgical abortions. Western women often promiscuously intermingle with different sexes. In the European and American universities I have visited, except for American women who still value their reputations, there are no restrictions in Europe, and the rampant desires of people often make those who cherish self-love sigh that they cannot get close. If a young man with a weak will encounters this environment, how can his studies and future not be affected? As for single male overseas Chinese traveling far away, their environment is not as pure as that of university students. During this long Second European War, their intermarriage with foreigners was done without any discernment of the other party. If there is a divorce, the resulting disputes and lawsuits will cause more losses, which is even more unimaginable. On the other hand, in the home country, the hair wives who have remained loyal for decades are left helpless and unable to seek help. Our government, Hu Fu, has considered this and is making progress for the families of these people, opening up wisdom and planning a way out, slightly following the Japanese-style overseas Chinese training center and emulating the New World education plan, so that all these women can easily achieve beautification and youthful transformation. This move is of great concern in terms of national economy and people's livelihood. I personally believe that for the sake of both parties, it is still appropriate to amend the law so that lost overseas children can still repent and approach their old families. I recall 36 years ago, I happened to see a question posted in the Shanghai Shenzhou Daily, soliciting answers from readers, which meant, "Why do women only love one person?" The answers at the time were like a forest, mostly beating around the bush. I intended to answer, "Love is the life of women, while men value their careers throughout their lives. Most ordinary men call the lack of love a small part of their lives." If a man is only focused on profit, no matter what, it is not difficult to take care of the original family in his hometown. However, when thinking about the last hope of life, the purely blooded children are trustworthy. In general, mixed-race children may have sufficient intelligence, but their morals are not as high as those of pure blood. Today's villagers still inevitably marry those who are more closely related, and the children born are less intelligent but uniquely virtuous. Children born in big cities are prone to mixed blood, and their morals are not as high as those of villagers. The great figures of today are often born to benefit the masses, and this is all solid proof that pure blood is far better than mixed blood. Those who plan the country must not neglect this.

A wealthy overseas Chinese man died during the war and left a will specifying that 10% of his Chinese hair wife should transport the coffin back to China and set aside a fixed amount of repayment for use. 10% of his children born to foreign women fought for this money and committed a crime: they stole their father's body and burned it. Westerners believe in nothing, and this is one example. A certain wealthy Western businessman left instructions after his death to extract a huge sum from his estate to purchase a valuable boulder as a memorial. His intention was naturally to refer to the tombstone. Unexpectedly, his son not only inherited the estate but also coveted this huge sum of money and wanted to hunt it for himself. He consulted with a senior lawyer and suddenly came up with a clever plan, which was to put a diamond ring commemorating his father on his finger, because a diamond is also a stone. The stone mentioned in the will did not have any annotations, and it was not said that it must be placed in front of the tomb. This is a humorous story about a will. I write it down so that people can smile.

### The First Shot of Overseas Chinese Returning to Invest: Developing the Economy of Fujian

— Thirteenth Day Airmail News, Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu from Fuzhou

We in the country have a direct impression of overseas Chinese living around the world, thinking that they all have strong, dark bodies, an aptitude for abacus skills, and countless banknotes, as if they were all bright stars of wealth. In fact, people in the country only see the wealthy side of overseas Chinese and do not see the miserable circumstances of their lives abroad! They are dependent on others, suffering from the exclusion of indigenous peoples and all kinds of harsh treatments from local governments, often toiling all year round without enough to eat. Most of the compatriots who have drifted overseas are in dire straits in their home country. They rely on their only carrying pole as a tool for making a living, enduring years of wind and frost, working diligently and thriftily to build a business, and a lucky few have smooth sailing and their careers are booming, leaping into the ranks of big capitalists. For example, Mr. Wang Zhenxiang, one of the founders of the Fujian Economic Construction Company, was once a miner, and now owns thirteen large companies in various ports in Southeast Asia.

"Chang'an is not a place to stay for long" - Investing in and Developing the Hometown

After the end of the war, a wave of national self-determination movements was brewing in various parts of Southeast Asia. Major conflicts, such as those in the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, meant that the lives and property of overseas Chinese were not guaranteed, and many died unjustly in foreign lands. Moreover, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the tragic experiences of overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia were unbearable to recount. The overseas Chinese, based on their years of accumulated experience, knew that although Chang'an was good, it was not a place to stay for long. Being dependent on others was ultimately painful, so it was better to find ways to move their large amounts of capital and businesses operating in various parts of Southeast Asia back to the motherland, to revitalize the war-torn motherland.

Fujian-born overseas leaders Hu Wenhu and Malaysian representatives Huang Chongji, Lin Qingnian, Wang Zhenxiang, He Baoren, Philippine representative Xue Fenshi, Dutch East Indies representative Huang Chaolong, Vietnamese Chen Zhaoji, Siamese Su Zhensheng, Burmese Li Liangyuan, and others agreed to cooperate in investing in and developing the economy of Fujian. They put forward the slogans of "concentrating efforts to build the hometown" and "building the hometown is building the country," and organized the Fujian Economic Construction Company. On November 15th of last year, the inaugural meeting was held in the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce. More than seventy founders representing five million overseas Chinese from various parts of Southeast Asia attended. Party and government authorities from Fujian Province also attended the meeting, marking the beginning of overseas Chinese returning to invest. The atmosphere was excited, demonstrating a new atmosphere of unprecedented unity in the overseas Chinese community. The overseas leaders all agreed that they could not survive without building a prosperous, strong, and happy homeland. They requested the government to provide assistance and guarantee their rights. Liu Shengxi, the representative of the provincial government, solemnly stated that the government was willing to provide technical assistance and security guarantees.

Overseas Leaders Raising Funds Separately, Drafting Business Plans

After the closing of the inaugural meeting, a preparatory committee was established, with Hu Wenhu appointed as a standing committee member, and Shi Xingshui, Wang Zhenxiang, Huang Chongji, and more than a hundred others as members of the company's preparatory committee. They planned fundraising matters separately, deciding that the total amount of the company's funds would be 30 billion, allocated as follows: (1) 10 billion from Malaysia, which has already been oversubscribed (including 4.5 billion from Singapore, 1.2 billion from Perak, 1 billion each from Selangor, Penang, and Johor, 300 million each from Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang, 200 million from Kedah and Perlis combined, and 100 million each from Kelantan and Terengganu), (2) 10 billion from the Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Burma, Vietnam, and Siam combined, (3) 10 billion from within the province and Hong Kong and Shanghai combined, to be raised in three phases. It is expected that fundraising in various parts of Southeast Asia will be easier than within the province, but the remittance of large amounts of funds will face some difficulties due to different exchange rates in various places and restrictions on overseas remittances in the places where overseas Chinese reside. Regarding the remittance bank, the preparatory committee carefully decided to mainly use the Central Bank, the Fujian Provincial Bank, and the Overseas Chinese Bank. Representatives Hu Wenhu, He Baoren, Huang Chongji, Lin Qingnian, and others were sent to Beijing to contact the central government, requesting special approval to establish a construction bank to handle overseas remittances and mortgage business, as a bridge for overseas Chinese investment.

The headquarters of the Economic Construction Company will be located in Xiamen, and branches will be established inside and outside the province as necessary. In addition to the construction bank as the main business, it will also establish industrial and mining, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, fisheries, salt, and transportation enterprises in the province, paying particular attention to supporting the trade of Fujian's special products and the development of industrial and mining, in order to gradually guide Fujian towards industrialization.

Xiamen Can Build a Good Harbor, Constructing the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway

Since the establishment of the Economic Construction Company's preparatory committee at the end of last year, Fuzhou and Xiamen have been filled with a construction boom. What lingers in the minds of the upper class is how to guide more overseas capital to develop Fujian's rich resources. The company's founders have received many suggestions and plans, some saying that transportation is the most important, some saying that a bank should be established first, with different opinions and each having its own reason. Minister Bai Chongxi once discussed the future status of Xiamen from a national defense perspective, which actually surpasses Shanghai. Xiamen is the hub of the Southeast Asian sea route, where ships from five continents and merchants from all over the world gather. The port of Xiamen is the best port in the south, capable of accommodating giant ships of 30,000 tons. It is worth developing. Minister Wang Yunwu believes from an economic standpoint that to compete for the Southeast Asian market, it is necessary to complete the railway extending from the coastal ports to the hinterland. Chen Tirong, the first director of the Construction Department of Fujian Province, once loudly appealed for the importance of constructing the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the north, which has been approved in principle by the central government, and the investment of 35 million US dollars from a Canadian manufacturer. He requested the Economic Construction Company to invest 10% of its capital in the railway company. In addition, people in the province believe that developing the hydropower generation of Nengting in Gutian and Jiulihu in Xianyou can induce the rise of countless small industries and give ample opportunities for the development of Fujian's textile, printing, hardware, and electrical appliance manufacturing industries. Some say that supporting the trade of special products is a shortcut to profit. The Fujian media have also published articles expressing their views, forming a wave of provincial construction movements.

What the Future Holds, Still Awaiting the Cooperation of Overseas Leaders

Many of these founders of the Economic Construction Company have private enterprises in Southeast Asia, and they are large in scale. After the inaugural meeting, most of the overseas leaders returned to their original places, reportedly to raise funds or prepare to move their businesses back to the country. Among these overseas leaders, some were originally miners and are very interested in the iron mines of Anxi, Fujian. Some have always been traders and advocate large-scale investment in the trade of special products in Zhabei. Some operate textile industries and are willing to invest in the textile industry in the Longxi area. Some are engaged in shipping and believe that developing coastal shipping is the top priority. Each has their own ambitions and pursuits, which may disperse the company's strength. It is crucial to select the essentials and proceed in order, which is the key to construction. This requires the cooperation of overseas leaders and a comprehensive plan.

It is said that the company's funds have reached 20 billion yuan, and the founding meeting will be held in Xiamen on April 1st to announce the official establishment of the company and begin the implementation of the approved plans. We hope that the establishment of the Fujian Economic Construction Company can truly do a few things, and that the local government will provide assistance, as a beginning of the movement of overseas Chinese returning to invest, using the abundant funds of overseas Chinese to revive this motherland that has suffered long-term disasters.

### The National Archives of the United States

— New York, Eighth Day Airmail News, Li Dongfang

With a letter of introduction from Dr. Hermay, I visited Mr. Solon J. Buck, and told him: I am an honorary advisor to the National History Museum of China and have conducted research at the National Archives of France for four years. Mr. Buck is the director of the National Archives of the United States, and he was very excited when he heard what I said. He asked me why I was unwilling to stay in Washington for a few more days so we could talk at length. I, a lonely wanderer, had to rush to the Northeast to teach.

I am very grateful to Mr. Buck and his assistants for taking the time to show me around the various departments of the Archives. Compared to the one in Paris, the equipment and organization are truly surpassing. What makes me most happy is the special disinfection department in the basement. All documents entering the Archives, whether they have insects or not, are treated. I think people who come here to bury themselves in old papers will no longer feel itchy. I want to write a special letter to the old director in Paris, but I am afraid he will misunderstand.

What I also admire is that the Americans spare no expense (actually, not much money) to mount the documents with blurry handwriting, fragile or particularly precious, on transparent paper, but without using paste, but using chemical and physical methods. The chemical method makes the transparent paper sticky, and the physical method tightens it with force. Why don't we transport our ancient books and historical materials here and mount them all like this? Or should I buy a machine and bring it back to China? (It's very cheap and there is no commission.)

They have money, needless to say. They specially built a Western-style building (becoming one of the famous attractions of Washington, D.C.), with each floor and each room having a special designated task. The exhibition hall on the second floor is very large, with valuable materials on display regularly. What I encountered was the ten definitive amendments to the Constitution, and the letter of credence from a certain envoy of the Great Qing Empire (with dragons surrounding, a combination of Chinese and Manchu, not written in English, with a golden silk and vermilion seal). The reading room has two rooms, east and west, and a catalog room in the middle. There is a separate room for those who want to type or take photos, so as not to disturb others. (The French still do not allow typing in the archives.) The place where the scrolls are stored is completely steel doors and cement walls, so in case of fire, only one room will burn. If a fire really breaks out, even if it is only one room, it would be too embarrassing. I think this building will not catch fire unless something falls from the sky. In Paris, the scrolls are stored in paper boxes, while in the United States, they are stored in flat and large steel drawers. In addition to the reading room, there is also a small library, with 65,000 books related to American history and various social sciences placed on the shelves for you to browse at any time. There are also two historians, called historical commissioners, who are permanent living dictionaries. If there is anything you don't understand or have forgotten, just ask them. Their job is to provide you with information. There are also times when they can't answer, but they never get angry, but are happy to ask more knowledgeable friends or arrange for you to meet their friends. — I think anyone can come here to do research and easily write a paper on American history.

Their archives, as of now, are 320,000 feet long on the shelves. (The shelves occupy 320,000 feet.) Most of them are kept by the State Department before this museum was established in 1935. All outdated files from Congress, courts, and administrative departments are concentrated here. Each agency can still borrow them back when they need to refer to them at any time.

I remember that when the Nationalist Government was still in Chongqing, most agencies suffered from small air-raid shelters and could not store their files, so they often burned slightly outdated files. Later, the preparatory office of the National History Museum learned about this and sent a letter to everyone, asking them to let the preparatory office of the National History Museum send someone to take a look before burning them and choose important ones to bring back for preservation. This was truly a rescue. Fortunately, even though not many agencies were willing to allow people to rescue in this way, at least those files that were burned were spiritually comforted.

I often emphasize how the Han Dynasty valued archives, and the account books of each state and county had to be sent to the Grand Historian in the original copy, and only the copy was sent to the Prime Minister. Today, it is difficult for China's National History Museum to explain such a pedantic method to various agencies. If we do not cite our own worthless ancient history, but cite the invaluable American example that everyone admires in all aspects, perhaps the various agencies will immediately follow suit. To put it bluntly, whether a nation has a soul, or whether its soul is lost, depends on its attitude towards archives.

Our National History Museum should really be renamed the National Archives. Because official history compilation is neither in line with the trend, nor have we actually compiled any "veritable records" in the way that the national history museums of previous dynasties did. The government can expand the National History Museum into a National Archives, which can both collect the archives of various agencies, facilitate inspection, and help scholars who are willing to write history, allowing everyone to write freely based on authentic materials.

A person who studies modern Chinese history cannot but come to the American National Archives to search, because the American ministers and consulates stationed in China have regular reports back to the country, and all are collected here. If we can add a lot of new knowledge about Hong Xiuquan, Li Hongzhang, Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai, etc.

In addition to paper materials, this museum also has gramophone records and sound films. President Wilson's voice and appearance have disappeared, but his voice is still there. If there had been such an idealist on the international stage after World War II, perhaps things would not have been so bad today! This is a campaign speech. Roosevelt also has several speeches stored here. Why not also preserve the records of the Yalta and Tehran conferences? Under the film category, most are Movietone newsreels. However, yesterday's news is today's history. One genuine film is the most famous, it is the first film in history, starring Mary Pickford, and was personally given to this museum by this empress dowager. Ford also sent a film about manufacturing cars.

American history is not long, but compared to us, it seems that there is more historical material than we have. Is it because they are better, or are we not good enough?

### A World-Class Orchard: The Chiayi Agricultural Experiment Branch

— Eighth Day Airmail News, Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu

The Agricultural Experiment Institute, which is directly under the Governor-General's Office, has a total of ten branches throughout the province. Chiayi is located in the center of the western plain, right on the Tropic of Cancer, making it an ideal place for agricultural experiments. Therefore, a branch has also been established in Shanziding Park and has been maintained for twenty-eight years. Sweet potato improvement is coordinated with military needs. In the past, the scope of work of the institute was very broad, but in recent years it has gradually reduced and focused all its efforts on the improvement and research of sweet potatoes. According to Yang Shourin, the director of the branch, this work is not only well known to the people of the entire province, but also has a very important position in the Far East. According to the results of the experiments here, sweet potatoes can be planted all year round, shortening the breeding period, and flowering is normal, so hybridization methods can be used to improve them. The most interesting thing is that sweet potatoes also have seeds that can be planted.

Before sweet potatoes were studied and experimented here, the starch content of the sweet potatoes produced locally was only 15% to 18%. However, after using the improved varieties here, the sweet potatoes that grew had a starch content of more than 30%. More than 80% of the farmers near Chiayi have now completely adopted the improved varieties. During the war, the Japanese built a large-scale alcohol factory here, the fourth largest in East Asia, to supply fuel for combat as much as possible. The raw material was the sweet potatoes produced here. If the starch content was not above 30%, this factory could not be used. The coordination of agricultural research and military needs cannot but be said to be the success of Japan and is worthy of our vigilance.

"Queen of Fruits": A Lifelong Regret of the Empress

In addition to the extremely successful research on sweet potatoes, the orchard here is also quite famous. Out of more than 200 acres of experimental land, fruit trees occupy two-fifths, with 121 species and more than 260 varieties. At the end of the war, this place was full of cavalry and air-raid shelters were built everywhere, resulting in great losses. After ten months of sorting out after the takeover, the houses have been completely renovated, and the valuable records of the past will soon be published. Now there are a total of four fruit gardens: including a pineapple garden with more than 30 improved varieties from all over the world, a coffee garden, a Sapodilla garden, and a mango garden. Among them, the mangoes did not have the flavor of those produced in the Philippines because the temperature was not high enough, so the institute has recognized that it has failed. On many other plots of land, various famous and precious fruit trees are planted separately. There is a kind called Mangosteen, with red skin and white flesh, and excellent color, aroma, and taste, called the Queen of Fruits, originally from Singapore, but it has never borne fruit. Empress Victoria regarded it as the honor of the British Empire because there were such products in her territories, but she still thought about it until she died and regretted not being able to taste it in her whole life. The four or five plants planted here have not borne fruit for fifteen years, but they actually bore two fruits last year, which is a great event after the recovery of Taiwan Province. Governor Chen Yi specially named it "Feng Guo" (Phoenix Fruit).

Olive Oil Extraction: Seeing if It Can Become a National Treasure

Director Yang also led the reporter to visit many rare fruit trees: (Sapodilla), produced in South America, the fruit is very sweet, and the white juice is very sticky, and it is usually used as a raw material for gummy candies. The Japanese used to value this fruit very much, and they only used it as a generous gift to the Emperor every year. The "King of Fruits" (Klngof fruits) avocado is a product of Hawaii. The fruit has a sweet milky taste. It was badly damaged three years ago, but it has now been restored, and one has been picked and displayed as a specimen. The small flowers of the cocoa tree bloom on the trunk and then bear fruit. The Japanese were initially baffled and actually pruned the flowers below. Now there are only a few fruits on the upper part. The fruit of Cnistel is similar to mango, but the strange thing is that the flesh is egg-yolk colored and tastes like egg yolk. Mexican Malabar is very rare in the world. The fruit is like a chestnut and can be stir-fried and eaten. The greatest function is that the roots are thicker than the stems and spread widely, making it an ideal windbreak tree. Many engineering agencies in Taiwan Province have come here to request transplantation. Professor Hoskinson of the University of California in the United States has also visited here. Mexico is very close to California, but he said that he has never seen such a good windbreak tree. Ceylon olives fall all over the ground. Director Yang said that he is now studying its composition to see if it can extract the same lubricating oil as in the fruits of the Mediterranean olive tree. All precision machinery cannot do without this oil. Germany's only request from Turkey during the war was this thing. If our research can be successful, it will be no different from a "national treasure."

### World-Famous Book Charity Exhibition: The Basis for Appreciating Western Paintings

— Wen Zhaotong

So-called Western paintings generally refer to oil paintings, watercolors, and sketches. In fact, this is distinguished from the material, if divided by form, can be distinguished into murals, framed paintings, and sketches, divided by content, it can be divided into still lifes, landscapes, animals, and people.

Because the origin of Western art comes from the humanistic and realistic spirit of ancient Greece, after the middle ages, the Renaissance advocating the revival of the ancient Greek spirit came, Western art returned to reality, so the traditional spirit of Western painting is realism. We appreciating it, must pay attention to this point.

The realistic technique is due to the foundation of sketching. The so-called basic sketch usually refers to charcoal, because it can practice depicting the accuracy of the outline, and from a simple color, it is easy to express the complex colors of the object and become a different tone of light and dark. Therefore, a good Western painting should have a solid sketch technique. This can be proved at any time in the works of ancient masters or modern writers.

Works with a basic sketch have an accurate tone when applying color. The so-called tone includes light and dark, strength and weakness, and lightness and heaviness. When we appreciate a good Western painting, we feel that the tone is well controlled, and the reflection of one part and another is harmonious and responsive, with no stiff or abrupt feeling at all.

Regarding the color in Western paintings, the style of the Venetian school in Italy during the Renaissance period was particularly exquisite. This style influenced the French romanticism two centuries later, just as the Florentine school, which emphasized form and ingenuity, influenced the classicism of the nineteenth century; the color of naturalism is the hint of the color and light research of the later Impressionism, although it did not study color scientifically like the Impressionists, it also knew that the change of color is the shift of sunlight. The Impressionists were so happy with the selection of colors because they were influenced by this. Monet's series of "Water Lilies" and "Haystacks" can be said to have thoroughly implemented the attempt of naturalism, and the picture is full of the color feeling under the sunlight. The Neo-Impressionists did more thorough color research, they analyzed sunlight, negated shadows, paid attention to the reflection of color and color, and as a result, used simple primary color dots to depict the unpredictable sunlight, the so-called "pointillism", not to mix colors on the palette but to mix colors on the retina of the eye, this is the result of scientific development, and it is not the most advanced method of color application in Western paintings? The colors of twentieth-century new and wall paintings have been studied even more deeply, and we want to talk about it in another article.

The important condition of Western painting is realism, and the technique is to study sketching and color, and even to study the perspective of objects in the distance, the anatomy of the human body, etc., it can be said that all are for the sake of realism. However, simply relying on the realism of the two parts of the object without cleverly arranging the object on the picture, it loses the artistic meaning, so appreciating Western painting, we must also pay attention to the composition of the picture, that is, the proper arrangement and layout of the objects.

The best way to arrange is balance, which is to make the objects on the picture not feel that one side is more or less, this must also pay attention to the control of color, that is the question of tone.

In composition, we should also pay attention to a picture, there should be a center, and other things should be to the center, but it cannot be rigid or chaotic, the best example is Da Vinci's composition of "The Last Supper", we should appreciate the hard work of this artist who controlled thirteen people to achieve the "change and unity" on this painting.

Finally, we should also pay attention to the application of materials, oil painting is thick, but thick coating and thin coating, the effect is completely different, watercolor has a light and cheerful interest, color powder has an ethereal interest. Regarding brush techniques, such as flat coating, clumps, pointillism, and thick lines, smooth surfaces, the effects are different, and we should also pay attention to them when appreciating Western paintings.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 181

— Ye Jingfeng

"No need to go to such great lengths." Kiken Shinichi said, "Although I haven't had in-depth research on this, I still understand a little bit about the basics. That Pingzi is still a defeated pawn of mine." Taking this opportunity, Tsurumi briefly explained the scene at Matsushima Beach with the various Pingzi methods (occult arts).

"From the looks of it, this Miss Pingzi's resistance isn't that strong – since she's Aoki's mature medium, it'll be easy for me to transmit the telepathy of you two old brothers... The most important thing is the timing for Shi and Li – it must be when she's mentally weakened or resting." Lai-kun is also an expert.

After Mr. W finished speaking, the four of us looked at each other and smiled, and the inexplicably confused Hu Cheng, influenced by our smiles, also laughed confusedly along with us.

We carefully deliberated and chose to implement this plan around three o'clock in the morning; the reason being, we'd finish abruptly suspending [the plan] at midnight, rest for two hours, and then arrange the various conditions for performing the ritual from two to three o'clock. However, because I'm tied up with military affairs and various trivial matters, I've abandoned the practice of unifying my spirit for many days; this action definitely has a meaning of taking risks and seeking luck. Why do I say it's taking risks? Because if our counter-sent telepathy is resisted by the opponent, or even strongly controlled by the opponent's spirit, our spirits will be greatly affected. To put it bluntly, my and Kiken's nerves might be damaged; at best, we'll suffer from periodic headaches, and at worst, both of us will go crazy.

In total, the plan we discussed this evening is divided into three and a half steps: First, from eight to nine o'clock, Tsurumi will go out alone to the Beiping headquarters to gather enemy intelligence, and also to "falsely convey the imperial edict," fabricating a secret order from Konoe, a measure of "attacking the mind as the best strategy."

This method is the "deceiving the heavens to cross the sea" tactic that Tsurumi planned. The intention is to build a protective city for the people of Beiping; to save them from being massacred as "fish in the moat" after we launch our attack.

Will this method work? Will people like Matsui and Sakai, who have the backing of Song, Lan, Mei, and the Black Dragon Society, take Tsurumi's personal secret telegram to heart? Little do they know, there's a small arrangement hidden within. Before eight o'clock, Tsurumi has to draft a report on the situation in Beiping, half-true and half-false, and have the General Staff Headquarters forward it to Konoe, saying that the Beiping expeditionary "imperial army" is planning a massacre of the city. The massacre may be a fabrication, but the indiscriminate arrest of many "unstable elements" is a fact. At the same time, he'll advise Konoe to order Matsui to be responsible for winning back the people's hearts.

### Jottings on Bookplates

— Wang Yizhi

Small and precious paper is called a "jian" [note paper]. In Europe and America, gentlemen and ladies use bookplates in their books, pasting them on the first page with their names inscribed. Even if it's followed by the Latin phrase "Ex libris...from the library of...", the English term for the bookplate is "Book-Plate," and they are always as elaborately decorated and intricately painted as Chinese paintings, unlike the simple labels on the covers of traditional thread-bound books, which only have text and no illustrations. Throughout my life, I have served on delegations, and encountered rare and precious items. Through extensive searching and collecting, I have acquired a fleeting glimpse of Western craftsmanship. Among the things that best showcase the special features of European and American printing and art, the "war bookplate" is the most valuable. In Western society, the cost and effort of designing, drawing, and printing a bookplate can easily exceed ten British pounds. Later, in the 17th and 18th centuries, conventional thinking had not yet escaped the constraints of the Middle Ages. The bookplates of famous and wealthy families were limited to their existing family crests, lacking any new and captivating designs. In the recent century, global transportation has become increasingly developed, and various industries and academic fields have emerged. The variety of bookplates is limitless. A single print run can be as small as a thousand copies or as large as tens of thousands. The paper size of a bookplate is roughly the same as a Chinese seal. The largest can be 11 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide, while the smallest is 2 centimeters in both length and width. The illustrations and text used on bookplates can be exemplified in the following ways: Some interweave the initials of the name into a clever phrase, similar to the Chinese practice of embedding characters in a couplet. For example, the bookplate of the famous Dutch publisher Albert Willem Sijthoff, beneath the ownership inscription, adds the motto "Altijdt Waeck-saem" [Always Vigilant], comparable to the Chinese couplet "Sunset Mountain scenery crosses dangerous cliffs, Beautiful sunny light ascends small building", a perfect match. Another Westerner named Hazeloop has a bookplate depicting a fast-running rabbit, with the inscription: "May this book quickly return to its original owner, like a rabbit escaping in flight (as shown in Figure 1)". Another bookplate depicts a bookshelf with a missing book in the middle, as if someone has just taken it away, with the text: "My bookshelf is precisely missing this volume". This allows the reader to see the illustration and understand the meaning, promptly returning the book to its original owner after reading it. Another bookplate also depicts a bookshelf with a missing book (as shown in Figure 2), with the inscription: "Return this book to me quickly, send it to A.R. Bake, If you don't return it, will your conscience be clear?". Ingeniously conceived, full of playful interest. Some bookplates use the family name of the owner as the basis for the design. For example, the bookplate of someone named Wijs depicts an owl, a symbol of wisdom. (as shown in Figure 3). The bookplate of someone named Winterink depicts a winter scene with snow and wind. (as shown in Figure 4). The bookplate of someone named Mus depicts a sparrow on a branch. (as shown in Figure 5). Bookplates that express national characteristics, such as the Tree of Life and two deer, are traditional Germanic symbols (see Figure 6). I think that Chinese historical achievements are most splendid in the Han and Tang dynasties. If someone wanted to commemorate the glory of the Han people, they could depict the thousand-mile horse that General Li Guangli obtained from his western expeditions during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. This bookplate would be especially suitable for military officers with the surname Li. Some bookplates represent a profession or occupation. For example, a snake representing the medical profession, with a microscope inside a heart-shaped outline, immediately indicates that the owner of the book is a doctor. A book depicting a legal official in robes, with a weeping woman being accused in front of him, immediately indicates that the owner of the book is a lawyer (as shown in Figures 7 and 8). A bookplate depicting overflowing books and mixed manuscripts on a desk (see Figure 9) immediately indicates that the owner of the book is a library expert. If a Chinese librarian were to design a bookplate, it would be appropriate to depict Lao Tzu, who once served as a historian. Finally, bookplates related to the owner's experiences and hobbies could depict a round-the-world sailor like the immortal astronaut Wu Gang who shares my last name, with the osmanthus tree and the moon, or a boat, or a woman swimmer, or the subtle floral patterns and bird shadows on my [own bookplate]. (as shown in Figure 10).

### A Record of Zhang Shuqi: Ten Points Talent, Ten Points Effort

— Xu Shiji

The seventeenth Literary Tea Party was held at the Guanshengyuan in Nanjing. Literary figures gathered together to welcome Professor Zhang Shuqi, a contemporary master of flower-and-bird painting, who recently returned to China from the United States with honor. Looking back six years ago, during the most difficult period of our country's resistance against Japan, Shuqi was ordered to go to the United States to study art and hold personal exhibitions. From the standpoint of national diplomacy, he promoted Chinese art and gave the Chinese nation a breath of fresh air, which is worthy of praise.

In the past half century, China has cultivated no less than thousands of talents in science, and the price paid is incalculable. It cannot be said that scientists have made no contributions, but science, industrialization, and electrification, etc., are just hearing the sound of stairs but not seeing anyone come down. Of course, the reasons are complicated. When it comes to inventions and creations that are manifested in reality, although they are not castles in the air, they are also as elusive as immortals. I dare to boldly assert that the literary and artistic writers who are slightly prominent in the international arena and can win a place should be considered the least important. Shuqi is one of them.

During his six years in the United States, he held dozens of personal exhibitions of Chinese paintings in Washington, Chicago, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and major cities such as Toronto, Canada, traversing the North and South American continents. He was invited by various universities, art museums, and museums to lecture on Chinese art and wield his brush, using his refined skills, as quickly as wind and rain, completing a painting in a short time. People from all walks of life were amazed and praised his superb skills. Newspapers headlined "A Chinese Masterpiece in Ten Minutes" (A. Chinese Masterpiece in Iominites). His success was not accidental, just as the famous inventor Edison said, "One point of genius still depends on ninety-nine points of effort," not to mention that he really has ten points of genius, plus ten points of effort.

Chinese flower-and-bird painting originated in the Tang and Five Dynasties, developed in the Song Dynasty, changed in the Yuan Dynasty, and reached its peak in the Ming and Qing Dynasties; however, the painters of the Ming and Qing Dynasties inherited the legacy of the Five Dynasties and the Two Songs, followed the norms of their predecessors, and lacked creativity.

Shuqi's paintings learn from nature and delve into nature. He is "ingenious in his conception," proficient in both meticulous and freehand styles, breaking through the barriers of the ancients and able to create his own style. His attainments and success are truly a unique and brilliant spectacle in the oriental art world.

### A Record of Paintings in Xiaxi Garden

— Busou

The owner of Xiaxi Garden has been fond of calligraphy and painting all his life, and has been addicted to it for fifty years. Li Baiyun said that he loves painting to the bone, and Zhu Zhuyu said that he loves painting like his life. The owner has both. His love of painting has progressed from shallow to deep, from the present to the past; because of the changes, he has lived in Shanghai for ten years, and the calligraphy and paintings he has collected are only fine antiques. Therefore, there are many calligraphy and paintings from the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties; he has also obtained famous works from the Later Han, Three Kingdoms, Jin, and Six Dynasties, and can understand the origin and development of painting. For example, Zheng Kangcheng liked to paint plum blossoms, and Lin Hejing should have imitated him; Guan Yunchang was good at painting red bamboo, and Yan Zhenqing also imitated him a lot; the transmission of the lineage has its own origin. Zhang Huanhou was skilled in writing elephants, such as figures, flowers, birds, mountains, rocks, and steeds, and there was nothing he could not do; Emperor Zhaolie was good at painting pine and plum, Sun Shangxiang painted daffodils and orchids, and Zhuge Liang was good at painting maps and wooden oxen and horses, and also good at painting pine. When people suddenly said this, few would think it was absurd; in fact, the owner personally experienced it, not a vague influence. Therefore, the collections, whether they have been decorated or not, are all extremely exquisite. Today, only a small portion is displayed in the National Painting Garden, not the whole picture. I hope that people with knowledge can appreciate it together. People often say that it is a feast for the eyes, and it may not be in vain to make this trip.

Editor's note: Mr. Sun Jing, also known as Cangsou, settled in Jingsha Bixia, Nantong, and has a garden with beautiful scenery, called Xiaxi Garden. Mr. Sun was a filial and virtuous man in his youth, and once served as a representative of a civil organization. He was respected by the late Mr. Zhang Jian, a local sage; during the war, he lived in Shanghai, closed his doors to thank guests, and enjoyed calligraphy and painting, which was admired by the world. Recently, at the advanced age of eighty-one, he still wields his brush every day, and the oracle bone characters he paints are simple and unadorned, close to the ruins of Yin. The collection is rich and magnificent. When we saw the Tang and Song ink paintings, and Liang Kai's paintings, Zha Shibiao's bamboo paintings, etc., they were all well-preserved and worth watching. This public exhibition will definitely have many treasures. Now we have received this article from Qiu Busou and published it as soon as possible to introduce it.

### The Declining and Desolate Bird Market

— Zhuguang

Raising birds, a hobby that scholars and officials competed to pursue thirty years ago to show their "elegance," now only exists in the bird market in the round square in front of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road, the teahouse on the upper floor of the Yiyuanlou Teahouse on Zhejiang Road, and the bird shops on Wuma Road, which are full of bamboo cages. Apart from these three places still having traces of "elegance," this hobby, which was once extremely popular and became a fashion, has been almost forgotten by modern people.

On Wuma Road and Zhejiang Road, ten or twenty bird shops are lined up side by side. Since they moved to this area, the golden age of their business has long passed. According to an elderly owner of a bird shop who spoke to a reporter: their heyday was thirty years ago, when the area around the Nine-Bend Bridge in the City God Temple in the Nanshi area was their base camp. No matter whether they were dignitaries or wealthy people, it was not enough to show their power and elegance if they did not raise dozens or even hundreds of colorful birds in their mansions. At that time, slightly more decent wealthy families even had to hire bird keepers who specialized in raising birds.

"The situation is different now," the elder said with a sigh of vicissitudes: "Rich people don't like to play this game anymore. What has replaced it is radios, cinemas, and dance halls. As for those who don't have money, they can't even get enough to eat in these years, so where do they get so much leisure to play with birds!" Filled with melancholy emotions, he came to a conclusion, saying, "In these days, even the birds have suffered!"

Speaking of birds, according to the experts who have been playing with birds for a long time, there are really all kinds of them, with many different names. There are so-called literary birds, such as Java sparrows, white-eyes (so named because the circles around their eyes have black and white lines like embroidery), lovebirds, ten sisters (so named because of their small bodies and beautiful colors), plum blossoms, etc. There are also so-called martial birds, such as thrushes, skylarks, and even the combative yellow-headed birds. In addition, there are myna birds produced in Annam (a kind of parrot, extremely intelligent and good at learning human speech), small parrots, myna birds, sparrows, pigeons, etc. At the same time, each type has several varieties. Taking Java sparrows as an example, there are curly Java sparrows, Dutch Java sparrows, and even snake-headed Java sparrows, which are truly colorful and beautiful.

### Surface Work

— Jin Ling

Generally, people criticize our administrative officials for paying too much attention to surface work. In fact, it would be good enough if they could really pay attention to surface work, but I'm afraid that they can't even do surface work properly. Yesterday's newspaper reported: Chairman Chiang criticized the municipal administration of the capital at the Central Memorial Week, saying: "Everyone does not pay attention to public health and urinates everywhere, without any order. The capital does not look like a capital, which is despised by foreigners. I don't know what the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Health Department, and the Municipal Government are doing!" This is indeed a big blow to those who can't even do surface work properly.

What is strange is that when Chairman Chiang first flew to the capital after the victory last year, the authorities mobilized a large number of people to build roads and clean streets on the same day, and there were bright slogans and flags everywhere. Nanjing City suddenly became lively. But now, the National Government has returned to Nanjing for nearly a year, and Chairman Chiang has been stationed in Nanjing for a long time, but not only has the surface work not been thoroughly completed, but it is "urinating everywhere" and "the capital does not look like a capital." Is it possible that the so-called surface work is just a temporary show?

Therefore, I don't think surface work should be overly criticized, because no matter how gorgeous clothes a haggard patient wears, he can't hide his pale and thin appearance. A healthy person with developed muscles and a rosy complexion will naturally look very beautiful on the outside, even if he doesn't dress up much. Administrative work is also like this. If you are truly a public servant, how can you ignore the cleanliness of small streets and alleys and damage the health of the people?

### Protest

— Zifeng

Amid the soaring prices, Wu Kaiguang, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, insisted on implementing a rationing system in order to stabilize the lives of public and educational personnel and gradually suppress prices. This plan was indeed adopted by the government and will be officially implemented in mid-March. The items to be rationed include: rice, flour, yarn, fuel, salt, sugar, cooking oil, and other necessities for everyone's life.

However, the scope of rationing is limited to "public and educational" personnel, while "private education" and "social education" (cultural circles) are all exceptions. The teachers and staff of private schools and cultural workers, who had been eagerly waiting for these days, thinking that they could also get rations, felt greatly disappointed.

In fact, educational personnel are equally responsible for cultivating talents for the country, and cultural personnel are working hard to promote social education, and their lives are no less difficult than those of general public servants and teachers and staff of public schools. However, the treatment they receive from the country is so different...

Here, we dare to lodge a protest!

### Miscellaneous Fees Under Cleverly Invented Names

— Zhizhen

Even exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies must have a name, and "inventing clever names" has become the specialty of "corrupt officials".

We dare not say that the schools in Ruizai have already become corrupt, but at least many schools have now been infected with the bad habit of "inventing clever names". The Municipal Council has set the standards for the fees of private primary and secondary schools. Although the principals of primary and secondary schools have published dignified protest letters in the newspapers, they have remained silent due to the order from the Municipal Education Bureau to comply. As a result, one middle school wrote on the tuition bill of high school students: "The fees payable this semester are as follows: Tuition fee 220,000 yuan (in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Council), miscellaneous fee 70,000 yuan, health fee 10,000 yuan, compensation deposit 10,000 yuan." The miscellaneous fee is almost one-third of the tuition fee, and the "tuition and miscellaneous fees" actually exceed one-third of the tuition fee.

The authorities of private universities deeply regret that the principals' meeting was held before the rising tide, so that the standard of "a maximum of 500,000 yuan for tuition and miscellaneous fees" was set too low (?). In order to "mend the fold after the sheep is lost", in addition to the 500,000 yuan of "tuition and miscellaneous fees", they added a library fee of 20,000 yuan, a sports fee of 10,000 yuan, lecture notes fee...

Let's talk about public schools. A junior high school student studying at the Municipal ×× Middle School, his parents have to pay 20,000 yuan in tuition and 80,000 yuan in miscellaneous fees, and also have to bear "temporarily collected academic training fees for teachers and staff", "supplementary repair fees" and other "miscellaneous fees" totaling 85,000 yuan - more than the "legitimate" miscellaneous fees!

I don't understand the meaning of miscellaneous fees. Judging from the school's tuition bill, it seems that only a few miscellaneous expenses such as rent, water and electricity are omitted. Is it possible that the miscellaneous fees, which account for such a huge proportion of the total amount of fees, are only used to pay these miscellaneous expenses? This seems a bit unreasonable.

The education authorities once stipulated that the salaries of teachers and staff should account for a percentage of the total tuition fees. Now teachers cannot complain about the low salaries, because the "tuition fees" are collected less - teachers are usually not allowed to interfere with the use of miscellaneous fees and "miscellaneous miscellaneous fees".

To pay attention to hygiene, it must be clean; with sports, how can we forget moral education; teachers and staff are not stable in their lives, there is no talk of academic training... I think, soon the school's tuition bill will be added: "cleaning fee", "moral education fee", "teachers and staff living subsidy"...

### Jade Twig Intersection

— Hulu

What's so strange about an infant? Depending on each other for life, how helpless and sad! Deformity and perversion, it becomes a debt of misfortune -- a double personality is sold piecemeal, born in an unfortunate new era! New era? There are both "gods" and "monsters" treated in two different ways!

### Ode to Tiger Beating - Feelings After Seeing Untitled Works II

— Menglong

Man-eating tigers and harmful flies have appeared in the gold market, and the number of people who have been eaten and harmed is countless. Now is the day of total liquidation!

Tigers, who have always been known for eating people, in the past, let alone beating them, it was not even good to talk about them. The so-called "talking about tigers changes color" is also the case. Today, a large number of warriors who go up the mountain to beat tigers have emerged, isn't it wonderful! Admire! Admire!

The determination to beat them has been made, the reasons for beating them have also been resolved, and the steps to beat them must have been arranged long ago, right?

There is only one principle: only beat tigers, not flies. Their integrity and courage cannot be done by non-warriors! But the prerequisite question is whether tigers exist? Where do they exist? Even flies will fly away, can't tigers stage a scene of "tigers leaving the mountain"? If so, then the flies on the heads of the tigers will obviously become "pond fish" after the city gate catches fire.

Flies! Are you motionless, standing as if you are innocent and safe? Will you fly away while humming the old tune of "don't beat flies"? Will you be uneasy about your own safety? This is the sorrow of the flies!

As for the tigers, who are they? Where are they? This is hard to say. Perhaps they have escaped into the deep valley, or gone far away to the absolute peak, or hidden themselves in the swamp. Once they reappear, they will still eat people as usual!

### Literary and Art Circles

The first collection of "Sanmao Joins the Army" comic strips was published yesterday. The second and third collections will be released soon. The book includes 170-180 pictures, exquisitely printed in seven colors on Dowling paper. Each book costs 3,000 yuan.

Xu Wei, the author of "Ghost Love", has been appointed as the editor of the supplement of the Financial Daily. With the seductive power of Xu's past works, he should be able to attract a large number of junior high school girl readers to the newspaper.

Yang Hansheng has not been heard of for a long time for his new works. Recently, he has been burying his head in writing a historical drama (movie script), the title is yet to be determined.

Lu Yegao was a member of a drama troupe in a certain army in Jishi, in the rear during the war. He met in Shanghai a few days ago and invited him to go to "Goshman". Who knew that this person was one of the "Four Famous Mountains". He had been arrested and tailed at the time. After arriving at "Goshman", they were arrested together. During the interrogation by the judge that night, after clarifying Lu's identity, he slept with Lu foot to foot and was acquitted the next morning, but he had been greatly frightened.

It is rumored that "China Electric" will be changed to private ownership and each factory will be independent.

The postal workers' drama troupe of the Postal Workers' Union originally planned to perform regularly, but unfortunately it was difficult to find a theater. It negotiated with "Victory" in Hongkou several times, but to no avail.

Fan Lai, who played Shi Dakai in "The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" in "Amateur" performances before the war, has been unemployed since returning to Shanghai after the war. He is staying with his wife and children in "Talmont". Recently, he played an important role in Wu Yonggang's "Welcome Spring", so his frown has eased slightly.

Gao Yang's son has severe pneumonia. The couple took out their gold bars and sought medical treatment everywhere.

Ma Xuweibang is filming "Heaven and Earth Net" (adapted from a stage play) for the Second Factory of China Electric. The entire cast has only six actors, starring Ouyang Hongying.

Zuo Lin will write and direct a film for a certain company. It is said that the content is similar to "Out of the Water Hibiscus", with a funny bathing scene. The male lead is tentatively set as Han Fei.
