Simultaneously, National troops who captured Laoya Pass are advancing north along the Yellow River, heading directly for Wubao, a Yellow River crossing point.

### American Arms Depot in Tanggu Attacked; Ministry of National Defense Orders Investigation; US Officials Awaiting Formal Report

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of National Defense has ordered the Tanggu military authorities to investigate the incident of Communist forces attacking the American arms depot.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Regarding the recent Tanggu incident, in which five US Marines were killed and sixteen wounded, officials here said that they are currently unable to provide any detailed report. Before issuing a statement, the US authorities are awaiting a formal report from their representatives in China. It is expected to be received within two or three days.

[United Press, Tianjin, 6th] One of the three US Marines severely wounded in the Communist attack in Xinhe has been rescued from danger today and is expected to survive. The other eleven have minor injuries and are responding well to treatment. The US Marine Corps authorities have so far not allowed reporters to speak to the injured. A battalion of the National Army arrived in Xinhe four hours after the fighting had stopped and is currently pursuing the Communist forces. However, it is generally believed that most of the Communist forces have escaped. Many officers of the Second Army of the National Army went to Xinhe today to investigate the matter.

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] "The New York Times" and "The Herald Tribune" continued to carry the news of the attack on the American arms depot near Tanggu for the second day today, but both newspapers did not certify the report. All news agencies confirmed that the attackers were Chinese Communist elements.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] The First Marine Division Headquarters stationed in Tianjin reported that over 300 Chinese people who raided the First Division arms depot in Xinhe, five miles northwest of Tanggu, on the morning of the 5th were indeed organized and trained Communist forces. They not only advanced and retreated based on military bugles and whistles, but also used Japanese automatic weapons and grenades. During the attack, they were divided into four teams, three teams attacked, and one team ambushed on the roadside between Tanggu and Xinhe to prevent reinforcements. In the first few minutes of contact, the 1st Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the Marine Corps stationed in Xinhe lost five men, two guards and three people who were assisting the guards at the time. After the contact began, the soldiers of the 1st Battalion launched a fierce counterattack against the Communist forces with a much smaller number of men. The headquarters of the 1st Battalion stationed in Zenggu received the report and immediately sent reinforcements. Although the armored vehicles encountered some resistance on the way, they finally arrived in Xinhe after fighting back. Four hours later, the Communist forces were repelled. On the morning of the 5th, aircraft of the First Battalion of the First Division stationed in Tianjin took off one after another to pursue them until about 1:00 PM, when they withdrew. Throughout the entire contact, in addition to the five American soldiers killed, sixteen were injured, two of whom are still in critical condition. The Communist forces suffered heavy casualties in addition to leaving six corpses. After the incident, the aircraft of the First Division reconnoitered the Communist forces' positions and retreat lines and saw a large number of stretchers and bloodstains in many places. Two American ammunition depots exploded, and other losses were minimal.

### Receiving Lüda Becomes Increasingly Concrete; Chinese and Soviet Generals Hold Talks; Soviet Side Agrees to Let Us Receive Wazi Dian First

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 6th] The issue of receiving Lüda is becoming increasingly concrete. The Soviet military commander in Lüda specially invited our frontline commander Colonel Zhou Pu to hold talks in Pulandian at 11:00 AM on the 6th. In addition to dispatching senior staff officer Zhan Shi to participate, the Command Headquarters also sent two staff members. Zhan will return to Qing Dynasty (瀋陽) within the day.

[Another Dispatch] The meeting between Chinese and Soviet generals in Pulandian on the afternoon of the 6th is the precursor to our receipt of Lüda. The extent to which both sides respect the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship can be conceived from this. Our side will express our firm position to the Soviet commander and request that the Soviet side clearly indicate the methods for expelling the illegal armed forces in the Lüda area, otherwise the National Army will restore political power in Lüda through action. The people involved in our meeting with the Soviets returned north on the night of the 6th and stayed overnight in Wafangdian. Liao Yaoxiang is scheduled to arrive in Shenyang by train on the night of the 6th to report on the meeting between the frontline Chinese and Soviet generals in Wafangdian. Furthermore, the telephone poles and lines between Pulandian and Shihe have been jointly repaired by China and the Soviet Union and are now connected. This line, approximately 15 kilometers long, will greatly improve the military liaison and emotional relationship between China and the Soviet Union in the future.

[Another Dispatch] During the Sino-Soviet talks in Pulandian on the 6th, the Soviet side agreed to let us receive Wazi Dian first. Wazi Dian is located southeast of Pulandian and is the water source for Lüda. The Soviet side requested that we recover and be responsible for protecting it.

[Another Dispatch] It is believed here that it would be beneficial and convenient for both sides if the frontline troops of China and the Soviet Union each sent a military team to be stationed in the other's headquarters regarding the military affairs of the Lüda area.

### Xu Kan Talks About the Recent Situation in the Northeast; All of Liaoning Province Except Lushun Has Been Received; The Strength of the National Army is Very Strong and Does Not Allow Communist Army Raids

[Our Report] Xu Kan, Chairman of Liaoning Province, arrived in Beijing from Shenyang on March 21 to attend the Third Plenary Session. After the meeting, he came to Shanghai on the 4th. Reporters paid a special visit last night and asked about the recent situation in the Northeast. According to him: Because Liaoning Province was received earlier, there are no security problems today. All the provinces have been recovered except for the city of Lushun.

There are more than 20 newspapers in Liaoning Province, and the ones with larger sales volumes include Central, Peace, Progress, Northeast Pioneer, Northeast Minbao, Commercial Daily, Sino-Soviet Daily, Xinbao, Shenyang Daily, and Justice News. The daily sales volume is over 10,000 copies. In addition, there are many news agencies.

The recovered area of ​​the Northeast accounts for more than two-fifths of the total area. The important political, economic, and cultural centers are all within the recovered area. The population accounts for more than two-thirds of the total population of the Northeast. Transportation has been restored, but there is a shortage of railway cars. More than 600,000 Japanese prisoners are being sent back, and there is no underground power of Japan in the Northeast. The current difficulty felt in the Northeast is still in terms of finance, which is the same for the whole country, not a special situation in the Northeast. In terms of the supply of materials, there is no shortage of daily necessities produced locally. Those imported from other places have transportation difficulties. However, due to the use of Yingkou; Huludao port, it is much more convenient than a year ago. The currency currently used in the Northeast is still mainly circulation coupons, and prices have risen about tenfold compared to the initial reception.

About seven-tenths of the industrial equipment in the Northeast was looted. The remaining equipment is being actively used. However, because it is not easy to replenish Japanese goods machines and there is a lack of technicians, this work has not yet been completed. Currently, the heavy industry in the Northeast is operated by the National Resources Commission, and other light industries are managed by the Northeast Production Administration of the Xingyuan Command Headquarters.

The strength of the National Army in the Northeast is very strong and it does not allow the Communist Army to raid. Self-defense forces of the people have been organized in Liaoning Province to protect railways and rural villages.

Regarding the receipt of Lüda, Xu declined to express his opinion, but believed that it would take longer to receive it politically and less time to receive it militarily. There are not many large-scale Communist forces, and there will not be a large-scale battle. Xu also said: While in Beijing, he paid a visit to the President and made some requests in all aspects. Chairman Xu is unlikely to be there for a day or two due to traffic conditions.

### Plan to Designate Taihu Lake as a Special Administrative Region: Suzhou County Government Submits Two Suggestions to Improve Transportation and Develop Production

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] The case of designating Taihu Lake as a special administrative region and establishing an administrative bureau was previously approved by Chairman Chiang to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for joint discussion by relevant ministries and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for reporting and approval. It has now been decided that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should first solicit the opinions of the counties along the lake and report them for consideration and deliberation. Recently, the Suzhou County Government has submitted its opinions on transportation and production, which are recorded as follows: (1) Transportation: The current water and land transportation of Taihu Lake relies solely on shipping, which is very inconvenient. It is proposed that the existing road from Suzhou to Fuxiao be extended to Qingkou, and two lines be built through Hengjing to Dianqian. On Xishan Island, a county road will be built from Houbao through Zhili to Tangli, with a total length of approximately 30 kilometers. Ferry services will be established in Houbao, Zhenxia, and Xukou in Dongshan, which will greatly facilitate transportation. (2) Production: There are many beaches along the coast of Taihu Lake, covering a vast area. It is proposed to develop them into fish ponds, plant mulberry trees and various flowers and trees, and establish seedling nurseries and forest farms in Dongshan and Xishan to improve planting for the benefit of the country and the people.

However, due to the many difficulties faced by the country in the past twenty years, even with excellent policies, the implementation of government orders has not achieved the expected results. In land administration, important tasks such as land registration, land price declaration, and agricultural output distribution have not yet been initiated. We must make double efforts to lay the foundation for the great cause of national construction, which is extremely urgent. In particular, our country has a vast territory, and the conditions of urban land to rural land, and in the east, west, south, and north, are mutually different and intricately complex. If we want to implement our party's land policy thoroughly to achieve the effect of utilizing the land to its full potential for the benefit of the people, then all handling methods must have good regulations that adapt to local conditions. This also relies on our people's careful consideration, comprehensive and meticulous management, and compromise to achieve success. Your society has a long history and gathers extensive knowledge in one place. It is hoped that this annual meeting will focus on current needs, carefully deliberate, and express excellent plans to serve as a reference for land administration measures and to benefit the progress of people's livelihood construction. This is my sincere hope.

### Disposal of Remaining Japanese Warships: Allied Headquarters to Issue Statement Soon, U.S. Official Indicates Decision-Making Power Lies with MacArthur

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] An official from the State Department told a Central News Agency reporter: Regarding the disposal of remaining Japanese warships, a statement that "the Allied Headquarters in Japan is currently considering it" will be issued soon. The State Department declined to comment on the news from Nanjing that 64 Japanese warships would be equally distributed among China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and stated that the decision-making power on this issue rests with MacArthur. In other news: The Far Eastern Commission has not yet begun to consider this matter of distributing ships in advance as compensation.

### Most of the Warships Allotted to Us Require Repair

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Among the sixteen Japanese compensation warships to be allotted to us, ten are destroyers and the remaining six are various types of ships. However, most of them need to be shipped to Canada for repairs before they can be used. In addition, our country has four shipyards, including Jiangnan, Magong, Qingdao, and Huangpu. Except for the Jiangnan Shipyard, the other shipyards need to be strengthened. In the future, part of the compensation materials will be machines used to strengthen our shipbuilding equipment.

### Shenyang Again Cracks Down on Opium Den, Masterminds and Accomplices All Captured

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] The Criminal Police Brigade of Shenyang City cracked down on a massive opium den in Shenyang on the 4th. Guo Qingxiang, the mastermind, and Li Zhengkang, a Korean technician who manufactured opium, along with four others, were captured on the spot. Multiple opium-making machines, various raw materials for opium production, and a large quantity of manufactured opium, worth over 5 million yuan in current currency, were seized. At the time, these drug offenders were manufacturing opium, and the mastermind of the opium den, Guo, was also on-site supervising the work. Therefore, they were all captured in one fell swoop, with both the criminals and the evidence seized. Afterwards, a continued search revealed that a certain Liu was responsible for transporting and selling the opium and supplying the raw materials, but he is currently at large. It is reported that Guo Qingxiang is the manager of Shenyang Tianyuanbao Trading Company. He has a lot of wealth in Siping, Liaoyang, and various places in the city. According to his confession, the capital of the opium den was 4 million yuan. Since February, he has started manufacturing opium, having already produced it four times, with a total value of over 30 million yuan in current currency. Most of it was transported to Andong for sale. Relevant authorities are still investigating whether they are related to the opium manufacturers previously cracked down in Changchun.

### To Implement Constitutional Government, the People Must Have a Spirit of Law Abiding: Minister Peng Gave a Broadcast Speech in Shanghai Yesterday at the Invitation of This Newspaper

[Report from This Newspaper] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei, at the invitation of this newspaper, broadcast a speech on China Freedom Radio Station at 6:00 PM yesterday, with the theme "To Implement Constitutional Government, the People Must Have a Spirit of Law Abiding." The main points of Minister Peng's speech are as follows: "This year is the beginning of the implementation of constitutional government. The Kuomintang will end its period of political tutelage and return power to the people. However, when the people begin to participate in politics, first, they should be prepared to accept constitutional government; second, they should have the training and experience to exercise political power; and third, they should have a spirit of public service and law abiding. For example, if we demand freedom, we should not infringe upon the freedom of others. Everyone must abide by the law and exercise self-control in order to be impartial and selfless and promote unity and unification. Otherwise, if 400 million people abuse freedom, wouldn't it be terrible? Everyone must understand the meaning of law abiding and self-control. To be more specific, those in government should, of course, abide by the law and not abuse their power, but ordinary people must also abide by the law and cannot act recklessly and irresponsibly. For example, those who run newspapers cannot express opinions that violate the interests of the nation and the people or violate the rights and interests of the people simply to satisfy personal desires. This means that everyone should not only seek their own interests, but must take the interests of the whole as their own. We can see proof of this by looking at other countries. Why has constitutional government succeeded in Britain and the United States? The reason is that from the government to the people, they all have a spirit of public service and law abiding. Their newspaper industry is developed, but newspapers rarely have irresponsible remarks and speak based on facts, not personal emotions. Because their newspaper people can manage themselves, the government does not need to manage them. This highly developed spirit of law abiding and self-government is the only condition for the success of constitutional government in Britain and the United States. Looking at why Germany and Japan failed? This is because the general public in Germany and Japan lacked training in democratic politics and did not have the habit of law abiding, which led to the indulgence of a small number of people's ambitions, which eventually led to the emergence of absurd aggressive ideas, and the people followed blindly, which ultimately led to the tragic defeat of today. The strength of Germany and Japan, whether politically or economically, cannot be denied. But in a blink of an eye, they were completely defeated, and this was due to the people's lack of law abiding. The success of constitutional government in Britain and the United States and the failure of Germany and Japan are due to law abiding and the inability to abide by the law. It must be known that the implementation of constitutional government is by no means an easy task. It requires the knowledge and conduct of constitutionalism of all the people in order to succeed. Otherwise, it is likely to lead to the opposite result. The ancients said: The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual. This means that everyone has a responsibility for national politics, and with responsibility comes rights. What I am contributing to you today is the eight characters "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual."

### Nantong Construction Association Holds Inaugural Meeting

Editorial

### America's Responsibility for World Peace

On the anniversary of the birth of the late American President Thomas Jefferson, President Truman delivered a speech at the Democratic Party Convention, emphatically declaring: the United States cannot shirk its responsibility for creating world peace, and therefore bears the responsibility of assisting the freedom of peoples in all nations who are in danger. He also stated, "In order to shoulder this responsibility, the United States must maintain sufficient military strength to convince all nations that the United States is determined to act in accordance with its responsibilities; the United States must not only be strong, but also have a sound economic and financial situation." Although this important speech did not directly mention the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, the diplomatic policy it elaborated is a powerful interpretation of its aid plan to Greece and Turkey, making the American people deeply feel that the responsibility of the United States for world peace is indeed too important; if this glorious and lofty mission is to be accomplished, it is necessary to fully exert its political wisdom.

President Truman delivered a speech to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on the 12th of last month, requesting Congress to allocate $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey, and to assist the revival of Greece and Turkey in other ways, in order to resist external pressure; nearly four weeks have passed since then, and although American public opinion is extremely complex regarding President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey, there is also a common point that is, everyone unanimously believes that it is indeed necessary to aid Greece and Turkey. Therefore, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed this plan on the 3rd of this month, it unanimously passed the President's proposed aid plan to Greece and Turkey, and also passed the amendment proposed by the committee chairman, Vandenberg. It is heard that the State Department has also expressed its agreement to this amendment, so the Senate will begin to discuss this aid plan to Greece and Turkey when it meets tomorrow.

America's active assistance to Greece and Turkey is not only a clearer indication of American foreign policy, but also a prelude to the increasingly subtle relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, after President Truman announced this plan, it shocked almost the entire world, and its impact on Moscow was indeed significant, even exceeding the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference being held in Moscow. Even the most outspoken American congressmen initially had to adopt a cautious attitude towards this plan, which could influence the world situation, and did not dare to comment on it arbitrarily. However, in the past three or four weeks, American public opinion has clarified and fully understood the current world situation, deeply feeling the necessity for the United States to provide assistance to Greece and Turkey. Everyone believes that this plan will not only not cause a new war, but will also be sufficient to consolidate the foundation of world peace. The only question is how to use political wisdom!

Legally speaking, the aid plan to Greece and Turkey proposed by President Truman is drafted in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and it is clearly stipulated in its preamble that if the United Nations agency is capable of assisting Greece and Turkey, then the United States must stop implementing its aid plan to Greece and Turkey; at the same time, the amendment proposed by Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has also been passed by the Foreign Relations Committee, and the State Department has no objection to this. This amendment also clearly stipulates that the United States must stop implementing the aid plan to Greece and Turkey in the following three situations: (1) If the United Nations agency, through a resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly or the Security Council, is capable of implementing the aid plan to Greece and Turkey on its own; (2) If the majority of the people of Greece and Turkey request the United States to stop providing assistance; (3) If the President of the United States believes that the basic objectives of this aid plan to Greece and Turkey cannot be achieved. From this, it can be seen that the American aid plan to Greece and Turkey is not immutable and must be implemented. Let us look again at the documents published by the US State Department in response to questions from various senators, of which two points are most worthy of our attention: (1) The United States does not want to use aid to Greece and Turkey as a means to become a joint guardian of the Turkish Straits: (2) The American aid plan to Greece and Turkey cannot be regarded as an attempt by the United States to encircle the Soviet Union or other countries.

However, on the other hand, it is completely different: the Soviet Union not only harbors territorial claims against Turkey, but has also long wanted to meddle in the Turkish Straits, which is a well-known fact; it is also a well-known fact that Turkey is under external pressure and is in a state of anxiety all day long. What country does President Truman refer to when he says that the United States will assist Turkey in resisting its external pressure? It is even more obvious. As for the situation in Greece, Greece is one of the Balkan countries, how can the Soviet Union care that it is outside its circle! From the end of the war until now, it has been in the flames of civil war at all times. Although there are British troops stationed there to assist the Greek government in maintaining order and security; however, the disturbances of armed guerrillas have continued unabated, and it has never been possible to eliminate them, and northern Greece has become another world; does the Greek civil war have an international background? It is already self-evident! In successive international conferences, diplomats from Britain and the Soviet Union have engaged in countless fierce verbal battles over the Greek issue. The Soviet Union has repeatedly attacked Britain for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries because of the presence of British troops in Greece. What is its intention? The Soviet Union has long regarded the Balkan Peninsula as its security zone, and Greece is the only country not behind its "Iron Curtain." How can the Soviet Union stand idly by? Now Britain feels overwhelmed and has to withdraw from Greece. But after Britain withdraws from Greece, if the United States does not take its place in Greece, then the power that will follow will naturally be the Soviet Union's. Therefore, no matter how the United States explains President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey, the Soviet Union will ultimately feel that it is like a thorn in its side! This is also an inevitable truth.

Standing in the position of a third party, we calmly observe the development of the international situation, and we deeply know that the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union has become increasingly acute! For the sake of the future of world peace, it is indeed worthy of our concern. After the war, the United States and the Soviet Union, having learned this lesson of blood, both felt the horror of war and the loveliness of peace: but because of different ideas and conflicts of actual interests, they created a situation of opposition between the two countries. We study the crux of the problem and find that it is due to the mutual suspicion between the two countries that they cannot trust and understand each other. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it always feels that the United States is threatening and containing the Soviet Union everywhere with its secret of atomic energy and the advantage of its monetary diplomacy, so that the Soviet Union has to expand its "security circle" in order to seek its own self-protection. As for the United States, it always feels that the Soviet Union is expanding its power, whether in Europe or in the Far East, it is like mercury leaking to the ground, entering every pore. Therefore, in order to prevent problems before they happen, it has to keep the secret of atomic energy, it has to maintain military bases in various parts of the world, and it has to lend huge sums of money to countries that feel external pressure to help them develop so that they can resist resolutely. The mutual suspicion of both sides is both cause and effect, and mutual stimulation has become incompatible like ice and charcoal. Even on any matter, the views of the United States and the Soviet Union are always different. For example, regarding the view of peace, if it is not the peace led by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union always feels that this is not true peace; similarly, in the United States, if it is not the peace under the protection of the United States, it is not true peace. Furthermore, Soviet-style democracy? And American-style democracy are even more different. Therefore, although the United States and the Soviet Union both want to achieve peace and democracy, the ideals they hold and the methods they should take are completely different. At the Foreign Ministers Conference still being held in Moscow today, although the four powers are completely in agreement in principle on the German issue, they disagree as soon as they touch the core. This is an excellent proof.

In short, we fully agree with President Truman's statement that the United States has a responsibility to create world peace; but what kind of method should be adopted in order to fulfill its mission to the world and all mankind; especially for the Soviet Union, what kind of political wisdom should the United States use to eliminate the suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union invisibly, it seems that there is still a need for consideration.

### Preventing Aggression and Safeguarding the Freedom of All Nations: America Decides to Adopt a Positive Stance. President Truman Delivers a Speech Reaffirming His Belief That to Avoid War, the Roots of Conflict Must Be Eradicated

[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman delivered a speech at the Democratic Party founder Thomas Jefferson Memorial Day banquet today, strongly stating that the United States must adopt a positive stance to deal with all forms of aggression, and must maintain its own economic strength. Americans must assist the general public whose freedom is threatened by foreign forces. The President specifically pointed out two methods: secret infiltration and open military aggression. On the domestic front, the President said that the Republican Party's economic measures in Congress, such as demanding immediate tax cuts, will lead to disaster. He has no plans for the next election. When the President mentioned "In order to support the United Nations, we should supplement its activities when necessary," he was obviously referring to his plan to aid Greece and Turkey. It is said that "Aiding free countries to maintain freedom, we can strengthen the strength of the United Nations organization in completing the role of the United Nations organization. We must adopt a positive stance. It is not enough to just say that we do not want war. At this moment, we must eradicate any beginning of conflict to prevent its threat from spreading to the whole world. We have seen in the past that strong countries use force to invade weak countries and solve problems with bloodshed. We already know the result. The duty of the United States is to defend the United Nations organization. The United Nations organization must extinguish the flames in any place and not hesitate to use international guards to prevent armed conflict." The President added that the evolution of the situation makes it necessary for the United States to lead the world, regardless of the difficulty of the task and the magnitude of the cost. The people of our country are the ones who contributed figures such as Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt to the world. The people of our country not only cherish freedom, but also are willing to protect it with their lives when necessary. We also recognize the right of other countries and peoples to share this freedom.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] In the United States Senate, the accusations against President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey are divided into two factions: one faction is determined to oppose it to the end, and the other faction is prepared to accept it when there is no other way. Members of the opposition faction said that they will fight on the Senate floor this week and strive to eliminate aid to Turkey, and limit aid to Greece to relief trade. At the same time, the State Department also issued a 46-page printed document answering 111 questions raised by members of Congress, which can help those who support the aid plan. The answer strongly stated that aid to Greece and Turkey does not pose any direct threat to the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union cannot interpret this aid as an unfriendly act and use it as an excuse for retaliation. The greatest threat to the stability of Greece is the attempt of 13,000 guerrillas to overthrow the current government. Although most of these guerrillas are not communists, their leaders are mostly communists and promote communist ideas, so they must be prevented. As for Turkey, the country was a neutral country that was favorable to the Allies during the war. Turkey has assisted the Allies in many ways, such as allowing Allied technicians to enter the country, allowing the Allies to set up ammunition supply depots in its territory, and facilitating the passage of Allied wounded soldiers and prisoners of war, so it is also worthy of assistance.

### The US Joint Chiefs of Staff Announces the Completion of the Defensive War Plan with Emphasis on the Pacific

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Army officials announced today that the US Army has drafted a plan to deploy land and air forces to engage in the first phase of defensive warfare. Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz also announced to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Joint Chiefs of Staff has drafted a defensive plan, which has been approved by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy. According to those around Secretary of the Army Patterson: We can safely assume that this plan is constantly being revised and is based on the number of enemies that can be reasonably inferred, and the determination of attacks in many possible ways. This plan only uses the soldiers, guns, ships, and aircraft that may be obtained when attacked, and must be agreed upon by all members of the General Staff before it can proceed.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff is composed of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the President's military advisor. As for the strength of the Joint General Staff, almost no one knows it today. Military personnel are unwilling to discuss the planning aspects, but in recent months they have strongly stated the importance of this unit and Pacific defense. Army ground troops have conducted extensive experiments in the north, as have the Navy and Air Force. A practical and far-reaching plan for Far East Pacific defense has been formed since the United States and the Philippine government reached an agreement on the issue of US military bases in the Philippines. Within this week, the UN Security Council also passed the US trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands, and the defense of the Pacific region between the Philippines and Hawaii will be more convenient in the plan.

### Greek Prince Arrives in France

[Agence France-Presse, Nice, 5th] Former Greek Prince Philip arrived here today on a private plane and immediately went to Cannes, where he will stay for several days. He told reporters that the purpose of his visit here is to recuperate.

### The Depreciation of the Ruble Shows the Tense Relationship Between the United States and the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] The New York Herald Tribune stated that due to the tense relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, the price of the ruble outside the Soviet Union has fallen rapidly in recent weeks. The official ratio in countries such as Poland, Iran, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria is 5.5 rubles to 1 US dollar, but diplomatic figures can obtain an exchange rate of 12 to 1. Currently, the exchange rates in Tehran, Sofia, Budapest, and other places are as high as 100 to 1. This devaluation apparently began when the White House announced its policy of aiding Greece and Turkey to resist communism.

### The Security Council Has an Important Meeting Today: Gromyko Will Deliver a Speech

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] At the Security Council meeting on the 7th, Soviet representative Gromyko will deliver an important speech clarifying the Soviet Union's position on the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey. More than 6,000 people in New York have requested admission tickets from United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, but the gallery of the venue can only accommodate 514 people, so most of those who requested tickets are disappointed. However, the United Nations still has other important meetings on this day, such as the General Disarmament Committee and the Trusteeship Committee, which will both be held, so those who are turned away at the Security Council can go to these two meetings to listen. Gromyko will also deliver a speech at the Disarmament Committee.

### Truman's Speech is Well Received with Thirty-One Applause

[United Press, Washington, 6th] President Truman delivered a "Jefferson Memorial Day" speech here on the 5th. When he spoke about the US policy of maintaining world peace, he won enthusiastic applause from the audience, and the speech was interrupted 31 times. When Truman spoke about demanding a reduction in "unnecessary high prices," the applause was even more intense. He also received applause when he talked about the budget for this year being balanced and surplus. Truman avoided talking about domestic political issues. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace was also on the invitation list, but was not present.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Before President Truman attended the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Day banquet today and delivered a speech, Congressman Rayburn first addressed the Democratic members of Congress and said, "We already have a candidate" who can lead the entire party in the next presidential election, and that person is President Truman. The crowd cheered when they heard this.

### Hodge Talks About US Policy Towards Korea with Determination to Support Democracy

[United Press, Seoul, 5th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in southern Korea, has returned to Korea after reporting to the country. He told reporters today that the United States will strengthen democracy in southern Korea and actively develop its economy. If the United States cannot obtain Soviet cooperation, it can only fulfill its obligations alone. The commander of the Soviet army has recently been replaced. Lieutenant General Kolotkov succeeded Lieutenant General Kristenko as the supreme commander. This matter can be valued or not, because we all know that Kristenko is sick.

### The German Central Administrative Organization Should Be Controlled by the Allied Control Council and the Four Foreign Ministers Have Reached an Agreement After Consultation

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference continued to discuss the issue of German political organization today and unanimously decided to place the German Central Administrative Organization under the control of the Allied Control Council, and then gradually establish a German Advisory Committee and a German Provisional Government. The French plan proposed that in addition to the German Central Administrative Organization, a German Administrative Committee should be established separately, controlled by the Allied countries, which was only agreed to by the British and American delegations. As for the Soviet Union, it reserved its decision. Another French proposal advocated that the Saar region should not be under the jurisdiction of the German Central Administrative Organization, and the legal status of the Ruhr region and the Rhine region should be resolved later, so as to ultimately restrict the jurisdiction of the German Central Administrative Organization over these regions. The Soviet Union also adopted a reserved attitude towards the French proposal. As for Britain and the United States, they both expressed their acceptance of the two French proposals, but with one condition, that is, these two proposals should be stipulated in the agreement. The Four Foreign Ministers discussed the issue of German political organization today in accordance with the principles of the report submitted by the Coordination Committee. When discussing the issue of the powers and responsibilities of the commanders of the occupied areas for the German Central Administrative Organization, opinions were quite divergent. Finally, it was decided to return this issue to the Coordination Committee for further review. The Four Foreign Ministers then discussed the issue of establishing a German Advisory Committee. There were many misunderstandings about the date of its establishment. Finally, they unanimously passed the proposal of British Foreign Minister Bevin, stipulating that the German Advisory Committee should be established within three months after the organization of the German Central Administrative Organization. As for the German Provisional Government, it will be organized within nine months after the German Advisory Committee is established. When the Four Foreign Ministers discussed the composition of the German Advisory Committee, the differences of opinion were also very obvious. The French representative proposed a proposal advocating that the Advisory Committee should be attended by three representatives from each state, appointed by the state governments or parliaments in accordance with democratic public opinion. As for the Soviet representative, he proposed that the Advisory Committee should include representatives from political parties, trade unions, and other democratic organizations. The British and American representatives said that they are willing to accept any plan that does not allow the representatives of the German Advisory Committee to go beyond the scope of trade unions and political parties. However, Britain and the United States finally decided to support the French proposal. As for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, he strongly stated that Nazi and democratic organizations must participate in the work of the Advisory Committee. As a result, the Four Foreign Ministers did not reach an agreement on the composition of the Advisory Committee and decided to return this issue to the Coordination Committee for further discussion.

### The Foreign Ministers Conference May Be Extended to Be Reopened in London or Paris

### British Government Conscription Law Amendment: Churchill Expresses Opposition, Conservative Party to Reconsider Attitude Towards Government

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated in a declaration at Cadwell today: The government authorities submitted an amendment to the conscription law to the Lower House last Sunday, reducing the term of military service from eighteen months to one year. The Conservative Party will vote against this amendment. Previously, the Conservative and Liberal Parties voted in favor of the government because they felt reassured after hearing public statements from cabinet ministers. We have every reason to believe that the plan submitted by the government to Parliament is the result of long-term and meticulous study by cabinet ministers and is based on the advice of military experts. We also believe that the government's recommendations represent the minimum defense measures that Britain should take in the coming years to meet its needs and fulfill its obligations. However, as it stands, this plan has no basis, has nothing to do with defense needs, and the cabinet ministers who proposed this plan have no confidence in it. This plan exposes the Labor cabinet's weakness and incompetence in handling all matters affecting the people's livelihood, whether large or small, at home or abroad. I declared in the Lower House last Sunday that the Conservative Party not only intends to support the government during the second reading of the bill but also intends to support the government at all stages of the bill. However, we must now reconsider our position and course of action for the benefit of the nation. In addition, Cziriaaks, the leader of the extreme left wing of the Labor Party, met alone with a French news agency reporter today, representing the "Labor Party rebel MPs," and said: If Churchill and his friends vote against the conscription law in the third reading, we will not vote against it. Some moderates in our party may vote against this bill, but I personally will abstain. I believe my friends will also abstain. I and my friends are taking a position against the government's draft in order to change the government's foreign policy, but we are unwilling to give the Conservative Party any opportunity.

### Jinnah Meets Mountbatten; Talks Proceed in a Good Atmosphere; Whether the Muslim League's Attitude Has Changed Remains to Be Seen

[United Press, New Delhi, 5th] The president of the Muslim League, Jinnah, met with the new Viceroy of India, Mountbatten, today for an informal friendly talk that lasted one hour and fifty minutes. This was the first meeting between Jinnah and Mountbatten. It is rumored that the leaders of the Congress Party are willing to try again to negotiate with the Muslim League to resolve the political and religious disputes in India, but Jinnah's attitude has not been expressed and is only known to Jinnah himself. The Congress Party insists on Indian unity, while Jinnah has repeatedly demanded partition and the establishment of an independent Muslim state. It is unlikely that his opinion has changed at present. The Viceroy's office carefully announced that Mountbatten's talks with Gandhi, the ministers of the Congress-Muslim League in the interim government, and representatives of the Maharaja clans were called "exploratory" and a continuous proposal. Gandhi has met with Mountbatten five times this week.

### Foreigners' Soviet Wives Unable to Return; Soviet Policy Appears to Have Changed

During the war and the year after the war, the Soviet Union issued about twenty such passports.

### Norway Actively Rebuilding: Striving to Get Rid of Soviet Control

— Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

Norway is now advancing rapidly on the road to recovery, preparing to fully restore its pre-war state by the end of next year. It is believed that only in this way can it get rid of Soviet economic control. At the beginning of 1947, the Norwegian government prepared to ratify a two-year Norwegian-Soviet trade agreement. Norway is willing to trade with the Soviet Union, but it is unwilling to be subjected to excessively strict or excessively long-term constraints by any country. At the same time, under the current situation, the Soviet Union has no reason to demand the signing of a more binding treaty at this time.

Norway's neighbor Sweden cannot have such independence. Some businessmen and politicians used to do more business with the Soviet Union before the war, but now they feel that maintaining neutrality is not necessarily a good deal. Recently, Sweden agreed to lend the Soviet Union US$280 million for a period of fifteen years, and also signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to exchange goods worth US$140 million for the same amount of Soviet goods in the next five years. This transaction has greatly reduced Sweden's trade with Western countries.

The situation in Norway is different. It expects the United Nations to succeed. In order to free it from the economic constraints of the Soviet Union or other countries, Norway has contributed its former Foreign Minister Lie to the United Nations. The current Norwegian government believes that economic coordination can be achieved through international agreements. The Norwegian authorities are determined to try this method before being drawn into the vortex of the East or the West.

The resolution of this year's United Nations conference on the establishment of an international trade organization has a great relationship to any new economic trends in Norway. This westernmost country in Northern Europe is also a member of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund. As for Sweden, it has not yet joined these two organizations and seems to be taking a wait-and-see attitude towards their value.

At the same time, Norway is unwilling to formally accept the US$50 million credit loan that the US Export-Import Bank is prepared to give it, because US law stipulates that goods purchased by foreign countries from the United States must be transported by American ships. Norway, whose main export business is foreign transportation, is not eager to use a small number of US dollars to deal with the businesses that it can complete itself.

The trade treaty signed by Norway and the Soviet Union includes the exchange of Norwegian fish for Soviet charcoal and other chemical raw materials. The economic delegation has not given up considering future long-term contracts, but, at present, Norway is already concluding temporary contracts with other countries. Minister of Supply Tabby and Minister of Finance Blovoss believe that this type of treaty can best guarantee Norway's goal of achieving full recovery by the end of next year.

It may be beneficial to the Soviet Union if it allows Norway to develop freely without interfering. The Soviet Union may be able to use Norway's current major exports such as paper, mobile houses, and zero production, but even if these Norwegian goods are reduced to a minimum, the Soviet Union can still maintain itself.

The thing that the Soviet Union is particularly concerned about is that it uses most of the Norwegian merchant ships to enter and exit the iron ore area of ​​Narvik and obtain steel from Norwegian iron factories.

At the beginning of 1947, the situation in Norway was relatively good and it was gradually improving. Production has reached pre-war levels. Although the amount of currency issued has gradually increased and there is inflation, the government is trying to control it and increase foreign exchange reserves.

Housing construction is relatively lagging behind, but compared with the housing shortages in other countries ravaged by the Nazi invaders, it is not worth mentioning. Food is quite sufficient and is gradually increasing. Although clothing and shoes are still scarce, the supply has increased compared to half a year ago. The transportation industry is the key to Norway's construction and prosperity. The profits of merchant ships can usually offset the trade deficit, and now this profit is gradually increasing, and soon Norway can restore a favorable trade balance.

Fishery is Norway's main domestic trade, and the 1946 catch created a new record. The whaling ship industry has set out to hunt whales and will return fully loaded to enrich the national economy. The Soviet Union has begun to become interested in this industry and has specifically asked Norway to help it become familiar with whaling technology.

In the next few years, Norway will develop various new industries. First, because Germany as a producer is completely done for, there are many markets that can be seized. Second, because after the destruction of German industry, Norway has to manufacture many things that it used to buy from foreign countries. The largest of the industrial plans is the construction of a steel manufacturing plant worth US$60 million.

Industrialists believe that this plan is necessary in today's world where there is a shortage of steel materials. Norway has always relied on the profits from mineral ore exports to purchase steel plates and steel skins, and the current plan requires the domestic production of 200,000 tons of steel annually.

In addition, there is a great plan to expand hydroelectric power facilities, but it is progressing slowly. At the same time, considerable efforts are also being made to develop the plastics industry to meet international markets and to develop rayon and other fabrics to meet domestic markets.

Norwegians are unusually concerned and even indignant about the trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Sweden. They particularly hope to get Swedish electrical machinery, but now they are worried that they will only get a small part of the ordered electrical machinery. They also feel that Norway's position with respect to the Soviet Union has been weakened due to Sweden's concessions.

The Norwegian Communist Party fully supports Sweden's loan to the Soviet Union and asks that its own country take the same measures. However, some communists are suspected of colluding with the Nazis before Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, so they are not noticed today.

The Soviet Union's economic power has penetrated Finland and Sweden. Whether this power will penetrate deeper into Norway depends first of all on Norway's attitude and efforts.

Norwegians are very optimistic about the future. Now that the war is over, they can concentrate on planning everything. They quickly recovered from the German occupation. Under the efforts of reconstruction and nation-building, Norway will become a rich and powerful country again in a few years, which can be predicted.

### Bullets Flying on Meizhou Road: Conflict Between Soldiers and Police Leads to Bloodshed; One Wounded Soldier Shot, Two Passersby Killed and Wounded; Garrison Headquarters, Police Bureau, and Wounded Soldiers' Side Negotiate for Peaceful Resolution

[Report from This Newspaper] A large number of wooden materials piled up in front of the Xinhua Water and Electricity Materials Factory at No. 1341 Pingliang Road were suddenly stolen at 3 or 4 o'clock yesterday morning, with 26 pieces of wood and two large collapsed car wheels lost. It was not until 9 o'clock in the morning that the factory discovered the theft and immediately sent someone to report it to the Yangshupu Police Sub-bureau under its jurisdiction. Wang Xinheng, the chief of the sub-bureau, ordered the criminal division to investigate. The factory also sent someone to the bureau. Part of the stolen materials was found at the Chaoyang School wooden bridge, and it was said that the theft was committed by wounded soldiers. At about 1:30 p.m., two plainclothes police officers, No. 942 and No. 870, and uniformed police officers, No. 855 and No. 913, were ordered to go out for investigation. While passing by the Chaoyang Theater at Xiaomu Bridge on Meizhou Road, they caught sight of wounded soldiers mixed with people gambling by the roadside. When the police officers arrived, some of the people scattered in panic, but a few people continued to gamble with the wounded soldiers. The police officers immediately stepped forward to intervene, and the wounded soldiers refused to comply, leading to a quarrel. First, several wounded soldiers snatched a police hat from police officer No. 855, and the official gun of plainclothes police officer No. 870 was also seized. The police officers were outnumbered and fled, while the wounded soldiers

gathered more and more

About 200 people, subsequently chased after them, and finally dragged police officer Zhang Pingan, No. 870, away. At the same time, three off-duty police officers, No. 1108, No. 1074, and No. 1053, were passing by the wounded soldiers' hospital at Chaoyang Road on Meizhou Road and were also dragged into the hospital. When the police officers fled, the wounded soldiers fired many shots afterwards, fortunately without injuring anyone. Seeing that the wounded soldiers were chasing after them, the police officers hid in the Meizhou Road police station. When the wounded soldiers arrived, they threw stones, wooden sticks, bamboo poles, and hand grenades without gunpowder at the station, and smashed the police station's sign and glass doors and windows. Inspector Pan Zhaohong went out to dissuade them and was hit in the head twice with an iron bar. At the same time, Wang Xianglin, the director of the wounded soldiers' hospital, also tracked them down

but his suppression was ineffective

He was also injured in the hand by a weapon. In addition, Chen Zisheng, a student at the police training school, was passing by the place and was also hit in the head with an iron bar, causing serious injuries. A wallet containing 130,000 legal tender and a fountain pen was lost. In addition, the police station's team leader, Wang Lixing, who was passing by on duty, also lost a police hat, a gold ring, and a newly purchased Stalin watch in the chaos. At that time, police officer No. 855, Zeng, fired a shot, and a wounded soldier, Zhao Xingchang, was seriously injured. Chief Wang of the sub-bureau, upon receiving the report, urgently reported to the headquarters and requested that security police be dispatched in police vehicles. The garrison headquarters also dispatched special service companies and gendarmerie teams one after another, and the situation became tense for a while, and traffic was cut off. When the two sides confronted each other, the wounded soldiers fired more than ten shots, and the police also

returned fire with many shots

For a time, bullets flew everywhere. At that time, a man named Sun Caisheng (from Huzhou, living at No. 91 Changshou Road) was passing by the entrance of a sauce garden on Meizhou Road. He was shot in the chest and died on the spot. Another child, Wang Zengjia, nine years old, from Huai'an, was struck by a stray bullet that penetrated his right back and right waist, and was later sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Military police personnel did not withdraw their troops until 6 p.m. Subsequently, Team Leader Chen of the garrison headquarters, Company Commander Zhang of the gendarmerie team, and Chief Wang Xinheng of the sub-bureau, together with the wounded soldiers' officers, negotiated a settlement. First, the four detained police officers were released, and the injured were sent to the police hospital for treatment. By late at night, there was no news of the return of the firearms. Finally, the wounded soldiers' side also sent a representative to accompany the military police negotiators to the garrison headquarters to seek a reasonable solution. Afterwards, it was learned that the group of wounded soldiers had just been transferred from the Shandong front line to Shanghai for medical treatment. There were about 800 people, and they had an organization of guards, equipped with various weapons.

### Chinese Staff Captured on Wake Gunboat Request Compensation from US Navy Department

Chinese Staff Representatives Host Reporters

[Our Newspaper's Report] The U.S. gunboat Wake was docked on the Huangpu River during the Anti-Japanese War. On December 8, 1941, when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese Navy seized the ship, and all the American and Chinese personnel on board were captured by the Japanese invaders and imprisoned in the Zhabei Meteorological Observatory concentration camp. They were then transferred to the Jiangsu First Prison in Nanjing, where the captured Chinese personnel were forced to work as laborers. Several people were crippled due to brutal beatings by the enemy. Among them was Liu Baoxian, who, unwilling to live under the iron heel of the enemy, seized an opportunity to escape, but was unfortunately recaptured by the Japanese and imprisoned in another location, his fate unknown to this day. After the victory, the Wake gunboat was taken over by our country and renamed the "Taiyuan" warship. The American captain, Smith, is working at the Jianghai Customs, but there has been no news about the aftermath of the Chinese personnel. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of the Chinese staff of the warship hosted reporters.

Yesterday was a bi-weekly day when cinemas opened early shows, but the sudden power outage prevented the screenings. Some viewers questioned the situation, but the cinema authorities explained the reason and agreed to refund tickets, which calmed the situation. Elevators in major buildings also suddenly stopped in mid-air due to the power outage, leaving passengers temporarily unable to disembark. According to the engineering department of the power company, the power outage was caused by a worker accidentally touching the motor while refueling, which damaged the main line. A worker named Zhang Deyuan (27 years old, residing at No. 261, Lane 20, Wumeizhou Road) was injured in the left hand, right leg, and abdomen and was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the company.

### New Abbot of Jing'an Temple: Master Chi Song is a Scholar Who Remained Secluded During the Eight-Year War of Resistance, Plans to Do More Charity and Public Welfare in the Future

[Our Newspaper's Special Report] We went to Jing'an Temple to visit the first abbot of the converted Shifang Buddhist Temple, Master Chi Song (pictured), but he had not yet returned. Sitting in the abbot's reception room, Master Xu Xiang briefly told us about the new abbot's past history. He said that Master Chi Song is a scholar and an elder of Buddhism who had twice resolved to travel to Japan. During the eight-year War of Resistance, he had been living in seclusion in the Guandi Temple on Danshui Road in the city. Although the Japanese who knew him had repeatedly invited him to preside over Buddhist affairs in Shanghai, the old master had always remained reclusive and had not received a single Japanese guest during those eight years. This time, he was jointly recommended by various Buddhist protectors and lay Buddhists, as well as the monks and nuns of Jing'an Temple, as the first abbot of the Shifang Buddhist Temple. He humbly declined but was not allowed to, so he presented four regulations. After being supported by all parties, he took the seat and assumed office.

Two hours later, we met Master Chi Song, chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association, at the original location. He was not the white-haired, star-eyed figure we had imagined. He had a lean body, wore a light gray monk's robe, and had a pair of deep eyes behind his wide-rimmed glasses.

Talking About Disputes Over Temple Property

The old master spoke calmly, starting with the topic of Jing'an Temple. He said, "Since the early years of the Republic of China, Jing'an Temple has been plagued by endless disputes over temple property. In fact, Jing'an Temple is still in debt. Just at the end of last year, we barely made it through the year by borrowing money. Currently, there are over 100 monks in the temple. The income from Buddhist ceremonies and rent is barely enough to cover expenses." Speaking of Jing'an Temple's debt, he also talked about the history of disputes over temple property since the Republic of China, which led to the imprisonment of monks De Wu and Mi Jia after the victory.

According to the old master, Jing'an Temple currently owns 40 to 50 acres of land, including the temple grounds, the Jing'an Police Station, and the Jing'an Primary School. However, most of the land was leased to others in the early years of the Republic of China for long-term contracts of 30, 50, or 70 years, so many of the leases have not yet expired, and the rent was collected in full at the time. In addition, the road in front of the temple was originally not temple property. For the benefit of the local public, the price of the land was not collected from the Public Works Department at the beginning.

Originally a Desolate Village

As we were talking, the dismissal bell of Jing'an Primary School rang through the wall, and the sound of bells and the noise of people disturbed the tranquility of the abbot's room. Master Xu Xiang stepped forward to close the window for us, but the noise continued to enter the room. The old master then told us that Jing'an Temple was founded during the Three Kingdoms period in Eastern Wu and has a history of more than 1,700 years. Originally, it was a desolate village, and now, as we sit in the abbot's room, we can hear the voices of students from Jing'an Primary School and the sounds of bells and musical instruments from the temple, and we can even faintly hear the sound of horns from 1946-style American cars speeding along the asphalt road in front of the temple. But this was originally a desolate village!

Reorganized as a Shifang Buddhist Temple

If it had not prospered along with Shanghai's prosperity, this famous Buddhist temple in Southeast China could have avoided many disputes over temple property caused by fame and fortune. The ancient temple would not be located in a large city like today, and there would be no secular places like banks and dance halls next to it. Jing'an Temple might have appeared among small bridges, flowing water, bamboo groves, and dense forests. Within the tall red walls, the "monks" could have been much quieter, and Master Chi Song would not have had to say things like "Please do not burden me with trivial matters."

The reorganization of Jing'an Temple from a master-disciple ordination system to a Shifang Buddhist Temple that selects the worthy is undoubtedly a major transformation. Disputes over temple property may be eliminated as a result. The old master is a scholar and is currently reorganizing and reforming temple affairs, planning to reduce Buddhist ceremonies in the future and do more charity and public welfare, and to make contributions in culture. This would truly conform to the Buddhist tenets of saving the world and benefiting all beings.

### Tragedy of the Sinking of the Fubo Gunboat: List of Deceased Officers and Soldiers Announced, Navy Headquarters Actively Handling the Aftermath

[Our Newspaper's Report] The list of 130 officers and soldiers who died in the sinking of the Fubo gunboat near Xiamen was announced by Gao Rufeng, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy Headquarters, at a reception for reporters at the Navy Recreation Club yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. More than 30 family members of the deceased officers and soldiers registered in Shanghai, including Wang Ruiqing, were also present. Gao also issued a written statement, stating: The news of the Fubo warship disaster shocked the officers and soldiers, and Commander-in-Chief Gui expressed his condolences. They then took various necessary measures and proceeded in different ways. First, the Xiamen Naval Port Command and the Taiwan Base Command were ordered to dispatch the Xiamen warship and the Taiping warship to the waters where the accident occurred and the nearby islands to search and investigate, but the results were fruitless. After the Hai Min ship arrived in Shanghai on March 26, the department sent Section Chief Liang Tongyi to Shanghai to cooperate with relevant parties to conduct a preliminary investigation. Regarding the responsibility of the Haimin ship, since the only survivor of the Fubo warship was the marine engineer Jiao Dexiao, and he was a member of the engine room and was unclear about the navigation situation at the time, the only information available for research was the data provided by the Haimin ship. As for the rescue part, according to the passengers of the ship, they witnessed the situation at the time and said that the ship did not make efforts to rescue them, and that the Haimin ship failed to rescue those in need, which is a fact. The headquarters attaches great importance to the comfort of the family members and the handling of the aftermath and has successively sent personnel to both Beijing and Shanghai to individually comfort the bereaved families and has established a special agency at the headquarters to actively handle the aftermath. It is hoped that the families scattered in various places will send their addresses to the Personnel Office of the First Department of the Navy Headquarters in Nanjing for contact at any time. The list of deceased officers and soldiers is as follows:

Officers

Fourteen names: Mei Ren, Wang Anren, Zhu Chongxin, He Shien, Chen Guishan, Sun Fengbin, Jin Wensun, Zhang Guorun, Zhao Yuying, Xiao Zhiyuan, You Quanguan, Xu Linkui, Zhang Songqing, Zhang Yan.

Soldiers

Ninety-four names: Ma Changkui, Zhao Jusen, Liu Liangkui, You Qiyuan, Zhang Runhua, Chen Jiaozhang, Lin Shanchun, Li Guichun, Lin Tianbao, Su Qingchuan, Zhang Lianzhang, Shao Shunli, Pu Changzhi, Lin Yongfan, Wu Zengyuan, Chen Jinhai, Zhang Shengli, Wei Fagen, Dong Chengchang, Wang Changqin, Chen Jingui, Zheng Jixiang, Ren Shuangwang, Lin Xuexi, Zhao Yonglin, Zhao Jiaqing, Wang Daogan, Wang Yifang, Li Zhichao, Liu Yuntao, Chen Weijing, Sun Yishun, Hong Junyi, Zhou Zhengjun, Wang Yang, Shen Hangsheng, Chen Zhensheng, Lin Bixu, You Shuren, Zhao Shengming, Zheng Yizhao, Lin Zhiming, Ye Guomao, Zheng Quru, Huang Kezhi, Li Zhien, Li Yizhen, Guo Changrong, Zheng Wenfeng, Yu Jianxian, Wu Qingbo, Shen Ou, Yao Haoliang, Yin Zhixiong, Lu Mingyi, Jiang Songyou, Huang Qixing, Shu Huanmin, Lu Desen, Wu Peihua, Xu Baichuan, Wang Zixiang, Ao Qingyin, Wang Zixiu, Hu Fulin, Chen Yuexin, Shen Dehua, Wei Yunfang, Dong Chengyi, Chen Jinshan, Shen Wenbin, Yang Debao, Yang Qing, Ding Zhenggui, Zhang Kuinan, Dai Chengmiao, Li Chuqing, Yang Jichun, Yang Shihai, Chen Lanfeng, Guan Kang, Zhang Zude, Liu Chunhua, Luo Zifei, Chen Saicheng, Zheng Wenlong, Li Weisheng, Yao Xiaolin, Yang Zenghua, Liu Shentong, Chen Kai, Zhao Weifeng, Zhu Guangyi, Yu Ziping.

### Land Prices Increase a Thousandfold in Ten Years: New Standard Prices Assessed for Registered Land in Six Districts, Municipal Government to Announce Regularly

[Our Newspaper's Report] Before the war, the rate of increase in land prices in Shanghai was originally higher than that of general commodities, but after the War of Resistance, the rate of increase in general commodities was higher than that of land prices, which was the opposite. According to statistics, based on the retail prices of basic commodities in the city from January to June of the 26th year of the Republic of China, prices increased by a total of 6,082 times by December of the 35th year, a period of only ten years. However, during the same period, land prices in the Chinese and Western districts of Huangpu District only increased by 1,275 times, an average annual increase of 140 times. In the past, during the era of booming new construction and the strongest demand for land, the average annual increase was only a few times, and even in the most special locations, the average annual increase was only more than ten times. Now, the annual increase is more than a hundred times, which is not due to the increase in land prices but to the devaluation of currency. Therefore, this kind of increase is an abnormal phenomenon.

After the victory, the city had a committee for evaluating standard land prices. Recently, due to the sharp rise in prices after the gold dollar storm, a meeting was held a few days ago to assess the latest standard land prices for the land in the six districts of Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Fahua, Yinxiang, and Caojing that have completed land registration, based on their district segments and grades.

Huangpu District

Divided into 26 grades for A, 20 grades for B, 22 grades for C, 23 grades for D, and 16 grades for E. Among them, Grade A-1 is the corner land on Nanjing Road Bund, with an average land price of 550 million yuan per mu. Grade E-16 is the area north of Guiyang Road and Pingliang Road that is not along the road, with an average land price of 4.5 million yuan per mu.

Hunan District:

Divided into 30 grades for A, 30 grades for B, 20 grades for C, and 15 grades for D. Among them, Grade A-1 is the land along the shop front in the 16th Pudong area, with an average price of 120 million yuan per mu. Grade D-15 is the area west of Longhua Port and Dongmiao Bridge Road, with an average price of 1.2 million yuan per mu.

Zhabei District:

Divided into 20 grades for A, 21 grades for B, 21 grades for C, and 20 grades for D. Among them, Grade A-1 is the area around North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, with an average price of 90 million yuan per mu. Grade D-20 is the area on the northeast section of Song Park Road and the western area of Pusan Road on the south section of Danjin Port, with an average price of 1 million yuan per mu.

Fahua District:

Divided into 19 grades for A, 22 grades for B, 18 grades for C, and 24 grades for D. Among them, Grade A-1 is the land at the corner of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road, with an average price of 50 million yuan per mu. Grade D-24 is the area west of the Xinpu Huitang North Railway, with an average price of 750,000 yuan per mu.

Yinxiang District:

Divided into 8 grades for A, 10 grades for B, 20 grades for C, and 4 grades for D. Grade A-1 is the corner of Qimei Road and Diswei Road, along the corners of Diswei Road, Tiantong Road, and Tongjia Road, with an average price of 22 million yuan per mu. Grade D-4 is the area around Lijia Gou and Xijia Bang, with an average price of 850,000 yuan per mu.

Caojing District:

Divided into 3 grades for A, 5 grades for B, and 3 grades for C. Among them, Grade A-1 is Panjiazhai and Caohejing Town in Longhua Town, with an average price of 3 million yuan per mu. Grade C-6 is farmland in Xujiazhai and other areas north of Xin Jinggang, with an average price of 600,000 yuan per mu. The detailed land prices for each district segment will be announced regularly by the municipal government.

List (Dist) said: "There is no more definitive standard for measuring the progress and decline of national welfare than the rise and fall of land value." By comparing the land price of 550 million yuan per mu with the land price of 600,000 yuan per mu, we can get a glimpse of which area is the most prosperous in Shanghai today.

China is suffering an unfortunate encounter today, and the people are suffering. We must promote new life through morality.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Queries

Chen Liang asks: Mr. A has two rooms and before renting them to Mr. B, it was agreed that Mr. B must vacate them when Mr. A's eldest son gets married, therefore Mr. A did not accept any gratuities. Last year, Mr. A's eldest son got married and Mr. A wants Mr. B to move out immediately, but Mr. B is deliberately delaying. After Mr. A's son's marriage, they are cramped in a small room. Questions: (1) Is it possible to order him to move out within a certain period, given that no rent has been collected for over two years? (2) Is it possible to take back one of the two rooms first? (3) Now that Mr. A's second son is also getting married, what legal measures should be taken if Mr. B still refuses to move?

[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Pingfan] Whether there was a special agreement when A rented the two rooms to B, stipulating that B must move out when A's eldest son gets married, should be based on evidence. This special agreement is a reason for reclaiming the property for self-use. According to the law, one can request the termination of the lease and the return of the property based on reclaiming for self-use. A's failure to collect rent from B is not a reason to terminate the lease. Whether to reclaim one room or all rooms usually depends on the actual need. A can file a lawsuit with the court.

### Radium Institute Plans to Be Transformed into Atomic Energy Institute: Li Shuhua Talks to Reporters After Returning to Peiping from Nanking

[Our Peiping Correspondent, 6th] Li Shuhua, Director of the Peiping Research Institute, returned to Peiping from Nanking via Tianjin yesterday. Today, he told reporters: (1) On this trip to Nanking, he negotiated with the Ministry of Education for an increase in funding. The Ministry of Education has approved an additional temporary allocation of 400 million yuan for expansion and improvement of buildings. However, this amount is only equivalent to just over 30,000 yuan before the war, which is still insufficient. (2) Regarding the number of staff positions in the institute, according to the organizational regulations, there should be more than 210 people. After the victory and restoration, the Ministry of Education only temporarily granted 109 positions. This trip to Nanking to negotiate for more positions has not yet yielded any results. (3) The Institute of Materia Medica and the Radium Institute of our institute are still in Shanghai and there are currently no plans to move them to Peiping. Because these two institutes did not suffer war damage, they have now been restored to their pre-war state. However, the Radium Institute is currently planning to apply for funding to upgrade instruments and equipment in preparation for its transformation into an Atomic Energy Institute.

Although there was inevitably some regression during the war, if funding continues for further study, the original level can be restored in five years. In ten years, it will certainly be more advanced than before the war.

### In Respectful Response to Mr. Deng Gongsan Regarding National Standard Textbooks (Concluded)

— Lu Dianyang

Ancient England was conquered successively by the Anglo-Saxons, the Danes, and the Normans, and William the Conqueror even became the ruler of England. During the invasion of foreign tribes, there was inevitable trampling, but in English history, these events are invariably acknowledged. The narrative is straightforward and does not regard the Celtic Britons as "Xia" while regarding the Normans and Danes as "barbarians," nor does it consider this to be England's "greatest humiliation." The current English people have integrated with the various invading tribes to become a great nation. Since our country has combined the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, and Miao peoples into a great Chinese nation, when writing history, we should only acknowledge the Yuan and Qing dynasties, record the facts, and avoid praise and criticism. We should also emphasize the cultural exchange and emotional harmony between the various ethnic groups from a positive perspective to promote the inward cohesion of the border ethnic groups. Nationally compiled textbooks must be provided for young people of all ethnic groups across the country. Middle school students in the nine northeastern provinces, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang all read this book. If we follow Mr. Deng's opinion and focus on the Han people, what would the border youth think when they read it? Therefore, the content of the nationally compiled junior high school history textbooks may have areas for improvement in the details, but the general principles and prerequisites seem to be in order and are superior to past history textbooks. As for the fifth clause of the book's editorial guidelines, which refers to "relying on traditional historical concepts," it refers to the legends of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang in ancient times. Therefore, the following sentence immediately follows: "Materials from recent archaeological discoveries that are sufficient to promote the culture of our ancestors should also be adopted as appropriate." After all, historical education is different from historical research. Historical researchers may deny the existence of the Yellow Emperor and others, but historical teachers must still acknowledge ancient legends before the unearthed materials can be connected into a system, in order to show the achievements of our ancestors in creating culture.

The second point in Mr. Deng's article with which I cannot agree is his criticism of the "Dam Construction" lesson in high elementary school Chinese. "Dam construction" is dike, which can also be called a sluice, and it is an important project in water conservancy engineering. Recently, newspapers and books have been praising America's TVA, considering it President Roosevelt's greatest contribution to the American people. The so-called TVA is the Tennessee Valley Authority. Our country also has plans for a Yangtze Valley Authority, planning for large-scale dam construction near Yichang. Dr. Savage, who was hired to inspect the Yellow River, also advocated setting up sluices and building dams to control the water flow. The reason why Sichuan has become the "Land of Abundance" is due to the Dujiangyan irrigation system in Guanxian, in addition to natural causes. Dujiangyan is our country's old-fashioned dam construction, which only benefits irrigation, and the Chengdu Plain has been able to feed itself thanks to it. There are many other examples, which cannot be listed exhaustively. Dam construction regulates water flow, which can prevent flooding, benefit navigation, provide irrigation, and generate electricity (hydropower does not require coal, which is the most economical, and the electricity generation is very large). Agriculture, industry, and commerce all benefit from it, so it is not an exaggeration to say that it is the most beneficial project for mankind, and it is also appropriate to say that it is the main driving force of modern civilization. Our country's literati really lack knowledge of scientific engineering, so the teaching materials on economic construction in high elementary school Chinese textbooks have been specially increased, hoping that the next generation of citizens will not make fools of themselves in their speeches, and the future construction of the country will need thousands of future water conservancy engineering experts.

In short, the nationally compiled primary and secondary school textbooks were hastily compiled by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau during the War of Resistance, under difficult circumstances in the rear, with both manpower and material resources being limited, in order to meet the urgent need and alleviate the shortage of books. After the publication of the provisional editions, we did not presume to be confident, and we repeatedly convened expert review meetings to revise each lesson and sent them to normal colleges and national normal schools in the rear to solicit opinions. At that time, experts and education scholars in various subjects near Chongqing either accepted invitations to come to the bureau, or attended meetings to provide advice, or sent letters for consultation, and they all helped sincerely. Mr. Deng Gongsan was also one of the scholars who officially accepted an invitation to the bureau in the summer of the 34th year of the Republic to revise the textbooks. Mr. Deng revised the six volumes of junior high school history, originally scheduled to be completed during the summer vacation, but was extended to the end of November before it was completed. In the meantime, it lasted five months. Except for the sixth volume of foreign history, which he said he had not studied in depth and did not undertake to revise, for the remaining five volumes, three volumes were revised on the basis of the published provisional editions, and the fourth and fifth volumes were revised on the basis of the original manuscripts. The provisional editions sent to Mr. Deng for revision had already undergone a lot of revisions, such as the section on Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying scholars mentioned above. After Mr. Deng's revision, they were revised by others, and then the corrections were compiled and sent to the Seven United Office for typesetting. The names of all experts or scholars who have revised the nationally compiled textbooks are listed on the copyright page to show respect and express gratitude. "Deng Guangming," which is Mr. Deng Gongsan, is printed under the name of the reviser on the copyright page of the fourth and fifth volumes of the Shanghai edition of junior high school history. I am deeply grateful to Mr. Deng for his support and willingness to revise the textbooks and share the literary responsibility with us. We often encouraged each other in our discussions on how to improve the teaching materials. Now, the revised edition of junior high school history will be published soon, and Mr. Deng's revisions can be seen by the world. Since many parties have written to inquire about this matter, I have briefly described it to inform the gentlemen who care about primary and secondary school teaching materials.

### Eastern China's Three Goals Settle Tianshan Mountain, Western Alliance Suffers Total Annihilation, 20,000 Fans at Recreation Park Roar with Joy

[Report from Our Newspaper] The spring sunshine is bright and the breeze is gentle. The ever-victorious Eastern China team and the Western Alliance team held a football charity match at Recreation Park on [a recent] day. The audience flocked in, totaling about 20,000 people. The field was packed, and the rooftops on the south side were filled with fans, marking the first grand occasion of the year. The ticket revenue was used to fund sports facility construction in the Nanshi area. Before the match, the Western Alliance team captain presented flowers to Eastern China. Then, City Government Secretary-General He Dekui represented the Mayor to kick off the ball, and the fierce battle began. As a result, Eastern China scored three goals to settle the Tianshan Mountain, and the Western Alliance suffered total annihilation. In the first half, Dai Linjing and Han Longhai each scored a goal, giving Eastern China a 2-0 lead. In the second half, the Western Alliance launched a fierce counterattack, and the situation became tense for a time. Fortunately, Eastern China fought hard to maintain their lead. Finally, Sun Jinshun scored the third goal, securing the victory. 20,000 fans roared with joy.

Adai Scores, Opens the Record

At precisely 3:00 PM, referee Chen Jixiang, linesmen Wu Shouheng and He Chunhui, the two armies lined up. The Western Alliance presented flowers to pay respect to Eastern China. Then, City Secretary He kicked off the ball, and the fierce battle began. The Western Alliance attacked, with "Little Yellow Hair" attempting a solo raid, but was blocked by Longbo. Eastern China counterattacked, with Jinshun threading the needle, Linjing attempting a shot, McNitty parrying it out, and Li Yao's hook shot going slightly wide. After ten minutes, the Western Alliance launched a large-scale attack, with five forwards rushing in together. Novogolov crossed the ball, and Edward shot fiercely from 20 yards out. The ball was swift and dangerous, but Banglun was agile and saved the dangerous ball. Eastern China took the opportunity to rise again, with Adai stepping into the formation and penetrating deep into enemy territory. By the time Mania caught up, the ball had already entered the net. 1-0, Eastern China opened the record.

Amidst the Sound of Firecrackers, Eastern China Wins Again

Only thirteen minutes into the game, Eastern China gained momentum after scoring, and Youliang and Li Yao flanked from both wings, overwhelming McNitty. Later, the Western Alliance once gained a corner kick opportunity, but fortunately, Lingen cleared the ball with a long kick. In the melee, five minutes before the end of the first half, Lao Sun received assistance from Lingen and passed it to Linjing, who passed it to Longhai, who shot it into the net from ten yards away. 2-0, Eastern China scored another victory. The sound of firecrackers from the sidelines was deafening. Before long, the first half ended.

Western Alliance Counterattacks, Futile Efforts

Changing sides and fighting again, Eastern China made no changes, while Vaughn came on for the Western Alliance, and Copsding retired. After contact, the Western Alliance launched a large-scale counterattack, attempting to retaliate. Vaughn repeatedly used his breakthroughs, but without success. Novogolov continued his efforts, but unfortunately Banglun blocked high and low, making the goal impenetrable. "Little Yellow Hair" was nailed by Longbo and was also powerless. By the eighth minute, Youliang and Longhai were exceptionally active, repeatedly attacking the Western Alliance. McNitty performed brilliantly, and veteran Dai came to knock on the door himself, but still failed to open it. The Western Alliance had a turn for the better, and the situation became urgent again. Alarms were repeatedly sent from Eastern China's hinterland. However, at the last moment, they were able to turn danger into safety and protect their territory.

Lao Sun's Iron Leg, Breaks Through Three Barriers

At the seventeenth minute, Lao Sun took advantage of a gap and launched a cold arrow, McNitty missed, and the ball hit the target again. 3-0, Eastern China's good news spread for the third time. After this, the Western Alliance still tried to bet everything on one throw, but their eagerness to win led to more mistakes. Longhai launched a sneak attack, and McNitty left his post without permission. Just when things were critical, Mania arrived and was able to save the situation. By the 38th minute, Longhai left the field with a leg injury, and Chen Mingzhe replaced him. Although the battle was tense, neither side made any gains. By the time the allotted time was up, Eastern China defeated the Western Alliance 3-0, maintaining their reputation as perennial victors.

### Hong Kong Governor's Cup Soccer Final Ends in Another Draw

China United Team Experiences Joy and Disappointment

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong] The situation for the six major soccer championships in Hong Kong this season has largely been determined. The Stanley Shield seven-a-side tournament was won by Sing Tao early on, and the league championship also belongs to Sing Tao. Unfortunately, the "Memorial Cup" was won by the Army. The remaining "Governor's Cup," "Special Silver Plate," and "International Cup" also have scheduled final battles. The "Governor's Cup" was contested by the General Association and the Association on the 30th. The Sing Tao and South China teams will play the final of the Special Silver Plate on April 5th (Saturday). Recall that in the first battle of the Governor's Cup (February 9th), the two sides drew 4-4. The rematch today saw an unprecedented grand occasion at Jia Shan. On this day, the Western Alliance played with its original lineup, while China United made slight changes due to Qiu Ting's absence and Zhao Rong's foot injury. Jing Xiang supervised the team with an injury. The lineups are as follows:

(China United Team) Association

Yu Yaosui (Sing Tao)

Xie Jinhong (South China), Hou Rongsheng (Sing Tao)

Feng Kunshing (Sing Tao), Xu Jincheng (Sing Tao), Liu Songsheng (Sing Tao)

Anderson (Air Force), Chen Li (St. Joseph's), Sege (Artillery)

Ford (42nd Battalion), Wu Lun (Hong Kong Club), Ihus (Navy), Sullivan (Wireless), Little Gao Shannu (St. Joseph's) Captain

Each Side Ties Once

At 3:30 PM, referee Ye Jiugao gave the order, and the two sides made contact. "Magic Leg" Jingxiang dribbled the ball to attack, and the ball was in a melee in the Western Alliance's hinterland. After four minutes, Shijin got a chance to cross the ball, and Wenzhi responded in time, kicking the ball from 15 yards out and into the net at the left corner. China United took the lead.

After seven minutes, the Western Alliance advanced, and Jinhong was careless, allowing Gao Shannu to pass the ball in. Wu Lun rushed forward and shot quickly. By the time Yaode tried to save, the ball had already flown into the net, and the score was tied for the first time. China United, seeing this and feeling ambitious, tried to attack quickly, but Jingxiang's clever pass to Shijin, and "raw chicken boy" leaping forward, and shooting fiercely, was pushed out by Powell, diving to the ground, a good save.

After this, China United firmly grasped the offensive for the whole game. At 32 minutes, Shijin shot and hit the post, and Yongqiang headed the ball again, but it went over the crossbar, causing sighs to rise from the west. Before long, Songsheng launched a long-range powerful shot, but it missed again. At the last opportunity, Wenzhi shot fiercely from about ten yards away, but it was also saved by Powell. Thus, the first half ended in a draw.

Each Side Scores Twice

After the break, the Western Alliance launched a lightning attack. Gao Shannu lightly lifted the ball in front of the goal, but Liangde missed. Ihus took advantage of the air to head the ball. The ball fell in front of the goal, and Ford poked it in, and the Western Alliance took the lead.

Before long, the Western Alliance came back strong. Ford advanced quickly and crossed the ball. Ihus arrived with the ball and was sure to score, but Yaode took the risk of diving down and pushing the ball out, fortunately not failing.

At this time, China United's Jinhong, Wenzhi, and Shijin were injured in succession, while the Western Alliance's momentum was strong. China United's situation was dangerous, and everyone thought that it was sure to lose. After 30 minutes, the ball was kicked out and replaced with a new one. Jingxiang also switched positions with Yongqiang, and sure enough, the situation turned for the better.

At 36 minutes, "Magic Leg" got the ball and advanced, passing the ball out with a kick. The landing point was excellent. Yongqiang rushed in with the ball, knocked on the door fiercely, and the score was tied again, 2-2.

Each Side Scores Three Times at the End of the Game

In less than two minutes, Jingxiang, Wenzhi, and Shijin attacked together. Jingxiang lifted the ball to Wenzhi from a distance, and Wenzhi kicked it, but Powell rushed out to intercept it. Unexpectedly, Yongqiang flashed in and headed the ball into the net while lying on the ground. 3-2, the domestic fans cheered and shook Jia Shan. It seemed that the championship was secure, but who knew that in the last minute, Ford advanced straight from the border, bent at the baseline, and Ihus headed the ball in front of the goal. 3-3, the end of the game was a draw again. Who will win the cup? Wait for the third battle!

In this game, China United can be said to have avoided defeat when it should have lost, and failed to win when it should have won. It was truly a moment of joy and disappointment!

### American Woolen Manufacturer Keen to Have Constant Supply of Chinese Wool, How to Transport Stored Wool to Seaports is the Decisive Question

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the survey report of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team; in the development of China's wool industry, attention should be paid to the trade channels. The most important thing to restore China's dry wool export trade is to first investigate the existing wool reserves in various parts of the country, where they are stored, and how to find ways to transport them to the seaports. The key is to get the stored wool to the ports, so that normal trade can begin. American wool manufacturers are eagerly awaiting a constant supply of Chinese wool under the condition that it can compete with the price of carpet wool produced in other countries. American wool manufacturers are very fond of the advantages of Chinese wool. If the selling price is not too high compared to the wool prices of other countries, they are happy to purchase it. Wool, like other export commodities, must have a constant and continuous source to meet the needs of manufacturers. Nowadays, artificial wool has emerged, adding another strong enemy to carpet wool. However, the durability and applicability of artificial wool may not be as good as natural wool. Therefore, if high-quality, standard-compliant natural wool can be supplied regularly and in quantity, American manufacturers are still willing to buy it. The trade route for Chinese wool is long and difficult, which is expected in a country with transportation difficulties.

Investigation of Wool Reserves

According to the survey, the current reserves of wool, goat cashmere, and camel hair in China (excluding those produced in 1946 and those stored in the hands of small wool merchants and herders) are: 23 million pounds of wool, 750,000 pounds of goat cashmere, and 2.25 million pounds of camel hair.

In addition, according to the survey, the amount of wool available for exchange for goods in Qinghai and Ningxia provinces is: (The prices listed below are the market prices in September 1946.) Qinghai sheep wool: 11,800,000 pounds, priced at 551 yuan per pound in national currency, with a total value of 5,501,800,000 yuan. Ningxia spring wool: 2,750,000 pounds, priced at 910 yuan per pound, with a total value of 2,520,500,000 yuan. Ningxia autumn wool: 660,000 pounds, priced at 1,092 yuan per pound, with a total value of 783,200,200,000 yuan. Ningxia goat cashmere: 550,000 pounds, priced at 1,424 yuan per pound, with a total value of 5,260,000,000 yuan. Ningxia camel hair: 1,650,000 pounds, priced at 3,200 yuan per pound, with a total value of 9,286,420,000 yuan. The total amount of various wools is 5,610,000 pounds.

### Ministry of Finance May Approve Bond Issuance Procedures Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Supervisory Committee for the 36th Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds Fund will hold its inaugural meeting at noon on the 8th in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank. Minister of Finance Yu will personally preside over the meeting and is scheduled to come to Shanghai on tonight's military flight. As for the technical issues regarding bond issuance, Director Chen Bingzhang of the Public Debt Department has also discussed concrete solutions with the National Bank and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for approval. It is expected that a response will be received today (the 6th) to allow the underwriting banks and firms to follow and implement it.

### Use of Production Loans Not Entirely Satisfactory

[Report from Our Newspaper] The work of the Production Loan Inspection Team has largely been completed, and the materials obtained are currently being compiled and summarized. It is reported that Governor Zhang of the National Bank has also requested information from the team for research as a reference for future lending. Regarding the use of loans by various factories, there are several aspects that are worth improving. One is that some factories, after obtaining large loans, do not need to use all of them themselves, but lend a portion to other factories at high interest. Another is that some factories use production loans to repay [previous] debts instead of purchasing raw materials as agreed upon in the contract. There are many other aspects worth improving. In the future, the inspection team will submit concrete suggestions to the United Four Banks as a reference for future business.

### Raw Materials Expensive, Sales Stagnant, Silk Weaving Industry in Difficult Situation

According to sources in the silk weaving industry: The current situation of the industry is precarious, bordering on a state of sales stagnation. Spring is originally the peak sales season for silk products, but since the beginning of this year, sales have not improved much. Moreover, raw materials are currently expensive, and costs are too high. If weaving or patterned goods can be maintained, weaving mass-market goods will inevitably lead to losses. However, there is no guarantee for the sales of either. At present, the industry is maintaining its original production for two reasons: one is to keep the machinery productive and avoid decay, and the other is that it is difficult to dismiss workers. However, this situation is unlikely to last. It is also said that the jointly formed silk weaving production and sales joint venture company is also in the same predicament. The export silk produced by the company has currently reached more than 8,000 bolts, all of which are available for export. Its products were originally targeted at India, but it has not been possible to develop this market to date. The main reason is that since the foreign exchange adjustment last month, Indian merchants have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, making it even more difficult for our silk weaving industry to be optimistic.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Asks China Trust Bureau to Continue Purchasing Export Goods

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received requests from various related parties to purchase export goods such as tea, wool, musk, and furs and medicinal materials from North China. In order to reverse the economic crisis in North China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that the main reasons why it was previously impossible to promote the export of goods from various regions were that prices and freight rates were too high and the foreign exchange rate was too low. Now that the foreign exchange rate has been raised not long ago, it may be easier to promote transportation and export. The Rehabilitation Company, which was previously responsible for purchasing export goods, has had its business taken over by the Central Trust Bureau. Therefore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has specifically written to the China Trust Bureau, requesting it to continue to handle the purchase and transportation together to assist in the recovery of the rural economy. It is reported that the China Trust Bureau has suggested lowering prices in the producing areas, and the United Four Banks have ordered the local provincial banks to handle the remittance of funds to Chongqing or Shanghai to facilitate merchants' operation and transportation. If it proceeds smoothly and the prices in the producing areas are appropriate, the China Trust Bureau will pay close attention to the foreign market prices and buyers at any time, and purchase as much as possible in Chongqing, Shanghai, or other important ports, and actively find ways to transport and sell them abroad. It is now reported that the Ministry of Finance has already instructed the relevant local banks to actively handle the remittance of funds for the export goods in question, taking into account the actual situation.

### China Sericulture Transformation and Development Still Under State Guidance

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to comply with the provisions of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the China Sericulture Company plans to evaluate the value of its factories and issue shares in stages, so that they can gradually be transformed into private enterprises. Detailed measures are being drafted. According to relevant sources, the supervisory business of China Sericulture will still be retained, and the expenses will be borne by the state. The enterprise part will be sold to the private sector. The company currently has a total of seven factories, and its assets are estimated to be worth about 30 billion yuan. There are currently more than 10,000 employees, and a research institution will be established soon. In addition, the proposal submitted by the China Sericulture Company three weeks ago has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for a long time, but has not yet received approval due to the imminent government reorganization. If the purchase price of silkworms this year can take into account the cost of farmers, it is expected that the number of silkworms can reach 70,000 dan, of which 30,000 dan can be used for export.

### Prices of Domestically Produced Cloth and Cotton Textiles Decline in Singapore

[Singapore News] The black market prices of cloth here are falling day by day. Cloth retailers in the Jalan Besar area have begun to sell Chinese cloth at low prices. Poplin is six cents per yard, and other domestic cloth is up to eight cents per yard. However, because there is less printed cloth, it has not yet been sold off. This batch of goods was shipped from Hong Kong, and the wholesale price is 14 yuan per piece of 28 yards, which is the lowest price in the city. Recently, because 12 million yards of Japanese cloth are about to arrive, the owners are eager to sell, and the price is 100% lower than last month. However, the prices of Italian cloth and British printed cloth have not fallen, and are still standing at about 2.5 yuan per yard. The prices of white twill and black cloth are higher than the official prices, about 2 cents per yard.

It is also reported that the government has formally announced that cotton textiles are allowed to be exported. Before cloth is exported to areas outside Malaya, exporters can apply to the government for an export permit. Previously, the authorities stipulated that each importer of cloth imported from Hong Kong could ship 25% of the imported quantity to the Gu District outside Malaya. Currently, the best-selling areas for cloth are Java, Borneo, and Sumatra. Due to the impact of Dutch ships, this road is quite stagnant. (According to the political agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia, the two sides signed a contract on March 25th in Jakarta, and trade between Singapore and the Dutch East Indies should be active.)

### Export Price of Mexican Gold Coins Reduced

[Reuters, New York, 5th] According to reliable sources: From April 7th, the Bank of Mexico will reduce the export price of gold coins from $50.50 to about $49 per 50 pesos.

### Soybean Quantity Needed for Oil Extraction to Be Increased Again

[Report from our newspaper] According to Deputy Director Shen of the China Trust Bureau, Mayor Wu has consulted with President Zhang of the National Bank, hoping that the China Trust Bureau can regularly supply oil factories in the city with affordable soybeans to stabilize the market price of cooking oil. President Zhang has now telegraphed the Northeast to allocate another six thousand tons from the soybeans being purchased, to be shipped to Shanghai immediately. Together with the four thousand tons that have already arrived, there will be a reserve of ten thousand tons. As for whether the allocation will be regular or temporary, as well as the price and quantity at the time of distribution, these are currently under study, and a detailed plan will be announced within a day or two.

### Overview of Tea Production and Sales in Fujian

As one of the six major tea-producing provinces in China, Fujian tea ranks first in the province's export trade. The tea-producing area in Fujian extends over more than 20 counties, covering an area of more than 500,000 acres, with more than 300,000 tea farmers and workers. Before the war, the annual output was more than 300,000 dan, and at its peak, it exceeded 400,000 dan. In the early days of the War of Resistance, the government encouraged increased production, and the output remained at 220,000 dan. After the start of the Pacific War, export sales plummeted, and domestic sales also became sluggish. From 1938 to 1945, the average annual output was only more than 40,000 dan. The speed of its decline is lamentable. According to statistics, last year's output was only 39,560 dan, which is equivalent to one-fifth of that of 1937. Fuzhou's total annual exports were only worth more than 9 billion 60 million, but it still ranks first in exports. Because of Fujian tea's unique climate and soil, and excellent varieties, in the past, exports were mainly black tea. For example, Fuding black tea and "Bai Hao Monkey" from eastern Fujian are especially favored by the American and London markets. Wuyi's famous "Shui Xian" also had the reputation of "Tea King" among foreigners, and its "Da Hong Pao" and "Bai Ji Guan" are even more popular delicacies. In the future, if sufficient loans are obtained to reduce costs and improve production technology, it should not be difficult to restore its glorious historical status.

### Postal Savings and Remittance Bureaus in Various Locations Adjust Operations; Zhengzhou Office Upgraded to Branch Bureau

[Report from our newspaper] Since Mr. Gu Chunfan took over as the director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, he has spared no effort in rectifying the bureau's administrative facilities and employee discipline. In addition to finding ways to closely liaise with post offices to jointly seek the expansion of postal savings and remittance business, he has also carefully reviewed the business conditions of branch offices in various locations and adjusted them accordingly. It is now known that the Zhengzhou office of the bureau has a fairly developed business and will be upgraded to a savings and remittance branch in the near future. At the same time, the business of Shantou, Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Hengyang, Kaifeng, Luzhou and other branch offices is relatively逊色, and they have been demoted to offices to suit actual needs. In addition, more than a dozen branch offices and offices in Taishan, Meizhou, Shaoguan, etc., will be abolished. All savings and remittance business originally handled by these bureaus and offices will be transferred to local post offices for handling, in order to reduce expenses. After the adjustment in the future, there will be no hindrance to the needs of the local people.

Post Office Entrusted to Act as Treasury Agent

[Report from our newspaper] According to the Public Treasury Law, the State Treasury affairs should be handled by the Central Bank. However, because the Central Bank's postal network is widespread, most localities have entrusted post offices to act as State Treasury sub-branches. Since its implementation in November 1943, post offices currently have 845 State Treasury agencies, distributed in 21 postal districts, accounting for one-half of the total number of agency treasury agencies of various banks and bureaus in the country. This has made a great contribution to assisting the state in promoting treasury administration and facilitating people's payment of taxes. Recently, due to the frequent receipts and expenditures of the national treasury, in order to meet the needs of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, the post office intends to use its widely established agency treasury agencies. All locations with post offices but no State Treasury agencies are planning to be entrusted with agency treasury duties in order to achieve the goal of comprehensive agency treasury and complete a sound public treasury network.

In addition, since the implementation of the measures for depositing and remitting public funds of military and government agencies, the transfer and remittance of treasury funds by various agencies has been frequent and the amounts are large. The remittance capacity of the local agency treasury post offices was originally limited, which caused some difficulties in transferring treasury funds. Now, in order to facilitate the transfer and remittance of treasury funds by various agencies, the remittance capacity of each agency treasury post office has been increased as much as possible, and the original quota has been completely cancelled. In the future, if agencies transfer funds to local agency treasury post offices for account opening and expenditure, after this improvement, it will be greatly facilitated.

Preparatory Meeting of the Savings and Remittance Union

[Another Dispatch] The first preparatory meeting of the Savings and Remittance Union of the National Postal Workers' General Union was held at 9:00 a.m. on April 6 in the conference room of the union on Jiujiang Road, Shanghai. After reporting the significance of the meeting, more than ten proposals were discussed, and it was decided to convene the first National Congress in Shanghai in July of this year.

### Existing Inventory Available, No Problems in the Paper Market for the Time Being

(Report from our newspaper) Yesterday, this reporter interviewed several publishers and paper merchants in the city about the current situation of the paper market after the restriction on paper imports. To sum up, due to the fact that domestic transportation has not returned to normal, it is difficult for publications to be sold in other places. At the same time, due to the widespread phenomenon of [omission], the current demand for paper, each company still has inventory to supply. In terms of sources, foreign merchants are willing to supply and sell, but due to restrictions, except for the number of quotas stipulated by the government, very few private goods are imported. The reason why the current paper market can remain stable is that each company relies on a small amount of existing inventory to supply. If the existing inventory is used up one day, the allocated paper will be limited, and the quality of domestic paper cannot be supplied continuously, then the severity of the paper shortage and the fluctuation of the paper market can be imagined.

### U.S. Oil Production

[Reuters, New York, 5th] For the week ending March 29, U.S. oil production averaged 4,865,000 barrels per day, compared to an average daily production of 4,862,000 barrels in the previous week, and an average daily production of 4,424,000 barrels in the same period in 1946.

### Dried Lily Bulbs Arrive

The price of dried lily bulbs had risen by 20-30% previously due to scarcity. Now, dozens of packages of goods have arrived, and it is said that they have been released, with a small drop of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. However, merchants are receiving cash, the cost is relatively high, and they are unwilling to sell cheaply for the time being.

### Timber Market Conditions

Lauan plywood continues to weaken, fir wood is still hovering around 50-60 yuan, and foreign pine is also trending downstream.

### New Ways for Overseas Chinese Remittances from Java

[Singapore News] Merchants in Singapore and Java have recently been operating trade by transferring national currency. That is, the affiliated companies in Java handle the national currency remittance procedures, and then exchange the remitted funds for goods [omission], sell them through commercial channels, convert them into dollars, and remit them back to the country. This method indirectly connects overseas remittances when Sino-Dutch foreign exchange is blocked, which is beneficial to both public and private sectors.

Currently, the rate of national currency remittance by merchants is 4 Singapore dollars for 10,000 national currency, which is the exchange rate for remittances in Java. Then, the black market price of Singapore dollars against Nicaraguan cordobas is the standard for the local private remittance rate (currently, most private remittances in the area are 10,000 national currency, charging more than 20 Nicaraguan cordobas). From this, about 2 Singapore dollars can be obtained for every 10,000 national currency. It is said that there are already five companies operating this business. (According to the agreement signed in The Hague, trade control will be opened soon, and the Nicaraguan cordoba in Hong Kong has suddenly risen, and trade between Singapore and the Netherlands will be active, and the cloth market in Singapore and Hong Kong will also be energetic. The prosperity of this new way of overseas remittances may not last long.)

### Quantity of Indian Raw Cotton Exported up to the End of February This Year; Quota of 800,000 Bales between May and August

[Reuters, Bombay, 5th] Minister of Commerce Chindleyka recently replied to questions in the Central Parliament stating that the quantity of raw cotton approved for export as of the end of February 1947 is as follows:

[Reuters, New Delhi, 5th] The cotton allocation quota for the period from May to August 1947 has been determined to be 800,000 bales, and the distribution ratio is as follows: 300,000 bales for various short fibers, 250,000 bales for various medium fibers, and 250,000 bales for various long fibers.

### Japan Under Control

— Chen Xunyu

Introduction

It has been a year and a half since the United Nations accepted Japan's surrender on September 2, 1945. Due to the lack of systematic news reports on the situation of Japan under control, people in the country have not gained a thorough impression. General MacArthur of the Allied Headquarters invited our country's reporters to visit in February of this year. After several rounds of negotiations, the Chinese Reporter Group to Japan, composed of ten reporters from major newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places, flew east on February 26. In addition to visiting Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Hiroshima and other cities, they flew to Seoul, Korea on March 11, and returned to Tokyo on March 13. They returned to China on the 15th. The journey was thousands of miles, lasting 18 days, and the scope of the visit was quite extensive. The information obtained on Japan's military, political, financial, economic, cultural, educational, and wartime destruction under Allied control was abundant, and the impression was particularly deep. This reporter returned from Japan and specially wrote a series of articles on what he saw and heard, for the reference of those who are concerned about the Japanese issue.

Allied Policy and Organization

According to the Potsdam Declaration, there are two supreme guiding principles for the Allied management of Japan: (1) Negatively, to ensure that Japan no longer becomes an aggressive country that threatens world peace; (2) Positively, to make Japan a peaceful and democratic country forever.

In order to achieve the above two goals, the Allied powers decided to implement the following four guidelines: (1) Japan's sovereignty is limited to the Japanese mainland, namely Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and the small islands permitted by the United Nations; (2) Disarm Japan completely; (3) Enable the Japanese people to enjoy freedom of speech, publication, religion and assembly; (4) Develop a peaceful and self-sufficient economy.

The above four points were agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the time of Japan's surrender, and authorized Marshal MacArthur to be responsible for supervising and controlling Japan. In this decision, MacArthur has three privileges in Japan: (1) The power of supreme rule in Japan; (2) To take appropriate measures to implement Japan's surrender conditions and the Potsdam Declaration; (3) To issue orders and exercise the power of rule through his military government or the Japanese Emperor and the Japanese government; if the Supreme Commander believes that the personnel executing the order are not performing effectively, he can replace them immediately.

The above three points are the orders announced by US President Truman in Washington on September 22, 1945. This is enough to explain that MacArthur's authority was granted by the US government after being agreed by the Allied powers. On December 27 of the same year, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union decided to organize a Far Eastern Committee in Washington and establish an Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo at the Moscow Conference. The establishment of these two institutions did not substantially change MacArthur's powers. As far as the Far Eastern Committee is concerned, it is an guiding organization organized by representatives of eleven countries (China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and the Philippines), but all its resolutions need to be passed through the US government and conveyed to MacArthur, and there is no direct relationship with MacArthur. In the US government, in order to implement the resolutions of the Far Eastern Committee, there are two committees, one of which is the State Department, War Department, Naval Department Combined Committee (SWNCC), which is an advisory body. All resolutions are discussed by the committee and then submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) for orders to MacArthur. The organization system is as follows:

As for the latter institution, it is composed of representatives from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the chairman is US Ambassador Acheson. Its resolutions cannot directly bind MacArthur, and its role is only to provide opinions and serve as an advisory body. Therefore, the most direct and highest executor of the control of Japan is MacArthur. The Far Eastern Committee is theoretically the highest decision-making body.

The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) is composed of MacArthur as the Supreme Commander, with a Chief of Staff under him, forming the General Staff Headquarters, which is divided into four groups: Personnel (G1), Intelligence (G2), Operations (G3), and Supply (G4). Four Deputy Chiefs of Staff concurrently serve as the directors of each group, which is essentially a staff organization. In addition, for the convenience of division of labor and cooperation, there are nine bureaus under the Chief of Staff, whose responsibilities are as follows: (1) Executive Section: Responsible for general affairs. (2) Diplomatic Section: Responsible for liaison between the United Nations representatives in Japan and individuals. (3) Government Section: Responsible for general civil affairs; Korean administration is also under the jurisdiction of this bureau. (5) Economic and Scientific Section: Responsible for economic, financial, industrial and trade affairs. (5) Natural Resources Section: Responsible for agriculture, forestry, fisheries and mining. (6) Public Relation Office: Responsible for information, publicity, public relations, etc., and opened a press room for news reporters. (7) Civil Information and Education Section: Responsible for news, broadcasting, film, education, religion, art facts, and its main task is to be responsible for the enlightenment of residents in the occupied area. (8) Civil Communication Section: Responsible for the restoration and reconstruction of communication facilities. (9) Public Health and Welfare Section: Responsible for medical administration and public health and welfare affairs. (10) Legal Section: Responsible for investigating and prosecuting war criminals. The organizational system is roughly as follows (Table 2):

The above departments are all located in Tokyo, while the military government is organized by the garrison in each local prefecture and county. Wherever the administrative organs of the Japanese government are located, there must be the establishment of the US military government. Its task is to urge the Japanese government to implement the orders of the Allied Headquarters, and it may correct those who fail to implement them effectively at any time. When the Allied Headquarters issues orders to the Japanese government, it simultaneously notifies the occupation forces. After receiving the orders, the Japanese government orders all levels of administrative agencies and informs the people to comply. After receiving the orders, the occupation forces notify the military government, the legal bureaus at all levels, and the local garrisons, and inform the Japanese people. If the Japanese central government fails to implement effectively, the General Staff Headquarters of the Allied Headquarters may directly correct it. If the local government and the people fail to implement effectively, the central government will urge them, or the court will bring them to justice. If necessary, troops can be dispatched to enforce it. The execution system is illustrated as follows (Table 3):

The advantage of this control method is that the Allied control agency and the Japanese political system are independent of each other, so there will be no confusion, this is one. The Japanese government directly manages the Japanese people, and the Allied forces are only responsible for issuing orders and supervising their implementation. This has a better impact on the Japanese people's perception, this is two. But its weakness also lies here: since the Allied agencies at all levels are not responsible for implementation, they cannot have a deep understanding of various technical problems. If the Japanese government and the people collude, it will not be easy to discover the malpractices. At the beginning of the occupation of Japan, the United States did not neglect this point, and the strengthening of the G2 intelligence organization is proof of this. However, as time goes on, the Japanese are good at flattering, and the Americans do not bear old grudges. Whether the orders of the Allied Headquarters can be thoroughly implemented without losing their original intention is worthy of close attention by the people of our country and the Allied countries.

### Track Laying Project on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Completes More Than 100 Kilometers in 44 Days

— Quick News from March 20, sent by Huang Cen from Jinhua

From Zhuji to Jinhua, the track laying team of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Engineering Office completed the railway track laying project of 108 kilometers in 44 days.

Forty-four days is not a long time, and after excluding the days of spring rain, the actual "working days" are at most only thirty days. This time, they were able to create a new record of laying an average of more than three kilometers of track per day in such a "blitzkrieg" manner. In the middle of this, we cannot help but be surprised and admire the working spirit and technology of the track laying team.

Laboring Workers in Urgent Excitement

This reporter went to and from the vicinity of Jinhua Station this morning to observe the progress of the laying work.

The Jinhua Station gate, which had been deserted for five years, suddenly became lively today. Thousands of spectators stood densely beside the track, and more than 400 laboring workers came and went among them. Foremen and young engineers were excitedly helping to direct. At first, trucks drove by, dropping sleepers every foot, and the workers behind immediately put them in place and prepared for "compacting the soil". In the second step, the workers moved the steel rails from the dark material car, quickly placed them on the pulley car, and pushed them along the track. In the third step, the steel rails were unloaded and connected to the previous section. The fourth step was to start the necessary and piecemeal work such as "knocking nails", "tightening screws", "measuring distance" and "filling soil". The process of connecting section by section was faster than the "pacing" of ordinary gentlemen. The workers were full of a harmonious and joyful atmosphere. In today's China, which is so backward and does not seek efficiency in everything, we are so moved and gratified to see the hardworking and practical spirit of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway employees!

Jinhua Lanxi to Connect Tracks Soon

With the introduction of Engineer Cheng Junzerun of the road construction office, I visited the office of the nailing team attached to the front of the locomotive. Several engineers who had just graduated from university lived in a small carriage. They were young and full of enthusiasm for their work. They competed to tell the story of the record-breaking progress, and pointed out various statistical tables hanging on the wall for the reporter to see, including "Nailing Log", "Cumulative Table of Workers", "Progress Speed Statistics Table", etc. They started nailing the road on February 1. Zhuji is (64+100) kilometers from Hangzhou. According to this calculation, it reached Waichen (74+100) on the 5th, Piantou (81+170) on the 10th, Anhua (87+657) on the 14th, Zhengjiawu (94+672) on the 18th, Dachen (99+164) on the 19th, Suxi (107+990) on the 23rd, and Yiwu (119+191.80) on the 27th. (According to Yiwu to Hangzhou, it has been opened to traffic on March 4, with two shifts a day). The Huajin section started laying tracks on March 1, Yizhen (133+351.75) on the 5th, Hangcixi (139+230) on the 9th, Xiaoshun (146+408) on the 11th, Tangya (156+987) on the 13th, and Jinhua at 4 pm on the 16th. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line has laid nearly 172 li of track from Hangzhou to here. It is expected that the entire line can be laid to Quzhou in June and connected to the Jiangqu section. It can be fully opened to traffic around the Double Tenth Festival. Jinhua to Lanxi will start pressing the tracks immediately, and it is said that it can be completed by the end of the month.

Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Under Repair, Photo Sent by Huang Cen

The Damage to the Bushanxi Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (Sent by Our Reporter Huang Xingtian)

The Chief Engineer Spends Painstaking Effort

Director and Chief Engineer Hou Jiayuan arrived here on the 14th under a grand welcome, and immediately returned to Quzhou on the 15th to inspect. When mentioning Director Hou, everyone still remembers the touching experience of driving the locomotive himself and advancing one li while repairing and laying the Xiang-Gui Railway. When he took over the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway again this time, he still did it with this spirit. Some time ago, some people had a quarrel with Director Hou for some reason, and even went to Beijing to petition, etc. However, these rumors could not match his hard-working spirit after all. Why was the progress of the project delayed for more than a year after the victory, but it was completed so quickly after he took over? It can be seen that the fact will always defeat rhetoric. Today, who does not admire this engineer who has devoted himself to the railway engineering of the motherland?

The Leader of the Track Laying Team is Highly Meritorious

Tang [omission] Ru, the leader of the track laying team, graduated from Tangshan and has worked in the railway for several years. This time his contribution is also not small. Under his command, it is divided into four sections: engineering, machinery, dispatch, and material, which are respectively responsible by Lu Xiguang, Yuan Xiaozuo, Qian Guangzhao, and Huang Jialin. He said that when nailing the Xiang-Gui Railway in the past, the highest record was only a little more than three kilometers in 24 hours. This time, sleepers were thrown at night and work was done during the day, but more than half of the working days exceeded three kilometers. It was especially fast in the days before reaching Jinhua. On March 12, it reached 4.2 kilometers, breaking the historical record of nailing roads in China. The efficiency was around 4 kilometers on the 15th and 16th. This kind of work efficiency was beyond their expectations. They especially admire the working workers. Except for a few skilled workers, the rest were temporarily recruited. However, when guiding them to use their skills, they were also very familiar and smooth. In order to reward the workers, the bureau formulated reward regulations. The base number for 90-pound rails is 2.5 kilometers per day, and wages are increased proportionally if this is exceeded. For example, on March 12, the reward rate was exactly 100%, and everyone was paid double that day. Since March, the average daily reward for workers has been more than 50%. At present, the wages of skilled workers are from 10,000 to 13,000, and the wages of unskilled workers are from 7,000 to 9,000. If there is no such addition, their lives would still be difficult.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is now awakening. This is a trunk line that serves as the lifeline of the five southeastern provinces, not only Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. In the future, after the Nanchang section is extended to Zhuzhou and connected to the Yuehan Railway, combining the Pinghan, Pingjin, Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huhu lines, wouldn't this large triangle area become the center of everything in the motherland?

No Beginning and No End, Starting a New Journey

The engineers came from different corners (Beiyang, Jiaoda, Tangshan, Xiamen, Yingda...). When they saw the last rail nailing at the station, they were so happy that they burst into tears. The workers shook off the burden, and when they pushed the last rail loading truck to the end, they sang:

"Come on, push, use your strength... (The foreman sings) Hang Yu: (Chorus) Help, work together (The foreman sings) Hang Yu...

One step, be careful not to trip, Hang Yu...

Okay, shout, let's go to the movies tonight, Hang Yu..."

The end is the starting point, and they will start a new project tomorrow! I hope that the spirit of the nailing team employees will remain in the days to come. We have reason to believe that in China, as long as every project has such efficiency, the Stakhanov spirit will eventually emerge in China.

### A Youth from Changchun, Chen Fuhan, Commits Suicide, Leaving Tears of Sorrow for the Times

— A Dispatch from Changchun, the 23rd, by Air Mail — Our Reporter Tang Zhan

A suicide case that shocked the entire city occurred in Changchun. The protagonist was Chen Fuhan, a staff member of Changchun Youth Middle School, originally an artilleryman of the 207th Division of the Youth Army, and a native of Xikang. Last year, he came to the Northeast with the army. In June, he was wounded in battle in Heishi Town, Panshi County, breaking his right leg. This year, he took a position at Youth Middle School. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 20th of this month, he committed suicide by taking poison in his dormitory. The next morning, the cook discovered him while delivering breakfast. He was rushed to the Municipal First Hospital for emergency treatment, but due to severe poisoning, he died. He left behind a suicide note and a letter to a friend in Changchun. The suicide note read: "The affairs of the nation are withering, the mountains and rivers are being destroyed, corruption fills the roads, and malfeasance is rampant. The people are constantly hungry and cold, and the soldiers have no moment of rest. The family fortune is declining day by day, and the body is severely injured. We cannot use swift action to save this turbulent situation; we cannot but sigh deeply. Occupying a position without performing useful work, I feel that I am wasting public funds; lacking the ability to contribute, I am hindering national reconstruction even more. Thinking late at night, my heart is filled with anxiety. I have already made the greatest sacrifice for the country and the nation, but I regret that I could not die on the battlefield. I am deeply ashamed that I have failed to live up to the inspiring and great personality of our leader and have failed to live up to the spirits of the martyrs and the late Premier in heaven. Alas! It is over! My death will be scorned by most people, but I do not wish for any criticism from the press. I have suffered such pain today for the sake of the country and the people, which is not something that ordinary, mediocre, and incompetent people can casually judge. My conscience is clear, and I can close my eyes in peace. On the eve of my death, I write this to clarify my thoughts. Written by Chen Fuhan in the dormitory of Changchun Youth Middle School on the evening of March 20th, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic, at nine o'clock."

Regarding the reasons for Chen Fuhan's suicide, many commentators believe that he was so saddened by the times and worried about the country that he committed suicide by drawing his own blood. There were no other special reasons. Chen's friends said that he was upright and unyielding, full of enthusiasm, and had a strong sense of justice. He got along very well with his superiors and classmates in the army.

### A Visit to the Los Angeles Tuberculosis Sanatorium

— Tidbits from Ding Huikang's Visit to America — A Dispatch from San Francisco by Air Mail on March 24th by Yuan Cha

Dr. Ding Huikang, Director of the Shanghai Hongqiao Sanatorium, traveled to the United States on the General Gordon in January of this year to study the latest medical and public health practices. After landing in San Francisco, he met with Dr. Geiger, Director of the Health Bureau, who told him that smallpox had been discovered there a few months ago. Dr. Geiger immediately ordered vaccinations, and the entire city, with a population of approximately 800,000, was completed within two weeks. Dr. Ding expressed his deep appreciation for the rapid implementation of health administration. In early February, he arrived in Los Angeles, a newly emerging metropolis in the southwestern United States. Its area is about the size of Belgium, and the city's vastness ranks first in the world, with a population of approximately 1.8 million. Upon the invitation of the local Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Dr. Ding visited the Los Angeles Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which is located 27 miles from the city and covers 800 acres. It adopts a segregated village system, with each room accommodating only one to two people. The nurses' room and each patient's room have direct communication, saving time and providing convenience. Patients do not pay fees and are supported through donations. Recently, three Russian soldiers were admitted to the sanatorium, with the Russian government donating $5,000 for their care. The sanatorium is located at the foot of Mount Wilson, offering extremely beautiful scenery. The sanatorium also has facilities such as a workshop, a library, and a chapel. The Olive View Sanatorium, located 25 miles from the city and covering 1,000 acres, is the third-largest tuberculosis sanatorium in the United States. Medical conferences are held once a week, and it can accommodate 1,000 beds. The sanatorium is famous for its surgery. For patients with cavities, a thoracoplasty can be performed, or even the entire lung can be removed. In one recent case, the procedure was performed five days ago, taking seven and a half hours, and the patient is now out of danger. Significant improvement can be seen on X-ray images. One-third of the patients at this sanatorium are Mexican, demonstrating the connection between environment and tuberculosis. The Municipal Hospital is one of the newest buildings in the city, with 18 floors and a capacity of 3,000 patients, making it the largest municipal hospital in the world. It has over 200 physicians and serves as an academic research institution. Dr. Ding observed that the hospitals in major cities in the United States are always full of patients because early treatment allows people to recover their health and working ability more easily. This is in stark contrast to the Chinese practice of waiting until the illness is critical before seeking hospital care. Due to advances in diagnostic methods, the United States has found that heart disease is the leading cause of death, while tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 30. If this is the case in the United States, which has excellent environmental hygiene, then the seriousness of heart and lung diseases in China needs no further discussion. If everyone could have a health checkup every year, it would certainly improve the health of the nation. Note: In 1935, Dr. Ding was sent by the National Health Administration to various European countries to investigate tuberculosis prevention facilities. Since returning to China, he has spared no effort in promoting public health, such as school health checkups and X-ray tuberculosis screenings. Dr. Ding has transitioned from a private physician to engaging in practical public health work. He has been extremely busy visiting medical experts in the United States, such as Dr. Thomson, an authority on heart disease, and Mr. Cade, an X-ray expert. He is expected to visit medical centers in New York in mid-May before returning to China.

Weekly Forum

### The Current Mission of Young Technicians and Health Workers

— Zhao Zukang

At the anniversary celebration of the founding of the Chinese Technology Association, Chairman Song Mingshi asked me to give a speech. On the spur of the moment, I offered three points based on my thoughts to encourage my colleagues in the Association. Upon returning home, I further expanded and wrote this article for the reference of young technical personnel in China.

The establishment of the Science Society of China thirty years ago demonstrated the Chinese intellectual class's understanding of science. The establishment of the Chinese Institute of Engineers during the war indicated the Chinese people's understanding of engineering, emphasizing the practical application of knowledge. And the establishment of the Technology Association last year further demonstrated our country's understanding of technology. From science to engineering is a transition from theory to practice. From engineering to technology is a transition from a partial application of knowledge to a general application. This represents the progress of the Chinese people in understanding and utilizing Western culture.

The current turbulent and unstable situation in the country, and the difficulty of finding opportunities for us technicians, are indeed disheartening. But I want to loudly appeal to my country's young technical personnel to never lose heart or become discouraged, but rather to redouble their efforts. The special mission we bear at present, which can also be said to be the attitude and spirit we should have, should be threefold: first, "application"; second, "pursuit of truth"; and third, "martyrdom."

The purpose of studying is to apply what one has learned. Technical personnel are all specialists with specialized knowledge. Thanks to the cultivation of the country, the support of their families, and their own efforts, they have acquired specialized knowledge, which is no easy feat. We must use what we have learned, as this is the way to achieve the highest efficiency. Therefore, although the general situation in the country is unstable, the environment may not be entirely satisfactory, the treatment of technical personnel may not be high, and the opportunities to demonstrate their abilities may not be many, I want to advise young technical personnel to stick to their posts and do their best in whatever situation they find themselves. Everyone should use what they have learned in any situation; this is the primary meaning of application.

Last year, at a meeting of the Academia Sinica, a certain dignitary gave a speech calling for "returning politics to the people and returning science to scientists." However, a certain science magazine criticized this, arguing that it should be said "returning scientists to science." But I believe that both sayings are valid. Because there are many scientific or technological enterprises in the country that are not managed by scientific or technical personnel, and those who study science and technology do not all engage in scientific or technological work in their respective fields. Both of these should be corrected. This responsibility lies with the government and the founders of these enterprises. I hope that leaders at all levels in the political, economic, and cultural circles of the country can ensure that "returning technology to technical personnel" and "returning technical personnel to technology" will enable all undertakings to be managed properly and developed. This is the secondary meaning of application.

In the current difficult environment, all enterprises feel a shortage of financial and material resources. Young technical personnel should strive to promote and expand their undertakings in difficult circumstances. We must conserve materials and manpower, which means being able to "adapt to local conditions" and "adapt to available materials." For example, Shanghai imports hard asphalt for repairing asphalt road surfaces, but it is not easy to obtain. We must find ways to adapt to local conditions and try to use soft asphalt (Coal Tar) as much as possible. The soft asphalt in Shanghai is not entirely suitable for road repair, so we must formulate standards (Specifications) to guide the factories to refine it accordingly. This is adapting to available materials. There are many other similar situations. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many precedents were set for engineering projects in the rear, such as highways and railways, bridges designed and assembled on-site, and the manufacture of military equipment and chemical production. This is the third meaning of application in the current circumstances.

Next, I would like to talk about the pursuit of truth. Truth is truth. The term "technology" is considered "Technology" in English, but in English, it is also referred to as "Applied Science," which is translated into Chinese as "应用科学" (Yingyong Kexue), meaning applied science. However, some people believe that "实学" (Shi Xue), meaning practical learning, is a more appropriate translation for "Technology." Moreover, according to some scientists in the West, the term "Applied Science" is also inappropriate because practical learning is not merely the "art" of applying the principles and methods of one or more sciences to an undertaking; it also has its own theory. For example, water supply engineering is the result of the integration and application of various sciences such as hydraulics, hydrology, chemistry, and geology. However, it must also develop its own design theory. For example, the design of water supply systems, so "Technology" is not only the "study" of theory, but also the "application" - applied learning - but it is not only the art - technology - but also a kind of "study". Therefore, those who study applied learning (technology) in our country at present should, in addition to application, also be able to pursue truth. Seeking truth is learning, is the attitude of a scientist. Only when we have the spirit of pursuing truth can we make inventions, can we make applied learning a genuine applied learning. For example, civil engineers design culverts on roads using the Talbot formula. This formula is only suitable for a part of the United States. It is an empirical formula. In our country, it is best to establish our own formula based on our own experience. This is the pursuit of truth, and truth can lead to application, which is applied learning.

Truth is also "reality." The pursuit of truth is to be practical. Perfunctoriness, superficiality, and aiming too high are all impractical and cannot be considered to have the spirit of pursuing truth. Chinese scholars have a common problem, which is that when asked about practical work, they invariably "bluff their way through"; but when asked about theoretical plans, they are extremely profound and ambitious. One reason for this is that the majority of Chinese people lack the health and energy of Westerners, are reluctant to do practical work, and tend to indulge in abstract thinking. Another reason is the traditional habits of an agricultural society, which lack precise and meticulous training. We only need to look at the way most people use cars. Most people do not pay attention to when to add lubricating oil or what the tire pressure should be. Many drivers take it lightly. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when public buses broke down in the middle of the road, belts could be used to replace fan belts, and straw sandals could be used as part of the steel plates. I think this kind of situation only happened in our country. This is all due to a lack of emphasis on truth, which is fundamentally contrary to the spirit of industrial revolution with its emphasis on efficiency and mass production. We must resolutely correct this. This is another aspect of pursuing truth.

Finally, let's talk about martyrdom. What is martyrdom? Martyrdom is sacrificing one's life, and the Way is a moral belief. The ancients said, "A greedy person dies for wealth, and a martyr dies for fame." Wealth is not worth pursuing, and fame is also empty. The Way is the noblest path of human behavior. - The Way is the path. Those who study technology should take the principles and methods of science - "learning" - and the cause of national and public welfare - "application" - as their goal, their path, and their belief, their Way. For the sake of this "learning" and this "application," they are willing to sacrifice profit, sacrifice fame, sacrifice everything, and even sacrifice their lives if necessary. This is martyrdom.

In recent years, I have often had the feeling that the spirit of Confucianism in our country should be integrated with the spirit of Western Christianity in modern times. Confucianism has an attitude and ambition towards the Way and towards the nation and society: "When poor, cultivate oneself alone; when successful, benefit all under heaven." Zhuge Kongming's saying "Safeguard one's life in troubled times, and do not seek fame and fortune among the feudal lords" has the same meaning. I believe this spirit should be revised. Furthermore, the set of learning and practice mentioned in the Great Learning - cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world - inevitably leads to the bad habit of many students thinking of themselves as future leaders as soon as they enter school. In Christianity, it seems that it is not like that. Christ's teachings are equality, fraternity, freedom, service, and sacrifice, which are in serious conflict with the power of Roman politics and the beliefs of the Jews at that time. Therefore, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his life, carrying the cross to his death at the young age of thirty-two. This spirit of ethics, morality, economy, politics, and revolution has had a profound and far-reaching impact on Western culture. As for our Confucianism, although Confucius also spoke of working before eating and laboring before enjoying benefits, it is often ignored by ordinary scholars with leadership aspirations. Therefore, I feel that we should promote the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice - the spirit of revolution.

Two months ago, the newspaper reported that the American Ambassador to China, Mr. Stuart, gave a speech to students, as if advocating that our country still needs a revolution, which is a revolution of freedom and democracy. His meaning probably refers to a revolution of freedom and democracy in thought, which is exactly what I envision. However, add to it a revolution of the scientific spirit. "When poor, cultivate oneself alone?" That's not right. When poor, we need a revolution. What we need most is a revolution of thought, and technical personnel should shoulder this responsibility.

Let's look at European history again. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Crusades launched seven expeditions to the east for the purpose of preserving the holy city of Jerusalem. Its driving force was religious zeal. By the 16th and 17th centuries, such outstanding figures as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton overthrew Ptolemy's geocentric theory and proved heliocentrism, creating a new cosmic system. Even Galileo, at the old age of sixty-nine, was able to resist the church of the time, which was superstitious and clung to the old theories. Although he was forced to submit in the end, according to historical records, when he was forced to kneel before ten cardinals in crimson robes and finally renounced his theory, he muttered to himself as he crawled up, "And yet it moves!" From this, we can see his spirit of martyrdom. If young technical personnel can devote themselves to technological endeavors throughout their lives, taking the pursuit of national prosperity and public welfare as their responsibility, do so themselves, and encourage others to do so as well, remaining unmoved by poverty or lowly status, uncorrupted by wealth and high position, and unyielding in the face of force, that spirit is the spirit of martyrdom. Being able to recognize this responsibility is being able to take it as a mission. In short, young technical personnel of the present day - those in their twenties and thirties - should understand that the opportunity for national revival and the responsibility for national revitalization in ten or twenty years rest on your shoulders. You must hold yourselves accountable, respect yourselves, learn from your past mistakes, and redouble your efforts. To overcome the environment and create an era, you must shoulder the three missions I have mentioned above: first, application; second, pursuit of truth; and third, martyrdom. You must be based on the attitude of pursuing truth with science, aim for the cause of practical application, and uphold the spirit of martyrdom in order to shoulder the mission entrusted to you by the nation and the people. Then the future of our China will certainly be one hundred and twenty points bright!

### Buying and Selling

— Chen Jiahua

She is that kind of "always anxious to be the first to try the new product" person. Whenever a hawker shouts outside the door in a hoarse voice, she will start "making a fuss" as if she is rushing to get things done. Perhaps she does not even understand what the hawker is selling, but her nervous anxiety, as if she is afraid of not being able to buy anything, is enough to make people laugh.

Each time when a hawker complies with the landlady's "summons" and steps through the door, the landlady seems to be meeting an old friend. She will warmly ask him about all sorts of things, such as where he comes from and where he is going. If it is evening or lunchtime, she will greet him with a big smile and invite him to eat or sleep at her house. Her words are nothing more than:

"Hey, businessman, have a simple meal here; it's about time."

Or:

"It's so late; you can stay here for the night. Hotels are too expensive."

However, most hawkers refuse the landlady's kindness. If there has ever been an exception, it was the old woman selling chicken eggs, because the landlady often says this to show her sincerity:

"It's nothing. The old woman who sold chicken eggs stayed here for a night last time."

This can be said to be the landlady's opening line to start the buying and selling. What follows in an hour is the discussion of the price.

The landlady's bargaining often surprises the hawkers, because the landlady has her own "business philosophy," which is "cutting the price in half." She feels that the hawkers who come to her door charge a particularly high price, so it is okay to bargain lower.

If the hawkers realize that arguing is useless because the offer is too low and prepare to leave, then she will grab their burden. Needless to say, her smile is gone, and her face has turned green.

"Why are you leaving? This is bargaining. You can still negotiate!"

If the hawker's price is three, five hundred, or even one or two thousand, the landlady will still refuse to buy, but she will shout:

"You are not sacred! So inflexible, insisting on one price."

However, most hawkers step back because of her excessive entanglement. Finally, the landlady happily strokes her black and thick fingers on her nose, expressing her joy. The subsequent dispute is about the quantity of the goods. For example, she might complain that his scale is not an old catty (斤), but only ten taels (兩), and demand that he add a little more.

Thus, because the hawker suffers too much loss, he cannot help but curse a few times, saying "such a woman, such a woman." The landlady then turns red in the face, shouting fiercely, almost like screaming:

"Hehe, losing money! Not making money? The devil sent you to my door? Really black-hearted."

Even though she says this, her joy because of the cheap price is still visible. She often tells every tenant living in her house about the things she bought, as if they were trophies she has won. She not only wants the tenants to know that she has bought such lovely things, but also wants someone to praise them as "bargains."

If you just smile and do not respond when she asks you, then she will point her ink-black finger at your nose and start scolding:

"Are you saying these things are expensive? Why are you silent?" If your reply says that these things are exceptionally cheap and that you also like them, then she will not be able to close her mouth, and her face will be covered with countless wrinkles as she says with a smile:

"Really? Really?"

The landlady is such a fickle woman, loving to laugh, loving to cry, loving to scold, and being both fierce and aggressive. She may consider you a "good person," but within a few minutes, she will immediately treat you as an enemy.

If you want to understand her character further, readers, let me tell you a recent story:

After noon, the landlady called the hawker selling chickens.

This hawker was around forty years old, dressed in rural attire. The two chickens were large and round, walking behind the landlady.

"Ah, listening to your accent, you are!"

"I am from Shaoxing," the hawker replied.

"Haha, we are from the same hometown! We are from Yuyao, but we only came to Hangzhou recently," the landlady immediately appeared very friendly and started talking, quietly and slowly answering.

Thus, the landlady and the hawker started talking. They got along very well, and the landlady even poured a cup of tea for him herself. She said:

"We are from the same hometown, drink this." The hawker who had been standing immediately sat down on the stone bench, smiling as he accepted the tea.

They talked about the situations in Shaoxing and Yuyao, and also about doing business. They spoke of many things, and the atmosphere became more and more harmonious.

"How much for a pair, fellow townsman?" the landlady asked, appearing anxious.

"To be honest, 9,000 for one to a fellow townsman."

"Oh, too expensive! We're fellow townsmen, let’s make it 10,000 a pair. It is easy to remember and easy to calculate," the landlady said, immediately squatting down and using her black and large hand to grab the chickens in the basket.

The hawker smiled bitterly, because this bargaining had disappointed him. She offered 10,000 when he said 18,000, virtually cutting the price in half. This loss was too great, so he very humbly said:

"Landlady, let's make it 16,000 a pair. Fellow townsmen don't make any money."

"11,000 a pair is good. Four chickens, 20,000, clear as day."

"30,000 for four, I'll give you another 2,000 for friendship, to cover your travel expenses," the hawker said pleadingly.

But no matter what the hawker said, the landlady insisted on 11,000 a pair. She said:

"You, person, are stubborn to the end, not willing to budge at all."

"Really—"

The hawker had not finished speaking, but the landlady had already lost her temper, because she had mistaken "really" for "losing money". She threw the chicken down, stood up, and shouted loudly:

"Losing money? Bullshit! Are you a rich man?" "It's precisely because I'm not a rich man—" the hawker replied timidly, as if sensing that something unfortunate was about to happen.

"If you are not a rich man, what foul money are you losing?"

"Then—" The hawker gave a bitter laugh, intending to leave.

"You can't leave. I want to buy them. Why are you insisting on one price? 30,000, 30,000!"

"Sorry, landlady!" The hawker trembled, glancing back as he left. But the landlady revealed an angry expression, rolled up her sleeves, and with a jump, rushed forward and dragged the burden with all her might.

"There's no reason for this. Why won't you sell?" she shouted.

The hawker's face turned red, and he was shaking extremely badly, looking very scared. Preparing to escape, he pulled hard, and in this way, the landlady, who was dragging the burden, fell down.

Then everything went out of control. The landlady forgot that the hawker was from the same hometown, was one of her own people, and started shouting, seemingly crying:

"You hit people! You dare to hit people! To the police station! To the police station!"

The hawker wanted to escape, but the landlady grabbed him, and even gave him a slap.

In the midst of the struggle, a patrolman ran in from outside. Thus, with tears and shouts, the landlady reported to the patrolman, "This thug, this robber!" The hawker was then taken to the police station.

Later, it was said that the hawker, as the "thug" and "robber," was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, but because a distant uncle of his, who served as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, came out to vouch for him, he was only "locked up" for two days before being released.

And the landlady had already acquired six chickens, one of which was entirely black and extremely lively. The landlady fed them green grass and yellow millet every day, and whenever a kite appeared in the sky, she would shout, "May you be killed a thousand times, may you be killed ten thousand times! My family's chickens are not for you to eat!" As for where she bought these chickens and how much she spent in total, readers, please forgive my ignorance, I cannot know. (Early spring, thirty-sixth year, first draft in Hangzhou)

### Cat

— Shen Yue

### Banks of the Duren River

— Original by Pence, Translated by Zhenqin

How beautiful are the flowers along the banks of the Duren River!

How can you birds be so cheerful and sing,

While my heart is filled with sorrow!

You tear at my heart, beautiful bird,

As you sing on the branch;

You remind me of those happy days,

When my beloved had not yet changed her heart.

You tear at my heart, beautiful bird,

As you sing beside your mate;

For I, too, once sat like this,

Unknowing of my fate.

I often strolled beside the beautiful copper bank,

Watching the honeysuckle intertwine,

Every bird sang of its love,

And I, too, once sang of mine.

I once happily plucked

A rose from a thorny branch;

My unfaithful lover stole the flower,

And left me with the thorns.

### Adipose Tissue of Literature

— Jin Hong

The tendency of novels toward "looseness" has almost become a general fashion in the mid-20th century. Sinclair Lewis's *Main Street* is considered good because its chapters are well-organized, and the descriptions are full of vitality. Pearl Buck's *The Good Earth*, however, is somewhat like that. There are two main simple reasons for this trend: First, it is nothing more than the old realism style since the end of the 19th century, which often overemphasizes refinement, forming a habit of dense chapters and sentences, making readers shy away from masterpieces. Second, the psychology of literature is gradually changing. In the past, many readers often believed that the seriousness of the ideas and content of a work was inviolable, as if it could truly point out a direction for life. Now it is different. Its lightness is its advantage. Its emptiness is its way of sowing a seed of "self-cleverness" in the reader's mind.

A critic said:

"No matter how precise the imagination presented in a work, it is ultimately just the success of the author's personal imagination. It may not necessarily represent 'truth.' 'Truth' is not something that can be obtained through mere imagination. It must pass through the author's vision, be hidden in the depths of memory, and then be used as a resource for 'imaginative recreation' in the future to be artistically valid."

This statement has some truth to it. As the old saying goes, "Judging the fatness or thinness of the Yue people from the perspective of the Qin people" is not to blame for the irrelevance.

Mr. Lin Yutang seems to understand this as well. His *Moment in Peking*, though called a novel, is essentially a prose work in a loose style. However, most readers praise it. Not to mention Mr. Yu Cai's works. Is this natural and unrestrained habit of not pursuing "refined to the extreme" different from person to person? Or is it that the principle of description should not be contrary to "nature" in the first place?

Another English writer contemporary with Mr. Lin Yutang, Lin Wen-zheng (Lim Boon Keng), became famous both at home and abroad twenty years ago with his book *The Tragedy of Eastern Life* (Commercial Press edition). His style is much more rigorous than Mr. Yu Tang's, the descriptions are delicate, and the narration is fluent. Even a native English or American writer would not deny it. There are also some very loose sentence structures interspersed in the tightly structured chapters, such as "Malays and Chinese often talk very intimately, showing tolerance for each other in their living habits. The family is prefixed with the title 'Towkay' (Malays call gentlemen 'Towkay'), which is common in Chinese; it is equivalent to 'Mister' and 'Miss' in English. Therefore, Malays always add Towkay to the Chinese respectful address…" (Chapter 1, P. 4)

For example:

"…In this narrative, we assume that readers know Towkay. Peng Abe is equivalent to Mister Abe Peng, because Chinese surnames are often placed at the beginning, followed by the personal name, just like guiding it." (Chapter 1, P. 5)

This kind of narration is, of course, lively, and interspersed after a description, it can greatly relax the reader's mind. Psychologically, it is justifiable. It is not showing off, nor is it making jokes. It is a bit like the fat accumulated on a person's body, which can increase the beauty of the skin. Is it the beauty of a refined and solid physique? Or is it beautiful to have a layer of adipose tissue inside the limbs? People's appreciation varies. Some like to read serious works that are described without a single flaw, while others like works with a loose and natural style. Which preference is more desirable? Who can determine!

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 310

— Ye Jingfeng

"Oh! Does China have such an organization?" Tsurumi was surprised and very excited.

"Yes, Captain." Zheng Yan straightened his posture and lowered his voice. "The 'disappearance' incident a few days ago was also handled single-handedly by that friend entrusted by his subordinates!"

"Ha…" Tsurumi was happy. Just as he was about to ask further, the maid came.

"The news is not very good!" The maid looked worried. "The embassy said that Miss Nakamura did go to the embassy, but it was too early, 8:45. The office was not open. Only a small clerk received her. Miss Nakamura said she wanted to see the ambassador and retrieve a letter. The letter was important, and she had to retrieve it herself. The clerk asked Miss Nakamura to go again at 9:30. Miss promised to go at 9:30 or 10:00. The ambassador waited until 10:00, but Miss Nakamura did not go. Only then did the ambassador send someone to seal the letter."

Hearing this, Tsurumi glanced at the envelope of the document on the table:

"What car did Miss take?"

"The steward of the embassy called a car for a business trip, probably from 'Heta Car Rental Company'."

"Very good… Please tell the steward that I want to go to the military department. But I still want the car that Miss took, and I still want that driver. No one else!"

These successive events made Tsurumi feel a little confused.

"This time, I have to make a big mess!" Tsurumi seemed to be talking to himself. "I expected that something big must have happened to Pingzi." He indicated that he was going to make a fuss in Shanghai.

"Yes, Captain, but you don't have to worry. Maybe Miss Nakamura was delayed by an important matter at that secret meeting?" Zheng Yan comforted Tsurumi in this way.

"No." Tsurumi seemed very decisive. "Something more serious must have happened." Tsurumi picked up the secret letter from the park fishing club again and handed it to Zheng Yan: "There is no malicious intent in this letter. That's one point. Miss Pingzi is very careful and experienced. If something had delayed her, there would have been a phone call, and the embassy would have made a phone call. That's the second point. Judging from these two points, can you still say that nothing has gone wrong?"

As Tsurumi spoke, he picked up the strange note from the table and handed it to Zheng Yan as well, as if he wanted to entrust Zheng Yan with the responsibility of investigating the Pingzi matter clearly.

"Hua Mao Hotel 0915."

The note had not changed, it was still these four Chinese characters and a number.

Tsurumi continued to pace back and forth in the room, thinking deeply. Zheng Yan held the strange note and the secret letter, turning them over and over, looking at the note, then looking at the letter. The more he looked, the more confused his face became, like someone who had never studied Greek, suddenly receiving a letter in Greek. No matter how much he turned it over, it was still a mystery to him. The more he looked, the less he understood.

"Any new insights?" Tsurumi asked boredly.

"I'm afraid it will take some time. Maybe we can find some clues."

"Clues can only be found outside… the embassy, the Hua Mao Hotel, the park… These two documents have probably been washed in nitric acid. How can you find any clues there?"

"Yes, Captain. Maybe Miss Nakamura is delayed somewhere. If we give it a little time, things will become clear." Zheng Yan could only use these two sentences to explain back and forth.

"How much time is there? The matter is very urgent…"

### Minor Song of the Tung Flower

— Su Fan

Tung Flowers

Mist envelops the mountain city, and again, the tung flowers fly white.

You left, heading to the distant seaside, and since then, in my tranquil heart, you have cast a deep infatuation,

Like a tung flower, in the pale white night, I still love to sit alone, writing poems of life. At this table, in the past, how much tinkling laughter would rise! But today, it is as silent as the night.

In the September dusk, the riverbank raised waves, outside the window, tung flowers like clouds, in the night, tung flowers quietly fall, falling into dreams, the night so deep, the dream so far…

At my ear, you once quietly told me the story of the pilgrim in the Arabian desert, telling me to stay up late, to stay with the flame of life.

But when the flame lit up, you left, in the season when the tung flowers bloom white, the night is even longer…

### Little Orchid

In the gloomy and obscure days, in the endless years of wandering, when I carried the cross of life towards the threshold of my nineteenth spring, I met Little Orchid…

In the northern country, on the bank of the Taolai River, on the edge of the wind-swept desert wilderness, in that lonely place that is sealed by ice and snow all year round, there I met Little Orchid, like a lone sail tossing in the stormy waves, I found that tranquil and warm harbor.

Little Orchid blooms lonely on the edge of the grassland, the simple breath of the grassland nurtures her, nurtures her magnificent life of youth, in the embrace of the grassland, the spring breeze blows and sends the flashing golden years, Little Orchid blooms even more beautifully.

One year, the spring breeze brought the charming fragrance of the grassland, when I wandered there like a gypsy, I was fascinated by the deep fragrance of Little Orchid, and Little Orchid was also intoxicated in my melancholy strings.

Little Orchid used her trembling warm hands to caress the wounded heart of the young wanderer, so, I shook off my sorrow and wounds, and when the spring breeze knocked on the heart of the grassland again, I was as strong as a little lamb.

A thin mist lightly enveloped the dusk of the grassland, and the camel bells shook off the day. On the starry night, the grassland gently swayed with charming songs, and the melancholy strings told stories of long wandering years, I saw Little Orchid's eyes as crystal clear as the silver stars in the distant sky.

One year, a storm broke out on the grassland, and the years of wandering began again. Holding the muted harp, I quietly said goodbye and left there.

Now, Little Orchid still blooms lonely on the edge of the grassland, blooming on the edge of my dreams…

### Small Quotations

Everyone can do things that make people happy. Some people can make people happy when they walk into a room, and some people can make people happy when they leave a room.

### Post Office Tricks

— Xuan Shi

Among various public utilities, the post office should be one of the most diligent in advancing its business. There is no need to list its work here. We only need to pay attention to the newspapers and streets on weekdays to get the impression: the post office has new tricks again. Now the post office announces that it has started handling subscription business, so we deeply feel that under the current difficult situation, many things, although they cannot absolutely jump out of that earnest cycle, are not without possibilities. Looking at the actions of Langzheng and other public utilities, we can believe this sentence.

The post office, like many other businesses, is suppressed by the price suppression policy and falls behind in the price competition. We imagine that the lives of the post office staff must be very difficult and cannot be compared with before the war. However, in the midst of difficult circumstances, they are not only not slack, but also actively developing business to serve the people more and increase their convenience. This spirit cannot but be admired. We firmly believe that they inevitably encounter various obstacles in the process of promoting their work. However, obstacles are obstacles, and they must hold obstacle races and move forward. We also firmly believe that if there were no these vicious circle obstacles, the work would definitely be promoted more smoothly, and the business would definitely expand more widely. But we firmly believe that if we shrink back under these obstacles, or even use obstacles as an excuse and refuse to work hard, then there will definitely be more obstacles, and it will not be easy to maintain the status quo of the business. As a result, people will feel more inconvenience and suffer trouble. The "one out and one in" in between is very far apart.

The author does not want to praise the postal authorities, but feels that this spirit of service is worth promoting and worth emulating by staff in various positions. This is not sugarcoating peace, but saying that in an unpeaceful environment, we still have to be a good person and do a little bit of good work. It is boring for oneself and others to push everything to the vicious circle of the situation and spread one's hands to the sky.

### The Imaginary — Fixed Space Floating Airplane

— Chen Dexin

This year, airplanes have had bad luck. They have fallen down in the east and west. Wealthy passengers, in an instant, have their limbs broken and their heads burned, falling from the paradise of happiness into the miserable hell. I am a poor man, and I have no chance to take a plane, but I am constantly in danger of "sitting at home, and disaster comes from the sky." This is not alarmist talk. There have already been several scenes shown to the public. I pray day and night for scientists to quickly invent a simple and comfortable means of transportation.

The Earth is constantly rotating eastward along the hypothetical Earth axis, traveling 360 degrees in 24 hours, averaging 15 degrees per hour. Tianjin in my country and Washington and San Francisco in the United States are all around 39 degrees north latitude. Washington is about 45 degrees from San Francisco and about 165 degrees from Tianjin. Therefore, the space in Washington at this moment will be the space in San Francisco in three hours, the space in Tianjin in eleven hours, and the space in Washington again in twenty-four hours.

Therefore, I imagine that in the future, there may be an airplane that floats in a fixed space. It is not affected by the Earth's gravity, there is no danger of mechanical failure, and there is no need to worry about bad weather. Except for the north-south journey, which still requires flying, east-west can float fixedly in that space after leaving the ground. Passengers sit comfortably in the plane, look out the window, and admire all the scenes on the colorful earth. When you see your destination, you descend. A trip around the world only takes twenty-four hours.

At that time, one floating plane in the east and one floating plane in the west will be lined up and cover the sky.

Finally, I have to declare that I am a person without any scientific knowledge. This article is, of course, extremely absurd in the current era, but it may have some value after a few more years. Please readers don't laugh at my delusion.

### The Whereabouts of Floating Capital

— Ya Mu

According to Minister Yu’s report, the government issued US dollar bonds to absorb floating capital and stabilize finance in order to achieve a balanced budget. To seek a balanced budget, in addition to relying on tax increases and other methods, issuing bonds and absorbing floating capital is a legitimate means, and the government should have implemented it long ago. Mr. Lou Tongsou's speech was also largely the same. Some say: Taxes are already heavy, it is best to avoid adding them. Let's make a couplet as follows:

Times are difficult and years are barren, all industries are empty, thinking of your people, it is difficult to increase the burden, the rice lost is used to compensate for the tax income;

Open the source and reduce expenditure, sing in unison, support our government in issuing gold bonds, the floating away should know to float back quickly. (Floating, floating capital.)

### New Interpretation of Thick-Skinnedness and Black-Heartedness

— Dan Meng

Since Li Zongwu's book *Thick Black Theory* was published, it has spread very quickly, and everyone says it is an immortal book; because this booklet not only reveals the true character and true heart of heroes throughout history, but also reveals the most practical principles of life philosophy.

Of course, what he talked about was only the methods and techniques of how to succeed and become prominent, "Small is small kindness, big is big kindness." The content is nothing more than narrating how people with thick faces and black hearts seize power, how to grasp wealth, and how to seek fame. It is a textbook for ambitious people. As for us, the petty citizens who do not hope to be named in history books, it originally seemed that there was no need to study thickness and blackness.

But the fact is not the case. My friend A, who was originally a writer of comic verses, was down and out and could not even find a wooden rice bowl, so he set up a character splitting stall at the post office entrance, also deceiving fools and women. My relative B, whose old occupation was a newspaper reporter, was laid off for half a year. He prepared some money to get a license to make a living by taking photos at small docks to be a mobile photographer, deceiving rural people, taking photos for their national ID cards. And Professor C, who had been a lecturer in the chemistry department for nearly ten years, had to send several of his children to the Huihan Elementary School to get free education, and he himself went to grab the courses at the affiliated high school.

These all show that thick-skinnedness and black-heartedness are the lowest survival strategies in our environment, and are not as necessary as Li said only for those seeking victory, but even to "live in poverty" one must first study thickness and blackness.

### Great Changes in People's Hearts

— Guo

A few years later in Shanghai, a man on a tram gave his seat to a woman. She fainted. After waking up, she thanked him, and he fainted.

### "The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree"

— Wei Han

This is a magnificent and magnificent poem, a heartwarming story. Although in terms of time, it is already a long-separated "Warring States" period, it still deeply arouses our emotional resonance today, thousands of years later.

At the end of the Zhou Dynasty, the heroes separated and ruled. In the turmoil, many legendary figures such as wandering knights and debaters were born, and many generous and tragic historical sites were formed on these figures. The author of "The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree" drew his writing material from here.

The production of a historical drama is not an easy task. Although history has already prepared ready-made materials for us, because a drama is not a stereotyped record, it cannot simply repeat the historical facts mechanically. And the history of a certain era must have the historical background that formed the historical facts at that time. This cannot come from the playwright's imagination and false creation; nor can it be forced to put on a modern coat. Therefore, in addition to being faithful to historical facts, an artistic tailoring skill is also needed to transform the dead records into a living and organized story. "The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree" is such a successful work.

If we say that the preparation of the script of "The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree" is the success of Mr. Guo Moruo; then giving it life and concretizing it on the stage, completely realizing its performance, this will be the achievement of the director, Mr. Ying Yunwei.

The essence of the original work, under his refined technique, can be promoted and displayed on the stage. Especially in the first and fourth acts, that kind of emotion-filled, poetic atmosphere fully demonstrates the director's talent.

### More on Pen Names

— Lan Gan

People write articles, and instead of using their real name, they create a pen name. There are generally two reasons for this: one is because they feel that using their real name directly may be inconvenient. For example, the author of the famous children's book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" was a mathematician at a university. He was touched by a sudden whim and wrote that masterpiece, but he himself did not know it: later, the original manuscript was read by his friend, who was very surprised and wanted to take it to publish it, but he thought that writing such things was very incompatible with his identity as a mathematics professor at the university, so he falsely entrusted another pen name to publish it, and it was immediately warmly welcomed by readers - especially children's readers, and, unexpectedly, that thing that was "inconvenient" to be associated with his real name made his reputation in human history far better known than his research in mathematics.

Another reason for using a pen name is because the author wants to use it to commemorate something. There are many examples of this. For example, some people say. The "Lu" character in Mr. Lu Xun's pen name means to commemorate his mother.

Just like many other things, the initial use of pen names was not a bad thing; however, later, after being used by some speculative and opportunistic merchants, the original meaning of using pen names was tarnished a lot. It is said that there was such a joke in the literary world: there was such a person who used two pen names, one pen name to write creations, and one pen name to write criticisms; so, a one-man show of self-pulling and self-singing, self-promoting and self-praising was staged; and was finally exposed. - Naturally, this is quite disgusting.

### Ode to the War Ghost

— Sun John

Shi Jun, a member of the Qing Dynasty's Manchu royal family, has a poem praising the war ghost, which makes concerned people shed tears when they read it. The words say: "Join the army in the desert to seek a title, before reaching the general, the head has been cut off, the heroic spirit of a hundred battles remains crying in the wild, several families have nightmares and people are sad in the boudoir. The battle clouds are thick and the camp is far away, the border moon is desolate and the old fort is autumn. Who collects the white bones in horse leather? The blood stains are messy, dyeing the helmet." The first two sentences are particularly poignant. Wang Changling of the Tang Dynasty was accustomed to writing about the miserable situation of the borderland outside the Great Wall. When he saw this article, would he also stand by and hold his hands?

### Establishing Oneself as King

— Ji Shui

"Man's greed is like a snake swallowing an elephant," this is a saying, meaning that man's heart will never be satisfied.

Really, beggars only want a place to shelter from the wind and rain, and three meals of coarse tea and light meals, and they will be satisfied; but when they really get it, they want abundant food and clothing and a comfortable place to live. Like us who do things perfunctorily, when we lose our "job", we only want to have a job, and we will not care about salary and rank, but after working for a while, we will start to express dissatisfaction with the position and salary.

Therefore, in history, there are people like Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han, who became emperors and wanted to become immortals even more. Since the Republic of China, people like Yuan Shikai, who was already the president of the whole country, were not satisfied, and had to put on the "dragon robe" to make the people call him "long live," so that he could feel that he was "the world."

On weekdays, when I talked to my friends about these historical traces, I often tried to explain them by relating them to the times. I said, "If it were now, there would be none of these things."

But Franco actually ennobled himself as "Head of State." Moreover, "before Franco loses his ability, he will never establish another king." Does this represent a historical reaction or a turning point in the times?

### Speaking of Xiehouyu (Chinese Allegorical Sayings)

— Ting Song

"Zheng Wu being appointed prime minister, one can know the current state of affairs," as the saying goes, this is what is called a xiehouyu. How do today's politicians compare to Zheng Wu? When I was thirteen, I saw a letter from my elder brother's friend, filled with discussions of prices. Among them was the phrase "the back of the Prime Minister." I stared blankly, not understanding its meaning. I asked my elder brother, who said, "Why don't you read the biography of Han Xin in the Records of the Grand Historian? You will then understand the brilliance of this saying." Indeed, in Han Xin's biography, Kuai Tong persuaded Han Xin to rebel against Emperor Gao of Han, saying, "The worth of the Prime Minister's back is inestimable." I was deeply surprised that this letter, with its rather crude language, suddenly contained such an elegant xiehouyu. I am now seventy-three years old, having completed a full cycle of the zodiac, and this saying is still deeply imprinted in my mind, impossible to forget. The power of words is truly great. The other day, at a dinner party with friends, I happened to mention this incident. A friend suddenly said, "You are fond of discussing couplets. Are you also aware that Zeng Xiangxiang (Zeng Guofan) has a xiehou couplet of unparalleled brilliance?" I replied, "I have never heard of it." My friend then recited the couplet: "Return, oh return! The moonlit pavilion, the shadows of flower petals; cannot proceed! The wind and rain of Chu, the call of the partridge." This couplet was composed by Wen Zheng Gong (Zeng Guofan) as a lament for his brother, who died in the Sanhe disaster. Apart from the words "flower petals," which allude to the story of Emperor Ming of Tang and the flower art pavilion, concerning brothers, the entire couplet is exceptionally sublime. And the phrase "cannot proceed, brother" is commonly known. Used as a xiehouyu, it makes people, upon recitation, feel as if the soul has returned. The moonlit night, the Chu sky, the sound of birds, the shadows of flowers, the utmost brotherly affection, fill the lines. It is as if there is someone here, about to call out. If not for Wen Zheng's masterful brush, how could he paint such vivid images and sounds, so comprehensive and thorough?

### Literary and Art Scene

The National Conservatory of Music held informal concert charity practice performances in the main auditorium of its Jiangwan campus on the 28th of last month and the 3rd of this month. The program included piano, violin, and cello solos, as well as various vocal solos, with generally good results. The public performance is scheduled for mid-May at the Lyceum Theatre.

Recently, someone concerned about the future of culture has written "A Fundamental Policy for Cultural Governance," hoping to use a business approach to alleviate the hardships faced by culture, gathering opinions from various individuals. Mr. Gu Lijiang has generously funded the printing, widely distributing it to various cultural and educational circles, and welcomes newspapers and magazines to reprint and discuss it, for the sake of wider dissemination. It is also entrusted to the International Publishing House (Distribution Office, 7 Qinghai Road) for sale at cost, priced at 500 yuan per copy, so that those who have not received a complimentary copy can purchase it.

"Hiroshima," a famous work by the American author John Hersey, has been praised by American book critics as the most moving non-fiction work of 1946. The book, translated by Huang Jiayin, editor of Xifeng, has already sold out its first edition, and the second edition is now available. The general distribution office is Xifeng Society, 186 Dazhou Road, Shanghai.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"You... you don't... understand... my pain... either?" After three or four minutes, Jin Aili, lowering her head and trying her best to hold back her crying, finally blurted out this fragmented sentence in a very low voice.

This moved Lao Zhu. He turned his head in surprise, staring at Jin Aili, whose face had turned very pale.

"Don't be so upset! Let's say I was wrong, okay?"

The woman glanced at him with resentful eyes.

"Do you think Lao Zhu is not as good as Xu Fatty and Xiao Shen?" She took a breath and asked softly, still with her head lowered.

Lao Zhu saw her pathetic look and felt a little compassion in his heart, but he couldn't help but want to laugh.

"Is he treating you well?" He used another question as a reply.

"Not bad, Lao Zhu!" She suddenly became more excited, raising her face and staring affectionately at him. "He said that he would officially marry me when we get to Guiyang. Do you think he's lying to me?"

"Of course, I can't guarantee that, but I don't dare to talk nonsense." He gestured, stopping Jin Aili, who was about to interject. "In short, you don't have to think too far ahead! Now, you first tell me, how much money did he give you?"

Mentioning this point, Jin Aili felt truly comforted in her heart.

"He gave me a diamond ring." She raised her right hand and waved it, but Lao Zhu didn't look at the sparkling thing. "And five hundred US dollars."

Lao Zhu nodded and picked up the soy milk to drink.

"When we get to Guiyang, he promised to give me another million yuan to buy two houses." She was truly open with Lao Zhu, and Lao Zhu remained silent; so she felt embarrassed. "Lao Zhu! Why don't you say something? Tell me! Do you think he will be like Xiao Shen again?"

"What do you think of him?" Lao Zhu put down the glass and asked with a smile.

"He's an old man, he should be more honest than young people." Jin Aili's viewpoint was representative of most dancing girls. "I knew him when I was in Hong Kong, but he didn't have money then, now..."

"Now he's too rich! Isn't that right? Aili." Zhu Zhaonian said jokingly: "However, you have to be careful, rich old men are not more well-behaved than young men! Besides, you should understand where his money comes from? He uses public vehicles for big business. True, everything is chaotic in our country, and maybe it won't be exposed for the time being, but who can guarantee that in the future? So, Aili, you don't need to look too far ahead. Take this opportunity to get some money from him and escape in comfort. Wouldn't that be good?" (37)
