Sun told reporters, "I feel a great responsibility upon assuming this position. However, soldiers must obey orders. I will uphold the Central Government's intentions, cooperate with the full mobilization order, and do my utmost to serve the country loyally. As for the current situation, it is becoming increasingly clear. The Communist bandits' blind faith in military force and their betrayal of the nation and its people are unforgivable. Their fate of 'committing many acts of wickedness will lead to their downfall' has long been sealed. As the saying goes, 'Those who win the people prosper; those who lose the people perish.' There is no need for us to elaborate on the Communist bandits' future."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Military News Agency reports that Tang Enbo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army Headquarters, went to the front lines in Xuzhou to direct operations after taking office. It is now learned that Mr. Tang returned to Nanjing from Xuzhou a few days ago and officially reported to the headquarters for duty on the 18th.

### Huludao: Current Situation of the Only Major Port in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Huludao, 19th] Huludao is currently the only largest port in the Northeast, with a position more important than Yingkou and second only to Lüda. However, Lüda has not yet been recovered, so currently only Huludao and Yingkou in the Northeast are available for maritime transport. A group from the military support delegation arrived here this morning. The reporter surveyed the area and found that the island slants into the Bohai Sea, with boundless sea and sky, and green waters and mountains complementing each other. The port has six docks that can accommodate ships of 10,000 tons or more. The first dock was damaged by the Communist bandits and is being repaired. According to Zhu Chongguang, deputy director of the Port Authority, the repair project will cost 40 billion yuan and is expected to be completed within the year. Currently, the materials entering and leaving the port are extremely limited. The materials entering are partly equipment from the Resources Committee, and the materials leaving are coal from the committee's Fuxin coal mine, which totaled 20,000 tons in April and has fallen to over 7,000 tons in May. Customs revenue is approximately 60 million per month, almost entirely from state-owned enterprise taxes. The island currently has more than 4,500 residents and more than 50 stores. The comfort delegation held a comfort meeting here today, first presenting a flag to the port commander, He Shili, and inviting people from all walks of life to hold a symposium. Port officials unanimously believe that the port should be utilized urgently. It is said that the port's dock facilities are complete, with a draft of 28 feet, and can simultaneously dock five Liberty ships of 10,000 tons or more and seven ships of 3,000 to 5,000 tons. Most ships currently sailing to the Northeast dock at Qinhuangdao, but because that port is crowded with Kailuan coal, ships often have to anchor offshore, which is not as good as sailing directly to Huludao, which can save a section of railway transport. In addition, the warehouse capacity of Huludao Port is very large and can be utilized, and the Jin-Hulu Road branch line runs directly to the dock, making loading and unloading extremely convenient.

### Henan-Hubei Comfort Delegation Completes Mission and Returns to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Henan-Hubei Comfort Delegation, led by Liu Wendao, returned to Nanjing on the Jiangtai steamer this afternoon after departing from Hankou.

It held six comfort rallies and many symposiums and small group discussions, which greatly benefited the morale of the people and soldiers at the front.

### Du Yuming Arrives in Ping, Will Fly to Shanghai and Then to the United States in the Next Few Days

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] According to the Election General Office, Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Committee Election and Recall Law stipulates that "incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in electoral districts within their jurisdiction or where their offices are located must resign five months before the election period." The so-called "before the election period" has been clarified by the Election General Office as before the day of the vote. The voting date for the current Legislative Committee election has been set by the General Election Office as December 21st to 23rd. Counting five months forward from December 21st to July 20th, officials who are restricted by law and wish to run for Legislative Committee must submit their resignation before the 20th of this month. After the 21st, the deadline will have passed, and they will be unable to participate in the current Legislative Committee election.

### Economic Reform Plan Has Many Deletions and Revisions in Content

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The economic reform plan has been reviewed by the National Economic Commission's comprehensive group many times and will soon be finalized and submitted to the general meeting to be held on the 21st. It is heard that the main revisions are to include the "grain" item in the "agriculture" item, the "guide idle funds into the right track" item in the "price" item, and part of the "improve the treatment of public school personnel" item in the "price" item, while the part related to political issues will be deleted. After repeated deletions and revisions, the plan is much simpler than the original.

### Democratic Socialist Party Holds Standing Committee Meeting Today, Will Discuss Participation in General Election

[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to hold a Central Standing Committee meeting today, which is the last standing committee meeting before the National Congress. Jiang Yuntian and Wang Shixian have come to Shanghai from Nanjing and will submit a detailed report on the negotiations on participation in the general election and participation in local government. Furthermore, the rumor that the Democratic Socialist Party's National Congress has been postponed is not true. The party's general program will be approved at the meeting.

### Zhang Dongsun Talks About the Current Situation

[Our Dispatch] After Zhang Dongsun arrived in Shanghai, a reporter visited him. Mr. Zhang was unwilling to talk much about matters between parties. Regarding the domestic situation, he believes that the opportunities for negotiated peace in the past have been repeatedly lost, which has led to the current situation. The path of negotiation is currently cut off, but it may not be permanently cut off. After World War II, all countries have post-war problems, and there are international factors that are difficult to resolve in the short term. The world has been divided into two, and the United States and the Soviet Union are both busy consolidating their spheres of influence. There is no possibility of coordination between the two countries, but they are unlikely to engage in military conflict in the near future. In this situation, countries caught in the middle are the most painful, and China is one of the victims. As far as the attitude of the United States is concerned, it is in principle to support the National Government, but how to assist is another question. General Wedemeyer's visit to China this time is probably to solve this problem.

### Wuzhi, Northern Henan, Captured

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th] Wuzhi, in northern Henan, was captured by Communist bandits at approximately 8:00 AM on the 18th.

### Wedemeyer Passes Through Honolulu; Reportedly Studying Marshall Plan Expansion to China and Korea; Rumor of US Preparing Far East Evacuation Plan

[United Press, Honolulu, 10th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, en route to Nanjing, stated last night while passing through here: "The six-member committee I lead will study whether it is possible to extend the Marshall Aid to Foreign Countries Plan to the areas controlled by the Communist Party in China and Korea." Mr. Wedemeyer refused to disclose the exact details, only saying that the plan is currently under consideration. Mr. Wedemeyer and his party will continue their journey to Nanjing this morning at 9:00 AM to handle their special mission to assist China.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] General Wedemeyer and his party will land at the Nanjing University Campus airfield at 4:00 PM on the 22nd. Mr. Wedemeyer will stay in Nanjing for a maximum of two weeks. It was originally planned to use the US military advisory group office at No. 5 Haining Road as his residence. In order to avoid General Rooks having to move and to facilitate meetings with the Ambassador at any time, it has been decided to change the location to the US Ambassador's residence at No. 84 Shanghai Road. The Ambassador and his staff have been very busy in recent days, having roughly planned Mr. Wedemeyer's activities in Nanjing and the people he will meet. However, the specific program will be determined after Mr. Wedemeyer himself arrives here.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] According to a dispatch from the Howard News Service correspondent in Japan, the United States has prepared a secret plan to evacuate Americans residing in China and Korea in the event of an incident. In view of the deteriorating situation in China and the stalemate in the US-Soviet Joint Commission in Korea, senior US Army and Navy leaders in the Far East have prepared a plan to quickly evacuate Americans residing in China or Korea, mainly by air transport. It is said that the US Air Force in the Far East can evacuate hundreds of thousands of Americans from any region in the East within 30 days.

### Establishment of the Pingjin Autonomy Association Initiated by Famous Figures in Education, Such as Hu Shi, Aims to Promote Local Democracy

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] The Citizens' Autonomy Promotion Association, organized by famous figures in education and industry in Pingjin, was established in Ping today. Hu Shi repeatedly stated: "This organization is not a national political party, nor is it a local political party. It is just a gathering of ordinary citizens with occupations in their spare time. We want to gather together from time to time to talk about local public welfare undertakings and study reform plans. We are all interested in civic autonomy and want to train ourselves to do some work to promote local democracy." The inaugural meeting of the association was held at the Europe and America Students Association this afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than ten members from Tianjin also came to participate, with a total of more than sixty members in attendance. The meeting was chaired by a presidium consisting of Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, and Zhang Boling. Hu Shi first gave the opening speech, saying: "We believe that the learning and training of democratic politics must start with the society that we care about most. We, the citizens of Pingjin, hope to start our democratic life's learning and training from the autonomous work of the two cities. Urban people should recognize the importance of cities, use the superior conditions of cities, conquer the special difficulties of cities, and work together for cities." He then explained the association's tasks as: (1) investigating municipal administration and citizen life; (2) studying the draft of the Citizen Autonomy Law or City Charter for reference by the whole country; (3) discussing issues related to municipal administration and citizen rights; (4) learning and training democratic life and participating in various public welfare undertakings to promote political and economic improvement. Zhang Boling then gave a speech, saying: "In the past, we were superstitious about using education to save the country, but the constant political turmoil destroyed all of our educational efforts. So, in the last ninety days, I had a great realization, that is, without political stability, nothing can be done well. Now everyone is automatically participating in this meeting, which shows that long-term lessons have made everyone have a common awareness." Zhang also said that the association is not a party organization and hopes to have educational value for the people of the whole country. Li Zhuchen and Hu Xian also gave speeches one after another, and finally discussed the constitution, declaration, and proposals, and conducted elections.

### Chairman Orders Additional Appropriation of Emergency Relief Funds for Siping Street

[Central News Agency, Panjin, 18th] The Central Government has decided to increase the emergency relief funds for Siping from 1 billion national currency to 500 million circulating coupons (equivalent to 5.75 billion national currency). Chairman Chiang's telegram has arrived here, and the Executive Headquarters is currently formulating specific relief measures for the Siping plan.

### Ambassador Receives Reporters on the Anniversary of Presenting Credentials

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The 19th is the anniversary of Ambassador Stuart's presentation of his credentials in Guling. Our reporter met this kind old man at his residence. He was full of energy and walked as briskly as ever. When talking about the events of this day last year, he could not help but laugh heartily. He has been very busy these days and has only now been able to rest and spend a quiet weekend. The Ambassador did not talk about actual issues. According to a friend of his, General Wedemeyer's work did not infringe on the Ambassador's powers and responsibilities, and he had no objections to it. The Ambassador's decision on whether to stay or leave depends on whether it is beneficial to the Chinese people. The rumors caused by General Wedemeyer's new mission were probably caused by the Chinese people's lack of understanding of American character and political style.

### Bullitt to Arrive in Shanghai This Week and Visit the Northeast After Transferring to Nanjing

[Our Dispatch] Life Magazine's Shanghai office reports that former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, will leave Japan for Shanghai this week. Mr. Bullitt plans to stay in China for a week. In addition to deciding to visit Nanjing, the rest of his inspection plan, including visits to the Northeast and North China, can only be determined after arriving in Shanghai.

[United Press, New York, 18th] Howard News Service diplomatic reporter Simms wrote on the 18th that a well-experienced European diplomat behind the "Iron Curtain" believes that the Soviet Union's decision to boycott the Paris Conference indicates that the Soviet Union will implement more clever plans not only in Manchuria but also in Asia. Since the Soviet Union is determined to divide the world, its goal will be to expand its territory as much as possible. The Soviet Union also knows that in the long run, the Far East is more important to the United States than Europe. The importance of the Far East to the Soviet Union is no less than that. The order of Soviet action will be the nine provinces of the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, North China, Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, Korea, and even India.

### Communist Bandits in the Northeast Capture Shuangyang

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 19th] Communist bandits captured Shuangyang, and one unit advanced to Xin'anbao, thirty kilometers southeast of Changchun. In addition, the Yantongshan Communist bandits gathered north on the 18th, and the National Army is fighting them separately. The fighting in the Jichang and other areas is bound to be prolonged. The Communist bandits are planning to use "fluid warfare tactics" to buy time in an attempt to "wear down" the National Army.

### Peng Xuepei Goes to Qinghai

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 18th] After Politicial Commisioner Peng Xuepei left Lanzhou, he visited Xinglong Mountain yesterday. On the morning of the 18th, he went to Qinghai for sightseeing by special military plane, accompanied by Ma Jizhou, director of the Gansu Civil Affairs Department. He is scheduled to return to Lanzhou on the 21st and then go to Yumen and Dunhuang for inspections. If time permits, he also plans to visit Xinjiang.

### A Batch of Former Kwantung Army Still Roams the Border Between China and Korea; No Response to Our Government's Surrender Offer

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] 50,000 former Japanese Kwantung Army soldiers are still roaming Changbai Mountain at the border between Korea and Northeast China. This is the news brought back by Japanese people who were sent back to Japan from Northeast China. They said that these Japanese troops have not responded to the Chinese government's surrender request. It is said that the remaining units of the Japanese Kwantung Army are very well equipped, have solid defenses, and have good supplies. According to Jushun Tsugiro, a Japanese returnee, 40,000 former Japanese Kwantung Army soldiers and 18,000 Japanese refugees in Dunhua on the Sino-Korean border went to Changbai Mountain when Japan surrendered. They were all fully armed, carrying 5,000 horses and enough food and ammunition for two years. They built fortifications in the deep mountains, dug caves, and the entire force was divided into groups, each with 2,000 people, with five miles between groups, using radio to maintain communication. When the Chinese government troops entered Dunhua on November 2, 1946, they used radio to notify the Japanese troops in the mountains to come out and surrender, but the Japanese troops did not respond to the Chinese government's notification. Later, the Chinese government troops withdrew from Dunhua due to pressure from the Communist army, so contact between the outside world and the mysterious army was interrupted. It was also said that the mysterious army seemed to have a food shortage in April this year, but he refused to disclose the army's activities or whether it would join the Communist army.

### National Army Units Converge Separately: Jining and Sheng Counties Relieved; Southwestern Shandong Still in Combat

[Our Jining Dispatch, 19th] The focus of the Shandong battles remains in southwestern Shandong. Fierce fighting continues in Yanzhou, Zou County, Yangshanji, and Jinxiang. The siege of Jining has been lifted. National forces advancing south from Tai'an have crossed the Wen River and reached Wucun, poised to reunite with National forces moving north from Tengzhou.

[Our Tengzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Battle of Yanzhou is unfolding fiercely. With the arrival of substantial reinforcements and the completion of new deployments, the National Army is absolutely confident of victory. Military sources here firmly believe that good news will arrive within a week. The frontline report from the 19th indicates that large contingents of troops, stretching from Feicheng and Tai'an in the north to Xintai and Mengyin in the south, have crossed Anjiazhuang, Wucun, Sishui, and the area east of Teng and Zou counties. They have joined forces with National troops stationed in Jining, Yanzhou, Qufu, Zou, and Teng, forming a large encirclement. Chen Yi's main force of seven columns is now completely contained. The decisive battle that could determine the overall outcome of the Shandong campaign is underway. As for Liu Bocheng's five columns, apart from the Yangshanji battle where two divisions have already been annihilated by our forces, the remnants of the remaining two columns are still being pursued by National forces. The one column that attacked Jinxiang has been blocked west of the city at Majiamiao and the area ten li north of the city by National forces. Additionally, the two columns that joined Chen Yi's forces in attacking Jining have been subjected to relentless attacks by National forces from both inside and outside the city, and are on the verge of collapse, retreating northeast of the city. The siege of Jining has been lifted.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Shandong Communist bandits have suffered a complete and comprehensive collapse. National forces from various directions, including those between Tai'an and Yanzhou, Zou County and Teng County, and Teng County and Lincheng, successfully converged on the afternoon of the 19th. Traffic between Xuzhou and Jinan has been restored once again. The National Army has not only completely shattered the Communist bandits' ambition to sweep through Shandong with a force of thirteen columns, besiege Yanzhou, and cut off traffic between Xuzhou and Jinan and the Longhai Railway, but has also rapidly deployed five lines of blockade in the Jiajia Mountain area east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to the west bank of the Xin River, weaving a tight encirclement. The Communist bandits' East China Field Army, consisting of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th columns, have become turtles in a jar, ripe for complete annihilation. On the afternoon of the 19th, Dushanji was recovered. The National forces are currently coordinating with those in Juye (not yet fallen) and Heze to eliminate the remaining Communist bandits in that area. The offensive by the Communist bandits attacking Jining was thwarted on the 19th. Furthermore, on the 18th, National forces discovered a grenade factory southeast of Sishui in Pipa Mountain, seizing over two hundred crates of grenades and six thousand catties of explosives.

Liu and Chen Bandit Remnants Merge: National Army Prepares to Encircle and Annihilate Them

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 19th] In the past week, the focus of the Shandong battles has shifted entirely to southern and western Shandong. On the southern Shandong front, of Chen Yi's ten columns, the 3rd, 6th, and 8th columns remain scattered in Juxian, Dadian, Yishui, Zibo, Qingshipu, and the area west of Hangjia Town and Yangliu Dian in Laiwu and Xintai. The remaining seven columns have fled south en masse. Among these seven columns, two crossed the Wen River from Tai'an and Feicheng on the 13th and besieged Ningyang. On the 14th, National forces in Ningyang concentrated their forces and broke through to Yanzhou. On the same day, three columns that fled north from Yi and Zaozhuang attacked Teng County with two columns, and Zou County with one column, starting on the 14th. A small portion of the bandits managed to break into Teng County, but they were completely annihilated by the defending forces after a strong counterattack. The two columns that fled west from central Shandong to attack Yanzhou have had their rear supply lines cut off after National forces from central Shandong retook Sishui, Wucun, and other locations. As of the 19th, these bandit forces were still fighting desperately. On the western Shandong front, Liu Bocheng's forces have been attacking Yangshanji, Dushanji, and Liuyingji since the 13th. Except for the latter two, where National forces have broken out, Yangshanji is still being firmly defended by National forces. In the past week, through combined land and air operations by National forces and attacks from both inside and outside, the bandit forces have suffered unprecedented casualties. On the 17th, Liu's two columns changed course and advanced towards Jining. At the same time, two columns of Chen Yi's forces, totaling about 100,000 men, besieged the city walls. The intensity of their firepower surpassed even that of the attack on Yangshanji. However, as of the evening of the 19th, the city walls remained intact. Failing in their objectives, the Communist bandits began fleeing west of Yanzhou on the 17th. In summary, although Liu Bocheng's forces from the west and Chen Yi's forces from the east have merged, they are deeply trapped in the National Army's multiple encirclements and are far from their bases, facing severe supply difficulties. The great annihilation battle outside Yanzhou will soon become the common burial ground for both Chen and Liu.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 19th] National forces advancing into the Yishan mountain area captured Tonglingguan, the most stubborn stronghold behind enemy lines, on the 18th.

### Truth About the Beitashan Incident: Participating Aircraft Did Have Red Star Markings; Local Chieftain's Son Witnessed the Event

[United Press, Dihua, 17th] Chilerqi Ma, the 26-year-old son of Batu, chieftain of the Kazak tribe in Beitashan, and a cavalryman, told a United Press reporter today: On the 5th of this month, he witnessed three Outer Mongolian aircraft dropping thirteen bombs on Beitashan over a period of two and a half hours, killing one Kazak soldier and over ten horses. One Outer Mongolian aircraft was shot down by Kazak soldiers using machine guns. It was a twin-engine aircraft with red star markings. At the time, the enemy aircraft were covering 200 infantrymen in combat with 100 Kazak soldiers. Outer Mongolian military commander Colonel Sagmi was wounded by a grenade and subsequently captured and executed. He was wearing a Soviet medal, awarded for his success in resisting Japan. Among the enemy spoils captured by the Kazak soldiers were fifteen Soviet and German-style light machine guns, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, seventy grenades, and four gold medals with a relief of Stalin's profile. There was also a Mongolian-language combat order issued by Choibalsan, Premier of the Mongolian People's Republic, instructing Sagmi's unit to occupy Beitashan. Other spoils included photos of Stalin and Choibalsan. Chilerqi Ma and his party came to Dihua on the 6th of this month, the day after the conflict, to report to the authorities. This report has been confirmed by the Chinese military authorities in Dihua, who stated that the July 5th incident was just one of many similar minor conflicts. Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, told a United Press reporter that the situation in Beitashan is currently calm.

### Xinjiang Traitors Disrupting Peace

[United Press, Dihua, 19th] Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated, with an area of over 600,000 square miles and a population of only 1.2 million. One-third of its territory is currently under the control of Ahmatjan, leader of the rebel party. This one-third is the richest area in the province in terms of food and mineral resources, centered on Ili, Tacheng, and Altai. The first two districts border the Soviet Union, while the Altai district is adjacent to Outer Mongolia. The origin of the rebellion dates back to November 7, 1944, in the Ili district capital. After more than a year of war, a peace agreement was signed in Dihua last July. However, the Chinese authorities have not been able to control the rebel areas, and Chinese people are not allowed to enter these areas. Ahmatjan claims he is not a separatist, but seeks political reform, and once implemented, will fully respect Chinese sovereignty. The Chinese authorities accuse Ahmatjan of seeking to establish a pro-Soviet provincial government and have stated that he has not complied with the agreement for the past year, nor does he intend to comply. The traitors are attacking the highways connecting Xinjiang with the outside world, the unrest is gradually spreading, and they are demanding the replacement of the newly appointed provincial chairman, Masud Sabri.

### Soviet Union Opposes US Proposal: Japanese Peace Conference Unlikely; China to State Position at Appropriate Time

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th (Radio): Due to Soviet opposition, the preliminary meeting of the eleven-nation Japanese peace conference cannot begin next month. Washington officials have expressed they have given up hope that the meeting will be held as scheduled. At the same time, the British have also advocated for postponement.

The Soviet Embassy in the United States lodged a protest with the US State Department today, stating: "Assistant US Secretary of State Hilldring's statement that he would consult with the embassy personnel of the other ten member states of the Far Eastern Commission on the issue of their countries' participation in the Japanese peace treaty on the 11th is inaccurate, as Soviet embassy personnel were neither invited nor did they participate in this discussion."

Another dispatch: The US government has recently responded to the Soviet allegations. It is claimed: Soviet representatives were among those invited to a meeting on July 11 between the US Assistant Secretary of State and diplomatic representatives from various countries of the Far Eastern Commission, but did not attend.

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 19th] Sources say: China will submit a formal reply to the US proposal to convene a preliminary Japanese peace conference at an appropriate time, and will simultaneously issue a statement to clarify our country's position. It is understood that the existence of the Big Four veto power makes the voting method one of the decisive factors as to whether the conference can open satisfactorily. While the Soviet Union advocates for first convening a foreign ministers' meeting, the United States proposes that the eleven nations convene directly and adopt a two-thirds majority vote. The two sides are quite far apart. In order for the Japanese peace treaty to reach a conclusion as soon as possible, China may have exchanged views with relevant countries on this point. It is also reported that our side will suggest a compromise voting method, adopting a two-thirds majority vote, but this two-thirds majority must include the Big Four. We have no preconceptions about the date of the meeting, but hope that it will be held as soon as possible under the premise that all eleven countries can participate. As for the issue of compensation for the Japanese puppet industrial equipment and materials lost by our country in the Northeast in the event that the Soviet Union refuses to participate, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also studying the matter.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Regarding the United States' hope to begin the preliminary Japanese peace conference on August 19, the United Kingdom has today put forward a counter-proposal to postpone it, and also suggested that the Foreign Ministers of the Big Four personally lead their respective delegations. According to the State Department, the United Kingdom has now submitted a formal memorandum stating: Since the British Commonwealth is scheduled to hold a meeting in Canberra on August 26, it opposes convening the preliminary Japanese peace conference on August 19. It is understood that among the eleven members of the Far Eastern Commission, only the Netherlands has accepted the US proposal unconditionally. Australia and New Zealand hold the same position as the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union has not yet replied.

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 19th] The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce cabled Secretary of State Marshall on the 19th, requesting that the Japanese peace conference be held there. It said that the city was a major port for the departure of war personnel and supplies to the front lines during the war, so the Chamber of Commerce believes it would be very appropriate to sign the peace treaty there.

### Japanese Affairs Expert Discusses: A Japanese Peace Conference Method That Favors the US is Detrimental to Us

[Our Dispatch] A certain "Japanese affairs expert" recently told reporters: There are three ways to convene the Japanese peace conference, namely (1) convened by the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; (2) convened by the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission; and (3) the method currently advocated by the United States, with decisions made by a two-thirds majority vote of the participating countries. Under the first method, our country has one-quarter of the speaking rights and possesses veto power. Under the second method, our country has only one-eleventh of the speaking rights, but also has veto power. Under the last method, our country no longer has the power to veto. The United Kingdom can increase its speaking power due to the support of its territories. Our country's speaking power exists only in name. In the Japanese peace treaty, our country's interests are not consistent with those of the United States, so the issue of this method cannot be ignored. In terms of the treaty itself, our country has paid attention to two points in the past: First, the complete eradication of Japan's military power so that it does not become a threat to our country and the world. Second, the democratization of Japanese politics, but we do not advocate adopting a policy of retaliation. In future military clauses of the Japanese peace treaty, it will be easy to achieve due to the unified goals of the United Nations. Political democracy can also be gradually realized. However, in the past, our country's government and the public have not studied the economic sector of Japan enough, and there is still no accurate and detailed information that can be used as a reference for decision-making. In terms of Sino-Japanese trade, the nature of the goods should be analyzed in detail before deciding whether to import them, so as to seek mutual benefit. A general rejection of trade is an impractical solution in the current situation. In terms of the overall situation in the Far East, the situation in Korea deserves attention. If the United States and the Soviet Union break down in negotiations on Korea, the barriers in the Far East will become even more distinct. The current US foreign policy is a strategic guidance policy, and China, Japan, and Korea are links in the Eastern front. Wedemeyer's arrival can also be viewed from this perspective.

### Hoover Speaks in the House

Advocates for Separate Peace with Germany and Japan

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Former US President Hoover recently told the House Appropriations Committee: It is easier for the United States to negotiate a separate peace with Japan than with Germany, but Korea may need to be supervised for another 25 years. Since the Soviet Union is hindering progress in Europe and also hindering the unification of Korea, I advocate that the United States should negotiate a separate peace with Germany, so as to reduce the burden on taxpayers for supporting the Germans and the cost of the occupying forces. In short, as long as the Soviet Union's current attitude does not change, there will never be a solution. Therefore, on the Korean issue, if the Soviet Union occupies North Korea, we should strive to maintain South Korea ourselves.

### Luo Jialun's Speech in India: The Chinese View of Life

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 18th] Our Ambassador to India, Luo Jialun, delivered a speech on the Chinese view of life at the Rotary Club banquet last night and answered various questions about modern social problems in our country. The questioners were interested in our country's philosophy and life, and unanimously pointed out the similarities between the Chinese and Indian viewpoints, and the need for closer cultural contact between the two sides. Ambassador Luo's speech was extremely clear and concise, and the audience was moved. He said: "The Chinese people, in general, tend towards political moderation and prefer a gradual process of evolutionary reform." He deeply hoped that "all of us in the world will be able to use our wisdom in the future to create a civilization that has all the advantages of the Indian sari (Note: The sari is the clothing worn by Indian women. If worn properly, it is elegant and comfortable), and not a civilization of clothing that is so small as to make one suffocate. This kind of clothing restricts life and will eventually lead to tragedy."

### Rumor That Puyi Has Died

Committed Suicide in Changchun After "August 15th"

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] A former attendant in the puppet emperor Puyi's palace recently read a United Press telegram from Tokyo on the 17th regarding the news that Puyi had left Khabarovsk. The phrase "accompanied by his brother Pujie" is incorrect. He said: Puyi shot himself with a pistol at his residence in Changchun a few days after "August 15th." Note: Pujie graduated from the Japanese Army Academy and served as a major instructor at the puppet Manchukuo military officer school, marrying the daughter of a Japanese aristocrat, Saga Hiroko. His wife was detained by our side when the Japanese expatriates were repatriated.

### Naming Ceremony for the Anti-Japanese War Memorial City of Hengyang: Chairman Chiang Issues Special Instructions, Announcing the Meaning of "The Benevolent are Invincible" to the Nation

[Our Dispatch, Hengyang, 18th] At the naming ceremony for the Anti-Japanese War Memorial City of Hengyang, Chairman Chiang issued instructions in the following telegram: "During the eight years of the War of Resistance, there were over a hundred major battles and countless minor battles, but the Battle of Hengyang, in terms of its duration, the intensity of sacrifice, the magnitude of its impact, and the greatness of its contribution, was particularly shocking to the world. Since 1932, the Allied naval counteroffensive in the Pacific has been winning victory after victory. The Japanese, seeing their maritime transportation obstructed, planned to open up land transportation, hoping to reach southern Guangdong from the puppet Manchuria through the Beining Railway, Pinghan Railway, and Yuehan Railway. The Hengyang railway section in the middle was still in the hands of our army, so they spared no effort to mobilize their elite troops and launch a full-scale offensive. Starting in February of the 33rd year of the Republic, they mobilized ten divisions and several special units to attack from different directions. Our army was less well-equipped, but our morale was high, and we calmly fought back, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy everywhere. By late June of this year, the counties surrounding Hengyang had fallen one after another. The remaining troops of our 10th Army, covered in blood, defended this isolated city for as long as 48 days. This is a rare miracle in the world, and the most prominent manifestation and expression of the inherent moral spirit of our China. This is why local people have requested that Hengyang be designated as an Anti-Japanese War Memorial City. Mencius said, 'The benevolent are invincible.' He also said, 'A vast, flowing energy, born from the accumulation of righteousness, is supremely great and strong.' What our Chinese nation relies on to survive and prosper is the deep and far-reaching influence of the teachings of benevolence and righteousness for thousands of years? Now, as we hold the naming ceremony, I hereby cite this meaning to inform the people of the country and to show it to future generations. Chiang Kai-shek."

### Seeking the Return of Seized Items from Japan: Allied Headquarters Has Not Stipulated a Deadline; Requests Can Still Be Submitted After July

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Officials from the Compensation and Restitution Group of our delegation to Japan told reporters this morning: The group has so far processed 140 requests for the return of seized ships from Japan, and 25 requests for the return of machinery. They urged people in China to speed up these compensation claims and stressed that these claims must provide full and detailed evidence. It is claimed that requests can still be submitted after July, as Allied Headquarters has not set a deadline for this, nor has the Far Eastern Commission, the policy-making body. In August last year, the Far Eastern Commission stipulated that requests for the requisition of industrial and transport machinery and equipment found in Japan should not delay the transfer of machines and equipment to be used for compensation in general. However, items related to restitution claims that have already been received by Allied Headquarters must not be allocated as compensation materials before action is taken on the claims. On the other hand, compensation materials that have already been allocated to designated countries must not be listed as restitution items. They stressed that there is still no deadline. It is reported that among the 25 requests for the return of machinery, one is a paper mill that was moved from Guangzhou to Hokkaido by the Japanese during the war. It is generally believed to be the second largest in the world. Another request was submitted by the Northwest Industrial Corporation, including 3,000 pieces of machinery. Regarding the ship restitution requests, only five ships have been recovered, 40 have been sunk and need to be salvaged, and others need major repairs.

### Guangdong Sojourners in Beijing Reopen Disaster Relief Meeting

Elect Wang Yunwu and Others to Form Fundraising Committee

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 19th] The Guangdong Sojourners in Beijing Committee for Relief of Guangdong Flood Disaster held its second meeting at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at 4:00 PM on the 19th.

UNRRA headquarters and other organizations jointly sent 1,900 tons of rice. However, in terms of needs, the urgent relief portion requires 30,000 tons of rice. The post-flood loss recovery plan requires over 32,000 tons of rice and labor funds of over $45,900,790,000. Therefore, fundraising is currently being actively carried out.

### South China Sea Typhoon Moving North: May Strike Guangzhou and Shantou

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The South China Sea typhoon, at 8:00 AM on the 19th, had advanced to 20 degrees north latitude and 113 degrees east longitude, moving northward at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour.

### Canal Water Rises Sharply in Northern Jiangsu: 17 Breaches in Dike Along the Su-Si Section; Communist Bandits Seize the Opportunity to Sabotage, Making Rescue Difficult

[Our Dispatch, Zhenjiang, 19th] Due to continuous rain, the water level in the Yi, Mu, and Canal has risen sharply. There are as many as seventeen breaches in the canal dike along the Su-Si section. The authorities are currently rushing to repair the breaches day and night. The Yi River's surge is particularly fierce, with the water level in the Tanji area rising to 24.98 meters and continuing to rise. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau has mobilized hundreds of workers day and night to rush to the rescue. The northern banks of the Fangting and Bulao rivers have been flooded. Both sides of the canal dike are covered with water, making it impossible to collect soil. Furthermore, there are strong winds and huge waves, which are insurmountable by human effort. At the same time, there are nine breaches downstream of Tanji. The area was previously occupied by the Communist bandits, making it impossible to carry out engineering work. Now they are taking the opportunity to sabotage the rescue work, making it even more difficult. Governor Wang of Jiangsu Province and Director Dong of the Construction Department, in view of the fact that it is now during the flood season, and that a breach is truly worrying if the water level continues to rise, believe that flood prevention and rescue are the most urgent tasks in northern Jiangsu. They have telegraphed relevant counties to mobilize the people and collect materials to cooperate with the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to strive for repairs, and have also urgently telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Water Conservancy Department to request that the flood prevention funds be quickly allocated. In addition, they have already raised a large sum of money from the provincial treasury to be allocated to the Canal Engineering Bureau for application.

### Reports of Existing Commercial Firms Merging are Inaccurate

Statements from Finance Ministry Official

[Report from our Nanjing, 19th] An official from the Ministry of Finance denied rumors that the ministry plans to merge existing commercial firms. According to him: "The current market is changing rapidly, and speculation is harmful. The financial sector should undoubtedly bear some responsibility. While it is true that the number of existing commercial firms exceeds actual needs, and although some have made this suggestion, the ministry has no such plans. This is because it would be difficult to implement and standards would be impossible to determine. Taking Nanjing as an example, it is impossible to determine how many firms should be established based on subjective judgment or objective data. Furthermore, some firms are sound and well-funded, while others are weak and empty. Even among established firms, some are unstable, while newly established firms are often well-funded. Therefore, it is impossible to rigidly stipulate how many firms should be merged or how the mergers should be carried out. Such rumors are not credible."

### Weekly Forum: Pay Attention to the National Culture of Xinjiang!

— Zhu Yingpeng

Xinjiang was invaded by Mongolian troops, who had just seceded from the community of nations less than two years prior. The whole country was shocked. Recently, the secessionist movement in the Ili region has spread to Kashgar. Many Ili residents have joined the Soviet Union, and Soviet workers are mining in the Xinjiang border area. The situation in Dihua is tense, with frequent acts of terrorism. This series of continuous bad news makes the Chinese people more worried.

The entanglement of the Xinjiang problem initially stemmed from the cultural differences between the ethnic groups, which prevented them from understanding each other and created obstacles. In addition, the mishandling by successive political leaders inevitably led to disputes. Unfortunately, they were tempted by external forces. Those who are generally indecisive, short-sighted, and prone to reckless actions easily fall into their trap and are exploited without realizing it. Therefore, the secessionist movement is more worrying than the occupation of land. The Chinese people should pay special attention to it, and make preparations in advance. This responsibility lies not only with the government but must be shared by the people. The government is responsible for dealing with internal affairs, diplomacy, and military matters, so I will not discuss them here. From the people's perspective, the primary task should be to strengthen the unity between the mainland and the local ethnic groups. In other words, we must seek close connections with each other, achieve mutual understanding and mutual support, and achieve complete harmony, like hands and feet, inseparable.

The connection between the people is economic in terms of material things and cultural in terms of spirit. In the past, the people of the mainland and Xinjiang were very unfamiliar with each other. Although the provincial government of Xinjiang has moved towards reform after the victory, the exchange of economies between the two sides cannot be discussed for the time being due to the inconvenience of transportation. The work that needs to be carried out urgently and cannot be delayed any longer should be cultural exchange. Originally, culture is the precursor of politics, and politics cannot be separated from the basis of culture. The culture of Xinjiang is very different from that of the mainland. We know that its relationship is very important from various aspects such as history, geography, ethnicity, and religion. This is not only a touchstone for national unity within the country but also worthy of attention for the possible impact on the overall Asian situation and the future religious civilization of the world. We must help the government take steady and lasting measures in administration, and we must help the people of Xinjiang prepare to defend the country and cope with the future situation. We must first have a deep understanding of Xinjiang culture. At the same time, the people of Xinjiang must also have a deep understanding of mainland culture.

Speaking of Xinjiang culture, the period of the Han and Tang dynasties has become a thing of the past and cannot be traced. In recent times, we must first mention the Uyghur ethnic group. The Uyghur ethnic group is now the most populous ethnic group in Xinjiang. It is estimated that there are three million people (including Taranchi), accounting for 70% of the province's population. Therefore, it occupies the most important position in Xinjiang. The second is the Kazakh ethnic group, with a population of about 400,000. The former is the representative of the "settled country," and the latter is the representative of the "mobile country."

The Uyghur ethnic group is the ancient Huihe. During the Northern Song Dynasty, their descendants led other Turkic people to occupy Xinjiang and the entire Central Asia, establishing the Kara-Khanid Khanate, with its capital in today's Kashgar. Its cultural and military achievements were brilliant for a time. After the Arab Empire, it was the cultural leader of Central Asia. Today's Turkey—that is, the Turkic people—was just a small tribe in the far west at that time. Its culture has been maintained for a long time, up to the present, and is not affected by political changes. As for the Sak people, they are the best knights in the world and the typical nomadic people. Other ethnic groups such as Uzbek, Tajik, Kyrgyz, etc. (the total population is 150,000 people) all belong to the same system of culture. Therefore, in terms of politics, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were originally one part of the Chinese nation, but their culture is called Turkic Islamic culture. Their religion belongs to Islam, their language belongs to the Turkic family, and their customs and habits combine both.

The center of Turkic Islamic culture was the Kara-Khanid Khanate established by the Uyghur ethnic group in the past, and now it is the Republic of Turkey. In addition to Turkey and the ethnic groups in Xinjiang, there are also the Bashkir, Tatar, and Crimean autonomous regions within the Soviet Union, as well as the Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Azerbaijani, and Turkmen republics. The above nine republics, because they are affiliated with the Soviet Union, retain only their language and some customs. Everything else has been socialistized, and the original Islamic culture has no room for activity.

The current situation in Xinjiang is the intersection of three major forces. First, the political power exercised by the National Government; second, the Turkic Islamic culture of the people of this province and the Turkic-speaking ethnic movement, that is, the ideal of establishing Turkic-speaking ethnic autonomy; and third, the power of neighboring Soviet Union and the East Turkestan secessionist movement it supports. Today, the nine Turkic-speaking republics belonging to the Soviet Union are originally one family with the blood and culture of the Turkic-speaking ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Among them, the Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Turkmen republics have a total population of no less than 15 million, and their soil is adjacent to that of Xinjiang. The Soviet authorities' claim that "the Ili people who have joined the Soviet Union originally belonged to the Soviet people" in the report is worthy of deep thought. Conversely, can we say that the people of the five republics belonging to the Soviet Union originally belonged to the Chinese people? The situation in Xinjiang is so complicated that if we fail to handle it properly, the result will be very different. On the contrary, even if the environment is complex, we can still find a favorable path. It is up to people to make it happen, and those with clear vision will be able to understand and obtain it.

The origin of the Turkic-speaking ethnic autonomy movement began with the youth of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang being influenced by the "Pan-Turkic movement" and having ideals for the establishment of modern politics. In addition to the Uyghur ethnic group, the leading figures of the Kazakh ethnic group, in particular, are more earnest in their expectations for modern political construction and their emotions for national unity. They have witnessed the modern construction of the Turkic-speaking republics belonging to the neighboring Soviet Union and cannot help but feel envious, but they also know the sadness of being a vassal. They have not lost their heart of allegiance to the Central Government, but the negative feelings about the corruption of the provincial government in the past are not easy to eliminate for a while. Especially because the government lacks understanding of Xinjiang's inherent culture and its new ideals, it feels that there is not enough maintenance and support. This is the real key to the Xinjiang problem.

The current guiding principle of the government's politics in Xinjiang is probably to accept General Zhang Zhizhong's suggestion to implement democratization and modernization and to respect its inherent culture as the first priority. This is originally a wise measure and worthy of praise. Since we know that the focus of Xinjiang politics is on culture, we feel that if we think from the perspective of national unity, the effect of relying solely on the government's efforts to maintain it is still superficial and temporary. Both peoples must work together to make Xinjiang culture and mainland culture exchange and promote each other, and the cultural connection will generate emotions of mutual empathy and sharing of joys and sorrows between ethnic groups, so that they can achieve eternal separation.

The Uyghur culture once occupied a leading position in Central Asia, and it is still the oldest culture among the Turkic-Islamic ethnic groups. We certainly do not harbor any sense of superiority or inferiority, and we should have a heart of love. In particular, we should not repeat the mistakes of our predecessors in forcing Sinicization, which would mislead the goal. We should have a better understanding of the Kazakh ethnic group and eliminate all previous absurd misunderstandings. There are no less than a hundred people from Xinjiang who are stranded in Beijing and Shanghai, and most of them are ambitious people. Among them are political commentators, poets, novelists, historians and geographers, and experts who have studied in the Soviet Union or Turkey and have high academic achievements. They also publish several Turkic-language magazines in Beijing and Shanghai, which are distributed to the Middle East, India, and Egypt. Their content is full of ethnic consciousness and modern ideas. This situation does not seem to have been noticed by the local society. As for the Han people in Xinjiang, during the period when General Zhang Zhizhong was in power, Huang Zhenxia, an expert in Xinjiang studies, established the Xinjiang History and Geography Society in Dihua to communicate Han-Hui culture and harmonize feelings. Many local cultural figures participated. Mr. Huang has recently come to Shanghai again and jointly initiated the Xinjiang Cultural Publishing House with Xinjiang people living in Shanghai. One type of Xinjiang Cultural Pictorial has been published, introducing Xinjiang's customs and arts. Among those in preparation, "A History of Xinjiang" is especially important.

Shanghai is the cultural center of the country. People from all walks of life who care about Xinjiang or are interested in Turkic-Islamic culture should do their duty as citizens and catch up quickly. They should work together with the youth of Xinjiang living in Beijing and Shanghai to form a cultural exchange organization and contact the cultural groups in Xinjiang to exchange cultures with each other. The initial work should be: (1) Both parties organize cultural visits, visit each other, and allow school youth and business people to participate; (2) Universities in Shanghai hire experts and scholars from Xinjiang to set up lectures on Xinjiang issues and its history, geography, and culture; (3) Translate each other's cultural classics and modern works; (4) Publish books and newspapers introducing each other's culture; (5) Exchange exhibitions and performances of painting, music, dance, photography, drama, and film; (6) Make films of each other's customs, places of interest, and characters; (7) Scholars from both parties jointly form academic research groups in history, geography, language, art, religion, and other fields. We want to promote the development of each other's culture and strengthen national unity. This is the minimum requirement. The author sincerely hopes that Shanghai social leaders and enthusiastic people will initiate and work hard to carry out these tasks as soon as possible.

Finally, there is an important opinion that should be added. The central country of the Turkic-Islamic culture is now the Republic of Turkey. The diplomatic relations between our country and Turkey have always been very friendly. The experience of Turkey's revival can serve as a good reference for us. In addition, the current international environment in which Turkey is located is similar to that of our country. Due to the promotion of Xinjiang's cultural work, we must also seek cultural ties with Turkey. It is best to go a step further and organize the Sino-Turkish Cultural Association to deepen the exchange of documents between the two countries and enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries. This will be of great benefit to both parties in dealing with the situation in Central Asia. I especially hope that the government authorities will pay attention to this.

### U.S. Foreign Aid Bill Passed Swiftly by the House of Representatives, Appropriating $1.6 Billion to Aid Disaster-Stricken Countries

[United Press International, Washington, 19th] Amidst reports of the Greek war front and the widening rift between the Soviet Union and Western nations, the House of Representatives last night approved a foreign appropriation of $1,600,319,900 to support U.S. foreign policy. This includes: (1) $400 million for Greece and Turkey; (2) $332 million for relief in China, Austria, Italy, and the Free Territory of Trieste; (3) $550 million for the expenses of the U.S. military government in occupied areas such as Japan, Korea, and Germany; (4) $71,102,400 for the International Refugee Organization fund.

The House adopted a voice vote system, passing the appropriation in just one hour. Considering the magnitude and complexity of the international significance of this bill, such an achievement would be unprecedented in peacetime. Key figures in government and foreign affairs presented their views, some of which will remain confidential. Members of Congress repeatedly called for a halt to aid to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence. Representative Taber, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, assured everyone that the funds would not be used to assist countries that are ideologically or economically linked to the Soviet Union, unless "they change course and are willing to work together with freedom-believing nations."

[United Press International, Washington, 18th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee has recently passed a $1,350,302,400 foreign aid bill, including $400 million for aid to Greece and Turkey. The committee reduced the UNRRA extension expenses for China, Poland, Italy, Hungary, Austria, Greece, and Trieste by $18 million to $350 million. This foreign aid of over $1.3 billion is included in the additional appropriation of $1.602 billion for this year, which is $3.131 billion lower than the government's request. The approved foreign aid is also $177,476,600 less than the original proposal, including a reduction of $177,476,600 from the $725 million requested by the military for relief in the occupied zones of Japan, Korea, Germany, and Austria. Former President Hoover had urged the committee not to cut the military's request. Regarding the $18 million reduction in relief funds for liberated countries such as China, Poland, and Italy, the committee stated that this was because certain countries should not receive aid. Although the committee did not specify which countries, it is generally believed that this refers to Poland and Hungary.

### Impasse Between India and the Netherlands Irretrievable, Netherlands Decides to Resort to Force, Consuls General of China, Britain, France, and Australia Mediate

### Tensions Suddenly Rise Between Greece and Bulgaria, Bulgaria Warns the Security Council, UN Investigation Team Inspects Greek Border War Zone

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcast: According to a Yugoslavian media report, Bulgaria has submitted an aide-mémoire to the Security Council regarding the Greek border war, stating that "if Greece continues its exclusionary behavior on the border, Bulgaria will not be responsible for any consequences that may arise." The aide-mémoire further stated that Greek troops had "invaded Bulgarian territory" on the 13th.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 19th] Members of the UN Balkans Investigation Team arrived by plane today in the 傑尼那 region to investigate the Greek border war zone and will inspect various battlefields.

[Reuters, 傑尼那, Northern Greece, 18th] Greek guerrillas and government forces, who have been fighting for six days, fell into Bulgaria yesterday and have retreated eastward to the Pindus Mountains. The guerrillas' attempt to occupy Greek territory in northern Greece has apparently failed. The UN Balkans Investigation Team's investigation in 傑尼那 has confirmed that 2,000 guerrillas attacked the town of 柯尼柴 on Sunday. According to Greece, these guerrillas were invaders from Albania. According to one member of the investigation team, "This is the most serious border incident we have investigated and is a clearly and meticulously planned military operation," but there is still no concrete evidence to support Greece's claim that "international brigades" participated in the war.

[United Press International, Athens, 19th] The Ministry of Public Security announced today that Greece is currently arresting 11,500 political prisoners throughout the country for detention or exile. Since the government began its counterattack against the communist-planned July uprising, approximately 7,000 people have been arrested and exiled, most of them to the island of Nikaria in the Aegean Sea. Approximately 2,000 disloyal soldiers have been exiled to the island of 马克洛尼西.

### British Warships Arrive in Greek Territorial Waters

### British Warships Intercept Jewish Immigrant Ship, Fierce Fighting Erupts, Jews in the Holy Land Strike and Close Shops in Protest

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] Tonight, 4,500 Jewish illegal immigrants from the 4,277-ton "President Warfield" which arrived at Haifa, have been transferred to ferries today for deportation to Cyprus. When the British Navy boarded the ship 17 miles offshore before dawn today, clashes occurred with the refugees on board. Fifty British soldiers carrying steel rods boarded the ship. Two Jews allegedly attempted to chop off the head of a British soldier with an axe, and British troops opened fire. Fierce fighting ensued, with both sides using tear gas, smoke bombs, and steam jets. Official reports indicate that three British soldiers were injured. The Jewish underground organization Haganah's secret telegrams stated that one Jew was killed and 125 were injured, including 25 seriously injured. Two of the five British cruisers and destroyers chasing the ship were damaged. Two hundred thousand Jews in Tel Aviv went on a sympathy strike upon hearing the news of the attack on the "President Warfield," with all stores and businesses closing down. A similar demonstration also occurred in the Jewish quarter of Haifa. The incident on the Jewish refugee ship was the first of its kind. According to Jewish sources, the ship carried 1,600 Jewish men, 1,282 women, 1,007 teenagers, and 655 children. The Jewish underground organization Haganah sent a letter to the United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee to prevent the Jews on the "President Warfield" from being deported to Cyprus. After reporting to Haganah Radio, the British Foreign Office released a detailed report accusing several American trading companies of assisting Jews in secretly immigrating to Palestine. It stated that these companies, ostensibly engaged in the fruit business, were actually using secret codes to assist Jews in secretly immigrating to Palestine, such as the word "banana," which was used to represent "ships carrying Jews illegally into Palestine." A report received by the British authorities specifically pointed out the Western Trading Corporation. Officials believe that the company's activities are, at the very least, very mysterious. The headquarters of the Western Trading Corporation is located in an old building on Stone Street in New York and is managed by a Colonel William, assisted by three people: Nathan Cohen, Bert Cohen, and Barnes. The company ostensibly engages in the fruit business. The "Exodus 1947," originally named the "President Warfield," was a ship purchased by the Western Trading Corporation. On February 25, 1947, the ship departed from Baltimore en route to China, but on April 30, it suddenly appeared in the Italian port of Spezia. Thirty percent of the sailors on board were young Jews with no maritime experience. The ship then left the port of Spezia on June 12 and sailed to the French port of Sete, where it boarded 4,500 Jews. The Jews obtained visas stating their destination as Colombia, but yesterday they suddenly appeared off the coast of Palestine. The Western Trading Corporation also has two other ships, one named "Trade Wind," which is currently anchored outside Palestine and cannot enter the port, and another named "Northland," which is currently docked in the French port of Bayonne.

### U.S. Congress Reintroduces Tax Cut Bill, Truman Vetoes Again, Senate Reconsiders and Accepts

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 18th] President Truman vetoed the second individual income tax bill today, stating that it was "still an untimely mistake." The Senate also supported the veto, ensuring that there is no chance of the tax cut passing in this session of Congress. The President sent a special message to Congress, vetoing the $4 billion tax cut bill. Shortly thereafter, the House voted to override the veto. However, the Senate once again supported the President's veto.

Reduced Government Revenue Affects European Aid Program

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] In President Truman's message to Congress vetoing the tax cut bill, he stated that the reduction in income tax will affect the obligations that the United States should bear under the Marshall Plan for European aid, and that the responsibility of the United States for international reconstruction is also of great importance to the efforts of the United States to obtain lasting peace. The recent refusal of certain countries to participate in the common effort to build a world of stability has made the task of the United States even more difficult, and it is inappropriate to reduce government revenue and hinder the government's ability to fulfill its obligations. The nature of the tax cut is wrong, and the timing of the tax cut is even more inappropriate. The United States is still burdened with heavy obligations arising from the war, and defense spending is enormous. Any budget surplus should first be used to repay public debt.

Unprecedented Prosperity in the United States Makes it Inappropriate to Stimulate Prices

In general, tax cuts not only represent an imperfect tax policy but also contribute to inflationary pressures. There is no reasonable justification for tax cuts before prices stabilize and before business, employment, and national income reach perfect levels. The general level of business activity in the United States is continuing to move towards a high peak, and the number of employed people continues to increase. The number of employed people in June was the highest record in our country's history, and there are no obvious signs of a decline in this unprecedented prosperity. Tax cuts will hinder the adjustment of wages and prices necessary to maintain high prosperity, stimulate the rise in consumer goods prices, and increase the risk of recession.

Heated Debate Between Parties in the Senate Reconsideration Session

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] After President Truman vetoed the tax cut bill, the Senate reconsidered it. During the session, Senate Democratic Leader Barkley gave a speech, urging the Senate to accept the President's veto, and said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov "sabotaged" the recent European Economic Conference held in Paris, but that the door remains open for countries that have refused to participate in the conference to join the Marshall Plan for European aid in the future. Senate Republican Leader Taft then spoke, expressing support for the main principles of the Marshall Plan for European aid, but believing that tax cuts are very consistent with this plan.

### U.S. House Committee Passes Universal Military Training Bill for Youth

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: The U.S. House Armed Services Committee subcommittee passed a bill for universal military training for U.S. youth, stipulating that youths aged 18 to 20 must undergo six months of basic military training and then serve six months in the reserves.

### Truman Signs Presidential Succession Act

Speaker of the House is Second in Line of Succession

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] A bill making the Speaker of the House the second in line of succession in the event of the President's retirement or death was signed into law today by President Truman. According to the bill, the order of succession to the President is as follows: Vice President, Speaker of the House, President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Secretary of State, and other cabinet members. Previously, the Secretary of State was second in line.

### Hand Grenades Found in U.S. Residential Area in Tokyo

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] The U.S. military criminal division announced that twenty Japanese-made hand grenades were found in "Washington Heights," the U.S. residential area in Tokyo, and have been destroyed. The area was formerly a Japanese military camp, and U.S. authorities have continued to search the area.

### Japan Actively Rebuilding its Economy, Economic Stabilization Board Plans to Reach Wartime Production Standards

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] In order to rebuild its economy, the Japanese government has decided to quickly formulate a long-term economic reconstruction plan and has established a long-term economic reconstruction committee within the Economic Stabilization Board. The basic policy of this reconstruction plan is reportedly to aim to restore 80% of the average standard of living between 1930 and 1934 from this year to 1950 or even 1952. The planned coal production volume for 1952 is 45 million tons. According to the U.S. Pauley reparations plan, Japan is only allowed to generally retain its production capacity from 1930, but this plan has not yet been adopted. In fact, the production capacity of 1930, which is also the production capacity before Japan's invasion of Northeast China, is now being used as the production target for 1930 to 1934, and rebuilding the Japanese economy is tantamount to using the production capacity after the "September 18th" Incident as the reconstruction target. The impact of this move on our country is extremely significant and cannot be taken lightly.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 19th] The Japanese Economic Stabilization Board announced on the 19th that it has drafted eight special plans to raise Japan's industrial production level to the level of 1930 to 1934 within three years. Problems such as the allocation of fuel, electricity, raw materials, daily necessities, as well as transportation and manpower, are included. The drafters of the plan hope that Japan can obtain foreign capital and state that it can be repaid by 1952. The plan will be submitted to the government on the 15th of next month.

### American Engineering Experts Go to Japan to Assist in Reconstruction

[United Press International, New York, 18th] Thirty American engineers are scheduled to go to Japan around August 1 to thoroughly investigate the country's industrial situation. Each engineer specializes in a specific field and will work under the guidance of the Department of the Army and General MacArthur's headquarters. According to the head of the delegation, Sterk, the purpose of the organization is to revitalize the Japanese economy, restore the Japanese machine tool and hardware market, and prepare a comprehensive technical study of the reparations issue. The final reparations plan has not yet been decided. Japanese industry is practically at a standstill, and Japanese factories must have an approved production level in order to revitalize them. The delegation's inspection report will serve as the basis for the revival of Japanese industry.

### Japanese Cultural Circles Association Plans to Connect with the United Nations

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] More than 100 leaders of Japanese cultural circles established an organization today in Sendai, northeast of Tokyo, with the aim of establishing relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a "preliminary step for Japan to join the United Nations." Dr. Yasutaro, president of Tohoku University, was elected chairman of the association. When the organization convened its inaugural meeting, it also telegraphed the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, stating the Japanese people's "enthusiasm to contribute to the progress of the international cultural movement and their desire for peace." The telegram stated that the organization's main task is to transform the mindset of the Japanese people and make them suitable for participation in UNESCO.

### Japanese Concealed Goods Case, Various Parties Attack Each Other

Has Developed into a Political Issue

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Japanese concealed goods case has recently developed into a political issue, with various parties attacking each other. However, because the case involves a wide range of people, the attacking forces are also dispersed. Even various parties are related to this issue. The case occurred four months ago, when a concealed goods handling committee was established in the Economic Stabilization Board. The disclosed goods were mostly military supplies when Japan surrendered. Calculated at the prices at that time, they were worth approximately 100 billion yen. Afterwards, they were gradually sold on black markets such as Ginza in Tokyo. Although the committee announced that it would offer 20% as a "bonus," it was never able to trace the source. Currently, the general public here believes that this matter can also be used as a test of the administrative efficiency of the Katayama Cabinet.

### Patterson Resignation Approved; Royal Appointed Secretary of the Army; Bradley to Become Army Chief of Staff

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Following the resignation of Army Secretary Patterson, President Truman has appointed Under Secretary of the Army, Kenneth Royall, as Secretary of the Army to succeed Patterson. He has also requested Senate approval today.

Royall is a prominent American lawyer. In 1927, he was elected as a member of the New York State Legislature. In 1945, he became Under Secretary of the Army, a position he holds to this day. During World War I, he participated in the war as a captain. In 1942, he was ordered to mobilize as an Army Colonel. In November 1943, he was promoted to Major General and accompanied the expeditionary force to Europe in 1944.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] In a letter to Patterson, President Truman stated, "I have never accepted the resignation of a government official with such deep regret as this." He added that Patterson's service as outgoing Secretary of the Army was "supremely noble."

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower has accepted an invitation to become the president of Columbia University and will leave his post at the beginning of next year. The White House has not yet announced Eisenhower's successor, but it has announced that General Bradley will soon travel to Europe to inspect troops and their needs for six weeks. It is widely believed that General Bradley will succeed Eisenhower as Chief of Staff. The term of Admiral Nimitz, the Secretary of the Navy, will also expire on January 1st next year. Naval sources say that Nimitz's successor will be either Admiral Brandy, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, or Admiral Denfield, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Air Force Commander General Spaatz has also submitted his resignation, effective January 1st. It is reported that he will be succeeded by his Chief of Staff, Major General Hoyt Vandenberg.

### British Treasury Surplus Exceeds 230 Million Pounds

Remaining American Loan is 1.3 Billion Dollars

[Reuters, London, 18th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton announced in the House of Commons today that the Treasury has a surplus of 234 million pounds for this fiscal year. This is unprecedented and a good sign. Dalton's report only referred to the domestic part; it did not discuss the import surplus in foreign trade, only saying that this is our major concern and should be carefully considered.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The Treasury Department announced today that Britain has used another $150 million in loans. In the first half of July, a total of $400 million has been used. One year ago, the total amount of British loans was $3.75 billion. $2.45 billion has been used already. At the current rate of consumption, the remaining $1.3 billion will only be able to barely support until the end of the year.

### Spain Issues Amnesty Decree

### Lincoln's Secret Documents Filmed in Miniature

[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] Thousands of unpublished documents of the late U.S. President Lincoln will be filmed in miniature after July 26th and made available to the public. The documents, which have been kept secret until now, will be displayed in the Library of Congress.

### Two Airlines' Price Increase Approved by Ministry of Communications; Air Transport Passenger and Freight Rates to Increase Tomorrow; Maximum Increase 120 Percent, Minimum 50 Percent; Company Officials Say Still Far from Target

[Reported by This Newspaper] The issue of increasing air fares and freight rates, which has been brewing for over a month, was approved yesterday by the Ministry of Communications in an order to China and Central Airlines. The new prices will be implemented starting tomorrow (July 21st). The passenger ticket price increases vary depending on the route, with the highest being 120% for the Xi'an-Lanzhou route and the lowest being 50% for the South China route to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The remaining increases are around 70% to 80%. Freight prices will increase proportionally, with newspapers still calculated at 60% of the rate. The two airlines have been applying for these fare and freight rate increases for a long time, and they have repeatedly sent senior officials to the capital to lobby the Ministry of Communications authorities. The Ministry of Communications is well aware of the airlines' inability to offset expenses, so it has long agreed to the price increase. However, because it had to be approved by the Executive Yuan, it has been delayed until now. It was originally rumored that the adjustment would take effect on August 1st. In fact, the company authorities had originally planned to start implementing it as early as July 10th. After the price adjustment, the two companies' business situation will greatly improve. However, according to company officials, because most of the expenses are paid in US dollar foreign exchange, it is still far from the target. If the development of the aviation industry is to be sought, a fundamental solution must be found. As for how to fundamentally solve this, it is said that the company authorities are already planning. The price list after the adjustment from Shanghai to various places is listed below:

C-47 Twin-Engine Passenger Plane:

DC-4 Sky Master Aircraft:

Shanghai to Peiping 1,800,000 920,000 Weakly 50%

### Participation in the Conference Subcommittee Still Temporarily Continues

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Ministry of Interior previously stipulated that during the suspension of the general assembly, subcommittee meetings in various places should also be suspended. A special order was given to the municipal government of this city to forward to the Council. After receiving the order, the Council believes that the power of the various subcommittee meetings is limited to deliberating on various continued proposals based on the principles of the resolutions of the general assembly, and they must be submitted to the next general assembly for ratification afterwards. There is no transcendence of the authority of the general assembly, and the cases submitted by the municipal government of this city are particularly numerous, and some of them are time-sensitive. If they are all left to be discussed at the general assembly once every three months, it will not only be untimely, but also a large number of accumulated cases will take a long time to deliberate. In addition, a temporary general assembly is not convenient to convene without a major accident. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily continue the original method and continue to hold the meeting. On one side, it is still stated the reasons, and a letter is sent to the municipal government to forward it to the central government for record.

The company sent a letter to the Railway Bureau requesting termination of the contract on the grounds that it could not purchase, and was willing to be responsible for compensating 30% of the loss. The Railway Bureau replied agreeing in principle, but the company was unable to pay the Railway Bureau's deposit and loss compensation due to financial difficulties. Although the Railway Bureau repeatedly urged, it did not respond. At the beginning of last month, the Railway Bureau urgently needed to replace the railroad ties, so it sent a letter to the company asking it to perform the contract as soon as possible. At the same time, it sent a letter to the Taiwan Provincial Government to negotiate. The Taiwan Province approved a special permit to export railroad ties for the Railway Bureau's use. After hearing the news, the company hired a special ship to transport them. However, recently the price of railroad ties skyrocketed. The company sold more than 20,000 railroad ties that had been transported, at a high price of 180,000 yuan per tie, to Sentai Wood Company (8,000 ties) and Zhongxing Wood Industry Company (3,100 ties). The matter was discovered by the Railway Bureau, and the police department of the bureau sent officers to seal the railroad ties. At the same time, it filed a lawsuit in the District Court suing the company for breach of contract, obstructing national transportation projects, and demanding compensation for losses.

Lin Yongping and four others secretly reported to the Garrison Command, saying that Jiang Weibin, also known as Bin, originally named Jiang Henghao, used a false name when Fuzhou fell for the second time to carry out interception on the upper reaches of various villages, robbing countless merchants and civilians fleeing the disaster. After being sued by the booksellers and civilians in a joint name to the Fujian Provincial Government, Jiang fled to Shanghai, where he speculated and hoarded goods, remaining at large. After the victory, he colluded with Gendarmerie Captain Jiang Gongmei to help with the takeover. After Jiang's case was exposed, Jiang disappeared again in Hangzhou. The Fujian Provincial Government's order to arrest Jiang has not yet been revoked. Please send a letter to the Fujian Provincial Government to investigate and punish him, so as not to let him slip through the net. As for Lin Xingji's bribery, according to reliable sources, Jiang also received tens of millions of yuan. The case has been transferred by the Inspection Office of the Garrison Command to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. He was once summoned, but Xu Shaobai, who lives in Jiang's house, replied to the District Prosecutor's Office that Jiang was ill in Fujian and has not returned, and cannot appear in court for questioning at present.

### French Concession Tram; Unemployed Workers on a Day and Night Hunger Strike; Get Satisfactory Answer

[Our Newspaper's Report] More than 300 drivers, ticket sellers, and ticket inspectors of the French Concession Tram Company who were dismissed during and before the war for various reasons went to the main company in Lujiawan the day before yesterday to request reinstatement, but did not get satisfactory results.

### Relief Rice Profiteering Case; Schools Receive Very Little; Diverted to Rice Stores

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the case of "UNRRA" relief rice being resold for profit, those arrested by the police are still minor figures. It is reported that this case involves a great deal and the investigation is time-consuming. For the sake of prudence, the police bureau will not issue a statement until the main perpetrators are arrested. However, according to what this reporter has learned, this relief rice was originally distributed to various schools in the jurisdiction of the UNRRA Su Ning branch, totaling more than 3,000 bags, each bag weighing 100 pounds net. However, the number of these relief rice that schools actually get to receive is very small, most of which are diverted to rice stores in the Beijing-Shanghai area. As of yesterday, the arrested suspects confessed to selling more than 700 bags that passed through their hands. It is generally speculated that the inside story of this case may be caused by the following three reasons: (1) Branch officials take advantage of their position to collude with school authorities to embezzle and pre-sell the relief rice; (2) school authorities withhold the rice after receiving it and sell it privately; (3) school teachers and staff sell rice to rice stores or exchange it for good white rice because the quality of the rice is not good. The arrested suspects include He Junsheng, the owner of Zhenjiang Longmao Rice Store, Song Xijing, the manager of Shanghai Songjingji Rice Store, rice trader Li Sizhong, and Li Yunqing, the owner of the Tongtai Gongji rice mill.

### Newspaper Association Emergency Meeting

Resolved that Fixed Price May Not be Changed

Direct Subscription Not Subject to Interference

[Central News Agency Report] The Newspaper Delivery Association of this city yesterday sent representatives to the Shen Bao to demand: (1) no longer accept direct subscribers in the future, (2) the wholesale price should be the current wholesale price plus a 30% discount. The newspaper asked the Newspaper Association to discuss this matter. Last night, the Newspaper Association convened an emergency meeting for this purpose. The following resolutions were passed: It is found that the fixed price and wholesale price of each newspaper have been decided by the association and may not be changed arbitrarily. Accepting direct subscribers is the business freedom of each newspaper and an inevitable way for each newspaper to develop, and is not subject to any interference. If newspaper vendors ask the Shen Bao to change the wholesale price and stop sending directly subscribed newspapers and refuse to distribute the newspaper, all member newspapers of the association (except for foreign language newspapers) will suspend publication the next day until the newspaper vendors withdraw all requests in order to maintain common interests. Any violation of this resolution will result in expulsion from the membership. In the future, if newspaper vendors take the same action against other member newspapers of the association, this resolution will also apply, and the members will respond in unison.

### Celebrating the National Army's Victory, Implementing a Ten Thousand Yuan Reward for the Troops, Barbers Strive for Future Generations, Vowing to Fight Against Insults in Films

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon, the joint negotiation committee of the barber industry regarding the film "Fake Phoenix" hosted reporters from various newspapers on the ninth floor of the Jinmen Hotel. Wang Zhenchuan, chairman of the industry association, and Gao Deyu, executive director of the labor union, reported on the dispute and the nine points where they requested cuts or modifications to the film.

Three Points of View from Director Jiao

Following them, Director Jiao Dingkai of the fellow villagers association expressed his opinions: Briefly stating that today, the barber industry is hosting you reporters, and I, in particular, will explain to everyone the views of our association and its relationship regarding my views on "Fake Phoenix." (1) Films are a tool for social education, capable of being widely shown domestically and internationally, or passed down to future generations, influencing their perspectives. They possess unimaginable potential and effectiveness. If a film casts a stain on a person, profession, or matter, it could provoke the condemnation of the entire nation, contemporary individuals, and foreign audiences. If it were to be passed down to future generations and screened, the magnitude of its impact would be even harder to imagine. (2) The nation is carrying out Mandarin education, and film companies have a duty to promote culture. This film still uses the slang of northern Jiangsu, and while the original intention may be satire, it can only elicit laughter from millions of viewers, which goes against the nation's policy on education. (3) Whether it is unofficial histories, novels, or dramas, they all contain the intent of encouraging good and punishing evil. Therefore, books and dramas that have been passed down through the ages, even those that depict adultery, theft, and evil, ultimately ensure that the wicked cannot escape the law, or are subjected to retribution, justice, public opinion, conscience, and various forms of sanctions, in order to align with the principle of encouragement and punishment. This film only portrays barbers engaging in actions and words that harm public morals, and using their tools to commit suicide, without any effect of encouragement or punishment. It is sufficient to inspire those in the profession to use their tools for self-destruction, no different from instigating suicide, and so on.

Vowing to Fight to the Death to Avoid Future Troubles

Finally, the meeting also distributed a "Statement of Reasons for the Insult to the Barber Industry in the Fake Phoenix Film," believing that it was the last straw, and for the sake of their own survival and that of future generations, all barbers across the country vowed to fight to the death, determined to cut out or modify the insulting points in the film, to avoid endless harm.

Origin of the Phrase "Sweeping Green Marks"

Furthermore, the host of yesterday's meeting made two requests to the reporters, stating: (1) A few newspapers have referred to us as "sweeping green marks." Upon investigation, the origin of "sweeping green marks" is actually an inauspicious term. For example, Ningbo barbers, in their spare time from shaving heads, also engaged in the business of carrying coffins and sedan chairs, so people called them "sweeping green marks." Also, when people in prison have their heads shaved, it is called "sweeping green." (2) It is often seen in newspapers that we are referred to as "barber craftsmen," but in fact, "craftsmen" refers to those who can make finished products from raw materials, which does not apply to the barber industry, so please use the term.

### Two "Playboy Ta歲" Sentenced to Death, Two Criminals, Kitahara and Sakio, Imprisoned for Life, Korean Zhang Xiqiu Sentenced to Ten Years

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Japanese war criminal, Shiba Hiraburo, known as "Playboy Ta歲", was sentenced to death yesterday by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The verdict's main text is as follows: "Shiba Hiraburo is sentenced to death for intending to destroy the Chinese nation and killing people during the war. He is sentenced to death for continuously raping in violation of war regulations. He is sentenced to life imprisonment for torturing non-military personnel. He is sentenced to two years of fixed-term imprisonment for gathering people to gamble with the intention of making profits, and the sentence should be death." Shiba Hiraburo is 47 years old, from Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. During the war, he served as the head of the Hangzhou Special Affairs Agency of the Japanese Army and the head of the Public Security Section of the Ningbo Special Affairs Agency, specializing in intelligence gathering, criminalizing the people, and controlling materials. In addition, he used local hooligans to open gambling dens and gather people to gamble. He also forced and seduced women from good families, with a shocking number being raped by him. The people in the eastern Zhejiang area hated him to the bone.

Yesterday, the military tribunal also sentenced in two other war criminal cases: (1) Kitahara Bungo and Ozaki Toraji, former sergeants of the Shanghai Xinshijie Military Police Unit of the enemy's military police, were each sentenced to indefinite imprisonment for continuously torturing non-military personnel in violation of war regulations during the war. (2) Korean Zhang Xiqiu was previously found not guilty of trafficking opium. After being reported to the Ministry of National Defense, the case was returned for retrial. Yesterday, the trial concluded and the verdict was: Zhang Xiqiu is sentenced to ten years of fixed-term imprisonment for helping to eliminate the Chinese nation and promoting drugs.

Two Other War Criminals to be Sentenced on the 24th

Furthermore, the war criminal Taiwanese Chuan Mitian previously abused our officers and soldiers in prisoner of war camps in Shanghai. Minowa Takeo, the former head of the Qingdao Military Police, arrested civilians and abused them during his tenure. The collegiate panel concluded the trial yesterday, and the sentencing is scheduled for the afternoon of the 24th of this month.

### A Defendant in a Vendetta Case Flees with His Entire Family, Ye Guangde is Suspected of Abetment

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the assassination case of Qiu Lianhuan, an investigator at the Gaoshiman Ballroom, 15 suspects were arrested and are currently being investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office. Subsequently, Qiu's wife, Chen, added Ye Guangde, the owner of a firewood shop, as a defendant, accusing him of being one of the major abettors. After the District Prosecutor's Office issued a summons, Ye fled with his entire family. Yesterday, Qiu Chen and Xu A'ming, Dai A'ru, Gu A'jin, and four others who were in the timber business were summoned. According to Xu and others' testimony, Ye had 1.8 million yuan in the spring, which was used up by Qiu, resulting in resentment. Whether this trivial matter triggered the murder is unknown. According to another defendant, nicknamed Little A'fu, in his previous confession, the day after the Qiu case occurred, Ye went to Fu's house and instructed him to flee, so Ye's suspicion of abetment is already credible. According to Xu Dingkan, the prosecutor handling the case, a public prosecution will be filed in the coming days.

### Opinions of the Examination Yuan: Granting of Doctoral Degrees to be Managed Uniformly by the State

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The legislative principles of the draft "Organizational Law of the Doctoral Degree Evaluation Committee" and the "Detailed Rules for the Doctoral Degree Examination" were discussed in the seventh State Council meeting and then submitted to the Political Review Committee for review. The draft details that doctoral degrees are divided into six categories: Literature, Science, Law, Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine, as well as the standards for reviewing applicants. The draft and the opinions of the Examination Yuan are recorded below: "Letter of Opinion from the Examination Yuan": The systems for doctoral degrees vary greatly from country to country, and even within the same country, there are discrepancies. Generally speaking, however, state-granted degrees are of a higher standard than school-granted degrees. The French State Doctorate is one example. Japan initially used unified evaluation and awarding, but later changed to individual universities awarding degrees, which lowered the standard, as is particularly evident. Our country's degrees, according to the current Degree Conferral Law, already adopt a three-tier system of Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate. The standard of the highest tier, the Doctorate, should be particularly raised, which goes without saying. However, the graduate schools of universities or independent colleges in our country have not yet been able to establish a balanced system, and due to the impact of the war, it is difficult to improve academic standards quickly. If individual schools and colleges directly evaluate and award degrees, it will be difficult not only to produce doctoral candidates in a short period of time, but also to establish academic standards. In the last two or three decades, it would be better to continue to follow the current law and have the state uniformly evaluate and award degrees. Moreover, in-depth specialized research is not necessarily limited to university graduate schools. Especially in recent years, there are many scholars who have left universities but want to have their research work or papers reviewed or examined by universities, which is not appropriate. Although the so-called "universities or independent colleges specially authorized to accept doctoral candidates" are not limited to accepting professors or alumni from their own schools, academic independence is the case in all countries, and it is difficult to have consistent academic views. If the opinions are not the same, it will be difficult to seek them. Therefore, it is better to have the state manage the evaluation than to have the schools evaluate, as it can eliminate sectarianism and broadly seek talent, which is more effective in achieving results. Based on the above reasons, doctoral degrees should still be awarded by the state through unified examination, as stipulated in the current Degree Conferral Law, and there is no need to change it.

Organizational Law of the Doctoral Degree Evaluation Committee

### Teachers of Municipal Schools Visited Director Gu Yesterday, Requesting Improved Treatment

And Will Petition the City Council

Representatives of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers Association, Xi Zhi (日三 and ten other people), went to the Municipal Education Bureau at 11:00 AM yesterday to visit Director Gu in order to request improved teacher treatment. Director Gu, along with Chief Xie Engao of the Secondary Education Division and Chief Zhu Junti of the National Education Division, personally met with them. Director Gu expressed his concern about the difficult living conditions of municipal school teachers, and said: "In this time of financial constraints, when the government cannot improve the lives of teachers, if we can gain the sympathy of people in society and the parents of students, and they are willing to provide teachers with financial assistance to stabilize their lives, then it may be worthwhile to pursue this avenue to obtain a proper and reasonable fee collection method. At the same time, if we can refer to the methods of collecting tuition, meal fees, and teacher appreciation fees in various places, and establish a compromise and feasible method for implementation in this city, and try to increase the number of children enrolled as much as possible, such as those who meet the regulations for public school personnel, martyrs, soldiers, and the poor, and grant them unlimited exemptions, then the lives of teachers will not be difficult to get some help." The representatives were deeply moved by his words. Finally, regarding the issue of schools dismissing teachers, Director Gu said that he would handle it impartially after investigation. Unless the teacher has a special and unchangeable fault, he hoped that the principals of each school could deeply understand the importance of the professionalization of teachers and not make too many changes, which would cause unnecessary disputes. The representatives were satisfied and left. It is heard that they will petition Speaker Pan to the City Council again the day after tomorrow.

### To Solve the Food Problem in North China, Tianjin and Shanghai Exchange Materials

Zhang Jiaao Reported the Process to Beijing Last Night

Zhang Jiaao, the president of the Central Bank, flew from Shanghai to Pingjin on the 14th of this month to solve the food problem in Qianshi North China, to see the actual situation and discuss regulatory measures with the authorities in North China. Zhang originally planned to go to the Northeast, but was summoned to Beijing and returned here on the 18th. Last night, he took a military trip to Beijing to report everything. According to Zhang (19th) when he met with the reporter of the United Credit Information Agency in the State Bank, he talked about: This trip to North China was to inspect the business of the branch and the food problem. Because North China suffered from the communist bandits looting, the price of food soared, and the people's life was quite difficult. The supply situation should be carefully studied. After researching the results with the various officials in Pingjin, North China needs 800 tons of food every day. In the past, the four lines of PingSui, PingHan, JinPu, and BeiNing were the arteries for food supply. At present, the JinPu, PingHan, and BeiNing lines are interrupted due to the war, and only PingSui can supply, but the quantity is not large, which has led to a serious problem. At that time, it was decided that (1) Shanghai would subsidize North China's food, and (2) North China would supply Shanghai with fuel, support each other, and exchange materials to achieve the goal of stabilizing life and stabilizing prices. Regarding the former, North China hopes to subsidize 200,000 tons, from July to the end of this year, but a part can be purchased locally, and at least 100,000 tons will be transported to support it in the future. Half of this food is ordered from foreign countries, because its price is one-third lower than wheat. It has now started to transport 300,000 bags of flour to public and teaching personnel in Pingjin, and Tianjin also distributed workers and civilians. After the foreign-ordered grains arrive, they will be supplied monthly. Regarding the latter, (1) Kailuan coal is now actively increasing production, and the Beining Road has also begun to rush to transport. There are 75,000 tons of coal transported to Qinhuangdao, and 130,000 tons can be transported to Shanghai by the end of this month. The coal shortage in this city can be solved. In order to encourage it, it was decided to give 80,000 bags of flour to Kailuan miners and 40,000 bags to Beining Road workers (2) This city is short of white coal, and it has been decided to order it from Annam, and Changcheng can also supply a part. This city needs about 6,000 tons of briquettes per month, which is also supplied by North China. Zhang continued to describe the financial situation in North China, saying that the financial industry in North China also feels the difficulty of slow growth in deposits. Due to the lack of computing codes, the banking industry in Pingjin has jointly set up a joint reserve, and at the same time increased rediscounting. The purchasing power of the people in North China has been weakened, and commerce is extremely declining. Zhang finally talked about the financial problems in the Northeast, saying that the Northeast circulating coupons once fell to 8.5 yuan, and now it is 11.5 yuan. Due to the free exchange and trade between inside and outside the customs, the Ministry of Finance is planning to unify the currency system, and the government will announce the way in the future. After the Communist bandits destroyed the Northeast, the losses were extremely huge, and the soybeans and coal that could enter the customs were hopeless. The goods shipped out of the customs were mostly cigarettes and tea.

### Loose Monetary Environment and Active Floating Capital, Brisk Demand for Yarn and Cloth, Bidding Prices in the Market Are All Higher Than the Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were due to the loose monetary environment, active intentions from all parties, and floating capital participating in commercial market activities, so the prices were often raised. However, most of the actual sales in the market were sporadic, but in the middle, there were some sell-offs at higher prices, and the rise was not as good. As a result, the 42-count Blue Phoenix rose by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 18 million yuan. The 20-count Extra Double Horse rose by 400,000 yuan, to 12 million yuan. The Double Horse yarn also rose by 400,000 yuan, to 11.1 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were due to the loose monetary environment. At the beginning of the opening, the market was quite enthusiastic, and customers came to purchase when prices were low. In addition, there were extra-industry participants, which made the buying trend even stronger. The holders of goods held on, and the market was very good. In particular, the demand for Yuan Biji was smoother, and the price rose by about 20,000 compared to the previous day. The closing price of the Four Gentlemen's Golden Seal Biji was 495,000 yuan, the Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance was 476,000 yuan, and the 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth had many buyers around 10:00, and the price was raised to 453,500 yuan, and the transaction was quite smooth, continuing to rise by 17,8000 yuan compared to the previous day.

The flour was slightly active in retail, and the market was tired first and then tight, and the results were similar. Bran was dull and had less vitality, and still lingered in the fatigue. The rural sales of bean cakes were active but not prosperous, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Yingkou cakes sold well and rose by 34,000 yuan. The flavor of yellow beans from Shantou has increased, they were dry and fragrant, and the tofu in this street was also in great demand, rebounding by 35,000 to 10,000 yuan. Tea beans were in a firm pattern, and the arrival and consumption of Yuanmai were both in contact, and the price did not change.

The source of broad beans has been increasing, but digestion is still stagnant, declining, and gradually decreasing, falling by another 23,000 yuan.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Are Both Weak

Tongbing opened at 7,250 yuan in the morning, the high price was 7,300 yuan, and the low price was 6,800 yuan, and then struggled around 7,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks were also very mediocre yesterday. Qia Yarn opened at 75,000 yuan in the morning and retreated from 76,000 yuan to close at 72,500 yuan. Although foreign merchants and Guangdong merchants bought, the securities gang, the northern gang, the banking gang, and retail investors all sold.

### Major Investors Rush to Sell, Chinese Stocks Plunge Sharply

Yesterday, the rally in Chinese stocks could not be sustained. The difference in bank settlements from the previous day was substantial, leading to a lively opening. However, external speculative funds were not attracted. After reaching a high, trading slowed, and then major investors in Sino-Foreign Industries and other companies urgently sought to sell, leading to a complete collapse and a severe decline. Secondary hot stocks like Mei Ya were also affected. Because the economic reform plan will be announced next week, operators are worried that credit may tighten again, leading to a wave of selling. Near noon, pessimism intensified, and the market collapsed. Except for Qin Xing, all stocks closed at lower prices. Trading in miscellaneous stocks was limited, and some remained strong amidst the general weakness.

The market opened high in the morning, and many investors took advantage of the high prices to sell. Delai Furuiya retreated from 605 yuan to 600 yuan, and then was sold down to 597 yuan. Some people took the opportunity to buy at the low price, and Delai Sino-Foreign Industries rose from 3740 yuan to 3920 yuan. Delai Mei Ya also rose to 611 yuan. However, it soon fell below 595 yuan. After that, Sino-Foreign Industries suddenly experienced a sharp decline, changing the overall market situation. After 10:30, the reaction became even worse. Currently, Sino-Foreign Industries is falling more and more severely, with Delai Sino-Foreign Industries dropping to 3300 yuan before slightly rising to close at 3330 yuan. Trading in existing Sino-Foreign Industries is limited, only falling to 3420 yuan. Delai Mei Ya was also affected, falling to 550 yuan, and then closing at 551 yuan. Existing Mei Ya closed at a low price of 540 yuan. After the close, the asking prices for Mei Ya and Sino-Foreign Industries remained stable. Dong Xing and Guohuo, on the other hand, closed at higher prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, among the stocks for immediate delivery, French shares fell slightly, Sino-Foreign Industries, Mei Ya, China Flour, Qin Xing, and Xinhua each fell less than half a percent, as did Yonggong. Xingguang Jingfu fell slightly more than half a percent. Tongyi and Shangwu remained flat. Guohuo rose slightly more than half a percent. Liann Cement and Wuhe Underwear rose slightly. Lianglun Matches fell half a percent. Xin Ya and Datong fell slightly. China Silk fell by ten percent. For immediate delivery, Qin Xing rose slightly, Yonggong and Sino-Foreign Industries each fell about ten percent, and Lianhua, Xingguang, Jingfu, and Mei Ya each fell slightly more than half a percent. Old stocks in the over-the-counter market remained weak and flat.

In the over-the-counter market for Yongs yarn new share, the initial opening price yesterday was 220 yuan, the high price was 230 yuan, and it fell to around 210 yuan. The noon closing price was 214 yuan to 217 yuan. After the close, in a flash, the asking price dropped to 202 yuan and 205 yuan.

### Regulations for Silk Market Completed in Draft Form

The long-planned silk market has been agreed upon by the Silk, Gauze, and Satin Guilds. Fifteen preparatory committee members were jointly selected, with Luo Qinghua as the chairman and Tong Xinbo as the vice chairman, and the articles of association and rules have been drafted. It is learned that the market held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM on the 18th (the day before yesterday) at the Silk Weaving Guild in the Fourth District of Taiwan Road. Vice Chairman Tong Xinbo, due to his extremely busy schedule, was unable to attend to the duties of vice chairman and submitted his resignation at yesterday's meeting. It is reported that the preparatory committee has tried to retain him.

### Active Cotton Market Trading

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw relatively active market conditions because the money market was moving, yarn factories had quite the appetite, and buyers were adding orders. At the same time, the cotton yarn closing trend was quite solid, hence people's hearts are filled with optimism. The market was characterized by strong selling pressure, and trading was more active than the previous day. Prices did not fluctuate significantly, and the basis seemed quite stable. The factory price for each grade was as follows: Ling Sai 2.27 million, Sha Shi 2.10 million to 2.18 million, Han Xi 1.97 million, 2.02 million, 2.12 million. Chong Sha Shi 2.12 million. The warehouse price was as follows: Ling Bao 2.10 million, 2.15 million to 2.20 million, Sha Shi 2.10 million, Han Xi 1.97 million to 2.00 million, Lao He Kou 1.97 million to 2.00 million, Huoji 1.75 million. For inferior goods, the price was 1.65 million. Zhoupu seed cotton was 328,000 per bundle.

### Dyeing, Weaving, and Five Other Guilds Request Rescission of Gas Restrictions

And Immediate Reduction of Additional Fine Burden

The dyeing, weaving, thermos bottle, type casting, light bulb, and electrical equipment industries and other guilds in this city, are suffering intolerably from the gas company's restrictions on industrial gas usage and the harsh fines. They have decided to jointly send representatives to petition the Public Utilities Bureau on the 21st (next Monday). They have listed reasons for requesting the cancellation of the restrictions to maintain industry. The main points are as follows:

Gas is an essential fuel for industry. Starting in July, the price per 100 cubic feet increased from 1,200 yuan to 3,600 yuan. Compared to other public utilities such as electricity and water, the increase rate is uniquely high, and it has lost the level of reason. The most unreasonable aspect is that the usage limit is too low. Exceeding the limit incurs a fine of five times the price of 3,600 yuan per 100 cubic feet, making it unbearable for factories. The origin of this restriction dates back to the period of occupation. At that time, under the control of the enemy and puppets, the Shanghai Water and Fire Company severely suppressed the usage limit for civilian industries in order to supply large amounts of gas for military needs. Each factory was limited to a minimum of several tens of degrees and a maximum of only several hundreds of degrees. Because industries were confined to a corner, and their products could not be sold far, most of the original equipment was shut down, the company used this as a calculation standard. After the victory, industries recovered, and equipment gradually expanded, and the usage increased day by day. The company not only did not consider relaxing the restrictions, but still followed the past restrictive measures. Knowing that the usage within this limit is not enough for industry, instead of considering increasing the supply quantity, it enacted a huge fine for exceeding the limit. This is tantamount to a disguised price increase, and it is a bad precedent that has never existed in any public utility. After the price increase in July, the limit was not relaxed, and the fine increased sharply from 300% to 400%. Currently, the monthly usage of each factory is only between several tens of degrees, and the burden of additional fines totals more than 10 million per month. Such measures are destroying industry. Because the member factories of each guild have repeatedly requested correction, please quickly order the British-owned Water and Fire Company to immediately rescind the fine measures.

### Chen Qimen Sells Well, 400+ Cases Traded

Since tea merchants believed that inventory on the market was limited for various export green teas, such as Special Grade, Zhenmei, and other varieties, sales intention turned firm. At the moment, despite seekers still clustering, it is still hard to get what one desires, the transactions still weak, but the process is stable as before. Among other types, the most active transactions were for old-fashioned black tea of lower grade. As for domestic sales, the weather had just turned clear for vendors around the country, so demand was not strong. For local stores in this city, replenishment is still happening in a steady stream, especially of old second-grade Qimen, for which a large number of trades was made, reaching 436 cases. The price has remained consistently solid. It is reported that the this year's new Qimen black tea that arrived in Shanghai several days ago, are seeing very active negotiations, however, the distance between both party's asking price is considerable, and transactions are temporarily difficult to carry out.

### Purchasing Old Tea is Not Compulsory

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Central Trust Bureau: Tea purchases are divided into two types: loans and non-loans. For the loan portion, the Four Banks Joint Office has entrusted the bureau to purchase the old tea from the 35th year, and the purchase price will be determined by the Central Bank. The bureau's handling of the purchase is not compulsory in nature. Therefore, the rumors that tea merchants are selling old tea to foreign firms are also welcome to do so. The bureau will still begin accepting applications from tea merchants for purchase starting on the 25th, it said.

### National Bank Discount Committee Approves Loans of 4.2 Billion Yuan

[Reported by this newspaper] The 16th regular meeting of the Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank's Discount Committee was held at 3:30 PM on July 18th in the Discount Committee Conference Room on the fifth floor of 24 Waiwan Road.

Thirty applications for factory loans were reviewed, and 26 were approved, totaling approximately 4.2 billion yuan, pending approval by the Discount Committee next week.

### Export Packaging Materials Approved for Special Import

[Reported by this newspaper] The measures for allowing special imports of packaging materials needed by exporters to ship export goods have been submitted to the National Economic Commission by the Export Promotion Committee for approval. It will be implemented as soon as the committee announces it.

### Soap Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the commodity market saw improved sales due to the clearing weather. Fellow vendors on the market were particularly active in restocking. Coupled with the easing of credit, speculative funds turned to goods, and prices were often bid up. As a result, Gubenz Soap rose to 500,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan, continuing the increase of 9,000 yuan from the previous day. Arrow Dao Soap rose sharply by 15,000 yuan to 495,000 yuan. The prices of other soaps, such as Xiang Mao, Riyue, Guanghua, and others, also rose uniformly by 3,000 to 8,000 yuan. However, the match market remained flat and weak, it was said.

### Sugar Prices Slightly Improve

Yesterday, the sugar market showed a slight improvement due to the sunny weather. The guild's designated price for 20-type medium white sugar was 653,000 yuan to 484,000 yuan, up 20,000 yuan. Si Ban Jun rose by 6,000 yuan to 666,000 yuan. Taiwan Red rose by 5,000 yuan to 565,000 yuan. 24 Coarse White Oil Pack remained at 660,000 yuan, Shantou Green at 446,000 yuan, and Cotton Red at 480,000 to 490,000 yuan, totaling 50 to 60 packages. Hainan Red high-grade was 465,000 yuan, 50 packages. Xinghua White high-grade was 608,000 yuan, and ordinary Xing Red was 440,000 yuan, totaling several hundred baskets. Scattered deals for Diao Qing were at 400,000 yuan.

### Textile Building Sells Fabric

[Reported by this newspaper] China Textile Building Company sold fabric as usual yesterday, selling a total of 13,685 bolts. There were 515 purchase orders in total. Thirty domestic manufacturers purchased 1,200 bolts. There were 485 clothiers purchased 12,485 bolts.

### Textile Adjustment Changes Method for Applying for Allocations of Imported Cotton

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the regulations for allocating imported cotton, yarn factories applying for allocations of imported cotton must have more than 3,000 spindles. The Textile Adjustment Committee has repeatedly received letters from small yarn factories requesting the same rights. After deliberation, the Textile Adjustment Committee has decided that yarn factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles but with equipment capable of producing cotton yarn of 20 counts or higher and product quality rated at grade D or higher will also be entitled to apply for allocations starting from the third quarter quota. The Textile Adjustment Committee has sent the new regulations to the Cotton Spinning Guild in the Sixth District for its members to review.

[Another dispatch] According to the Central Trust Bureau: It has been agreed that imported cotton that arrived in port before the end of April this year but could not obtain permits will be purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. The total value of this batch of imported cotton is approximately US$8 million, most of which belongs to various yarn factories. In principle, the bureau hopes that both national and private yarn factories can spin the cotton on consignment. If private yarn factories are unwilling to spin the cotton on consignment, the bureau requires that the applying factories spin at least half of the cotton yarn on consignment for the bureau, and the remaining half will still be entrusted to the Textile Building Company.

### Planting Wheat and Seizing Wheat: Two or Three Things in the Shandong "Liberated Area"

— Special Correspondent Li Tian

Jinan, 14th (Air Dispatch)

In Shandong, except for the areas along the front lines and the newly recovered areas, where farmers fled and failed to sow in time, resulting in wasteland, or even if sown, the wheat seedlings were uprooted by the Communist army before their retreat, the spring harvest this year can be considered a bumper one in the Shandong "Liberated Area." Especially in Zibo, Jiaodong, northern Shandong, and the Yishan mountainous area, according to refugees who have escaped: "The wheat ears hang low, almost falling, with as many as forty grains per ear. Looking south, it is a golden sea, quite beautiful!" The farmers, who have worked hard for years with "food as the priority," are congratulating each other, believing that they will no longer starve this year! Who knew, out of the blue, the "Shandong Provincial Chairman" of the Communist Party, Li Yu, and the "Commander of the East China People's Liberation Army," Chen Yi, jointly ordered ten columns and local units, totaling about 100,000 people, to be divided and deployed to various places to assist the people in harvesting the new wheat, except for the necessary guard troops left on the front line. Chen Yi's official newspaper, "Dazhong Daily," also vigorously promoted the all-out wheat-seizing movement with large headlines every day, calling for and launching a full-scale wheat-seizing movement: seizing the harvest, seizing the threshing, seizing the transportation, seizing the storage.

"Three Months of Grain"

As expected, starting in early June, within half a month, the wheat was all harvested and threshed. But what was the result? The second order that followed was to distribute the wheat to each household according to population, 40 catties per person per month, half for small mouths, and distribute for three months. The rest was to be stored uniformly by the "Liberated Area Government." As for the past practices, with numerous names but little effect, such as "comfort grain offering," "expansion grain offering," "support for the families of resistance fighters," and "struggle fine grain," etc., were simply abandoned. The wheat issued to the people for only three months of consumption could be kept and stored by themselves. If the area was occupied by the National Army, and the wheat was discovered or lost due to the war, the "Liberated Area Government" would no longer be responsible. Therefore, the food that the people in the "Liberated Area" could control and had the right to handle was only for three months. What would happen after three months? The "Liberated Area Government" controlled all the food of the people, which was no different from controlling the lives of all the people.

The Preserve-Your-Rice-Bowl Movement

Wherever the Communist army arrived, the first "benevolent policy" was to liquidate, struggle, and "the poor people turn over," followed by the equal distribution of land, cattle, and houses seized through struggle. The main purpose of the Communist army was not to love the people, but to coerce them into "joining the army" under the guise of the "Preserve-Your-Rice-Bowl Movement" or the "Protect-Your-Land Movement." Under the Communist army's clever propaganda, people could not protect their distributed property if they did not join the army. Therefore, according to the still incomplete Xinhua News Agency broadcasts for May and June regarding joining the army, in the Jilu Yu Military Region of the Shandong Military Region alone, 11 counties saw 50,000 people joining the army after the "land distribution." After screening, 37,000 people were sent to the front lines, 80% of whom were poor peasants. Zhang Changqi's two sons, two grandsons, and two nephews, six people in all, were conscripted. Seven newly married grooms in Weihai Village, Yanggu County, also "voluntarily" joined the army. In Shouzhang County, 3,500 young men joined the army in three months, 4,000 in Qihe, 1,500 each in Changyi and Chengwucounty, and 5,000 in Liaocheng. The above roughly totals 52,500 people, but how can this number be matched by the conscription figures of any province in the rear?

Forced Conscription

The Communist army's source of soldiers was completed under the manufacture and propaganda of this "Preserve-Your-Rice-Bowl Movement." If propaganda was insufficient, it was followed by enticements (such as using young girls to carry sedan chairs, perform Yangko dances, put on plays, hold farewell rallies, and reduce taxes and levies for those who joined the army, etc.). If enticements were insufficient, they were followed by coercion (such as using criticism, threats, and increasing burdens to force those who were unwilling to join the army to do so). When coercion was insufficient, they resorted to forced conscription, using their tight local organizations to order local administrative organs (such as counties, districts, and villages) to form conscription committees.

The Organization and Replenishment of Militias

After the people were forced to join the army, the first step for most was to become village militiamen (according to statistics, there are currently over 1.13 million village militiamen in Shandong). In principle, they do not leave their hometowns, so people are more easily fooled and willing to enlist. After serving as militiamen for a short period of time, they are reorganized into district squadrons and other units as needed. Their organization and replenishment process is as follows: Village Militia → District Squadron → County Independent Battalion → Joint Defense Brigade → Art and Cadre Unit → Local Corps → Field Army

Each soldier receives better treatment and equipment as they are transferred upwards from the village militia, and they become more respected and "honored" in the Liberated Area. Therefore, a small number of people unknowingly become more willing to be promoted. Not only that, in order to encourage people to fight bravely and willingly after joining the army, the Communist army, in addition to general comfort, especially elevated and respected the status of soldiers in the army. Soldiers sat in the front row when watching plays, and officers sat in the back row. Soldiers sat in the upper seats during banquets, eating dumplings and steamed buns with better vegetables, while officers sat in the lower seats, eating cornbread and millet noodles with poor vegetables. Especially before each combat mission, they would definitely hold large banquets, eating and drinking lavishly for six or seven days. According to common sense, the soldiers should have no more problems and be willing to die!

Sending to Die and Escaping to Live

But the reality is not so simple. When soldiers hear that there is a big feast, most of them invariably believe that their death is not far away! So, the passive ones intentionally harm parts of their bodies to become disabled, or feign illness, or even commit suicide. The active ones take the risk of running away towards government-controlled areas. In order to stop this phenomenon of desertion, the Communist army then promulgated the most terrifying and cruel laws: "Deserters will be killed!" "Deserters will implicate their entire families!" The masses have no other way but to be forced to "martyr" themselves for the "Chinese Communist Party" and "send themselves to death." Many refugees who managed to escape from the "Liberated Area" all said in unison: "In the 'Liberated Area,' we, the common people, have never seen a smiling face. Even if there is one, it only belongs to the Communist ruling class, but it is definitely not the common people!"

### Prelude to Total Mobilization in Cultural Circles of the Capital

— Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua

Nanjing, 15th (Express Dispatch)

Zhang Daofan said: "The current struggle is not a struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; it is the suppression by the entire populace of the nation of traitors who sell out the interests of the nation. It is not a fight for private party interests, but for the survival of the nation and its people." Ren Zhuoxuan said: "We must face the truth and from now on everyone should refer to the Communist bandits as 'Red Traitors' and 'Fifth Columnists'."

Since the issuance of the General Mobilization Order, everything in the capital city has been showing a "dynamic" atmosphere. The political circles have been mobilized, the military circles have been mobilized, the industrial and commercial circles have been mobilized, the women's circles have been mobilized, and yesterday, the cultural circles were also mobilized!

Yesterday at 8 PM, the Central Cultural Movement Committee in Xiangpu Camp was filled with cultural figures from various cultural organizations in the capital, eagerly discussing the total cultural mobilization with their mouths and pens.

The meeting first took place on the upper floor of the Public Recreation Association. Before the meeting, the cultural figures cordially chatted about their respective careers and plans. Only one young master, probably a representative of the Buddhist Association, sat in a corner, waving a paper fan, silent, his mind wandering between worldly involvement and detachment. In fact, during the Anti-Japanese War, monks could even form big knife teams, so today they should also be able to contribute something.

At precisely 8 o'clock, the meeting began. Mr. Zhang Daofan entered the meeting as the host and leader of the cultural movement, and nominated the supervisory committee member

Liu Shidu

Mr. Liu took the chair. Mr. Liu, with his neatly trimmed mustache, smiled as he assumed the chairmanship. Now that the situation is clarified and peace talks have become a thing of the past, Mr. Liu earnestly repeated in his opening remarks: "From now on, we must severely suppress and punish traitors who violate government decrees and national interests. Colleagues in the cultural world should especially strengthen publicity at home and abroad regarding the exposure of the bandit army's atrocities, diligently explore theories of national salvation, and work diligently." His peaceful Sichuan accent was full of passionate sentiments. Next, Mr. Zhang Daofan stood up to give a speech.

Zhang Daofan

Mr. Zhang is an experienced speaker, and he spoke quite fluently. He first made a clear account of the Communist bandits' history of harming the country, and then concluded: "We must recognize that the current struggle is not a struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but the suppression by the entire populace of the nation of traitors who sell out the interests of the nation. It is not a fight for private party interests, but for the survival of the nation and its people." Mr. Zhang's perfect Beijing accent and dramatic gestures couldn't help but remind me of his speaking scene in the film "Secret Code". His sharp tongue has been mobilizing along with the history of the revolution. At this moment, the hearts of the cultural figures should have been shaken by his righteous words, and applause resounded throughout the venue.

In the bright and cheerful breeze of tomorrow, veteran journalist

Xu Junwu

Mr. Xu opened the conversation, requesting that the internal steps of the cultural circles should be consistent, and that each can use their strengths formally. He does not advocate the kind of anti-Japanese stereotyped writing that begins with "Since the July 7th Incident," as that kind of formal unity is precisely the fatal flaw of the cultural circles in the past. He spoke excitedly, and the pair of eyes under the shadows of his prominent forehead emitted a sincere light. (Note: Mr. Xu is currently the editor of the Huaxia supplement.)

Ren Zhuoxuan

Mr. Ren was "moved." He sat modestly to the side and was not seen by the reporter. He said: "In the past, it was an era of peace talks, but now it is an era of suppressing bandits. How to awaken the people of the country for ideological and spiritual mobilization is the responsibility of colleagues in the cultural world." Mr. Ren's speech was very clear, sharp, courageous, and insightful, making him a first-class theorist. The eyes of the entire audience were focused on his gray cloth gown and thin face.

Chen Jianfu

Mr. Chen Jianfu of the Zhi Xing Society, Mr. Chu Boen of the military officer training corps, and Mr. Wang Buyi, editor of Beijige, then spoke in turn. Mr. Wang's words were quite humorous. He believes that there are too many American thighs in the film industry, the broadcasts are full of decadent music, and the drama is also too aristocratic and cannot reach the common people. He further pointed out that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was due to "chopping off the heads of the Japanese devils with big knives," but now people are confused by "I don't want you, I don't want you, you are a useless thing." Zhang Daofan made a reply to this, expressing that efforts should be made to improve in all aspects.

At this time, Mr. Xu Junwu and Mr. Chen Jianfu jointly put forward a proposal, advocating the establishment of a Capital Cultural General Mobilization Committee to regularly launch cultural mobilization work. The proper naming has caused a lot of opinions. Mr. Ren Zhuoxuan advocated that it be named "Capital Pacification and National Salvation Cultural Mobilization Committee", Mr. Zhong Rongcang advocated that it be named "Anti-Communist and National Salvation Cultural Mobilization Committee", and another advocated that it be named "Capital Cultural Anti-Bandit Mobilization Committee". When everyone stated their opinions, they were very enthusiastic. As a result, Zhang Daofan came out to smooth things over, and nominated Ren Zhuoxuan, Hu Yishang, Xu Junwu, Chu Boen, and Chen Jianfu as the five members of the preparatory committee to discuss the cultural mobilization organization and the progress of the work.

The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, it was already 10:55 PM.

Hu Yiguan

Mr. Hu then greeted the other four members of the preparatory committee in the capacity of convener, preparing to continue the discussion overnight. His enthusiasm is admirable.

The fire of suppressing chaos and saving the country has been ignited in the cultural circles, setting off a wave of national self-salvation. When the first ray of dawn shines on this ancient and troubled land tomorrow, this call will surely resound far and wide, and countless mouths and countless pens will be firmly armed to participate in the revolutionary camp against rebellion and aggression.

### New Scenery of Xiamen University

— Ai Te

Xiamen, 8th (Air Dispatch)

Since the victory, the whole country has unanimously demanded educational construction. However, due to the various damages caused by internal strife, the effects we expected have been shattered, leaving the national education still in a precarious situation. However, Xiamen University has assumed the mission of this era and is marching towards the avenue of educational construction!

Xiamen University was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China by the overseas Chinese magnate Chen Jiageng. Mr. Chen ran Xiamen University with his own funds for sixteen years. Later, due to his personal business failure, the government changed it to a national university, and Zang Bendong served as the first president of National Xiamen University. Not long after Mr. Sa took over, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and Xiamen fell into enemy hands. The campus was moved to Changting. During the eight years, due to Mr. Sa's painstaking planning and the joint efforts of the teachers and students of the entire school, the school's reputation continued to rise. It earned the honor of being "the first university east of Calcutta." After the victory, Xiamen University moved back to Xiamen from Changting. Under the leadership of the current president, Dr. Wang Deyi, it not only maintains the excellent traditions of Xiamen University in the past, but also adds a new joy of rebirth.

Most of the original school buildings were destroyed by the enemy. After the restoration, the school did its best to repair them, and now they have been roughly restored. The school buildings are tall and majestic, with mountains behind and the sea in front. Coupled with the pleasant climate of the southern country, people are often recuperating in the shade of green trees, which can be said to be full of poetic flavor.

Xiamen University has four colleges: Liberal Arts, Law, Science and Engineering, and Business. It is divided into Chinese, Foreign Languages, History, Education, Economics, Politics, Law (with Judicial Group), Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Civil Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Aviation, Banking, Accounting, and other departments. In addition to the Department of Marine Biology, which was ordered to be established last year, and the Department of International Trade, which was newly established this fall, there are a total of four colleges and seventeen departments. In addition, the establishment of the Science and Engineering Branch, the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Branch, and the Physical Education Department, it is said that it may be gradually realized in the near future.

In terms of equipment, the impact suffered during the Anti-Japanese War was minimal, so the preservation of books and instruments was possible. The recent large-scale purchase of books for the Liberal Arts and Law Colleges, as well as the completion of the Engineering Building, all demonstrate that Xiamen University is in a courageous leap forward.

In terms of faculty, Wang Yanan, Guo Dali, Guo Yicen... have recently been hired, all of whom are scholars of great renown at home and abroad. The establishment of various research laboratories also shows that the diligent academic style of Xiamen University is being increasingly promoted.

Mr. Kirk, the American Deputy Consul in Shanghai, once visited the school and hoped that American universities could exchange students with Xiamen University. Then we saw reports that the Philippine government would send four students to come. These all show that Dongda is not only the highest national

Xiamen University's enrollment work for this year has been launched in succession. The examination areas are determined to be divided into five areas: Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Nanchang, and Shantou. The number of admissions is temporarily set at 570.

The atmosphere of democracy opened earlier, and Xiamen University has become particularly progressive in recent years. President Wang is leading by example and aspires to build a most ideal and most democratic Xiamen University. We also hope that his wish will be achieved and create a good model for the educational construction of the new China!

### Heavy Rain and Flooding of the Jinjiang River: Severe Flood in Chengdu, the First Tragic Scene in Sixty Years

— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan

Chengdu, 10th (Air Dispatch)

This year is an unfortunate year for Sichuan. In the Land of Abundance, Chengdu, which has always been known for its stability, the man-made rice chaos has just subsided, and the rice shortage problem has not yet been resolved. This month, it suffered an unprecedented flood. More than 100,000 people were affected, and public and private property worth 60 billion yuan was lost. Due to the frequent disasters and misfortunes of the past month, the secluded and peaceful society of Chengdu has turned into a tragic picture of refugees everywhere.

The Chengdu Plain is the richest area in the country because the upper reaches of the Minjiang River have the world-famous Dujiangyan irrigation project, forming the "Land of Abundance where people have no hunger and do not know drought and waterlogging." The quiet Jinjiang River surrounds the Jinjiang City, winding around it like a belt. It is usually only for sightseeing. For hundreds of years, there has been no fear of disaster, which has cultivated the impression and experience of Chengdu people without any flood control. In the past month, there has been incessant rain in western Sichuan, and mountain torrents have erupted. The upper reaches of the Min, Tuo, and Fu rivers have also collapsed. The Feisha Weir and the herringbone dike of the Dujiangyan have been washed away, and the water level of the Neijiang River has surged. Starting from 0:00 on the 4th, Chengdu was suddenly hit by torrential rain, and the world was dark. It lasted for a day and night, and the water depth on the plain was three feet. The Jinjiang River overflowed, and the raging waves poured back into the urban area. In the low-lying areas, the water reached the roof pipes. The city was full of floods, a vast expanse of water. Houses, people, animals, and materials along the river were scattered by the huge waves and flowed with the waves, and the screams shook the sky. The Anshun Bridge, built a hundred years ago, and the Wanfu Bridge, built more than sixty years ago, were both submerged and washed away by the flood. More than sixty other bridges of all sizes were washed away. More than a thousand residents along the river who were unable to escape were washed away by the flood, and all their property was swept away, creating the first great flood in sixty years.

100,000 Victims amidst a Pile of Rubble

The heavy rain stopped on the 5th, but the urban area was still a vast expanse of water. The reporter waded through the water to climb the city tower to have a bird's-eye view of the disaster. All around was a vast expanse of water, with raging waves. The houses, furniture, sundries, corpses, livestock, and goods stored in the warehouses along the river were washed away, rolling and flowing with the waves. The victims helped the old and carried the young, hurrying to climb to high places to avoid the water, portraying the horror of the flood. On the 7th, the flood gradually receded, and the reporter went to the disaster area again to investigate. The once prosperous entertainment area was now just barren smoke and weeds, a pile of rubble. The bustling Anshun and Wanfu Bridges and hundreds of households were swept away by the flood. There were almost no survivors in the houses along the river. The victims, who had lost their homes and property, cried out to the heavens, weeping bitterly, which was truly tragic. According to the survey by the municipal government, more than 30,000 households were affected by the disaster, more than 100,000 people were affected, and the loss of public and private property exceeded 60 billion yuan. This is an unprecedented catastrophe that Chengdu has never suffered in nearly a hundred years.

Collapse of Dujiangyan and Unseasonable Rainfall

Chengdu - a land of peace and happiness on the plain, does not have high mountains and large rivers. Why did it suddenly suffer an unprecedented flood? According to the survey by the Water Conservancy Bureau, the reasons for this catastrophic phenomenon are: First, there has been continuous rain in western Sichuan recently, and mountain torrents have erupted. The flood control projects such as the Feisha Weir and the herringbone dike of the Dujiangyan have been washed down by the floods, and the water level of the Neijiang River has reached its highest point of 23 huas (usually around 7 or 8 huas). The water势 in the western Sichuan basin is vast, and the situation is precarious. Second, there was heavy rain in various places on the 4th, and the rainfall near Chengdu exceeded 300 mm, exceeding the total rainfall of the same month in previous years. The Fu River could not hold it, so it overflowed and flowed horizontally. At the same time, the floods in the upper reaches of the Dujiangyan suddenly arrived, and the two converged into a disaster. At the same time, not only Chengdu, but also more than ten counties near Rong were all flooded, such as Jin, Peng, Chong, Xin, Guan, Wen, and Pi, known as the 16 counties of Chengdu, all suffered unprecedented disasters. The Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Guanxian, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Sichuan-Kang highways were submerged, the highways were washed away, the bridges collapsed, transportation was interrupted, and the property losses of the people were countless. According to the elders, the Neijiang River basin has suffered such a huge disaster, which is the only one in a hundred years.

Starving Victims Awaiting Relief

After the disaster, 100,000 victims were displaced, the scene was tragic, and they were waiting for relief. The provincial and municipal governments united with various agencies to establish a "Joint Emergency Relief Committee". Governor Deng Xihou of the provincial government, Speaker Xiang Chuanyi of the Provincial Council, and Huang Jilu, chairman of the Party Headquarters, went to inspect the disaster situation and console the victims. They also telegraphed Chairman Jiang of the National Government and President Zhang of the Executive Yuan, reporting the disaster situation, and the Central Government allocated 10 billion yuan for emergency relief. In addition to Mr. Deng's personal donation of 18 million yuan for disaster relief, he also launched public and private institutions, industrial and commercial firms, and wealthy households throughout the city to donate generously. However, the most enthusiastic performance was the Chengdu press, which has been the most difficult to work with in peacetime and has been waiting for the rice shortage. The Xin Xin News here first donated one day's salary of 1 million yuan for disaster relief after the flood, and then raised tens of millions of yuan for donations. Central News Agency, Industrial and Commercial Herald, Zhongxing Daily and others responded successively. On the 9th, the Chengdu press specially organized an "Expanded Joint Fundraising Disaster Relief Conference" to launch a city-wide movement to jointly donate one day's income, requesting assistance from colleagues and fellow villagers in Shanghai, Beijing, and Chongqing, and held recreational fundraising activities. With the enthusiasm of the press colleagues, it is predicted that the results will be satisfactory.

Soon, the donation movement from all walks of life was launched enthusiastically. The provincial government has allocated 1 billion yuan for relief, and the Central Government has also decided to remit funds for emergency relief. The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Shanghai Sichuan-Kang Fellow Association have sent telegrams of condolences, which is the highest expression of human sympathy. It is said that "sympathy is a symbol of human civilization." The victims here earnestly hope that the Sichuan compatriots in Beijing and Shanghai will provide practical assistance beyond sympathy.

### Ripples in Paradise: Interesting Issues in the Hangzhou City Council - Social Dancing and Wonton Vendors

— By our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou, 18th (Quick Dispatch)

Even the serene Hangzhou, the "Paradise," occasionally experiences slight ripples. The City Council often serves as the mainstream within these circles of water ripples. These ripples are mostly extraordinarily interesting, making people ponder them and ultimately elicit a faint smile.

On July 11th of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the first Hangzhou City Council held its fifth general meeting, raising two extremely interesting issues: the opening of dance restrictions and the ban on wonton vendors. These two issues troubled the City Councilors with tense and heated debates, and also stirred up the entire city of Hangzhou.

The matter is as follows: Since dancing in Hangzhou was prohibited due to pressure in June of the 35th year (1946), many dancers have lingered on the shores of West Lake, hoping that it would soon be reopened. Therefore, many dance halls have petitioned the city government, requesting to continue

maintaining dancing businesses.

The city government, naturally in favor for the sake of boosting the city's economy and increasing tax revenue, yet newspapers continued to criticize, and the City Council insisted on not allowing it. Consequently, the Sino-American Dance Hall in the Lakeside West Lake Hotel, built with huge investments and elaborate dance floors, had to switch to operating singing cafes and other businesses. Since then, coffee shops would seize every opportunity to request the opening of the dance ban. The city government, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, would open the dance ban for three days during each festival, such as the New Year in the Gregorian calendar last year, and then again for three days during the Lunar New Year. However, after these three days, the coffee shops dragged on, hoping to create a fait accompli. After extending for more than half a month, many newspapers severely criticized them again, and the City Council reconvened. Female councilors strongly opposed dancing, and Speaker Zhang Heng also strongly opposed dancing. Therefore, the city government issued a ban again, and the coffee shop association gathered all its employees to petition the City Council. The next day, the Southeast Daily reported that the dancers wanted to pluck Speaker Zhang's beard and dance nude at the City Council. The day after that, the Southeast Daily reported that Speaker Zhang Heng made a big speech, saying that even if the dancers plucked his beard, he would "remain unyielding." Councilors gathered at the City Council, deeply fearing that the dancers would really dance nude at the City Council. Therefore, each coffee shop put up

big slogans and advertisements

, severely scolding the City Council for inexplicably banning dancing. The Sino-American Coffee Shop even offered free tea to customers, calling for the opening of the dance ban. During this period, the coffee shop association entertained reporters several times, once even saying, "The city government has agreed to open it, and the City Council has nothing to say, as long as the reporters don't speak out." Among the reporters in the city, there were also two different opinions, one in favor of opening the dance ban and the other against it, which almost led to a stalemate at the entertainment meeting.

This spring, Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo initiated fundraising for student loans for impoverished students. The fundraising committee decided to use the opening of the dance ban as one of the fundraising methods. So, they sent an official letter to the city government. When the City Council found out, female councilor Chu Chou-kang strongly opposed it, and the Speaker, of course, did not want to be outdone and also strongly opposed it. This continued until before this City Council meeting. The city government submitted a discussion case to the general meeting, titled "Draft Temporary Measures for Restricting Social Dancing in Entertainment Venues in Hangzhou City as Ordered, Requesting Approval." At the same time, at the anniversary celebration dinner of the City Police Bureau, Qian Jingxi, the acting secretary-general of the City Party Headquarters, took the stage to give a speech, advocating the benefits of opening dancing, saying, "As long as it is managed properly, it can not only maintain good social customs but also boost the city's economy and increase tax revenue. Otherwise, secret dance halls will still operate underground, which is also undesirable." City Council Speaker Zhang Heng talked about his past

"beard-plucking" story,

briefly saying: "The Council previously advocated banning dancing, which led the dancers to want to pluck my beard. At the reporters' social gathering earlier this month, there were many singers. Director Ruan gave the lady two lines of poetry: 'Please look at the guests at the table, all of them have long beards to be plucked.' I also replied to Director Ruan with two lines: 'If I had known what would happen today, I would have regretted not listening to your advice.' Because Director Ruan had strongly advised me not to grow a beard back then." He also said that he had hired a Western female teacher to teach dancing in the past and had mastered the steps, and had not forgotten them completely. The next day, newspapers published an article by Zhan Xiaocen, a member of the Legislative Yuan and advisor to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council, in a prominent position, titled "Why Ban Dancing?" He meant that dancing occupies an important position in human art history. Europe has practiced social dancing for thousands of years without decline because it can promote harmony between the sexes and change social customs. He also said that guests who come to Hangzhou, besides enjoying the scenery, feel lonely. He advocated setting up open-air dance floors in Pinghu Qiuyue, Santanyinyue, Sixth Park, Jiangzhuang, and the public sports field in the summer. After this article was published, the City Council review committee reserved the temporary measures for restricting social dancing submitted by the city government for discussion. Speaker

Zhang Heng stroked his long beard

and said, "I am not afraid of beard-plucking. If, when discussing this proposal, the votes are tied, I will cast the opposing vote." This statement can be said to be an implication from the Speaker. Then, articles were published in the newspapers. One was written by Han Chi-jun, titled "Does Our Country Need Dancing?", mainly arguing that Chinese society cannot accept it at present. The other was written by Wang Xipeng, titled "Who Enjoys Dancing?", arguing that those who enjoy dancing are not the majority of the public, but a small minority. On the 17th, the day of the discussion of the "Measures for Restricting Social Dancing" submitted by the city government, a big debate was triggered. Xu Xiongfei, the chief secretary of the city government, first explained, "After this proposal was submitted, public opinion has reacted with both approval and opposition. In recent years, guests who have come to Hangzhou for sightseeing have often complained that Hangzhou lacks dance halls, which is regrettable. The city government, for the sake of compromise, has cancelled the dance girl system and will open dancing under strict control, which should not cause any abuses. As for the General Mobilization Law, although it is implemented, the United States did not stop dancing during wartime when soldiers were resisting the enemy. By analogy, it is not impossible." Councilors were divided into two factions. One faction, the opposition, said, "May I ask the government, what is the purpose of opening dancing? If it is for financial reasons, it seems that gambling and prostitution can also be opened together. If it is to embellish paradise, then there are many things that should be built, such as environmental hygiene. Also, the target of opening dancing is the wealthy, which may lead to a scene of bright lights and wine in the venue, while beggars are lying outside. The result of opening dancing may lead to problems such as fighting, moral corruption, and corruption." The other faction, the supporters, said, "If dancing is considered to be harmful to social customs, then men and women walking side by side and sitting side by side on rickshaws, sidewalks, and in movie theaters should also be banned. The fact that cities do not allow dancing is something that surprises Westerners."

The two factions were at loggerheads.

The meeting was reconvened in the afternoon for discussion. Many councilors present believed that this was an unprecedentedly tense and heated debate. Just before the discussion of this proposal in the afternoon, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian stood up and explained, "Social dancing is a noble art and social behavior, and the Air Force Academy is also conducting it. Since your council is discussing it like this, I will withdraw this proposal." After the withdrawal, no one in the City Council brought it up for discussion again, and the matter was no longer discussed. The mayor also left the meeting in a hurry. As for whether dancing will be opened in Hangzhou or not, it is still an open question today. I think a problem, especially an entertainment problem, should not be taken too seriously. If it is taken too seriously, it is often difficult to handle. China's social behavior has always been different from that of Europe and the West. If we want to open up to the extent of Europe and the West all at once, there will be many obstacles. But the times are progressing, and we cannot afford to hesitate and wait, or even fail to progress! Another interesting thing is the

attempt to ban wonton vendors.

One councilor, when questioning the head of the city authorities, said, "The clatter of wonton vendors at night disturbs people's sleep and should be stopped." The police chief said that he would do so. Therefore, many wonton vendors on the streets at night were arrested and taken to the authorities. The wonton vendors collectively petitioned the City Council. At the same time, the owner of a wonton stall, Li Datian, wrote a letter to Councilor Zhou Shiruo, who proposed banning the clatter of wonton vendors, saying: "Dear Councilor Zhou Shiruo: When we heard that Mr. Zhou prohibited us from

clattering at night,

we were very alarmed because not being able to clatter at night is tantamount to prohibiting our business and cutting off our livelihood. Who will our families rely on? We are really surprised that rice has become so expensive and prices have risen so high. Why don't you think about us and try to lower them? Instead, you are troubling us wonton vendors. According to Zhou Guangsheng, the clattering at night disturbs people's sleep, but we find it very strange. Sometimes when we carry our stalls to XX Road, in front of a large gate, we only need to clatter twice, and the large gate will open, and a maid will come out to buy wontons. The sound of mahjong tiles can still be heard from inside the room, the clattering sound that disturbs people's sleep. According to the maid, this place is the mansion of Councilor X. Sometimes we see a lady sitting in her own car with a loud bell, disturbing people's sleep, in front of the mansion on XX Road. According to the driver, this is the wife of Councilor X. Mr. Zhou, think about it! Isn't this unreasonable? Which one disturbs people's sleep? We are doing it for a living, what are they doing it for? Please, Mr. Bureau Chief, save the common people and withdraw the order. We will be twelve million times grateful."

The councilors also discussed this case on the 17th. Councilor Zhou said that he had been considering this case for a year before finally raising it today. Another councilor said that if the clattering is not loud, business will not come. He believes that the clattering at night is quite poetic and should be allowed. As a result, the fire committee believed that after this case was raised, the number of wonton vendors at night had decreased, so it was decided to retain the case.

Although these two extremely interesting cases have passed so lightly and easily, the problems still exist and have not been resolved. (Photo by our newspaper)

### New Review of the United Nations' Two Years of Work

Translated by Shanghai United, July 8th

The General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council have held multiple meetings on this issue, focusing on repatriating refugees and resettling them. The countries of origin of the refugees requested their repatriation, while other member states firmly maintained that any refugee who had sufficient reason and knew all the facts should not be sent back to their country against their will.

On December 15, 1946, the General Assembly passed the constitution of the International Refugee Organization. The task of this organization is to repatriate refugees to their countries as much as possible, and for those who cannot be repatriated, to find ways to resettle them elsewhere and supervise their resettlement. The International Refugee Organization has not yet been established. A total of eighteen countries have signed the constitution, but only five of them have signed it unconditionally. The donations from these five countries only account for 19.47% of the first year's budget. The constitution must be ratified by at least fifteen countries before it can be implemented, and the funds must be at least 75% subscribed. However, the Preparatory Committee is already working and, from July 1st, is responsible for taking care of refugees on behalf of the International Refugee Organization.

In terms of trade, the United Nations has taken direct responsibility for conducting negotiations in Geneva to seek a general reduction in tariff barriers. A total of nineteen countries participated in the negotiations. The Economic and Social Council, in order to promote the expansion, production, exchange, and consumption of goods, agreed to convene an international conference in London. Before this conference is convened, a Preparatory Committee will be established to be responsible for drafting the constitution of the International Trade Organization. The Preparatory Committee has held meetings in London and New York successively, and is now continuing to meet in Geneva. At the same time, tariff negotiations in most countries are also underway, on a scale unprecedented in history. The International Trade and Employment Conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, will be held at the end of this year, and the location has not yet been determined. The draft constitution of the International Trade Organization will be submitted to the conference for discussion and approval.

Over the past few months, the United Nations has decided to establish institutions to provide expert assistance to member states. The Economic and Social Council has instructed the Secretariat to cooperate with various specialized agencies to assist member states in recruiting the experts they need and to provide research and other facilities. Several committees under the Economic and Social Council have also been authorized to provide technical or other assistance if requested by member states.

On June 19, 1946, the Economic and Social Council convened the World Health Conference in New York. In addition to the representatives of fifty-one member states, representatives from thirteen other countries attended as observers. The conference passed the constitution of a new international organization, the World Health Organization. This specialized agency will guide and coordinate international health work and carry out many tasks necessary to protect and improve world health. The World Health Organization can be established after sixteen member states of the United Nations ratify the signing. To date, fourteen countries have ratified, ten of which are member states of the United Nations. Before the International Health Organization is formally established, the interim committee is already working.

During the existence of the League of Nations, there was always an effective system that extended worldwide to control the production and distribution of narcotics. This responsibility has now been taken over by the United Nations. Forty-nine member states have signed the protocol of December 11, 1946, to amend the existing agreements on narcotics issues. The Economic and Social Council, at its recent meeting, also discussed measures to control narcotics in Germany and Japan, and recommended them to the governments of those countries. It has also begun new research on the effects of narcotics. In addition, it has asked countries where opium smoking is not prohibited to ban this evil habit and to prohibit the manufacture and sale of opium.

Work has begun on the International Bill of Human Rights (one of the most important tasks of the Human Rights Committee of the Economic and Social Council). The first draft of this bill is currently being drafted by the Drafting Committee and will soon be reported to the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Committee. The final draft is scheduled to be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion in 1948.

One of the human rights, the equal rights of women, is being studied by the Commission on the Status of Women. This committee has held its first meeting. When the General Assembly met in New York, it gave special discussion to the issue of women's suffrage and unanimously passed a resolution calling on all countries that have not yet allowed women to vote to grant women equal suffrage with men.

### Stifled Trade Between Hong Kong and China After Implementation of New Import Control Measures: Large-Scale Guerrilla-Style Smuggling Rampant on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway

— By our Special Correspondent, Cheng Zhizheng

Hong Kong, 16th (Air Dispatch)

Since the implementation of import control measures, the most affected has been Hong Kong. As everyone knows, Hong Kong is a bridge for trade between China and foreign countries. Foreign goods, after arriving in Hong Kong, must be transshipped to Shanghai, or transported through Guangzhou and then to the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's own consumption is extremely weak. When the import control measures were first implemented, the standards were relatively lenient, and Guangzhou was still able to easily obtain import permits. However, on July 1st, a new "exchange settlement method" suddenly came into effect, followed by the stipulation that the second-quarter import quota could not be exceeded. According to this new regulation, each importer can only import US$93 worth of goods per quarter. Such a small figure is tantamount to mocking import merchants. The Guangzhou Import Management Sub-Committee stipulates that qualified importers must have more than 2 billion in capital. However, according to the quota allocated, each quarter importing US$93 worth of materials is probably enough even for a small vendor's capital. The contradictions and conflicts in government decrees often create a lot of jokes.

Since goods from Hong Kong cannot be transported inland, prices in Hong Kong have naturally plummeted. Legitimate merchants who have ordered goods from Britain and the United States are all complaining bitterly because, by the time the goods arrive, the market price may have fallen to half the cost. Therefore, Hong Kong's commerce has been completely stifled by domestic controls. Import-export merchants who can make a profit on the June settlement are few and far between.

These days, the Hong Kong business community has issued a chorus of dissatisfaction, believing that the new measures are a "suicide policy." Dong Zhongwei, Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said, "The government's unreasonable controls must be improved. Industrial raw materials and printing paper, which are urgently needed domestically, have skyrocketed in price due to overly strict controls, increasing the burden on the domestic population, causing factories to close down, and increasing unemployment, which is unimaginable." It is heard that from July 1st to 14th, no one in Guangzhou went through the procedures to apply for a permit in accordance with the regulations, which fully illustrates how disappointing and ridiculous the new measures are. Because of the government's unreasonable control over imports, "smuggling" has become particularly active in South China. Smuggling in South China is almost an open secret and is a large-scale organization. Legitimate merchants, forced by circumstances, have slowly joined their groups, which is a very painful thing to say.

There are no less than 20 smuggling organizations in Hong Kong. They guarantee the delivery of goods to Guangzhou. Ordinary goods are charged a 20% handling fee based on the price of the goods, and special goods such as cosmetics and telecommunications equipment are charged a handling fee as high as 50%. After you pay for the goods in Hong Kong, they take an equivalent bank deposit as a guarantee. If the goods are confiscated en route, they are responsible for compensation, and their credit is very reliable. They have special forces as protection, so the customs can do nothing. Newspapers often carry reports of "sea battles" between customs anti-smuggling ships and smuggling boats, and the winners are often the smugglers. For example, the Qingyuan gunboat of the Guangdong Customs encountered a smuggling boat in the deep of night on April 28th. After several hours of fierce fighting, it was finally escaped, and as many as 16 customs anti-smuggling personnel were killed or injured, which shows the extent of smuggling. In addition to the smuggled goods departing from Hong Kong, Macau is also a shortcut for smuggling. Macau is adjacent to Zhongshan County, and there are even more mysterious smuggling methods. Although the Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to Hong Kong again to study how to prevent smuggling, it has achieved no results. The main reason is that import laws and regulations are too strict, driving merchants to take this road, and the secondary reason is that there are people behind the smugglers, and they are afraid of hurting the rats if they throw the stones.

In addition to large-scale smuggling, there is also guerrilla-style smuggling. They use the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway as a tool and often carry small amounts of smuggled goods, bringing rice from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and bringing Western medicines and cigarettes from Hong Kong back to Guangzhou. There are now at least 3,000 smugglers running independently on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.

Smuggling methods can be divided into four types: bypassing, deceiving, buying, and breaking through. Large-scale smuggling organizations naturally focus on buying passes and breaking through customs. Unorganized smugglers have to bypass customs and deceive customs. The revenue of the Guangdong Customs in April was 17 billion yuan, and it is estimated that it will only collect 4.5 billion yuan in July. If the government does not cut off the source of the problem and relax the control standards, not only will customs revenue become less and less, but also smuggling in South China will get out of hand.

### Artist's Demeanor

— Sun Fuxi

From Wei Fang Yuan to the Chinese Painting Circle

When I was in Kunming, Mr. Ji Kang lived in "Wei Fang Yuan." The flowers and trees were lush, and birds sang all around. I once painted Yunnan tea in this garden and wrote down my thoughts on viewing Dong Yuan's paintings in the garden.

Madam Liang Zheng Su, the owner of Wei Fang Yuan, is skilled in calligraphy and painting and hospitable. During the difficult life of the War of Resistance, we often had simple tea parties and wine gatherings to resist the suffering of materials with the spirit of literary and artistic research. This small gathering was held in rotation. Mr. Zhou Zijing was at the Academia Sinica in the western suburbs, Huang Yuke and Guangsheng were at the Chonglu residence of the Shanghai Bank, and Liu Xueran and I were at the Commercial Hotel, which I named "Heaven and Earth as Reading." Each gathering had programs such as collaborative painting and musical performances. Once, there was an exhibition of Annamese painters and an Annamese music performance. At that time, I often said, "The joy now is not surprising. In five or ten years, we will know that today's meaning is strong in retrospect." In less than five years, the memories of today have become many times richer than before.

The Yunnan Provincial Cultural Movement Committee initiated the first Yunnan Provincial Art Exhibition. I was the leader of the Art Group of the Cultural Movement Committee and served as the main backbone. I was the initiator and also the director of the National Art Army Exhibition. Every time an art exhibition was held, the affairs were busy, and there were not many assistants. Mr. Ji and Mrs. Liang both participated in the exhibition and helped with all the affairs, seeking public welfare and not counting private interests, so the donation results were very good.

At that time, there were more and more Allied forces gathering in Kunming. From the Flying Tigers to the 14th Air Force to various types of infantry, artillery, paratrooper, and transportation units, many new airfields were opened, and many new hostels were built. In short, everything in society changed greatly. Many people knew that there was a profit to be made and that the opportunity could not be missed. Under the name of the overall War of Resistance, some opened bars and dance halls, and some sold cigarettes, canned food, and American dollars. Even the children polished various Chinese copper coins and silver dimes and peddled them to American soldiers all over the streets as souvenirs of their trip to China, ripping them off mercilessly.

Professor Wu Yuseng (Mi) often interacted with British and American people. In view of the fact that the Allied forces had too little understanding of China, and that what China provided to the Allied forces was too boring and too humble, it was agreed that the person in charge of the American military hostel should write a letter inviting Chinese painters to hold an exhibition in the hostel's reception room and give lectures on painting. Mrs. Liang, Mr. Ji, and I went together, cooperating in painting performances, all of which were explained by Professor Wu in fluent English, which made everyone feel refreshed. This was of great benefit to the propaganda of Chinese culture, and Mr. Ji's works were sold at low prices in large quantities to the United States, not only spreading the good name of Chinese art, but also earning a considerable amount of American dollar foreign exchange.

At that time, Mr. Ji's works became the only high-end comfort items for the Allied forces.

We can tell at a glance that Mr. Ji's paintings are deeply rooted in the essence of the Northern Song Dynasty court. Whether it is flowers, plants, insects, birds, dragons, tigers, landscapes, or especially ladies, they are all magnificent and elegant. His deep skills are unmatched by ordinary people. However, he never copies or drafts. His lively and vigorous air comes entirely from his close contact with nature, so he can paint vividly and be full of aura.

Among the paintings shipped to the United States, flowers and birds were of course the most numerous, and ladies were not a few. At that time, there were four "Romance of the West Chamber" paintings, which were meticulously painted and had a light and subtle demeanor. Because they were not for sale, after many people enthusiastically sought them, they finally had to be separated and had to be restructured, re-weighed I don't know how many copies. Now, he has made a complete set of sixteen paintings, which are indeed masterpieces. There are also twelve "Hundred Horses" paintings, with a hundred horses of different shapes and colors arranged in the beautiful scenery of the twelve months of the year. Each painting has figures, indicating that they are all like Bole. However, the complete picture of Xixiang and the Hundred Horses were collected by Mr. Feng Peifen when he left Yunnan.

In addition to many excellent paintings, Wei Fang Yuan also produced a popular product: ancient costume beauties. Mr. Ji studied the costumes of various dynasties, and Mrs. Liang helped him make models for painting reference. Friends asked for them one after another, so he trained girls to produce them in large quantities. The head and hands were made of white rubber models, painted with colors, and painted with eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and nose, just like living people. The most wonderful thing is that the same model has different ages, personalities, and expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness due to the different facial features painted. Many of these beauties were also given to the United States.

Mr. Ji reads books and paints behind closed doors, with the demeanor of an artist. Some envy his talent, and some laugh at his stupidity. In the eyes of artists, talent is not worth boasting about, and stupidity is not worth being ashamed of. Wandering in another world, it is enough to satisfy one's own ideals. Everything else is not what is asked.

Mr. Ji is not only good at meticulous brushwork, but also his freehand brushwork is outstanding, high, and ancient, which is unattainable. Mr. Ji is young and strong, and his future progress is limitless, but meticulous brushwork is too laborious and cannot be mass-produced by people over forty. Now that an exhibition is being held in the Chinese Painting Academy, appreciators should take a look as soon as possible.

Shou Zhu uses a le knife for all his seal carvings, so his imitation of Han seal is vigorous and elegant, which can be called unique for a time; Zhan Xi is also exquisite and stable. He has been accustomed to learning from a young age, so he has unique insights.

### Talking about Woodcuts from Outside the Door

— One Table

In the seventh issue of the "New Woodcut" of the XXX newspaper, there is an article by Mr. An Huai entitled "Talking about New Woodcuts and Old Woodcuts," which discusses Mr. Xu Weinan's "Contradictions in the Woodcut World" published in this journal on June 22. I am completely an outsider when it comes to woodcuts; however, whether they are new or old, I like them all. Based on my poor experience of liking them, I cannot agree with Mr. An Huai's statement.

Mr. An said that the only "narrow" point of old woodcuts that is worth taking is that "the most basic nature of old woodcuts is only that they were valued for long-distance and mass distribution before the development of scientific plate making technology, which is the same as today's copper-zinc plates. Later, because some were finely crafted and more ancient and interesting than scientific plate making, they were appreciated by literati." He does not recognize that the carving skills of art woodcuts are an art, so he further said: "If this simple technology of copying is worth promoting, then today many photographers and scientific plate makers can also be praised as genius art sages. ..."

Mr. An seems to have only grasped a copy of the "Beiping Letterhead," and neglected the woodcut works of hundreds of years, so he denied that carving is also an art. The "Beiping Letterhead" is indeed a plaything used by literati such as Chen Shizeng and Qi Baishi to replace copper-zinc plates; however, it cannot be concluded that copying technology is equal to copper-zinc plates. The characters in Chen Laoyun's "Water Margin Pages" at the end of the Ming Dynasty are as vivid as life, and their eyes seem to radiate light; the shadow carvings during the Yongzheng period also have no major differences from the original works due to the superb carving skills. However, looking at the recently published "Water Margin" with copper pictures, those pictures, in addition to being "similar in form," are completely different in spirit. What is the reason for this? If it is not recognized that copying is also an art, why did Mr. Lu Xun use five-color rubber plates to print the "Beiping Letterhead" when he compiled it, and why did Mr. Xidi use carving when he compiled the "Illustrated Catalogue of Chinese Prints"? Especially the latter, part of it was first made into collotype plates, lithographed, and then carved and printed again. Woodcut paintings have the characteristics of woodcut paintings, just like other Gang paintings, all of which are a kind of art; and are different from photography. In today's era of developed plate making technology, Mr. An holds a steel knife to create, and does not seek copper plates and zinc plates. From the perspective of an outsider like me, I am afraid there is also a reason.

I don't know if Mr. An has read other old woodcuts besides the "Beiping Letterhead"? Chinese old woodcuts are not all copies. According to Mr. Xidi's research, Huang's father and son, the carving craftsmen of the Zhengpai prints, are all able to manage their own ideas. The "Zhuangyuan Tu Kao" is one of Huang Yingcheng's creations. It can be seen that Chinese carving craftsmen are not all the same as "photographers." Many talented artists of the past were regarded as "craftsmen" after their death, which is too sad.

Mr. An, who accepted Western woodcut art, may have "forgotten" that the West also has the art of copying. The "Beast Pictures," "Bird Pictures," and "Reynard the Fox" illustrations in England during the 18th and 19th centuries were all separated from drawing and carving. "People often think that prints are mostly imitations of famous works and are not an independent art. However, is it easy to extract the essence from famous paintings! ... It can be said that painters and woodcut artists are like the two wings of a bird and the changing wheels of a car, relying on each other for use." What Mr. Zheng Zhenduo said in the History of Chinese Prints is worth reading by Mr. An!

Considering copying as a copper-zinc plate and carving craftsmen as photographers, I don't know how many people besides Mr. An would agree with this statement!

Mr. An Huai pointed out that the current goal of woodcuts is "realism and national form"; this path is naturally correct. But he also said: "If it doesn't, won't it go into the horns of landscapes, flowers, birds, fish, and insects again"? I repeatedly suspect: I don't know if Mr. An has read other old woodcuts besides the "Beiping Letterhead"? From his words, it can be inferred that the old woodcuts in his mind are purely the "dead end" of landscapes, flowers, birds, fish, and insects; but there is a wider world in old woodcuts! Many illustrations of operas in the Ming and Qing dynasties, in addition to historical stories, had profound realism at that time; their themes were by no means limited to landscapes, insects, and fish. To give an example that is "suitable for both elegant and popular tastes"; Fei Danxu's "Yin Zhi Wen Tu Zheng" during the Daoguang and Xianfeng years is to persuade people to do good, punish evil, and teach people to believe in gods; (in that feudal, theocratic era, people naturally did not know what "realism and national form" were, and Shanghai naturally forgave them.) I don't know what is the difference in principle between the "sermons" of "Yin Zhi Wen Tu Zheng" and many woodcuts that "sermonize" for Marxism-Leninism today? It can be seen that old woodcuts are not purely a "dead end," it's just that the authors of new woodcuts have not accepted them well.

Mr. An finally mentioned "popularization." He believes that promoting old woodcuts is not as good as promoting comic strips; he also quoted Lu Xun's words, implying that old woodcuts seem to be "small decorations for literati and scholars." This sentence is naturally beyond question if the "Beiping Letterhead" is used as the "target." However, countless volumes of Buddhist scriptures, operas, and novels, especially woodcuts such as "Baixiao Tu Shuo," are still loved and read by the general public today. Can you say that they are not "popular"? Can you say that they are "small decorations for literati and scholars"?

With the above words, I am not obliterating the efforts of new woodcut artists in the past twenty years; on the contrary, the efforts of woodcut artists should be praised. However, as a new woodcut artist, Mr. An Huai, when he only knows "half of Europe and the United States" and only knows a copy of the "Beiping Letterhead," he completely denies the efforts of Chinese woodcut artists for thousands of years, and even says that they are all like photographers and plate makers. This narrow mind should not be possessed by an artist.

According to the editor: Although new woodcuts have only had a history of twenty years in China, they have been advocated by advanced literary circles and have participated in anti-war propaganda. Judging from the exhibits of the first national woodcut exhibition held in Shanghai by the Woodcut Association in April this year after the restoration, the content is rich and the results are quite impressive.

Of course, the average woodcut artist will not obliterate the fact that woodcuts have a history of thousands of years in China, have penetrated into the folk, and have established a national form. Naturally, there are also a few people who ignore traditional artistic skills and think that they are just imitations of Western plate spirits. Therefore, there is a debate between new woodcuts and old woodcuts. In fact, this problem is very common. Just like in literature, someone also felt that the vocabulary of spoken language was poor ten years ago and advocated learning from classical literary works. Originally, this was just a method of guiding young people to write. But at that time, it encountered a lot of criticism; and on the other hand, someone introduced the arguments that Shakespeare enriched the language of English-speaking countries and Pushkin enriched the vocabulary of Russian, which was unanimously recognized as the supreme truth. Therefore, this problem is just like arguing whether the moon is brighter in foreign countries or brighter in China, and there is no need to wait for a conclusion.

I always think like this: Chinese modern literature and art are indeed barren and poor. We need to learn, learn seriously, without favoring Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, famous and famous works. All are objects of learning, but we should absorb their essence and eliminate their dross, which is also an old saying.

Mr. Xu's and Mr. Yiji's articles are also well-intentioned suggestions, re-prompting the woodcut world with a direction to adopt reference materials. From this point of view, I think Mr. An Huai will also agree. As for the limited space in this journal, the discussion on this issue is also intended to end here.

According to a letter from the author of this article, there are also pictures of the title page of "Mu Yun Saves Her Mother," carved by Huang Ting in Huizhou during the Wanli period, Meng Meinu of the Ming shadow carved Song edition of "Lienu Zhuan," and Qi Gai's "Dream of the Red Chamber Yong Tu" of the Qing Dynasty, which are planned to be inserted into this article. "Because I am afraid of damage during mailing, and I don't know if this manuscript is available, I have not attached them." I also declare on behalf of the author. (Editor)

### Longevity, Wealth, and Honor Painting

— Ling Xu

### One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood 356

— Ye Jingfeng

I was indeed a little tired; their reasons did have some merit, so I discussed it briefly, exchanged some ideas, and let "04" use the military to escort Dingyuan back and inquire about Yaoqun's whereabouts.

During the period of military operations, especially when military affairs are busy and work is urgent, one of the most difficult problems for senior and junior generals responsible for commanding the battle is sleep. During the period of attack and defense, sufficient sleep is simply out of the question; being able to sleep peacefully for three or four hours is considered supreme happiness. However, sleep is also an indispensable condition for maintaining life; because without sleep, the brain cannot rest. Without rest, if the working hours are too long, even if you have the spirit of a dragon and horse, you will feel dizzy. Not to mention emergency finger placement, the most important issue of starting a new car at the right time, even simple mechanical work such as approval and reply will be wrong if the head is not clear.

Senior commanders, of course, have confidential secretaries, staff, staff officers, adjutants, etc., who can take over and handle things within a certain range, and can take a little time off to rest. At my level, especially my special work, which is so trivial, so complicated, so secret, and every question has a considerable weight, almost everything has to be handled personally; it is simply impossible not to handle it personally, so how can we get enough sleep? Moreover, as the naughty Miss Zishan of Bainin Manor said, seeing the work on this route of our troops is a life-threatening game that "risks three dangers," which is different from ordinary special agents. To tell the truth, we have to worry about things even in our dreams, fearing that if we relax our nerves for a moment, we will reveal the "three-fold" secret in our dreams; therefore, sleep is a very serious problem for us.

But the few people close to us all have their own "secrets" for sleeping: for example, "04," the eldest, doesn't need us to worry about him. His physique is even stronger than a water buffalo, so he has a natural virtue of being able to keep his eyes open for more than thirty hours. However, he also has a flaw. Sometimes when he gets sleepy, he hasn't even finished a meal, and the chopsticks and bowl are still in his hand, and he can immediately fall on the table, snoring loudly, and fall asleep in Handan. Once he is asleep, you can't wake him up even if you prick him with an awl. There is also a biggest problem. He likes to grind his teeth and saw his teeth in his sleep. The sound is like chewing pebbles; and while sawing his teeth, he keeps talking in his sleep. The wonderful thing is that he has a big tongue and a stutter. He uses Korean, Japanese, and Shandong dialects in his words, and no one can understand what he is saying.

As for Mr. W, it can be said that he has the spirit of a dragon and horse and seems to never need to sleep. As long as there is something to do, no matter when you go to see him, 24 hours a day, his slender and slightly protruding eyes are always lively and wide open. When asked why he doesn't feel tired, he always answers you with a smile, "It's not time to sleep yet!" According to his subordinates, he can sleep for three days and three nights when he has nothing to do. This is somewhat like the physiology of the American inventor Edison.

As for Tsurumi, he has practiced Japanese-style "endurance" in the army. He can stand there with his eyes open and sleep, he can also sleep while walking, and he can also talk while snoring; no matter how tired he is, as long as he encounters the stimulation of an important problem, he can immediately be refreshed. Just a basin of cold water is enough, and he can pour it on his head and face.

### On the Theory of Painting Having Teachers But No Sects

— Shi Chongpeng

Chinese painting originated from hieroglyphs, was born out of fortune, and has changed a lot. From form to formlessness, spirit, artistic conception, fineness, meticulousness, depicting natural scenery, and exerting the author's spirituality, it is divided according to the author's personality and talent. The substantive value of painting lies in this, and the national spirit of painting also lies in this; there is no distinction between sects at first. Later generations forcibly divided painting into the Northern and Southern schools, the court style and the non-court style, the literati painting school, and even the regional schools, etc. In terms of the essence of painting, this is actually an extremely unfair statement.

Dong Qichang called Wang Youcheng the ancestor of the Southern School and Li Sixun the ancestor of the Northern School. This distinction between the North and the South is based on the difference between their ink rendering and green silk outlining. However, this water milling rendering and nephrite green outlining are only different in method and form, and there is no difference in the goal of depicting nature, performing scenery, and exerting the author's spirituality. Dong Qichang also said: "The Northern School has been followed by Liu Li Ma Xia... since the Li family and his son, and the Southern School has been followed by Jing Guan Dong Ju... since Mojie." Judging from the world-renowned paintings of Nuojia and reading the records of past dynasties, the works of Liu Li Ma Xia and Jing Guan Dong Ju may not have any fundamental differences. History said; "Dong Beiyuan wrote landscapes of Jiangnan, with colors similar to Li Sixun, and ink similar to Wang Wei." The true works of Wang and Li are rare in the world. I saw the Wang and Li paintings collected by the Forbidden City in the past, and I don't know if they are true works? In addition to Li's delicacy and Wang's vigor, they are also strict and solemn. Other famous works handed down from Dong Yuan include "Dongtian Shancang" and "Long Su Jiao Ying," which combine green and blue ink, and are no different from Liu Li.

As for the transmission of painting techniques, teacher inheritance has been around for a long time, but the great masters of the past, although they started by inheriting a certain family or a certain method, they must be able to create their own faces and open up new paths in the end. After they reach the peak, they can never be confined by a certain sect or school. If you are concerned about the gains and losses of a teacher and do not change for the rest of your life, your painting will not be a great success; this is why I say that painting has a teacher but no sect.

Mr. Ji Kang of Cixi, his ancestors were all proficient in painting, and his family learning was very profound. Figures, landscapes, flowers, birds, and insects are all wonderful. Recently, an exhibition was held in the Chinese Painting Academy. The author was introduced by the female painter Pang Zuowang and had the advantage of seeing the exhibition in advance. I deeply admire his exquisite painting cultivation, high-level technique inheritance, and the quiet and elegant spirit and breath. The famous horses and beauties he made are derived from Han Gan and Gu Kaizhi. "Double Horse Picture" and "Eight Horses" are straight into the room of Jin and Tang Dynasties. Landscapes, flowers, and birds are derived from Mi Gao Ma Xia, as well as Qian Shunkyu and Yun Nantian, combining the methods of green and blue ink, boneless double hooks. Among the figures and landscapes, I love "Fufu Gusong Mian Panhuan" the most, using the Songxue version, which is better than blue, and Shen Yinlao's inscription can be called a icing on the cake.

Looking at Ningfu's paintings, the charming and delicate atmosphere is implied in the neat and rigorous. It is impossible to limit it to a certain sect or school. Tracing the source, Li Longmian, Han Gan, Liu Songnian, Xia Yuyu, and Huang Quan, Xu Xi, Qian Shunkyu, and Tantian, are all teachers of Ningfu, and they integrate and are not limited to a certain school or sect and open up new paths. Ningfu is no longer far away

Shanghai Beach Gossip

### Incoming Japanese Goods

— Sea Breeze

In the past two days, the general price level in this city has declined. Aside from other reasons, the impending arrival of Japanese goods in China next month is also one of the main factors.

This opening of Sino-Japanese trade is purely of a private nature. According to sources such as Supervisory Committee member Mei, the total value of goods to be exported to China throughout this year is US$99,180,000, while the value of goods China will export to Japan is US$47,768,000. Offsetting the two figures, our trade deficit is US$50,000,000.

The majority of goods Japan exports are light industrial products, such as bicycles, watches, cameras, cotton goods, etc., which will be dumped into China in large quantities.

Those light, flimsy Japanese goods that we often saw ten years ago will reappear in the bustling cities across the country in a month or two.

Our government has adopted extremely cautious measures regarding the opening of private trade with Japan. According to the announced measures, there are approximately the following points: (1) There are still considerable restrictions on the selection of factory merchants applying to go to Japan; (2) The quota for commercial representatives to Japan is tentatively set at 64 people.

The main reason why the United States strongly advocates opening trade with Japan and adopts export subsidy policies for this export of Japanese goods is to gradually reduce the cost of American occupation in Japan. The recent US trade goal for Japan is to enable Japan to pay for imports with export earnings. If this goal can be achieved, US gold reserves will not continue to flow out.

According to statistics, since January of last year, the United States has spent US$3 billion in Japan.

And MacArthur's recent actions are aimed at this goal.

However, in China, the opening of trade alone is very unfavorable. Here is a brief introduction to the reactions from various parties:

(1) Supervisory Committee members Wan and others submitted a temporary emergency proposal on the 16th, requesting the government to stop considering opening trade with Japan. The reason is that the Sino-Japanese private trade deficit reaches US$50,000,000, and the goods China exports to Japan are extremely scarce in China, such as coal, etc. Therefore, before signing a peace treaty with Japan, the dispatch of a commercial delegation to Japan should be suspended.

(2) Chinese economic experts believe that the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade on August 15 is a kind of "economic aggression." At present, China has no goods to export, while Japan, whose industry has not suffered losses, will massively dump manufactured goods into China. In particular, MacArthur's regulation that Japanese trade with the United States is calculated in US dollars is tantamount to a "one-way traffic."

(3) The Northeast region believes that Japan's "starvation exports" mean that the Northeast currently has nothing to export, and North China only has salt, but salt can help Japan's military and chemical industries. The "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation" advocated by Japan before the "July 7th Incident" is now being gradually implemented under the American occupation.

(4) Private individuals believe that the labor cost in Shanghai is now eight times higher than in Nagasaki. How can they compete with Japan? After Japan opens up to foreign trade, not only will the Nanyang market be occupied by Japan, but China itself will become a flood zone for Japanese goods.

Based on these reasons, trade with Japan needs to be carefully considered.

### Between Civilization and Barbarism

— Pu Lun

– A Record of Contrasts in Human Bodies

There is an interesting contrast between the bodies of barbarians and civilized people, as demonstrated in an exhibition by an Austrian graphic artist named Bernard Rudofsky.

Many famous graphic artists believe that the human forms they depict possess natural beauty, that is, the human body is inherently beautiful. However, Bernard Rudofsky denies this, saying that people are often very dissatisfied with their bodies. This mischievous theory of his has attracted much attention and interest.

Bernard Rudofsky has been studying this issue for quite some time, constantly playing with himself and his wife. He struggles with facts, trying to find materials on the human forms of barbarians and civilized people to prove his theory. Finally, he opened an exhibition and also authored a book on the subject.

His collected works include cartoons, silhouettes, plaster figures, and photographs. Among these works, the first to give us a deep impression is how ugly and fragile the women of the ancient cave dwellings were in every part. At the same time, the contrast between the bodies of barbarians and civilized people is particularly evident here.

For example, the corsets and bras worn by modern women are the same as the ancient women's tight waists and protected breasts. The glasses of 1900 emphasized aesthetics rather than practicality, which is similar to the function of the glasses of 1946. The mask-like headgear worn by women in the Arab state of Oman is surprisingly similar to glasses. Burmese women still retain more than a dozen brass rings around their necks, resembling giraffe cubs, which is somewhat similar to the neck bead circles worn by women in the Victorian era of England. The bound feet of Chinese women are similar in shape to wearing high heels. From birth, the heads of African children are always tightly wrapped in cloth, shaped like cylinders, which is similar to the hairstyles of modern women today. The high-backed and shapely aprons worn by women in the Victorian era of England are exactly the same as the particularly swollen buttocks of women of a certain Hottentot tribe in South Africa. Recently, women have been wearing earrings with two pieces facing each other on one ear, which is similar to the women of another African tribe, the Sandagulus, who pierce their ears and hang ornaments. Modern women's clothing and even the colors of chairs are similar to the people of the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific, who have tattoos from their faces, arms, lower bodies, all the way to their toes. Some primitive tribes have brides who are half-naked, which is somewhat similar to the half-naked fashions of 1946. Virgins in the Congo region of Africa wear a piece of cloth around their arms on their naked bodies to show chastity, which is also similar to the latest women's clothing, which also has a circular piece of cloth extending from the back.

In addition, dissatisfaction with human appearance began in primitive times, because that was the period when humans fought against beasts, so there was a feeling of inferiority to animals. Human skin was not as beautifully colored as the feathers of birds, humans were not as strong as dogs, and were even easier to fall than groundhogs. Therefore, they tattooed their skin with patterns and painted it with colors. They made their eyes shine like the eyes of an eagle, and women tried their best to seek their unnatural walk. Regardless of whether their consciousness is right or wrong, it is at least an expression of their dissatisfaction with their bodies.

The history of the human body is a part of human history. From ancient times to the present, the bodies of civilized people have become more and more beautiful.

A Monument to Corruption

Meng Zhu, the former magistrate of Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, was impeached by the Control Yuan for corruption and dereliction of duty during his tenure. An order was issued to the province for punishment. The people of the county pooled funds of tens of millions to erect a "Meng Zhu Corruption Monument" in the city center, with a statue of Meng Zhu engraved on it, followed by Meng's dereliction of duty, totaling two thousand words. The monument is being carved by Liu Kaiqu from the sea and is expected to be completed this month. A grand ceremony will be held upon completion of the project.

Cooperation between Prostitutes and Merchants

The Xinxin District of Shimen City, Hunan Province, is far west of the urban area, with only brothels isolated in the area, far from the city, so business is very bleak. Recently, the acrobatics industry and the brothel industry in the city felt that their relationship was close and that cooperation was necessary. They jointly petitioned the municipal government, proposing to designate the area where the brothels in Xinxin District are concentrated as a market, so that merchants and prostitutes can cooperate and the urban area will not be difficult to prosper. The municipal government has approved the relocation and instructed the police to handle the selection of the site.

Love Group

The "Love Group" in Nanchang is reorganized. It is reported that the group will dispatch capable cadres to various major cities such as Shangrao, Jiujiang, and Ganxian to actively carry out activities. The members of the group are all intellectual young men and women, especially many young women. The purpose is to use "sex" as capital and "love" as a means to obtain material enjoyment. The initiator is a female student surnamed Xiong in Nanchang, who serves as the head of the group, with a chief of staff, also a woman. Below are several groups, each with a group leader and ten members, half male and half female. Every ten small groups form a large group, with a director. Recently, the group stipulated that all members should gather at the Nanchang Provincial Stadium every Sunday.

Tears of Opium Prohibition

During a recent general meeting of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, many assembly members criticized the increasingly serious opium problem in Sichuan Province and expressed doubts about the anti-drug work. Assembly member Jin Xiaogeng said: "When anti-drug supervisors go to the border areas to investigate opium, the sedan chair carriers are often opium addicts. He not only dares not arrest them, but also dares not let them know what he is doing, otherwise he will not be able to find anyone to carry him."

Honest Intimidator

Sun Honglin, the president of the Jiangsu Provincial High Court, received two threatening letters in his residence, demanding two hundred million yuan from Sun. The sender signed Pan Renyi and specified a detailed address. The Suzhou Police Department arrested him at the address and sent him to the procuratorate for interrogation. After a forensic examination, it was found that the Pan had severe neurasthenia, and the result was a suspended sentence of two years. — Dongfang Jing

### Dragonflies are Greedy, Beetles are Surprisingly Strong

— Dongfang Jing

A beetle can drag something forty times heavier than itself. If the beetle were as big as a horse, it could drag a car weighing 100,000 pounds.

The pyramids are 410 feet high, and the tallest skyscraper in the world is 1,250 feet high, which is only more than two hundred times taller than a six-foot-tall person. However, there is a kind of white ant in Africa whose nests are a thousand times taller than their bodies.

The larvae of a certain black fly can jump out of a four-inch-deep box. If humans had this jumping ability, they could jump up to eight floors with just one kick. Fleas can jump a distance two hundred times longer than themselves. If humans had the ability of fleas, they could jump more than a thousand feet.

Imagine a person with a good appetite sitting there in the afternoon eating roast chicken, one every five minutes, all afternoon. Of course, this is just a fantasy. But if humans had the appetite of dragonflies, it would not be surprising to eat a chicken every five minutes. A dragonfly eats forty flies in two hours. Dragonflies are the most voracious creatures in the world. As long as it has something to eat, it will be at ease even if it is on a needle bed. A biologist once cut off the tail of a dragonfly and fed it into its gluttonous mouth.

The Academy Award-Winning "Mildred Pierce"

In recent years, Hollywood has been plagued by a shortage of scripts. Therefore, many American bestsellers and popular novels, regardless of their literary value, have been adapted into movies by filmmakers to fill the needs of the producers.

"Mildred Pierce" is based on James M. Cain's popular novel. The story is the one commonly seen in movies. However, this script has its considerable merits in terms of writing technique.

The story depicts a mother who sacrifices everything for her beloved daughter, even selling herself, but what she pursues is a tragic result. The script's depiction of the social life of American capitalism is true and vivid. It portrays those Americans who are doing business all day long, and even when they are in love and forming families, they are accustomed to solving problems in a businesslike manner. This at least allows us to understand one aspect of the life of a money-oriented society. Besides that, there is only the pitiful mother who dotes on her daughter and still suffers the consequences.

Joan Crawford, who won the Academy Award, does have superb and sophisticated acting skills in this film. But we must recommend director Michael Curtiz's excellent skills. He handled the whole play naturally and meticulously. Even the flashback method, which is the most difficult to please, is so smooth and seamless under his use. The use of the camera is also worth studying by those who love film art. Technically, the photography, lighting, and recording are all excellent.

The Mediocre "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"

Alan Ladd is a rising star in Hollywood in recent years, and this "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" is being promoted as his first film after returning to the film search after demobilization. However, the content of the script is a Hollywood cliché, temptation, worldliness, assassination, framing, and revenge, linking these many plots together to form this story.

Alan Ladd does not have better acting skills, but William Bendix's Buzz has rich creativity, and Howard St. John's hoodlum Harv Howard is quite good. Doris Dowling's Helen, the female lead, has too weak acting skills.

The Nonsensical "The Bachelor's Daughters"

A clerk disguised as a gentleman and tricked a young lady into love. This is not breaking the class love, but a "suspended" story in the ideological sense of emptiness in life. The story is written nonsensically and far-fetched. The director and actors have no merit.

The Hollow "House of Horrors"

This is another detective film that uses tension, stimulation, horror, and love as its selling points. The story itself is mediocre and not worth taking.

The director's handling of the play also fails to grasp the style of the play. This is just a cliché third- or fourth-rate film.

The Unremarkable "Blind Spot"

When Hollywood screenwriters can't find newer detective film themes, they think of this "Blind Spot". This "Seeing Eye Dog" is used as the protagonist, and the blind detective is used as a foil, but the story in the script still lacks a realistic basis. Furthermore, there are no particularly amazing arrangements for the "Seeing Eye Dog" in the film. The blind detective, on the other hand, is arranged in a way that seems unreasonable.

Edward Arnold, who plays the detective, has extremely calm and experienced acting skills. Lola Lane's Laurena is merely competent.

Two Musical Films

Nelson Eddy's "Make Mine Music" and Fred Astaire's "Yolanda and the Thief", the former uses fifteen famous songs as a selling point, while the latter boasts fifteen color films. However, regardless of the story content and performance techniques, "Yolanda and the Thief" is inferior to "Make Mine Music". Even if it is a film in fifteen colors, it still cannot save the emptiness in the script and teaching techniques. At least, the songs in "Make Mine Music" are worth listening to.
