### Mr. Du Yuesheng Advocates Sino-British Joint Transport

[Central News Agency, this city] Since the British Parliamentary Delegation to China

expressed opinions on the issue of opening up inland waterway navigation rights, those concerned with the shipping industry have risen up in opposition.

A reporter interviewed Du Yuesheng, Director of the National Shipping Association,

to solicit his opinion. He said:

"Now that our country has recovered its inland waterway navigation rights, there is absolutely no reason to open them up.

However, in order to develop trade between China and Britain, our country's shipping industry is extremely willing to cooperate sincerely with

British shipping companies. The best way to do this is to hold

joint transport operations. Then Sino-British trade will definitely be smooth.

The transportation blockages that the delegation is concerned about

will not be a problem at all." As for expanding ship tonnage and improving driving techniques,

the government and the industry are working together. Given time, it will surely be able to

live up to the expectations of the people and friendly countries.

to combat Communism. It is reported that he is determined to implement his plan to aid China as described in Life magazine. The article has attracted the attention of diplomatic circles and senior government officials.

It is reported that he has met with Weidmeier and Eisenhower. He expressed optimism, believing that the US government may provide the Chinese

government with practical and substantial assistance.

### US Newspapers Consider Failure to Publish Weidmeier's Report a Mistake

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The Scripps Howard

newspaper chain criticized President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall

for delaying the release of Weidmeier's report, and reiterated that the situation in China

urgently requires emergency assistance from the United States. The New York World-Telegram and

Washington News, among other newspapers in the chain, stated that not publishing the Weidmeier

Report is a major mistake. This action has not accelerated American assistance to the Chinese government, nor can it increase people's confidence in the US government's policy.

To achieve these three outcomes, this long-delayed report must be released.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] The US State Department's statement released yesterday, which was only 128 words long, to explain why Weidmeier's report on his visit to China was not released,

greatly puzzled observers here, who all believed that this vague statement failed to clarify the mystery surrounding this issue. It also failed to make the American people deeply aware of what the US government's policy toward China actually is.

One commentator even suspected whether Secretary of State Marshall believed that China's "reform work" was not yet suitable for the conditions he set for immediate and substantial aid to China. If such speculation is true, the commentator

believed that Marshall has ignored the entirely new situation that has emerged in China since he left China the year before. He also believed that China's current

problem is no longer purely a matter of domestic political reform, but a struggle for survival with the Communists.

### Editorial: Ryukyu Must Be Returned to China

Since Premier Zhang attended the Resident Councilors' meeting and reported on

our country's military, political, and diplomatic measures, carefully mentioning: "Ryukyu has a special relationship with our country.

It should be returned to China," the Washington and Tokyo sides

have paid close attention to our country's request. Originally,

regarding the scope of Japanese territory, the November 1943 Cairo

Declaration only decided: "The four northeastern provinces, Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, etc.,

should be returned to the Republic of China." The future status of Ryukyu was not mentioned.

The July 1945 Potsdam Declaration, implementing the spirit of the Cairo Declaration,

stipulated: "Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido,

Kyushu, Shikoku and such other minor islands as we determine," meaning the status of Ryukyu

remains undecided. Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi and veteran parliamentarian Ozaki Yukio said: Ryukyu should belong to Japan, and misinterpreted the "other minor islands" referred to in the Potsdam Declaration

as including the Ryukyu Islands, etc. The Ryukyu people opposed Japan's misinterpretation, and Chinese scholars have cited historical facts to

explain the relationship between China and Ryukyu, mostly arguing that Ryukyu should be returned to our country.

Standing from a research standpoint, based on Ryukyu's history, geography, and human relations,

we support the government's view and solemnly declare to the Allied nations: Ryukyu

must be returned to China!

The earliest political relationship between Ryukyu and Asian countries was with

China. In our country's ancient books, the Sui Dynasty called it "LiÃºqiÃº," the Tang Dynasty called it "LiÃºqiÃº,"

"LiÃºchÃ³u," or "LiÃºqiÃº," and the name "LiÃºqiÃº" first appeared in the Yuan Dynasty,

and has been used ever since. According to the "Ryukyu" section of the Encyclopedia Britannica, the relationship between China and Ryukyu can be traced back to

605 AD, the first year of Emperor Yang of Sui's Daye era, which is the same as recorded in Chinese records

(such as the Book of Sui). However, Ryukyu officially became a vassal state of China,

starting from the early Ming Dynasty. Thereafter, it not only paid tribute every year, but also

came to the court every generation; and sent government students, observing rituals with great respect. Official histories and private

writings have repeatedly recorded this, and there is ample evidence. After the Jiajing era in the Ming Dynasty,

the country gradually declined, border administration was neglected, Western powers invaded Nanyang, and Japan

also coveted Ryukyu; however, the Ryukyu royal family continued to pay tribute to

China as before. Our country's envoys to Ryukyu

also followed one after another. Until the mid-Qing Dynasty, Ryukyu always recognized China

as its suzerain state, treating itself as a vassal. Even under Japanese oppression later,

the strong will of the Ryukyu people did not change their loyalty to China in the slightest.

We only need to read Ryukyu's documents to see this immediately. Recently, the Ryukyu

Revolutionary Comrades Association's "Refutation of Japan's Ambition" further proves that the Ryukyu

people despise the absurdity of people like Ashida and Ozaki, and are not ashamed of what they have done.

From a geographical point of view, Ryukyu and Taiwan are both the shoulders of China,

with a relationship of national interdependence. Ryukyu is an archipelago, extending

between Taiwan and Kyushu, Japan, forming a large arc, located on the outer edge of China's

East Sea, winding across the sea for 800 miles from northeast to southwest,

including more than 70 islands, with an area of 5,000 square kilometers and a population of 800,000.

In terms of latitude and longitude, Ryukyu is located between 24 and 31 degrees north latitude, and 124 and 130 degrees east longitude,

each accounting for more than 7 degrees. Greater Ryukyu is Okinawa Island, and Lesser Ryukyu is the largest island of the Amami

Islands, both of which are strategically important. After Japan occupied Taiwan in the 21st year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, it further

intensified its efforts to manage Ryukyu, making it a stepping stone for southward aggression, proving that Japan's occupation of Ryukyu was entirely for the purpose of aggression. Now,

the intention to seize Ryukyu still contains the ambition to not give up aggression. We

must especially point out that the total area of the Ryukyu Islands is only 5,000 square

kilometers, with a population of 800,000, and its economic value is extremely limited; however,

when the American and Japanese forces fought for Greater Ryukyu, a total of more than 200,000 troops were mobilized, fighting fiercely for

83 days. American Tenth Army Commander General Buckner died in this battle, and

115,000 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, defending to the last man. When the kamikaze

suicide planes were unable to exert their power, Tokyo announced its surrender. All of this

illustrates the importance of the strategic value of the Ryukyu Islands.

Japan occupied Ryukyu in order to consolidate its inner maritime defense line, and the US military

controlled Ryukyu in order to open the way for its fleet to reach China and the Yellow Sea,

and then advance to China and Korea. Our country, from the perspective of the relationship between China and Ryukyu, demands

that Ryukyu be returned to China for the sake of peace and to ensure the safety of Taiwan and China's territorial

waters. China has no intention of using Ryukyu as a support point for aggression.

At the same time, for the sake of peace in Taiwan and the sea, our country does not want Ryukyu

to become any country's military strategic zone. What our country wants to help Ryukyu with is

the high degree of autonomy of the Ryukyu people; what our country wants to develop in Ryukyu is that

the traditional culture of the Ryukyu people derived from China can be preserved. The Ryukyu people's

bloodline and culture have had a relationship with China for thousands of years; today, the Ryukyu

people still worship Confucius, live their lives with Tang Dynasty customs, and we

cannot bear to sever the pulse of the nation. For the sake of future peace and

security, we must insist on possessing Ryukyu as a condition. Our war of resistance was for the

survival of the nation; the Cairo and Potsdam documents did not reject China's possession

of Ryukyu. Regarding this undecided issue, we should strive for it legally.

Today, the Ryukyu people and the Ryukyu Revolutionary Comrades Association have earnestly

issued their calls: "The area south of 30 degrees north latitude to Yonaguni Island

is the ancient territory of Ryukyu, and is also a part of China, the front line for defending

the mainland." "Today, at this good opportunity for the liberation of the Ryukyu nation,

we hope that the Chinese government will pay attention to the calls of our comrades." Due to Director Zhang's

statement, our government's decision that Ryukyu should be immediately returned to China

will surely be supported by the 800,000 Ryukyu people. We hope that the enlightened

friendly nations will respect the spirit of the Atlantic Charter, recognize the reality of the Ryukyu

people's quest for liberation, and support the demands of the Chinese and Ryukyu people, so that Ryukyu

can be returned to China as soon as possible.

### Dong Xian Guang Answers Reporter's Questions

Wheat and Rice Shortage Approximately 60,000 Tons

(Continued from Page 1) According to current

estimates of our country's population and

food consumption, the national wheat requirement

is 24,478,000 tons, and the rice requirement is 51,436,000

tons. It is estimated that before the next harvest

season, there will be a wheat shortage of 2,950,000

tons and a rice shortage of 3,092,000

tons. In recent years, the main sources of China's imported

food have been UNRRA, the United States, Canada,

Indochina, etc.

Ample Coal Supply Expected This Winter

Director Dong said:

As for our country's

monthly coal production,

rough estimates are: North China 600,000 tons,

Northeast 300,000 tons, East China 100,000 tons, Central

China 100,000 tons, Taiwan 100,000 tons. Of the

600,000 tons in North China, 500,000 tons is sufficient for

consumption in that region, and 100,000 tons can be transported to help South

China and Central China. The current difficulty is the

transportation problem. However, the national coal supply this winter is expected

to be sufficient.

No Restrictions on Freedom of the Press

Regarding the question

of whether the Chinese

government is considering

implementing press censorship in military or non-military areas,

Director Dong replied: Even during the current bandit

suppression operations, the government has no intention of implementing press censorship.

Therefore, there are no provisions restricting freedom of the press

in the Outline for the Implementation of General Mobilization. Furthermore,

Article 12 of Chapter II of the Constitution states that people have freedom of

secret correspondence, except as provided in Article 23 of Chapter II of the Constitution,

which stipulates that it should be excluded when necessary to avoid emergency

dangers, maintain social order, or promote public

interests. The National Government promulgated and implemented the Martial Law Act on November 29,

1934, Article 3 of which

stipulates that during wartime, when a certain area is surrounded by the enemy

or faces extraordinary changes, the highest commander of the area may declare temporary martial law.

Article 12 of the Judicial Regulations stipulates that within the martial law

area, the highest commander has the power to carry out the following matters: To suspend gatherings, associations, or ban new newspapers, magazines, books, advertisements, slogans, etc.,

deemed to be detrimental to military affairs; To inspect

postal mail and telegrams, and detain or confiscate them if necessary. Currently, because

the Communist bandits are in full-scale rebellion, the government,

in order to protect military secrets and suppress bandits to quell the rebellion, is conducting temporary partial spot checks of postal and telegraphic communications in pacification

zones and areas near combat zones based on leads. However, it must still be submitted to higher authorities for approval before it can be carried out. If

Communist bandits flee to a certain area or Communist

subversives in a certain area attempt to riot, higher

authorities may also order it to be carried out at any time. In short, this

partial postal and telegraphic spot check method is neither

universal nor permanent, but an emergency measure

taken to avoid emergency dangers and maintain social order. Based on leads,

it is used to spot check postal and telegraphic communications suspected of providing secret information to the Communist bandits,

and does not hinder the freedom of communication of the general public, and especially does not affect

the transmission of news by mail or telegraph.

Foreign Correspondents' Cables Not Subject to Control

[United Press,

Nanjing, 22nd

Dispatch] News Bureau

Director Dong Xian Guang admitted today that the Ministry of National Defense had ordered military authorities in the war

zones to implement postal and telegraphic inspection, and news dispatches are not exempt. However, he declared that the Chinese government

has no intention of restoring press censorship. Regarding the detention of the United Press's Qingdao cable, he said that he had telegraphed the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters

for inquiry. Dong also stated: Temporary local postal and telegraphic inspections are not enough to affect

newspapers, and foreign correspondents' news sent abroad is neither subject to control nor inspection.

This is an indisputable fact. However, many foreign correspondents asked Dong to note that this statement does not match the facts.

### Full Text of Du Yuesheng's Welcome Speech

(Continued from Page 1) Mr. Du said in his speech:

"Chairman Lord Ammon, distinguished guests, the six distinguished guests of the British

Parliamentary Delegation have come to visit.

The Chinese government and people express their warm welcome.

The Shanghai business and industrial community is very pleased and excited to hold this reception today.

China and Britain have always had friendly relations, and their commercial relationship

has an especially long history. They fought shoulder to shoulder in the Second World War, sharing weal and woe, and their friendship has become more

substantial. This friendship has continued to grow after the war. The British

Parliamentary Delegation's visit to China this time is a testament to the British friends' deep concern for China, and

will further enhance the friendship between China and Britain in the future.

China and Britain both suffered severe blows during the war.

They also suffered the same economic panic after the war.

In order to achieve economic recovery and prosperity in both countries, practical

cooperation is necessary. Britain is an advanced industrial country.

After victory, it is striving for recovery, and the system left over from the war

continues to be implemented in order to meet the needs of recovery.

It is trying every possible means to increase production and export in large quantities.

This is such a solemn and calm attitude, and its value

is worth our learning from. Since victory, in addition to general difficulties,

China's various constructions have been hindered by the Communist Party's rebellion,

and the development of industry and commerce has also been greatly affected.

However, we firmly believe that the Communist Party's rebellion will surely be quelled,

just like the victory we reaped in the war against Japan.

Our country's business and industrial workers are now, under the government's

guidance and assistance, working hard to overcome this difficult period. The friendship between China and Britain, which is characterized by friendliness

and harmony, has become more and more prominent over time.

In addition, we deeply feel that the economic prosperity and decline of

countries around the world are interconnected and inseparable. We hope that our British friends, who are known for their developed industry and commerce, can provide us with assistance.

What Lord Ammon said on the eve of leaving England for China, that

"the British Parliament and people care about China today as much as they did during the war,"

his sincere attitude and warm concern will be unforgettable for the Chinese people.

China needs to import British equipment and materials.

Before the war, China was a large market for British exporters. After the war,

business between China and Britain remains to be developed, and the future development of British

trade also relies on the rapid prosperity of China's large market as a precursor. Therefore, the practical

cooperation between China and Britain is an inevitable trend.

At the time of welcoming the distinguished guests, I respectfully

extend my welcome on behalf of the business and industrial community, and I hope that each

distinguished guest will give us more guidance!"

### Original Text of the Agreement on Handling Remaining Materials for Relief (Continued from Page 1)

All remaining relief materials in each sub-office

should be transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs around the closing date. These

relief materials include food (staple foods,

non-staple foods), clothing, textiles, shoes and socks,

and miscellaneous welfare materials; but medical equipment

is not included. The three parties agree that on the date when the materials

are transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs will allocate half of each item

to the United Welfare Organizations Federation (hereinafter referred to as "FÃºlian"),

and FÃºlian will immediately extract them from the warehouses. The Ministry of Social

Affairs should issue two receipts for the materials received,

sending one each to UNRRA and the Executive Relief Administration. FÃºlian should issue

four receipts, sending the original to the Ministry of Social Affairs,

and three copies to UNRRA, the Executive Relief Administration, and the FÃºlian General Association.

When the aforementioned materials are transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs and FÃºlian,

the Executive Relief Administration should also provide sufficient funds to the Ministry of Social Affairs and FÃºlian

for the purpose of distributing the materials to the final recipients.

To save procedures, the three parties agree that the Executive Relief Administration should transfer

these funds to the Ministry of Social Affairs and FÃºlian through the Central Bank; and set up

two accounts separately for the Ministry of Social Affairs and FÃºlian to remit to various places for application

(excluding Shanghai). The total amount of the aforementioned funds should

be notified to the Ministry of Social Affairs in advance. The payment

of the aforementioned funds should be calculated based on the cost

required to distribute each ton of materials within each region. This basis

should apply to all materials, but should vary depending on the region.

The Ministry of Social Affairs should provide detailed reports on the inventory and distribution

of received materials to UNRRA and the Executive Relief Administration, and FÃºlian

should provide detailed reports to the Ministry of Social Affairs as well.

All such reports should be submitted before March 31, 1948.

Detailed public announcements should be made centrally and locally

regarding the handling situation and quantity of materials. The closing dates for each sub-office

are as follows: 1. Closing on October 31 this year:

Northeast, Jin-Cha-Sui, Rehe, Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong,

Zhejiang. 2. Closing on November 15:

Ji-Re-Ping-Jin, Anhui, Su-Ning, Guangxi. 3. Closing on November 30:

Henan.

### UNRRA Gives 100 Vehicles to Guangdong Provincial Government

[United Press, Guangzhou, 22nd] Today's

news: UNRRA, at the request of the Guangdong Provincial Government,

will give 100 trucks to the Guangdong Provincial Government to improve

highway transportation. UNRRA may also transfer other

highway equipment and fishing boats. Everything must wait

for the meeting in Shanghai this week to decide.

Samson, director of UNRRA's South China sub-office, is scheduled to fly to Shanghai tomorrow

to attend this meeting.

### Kawashima Yoshiko Sentenced to Death

[Continued from Page 1] When Jin Bihui arrived in court, she was wearing

a snow-white sweater that hugged her neck, green woolen trousers,

a black woolen coat,

black leather shoes, and her hair was still styled in a men's side part,

shining brightly. She wore light powder and looked quite cheerful.

After Judge Wu confirmed Jin's identity, he pronounced the sentence:

"Jin Bihui conspired with an enemy country, plotting to revolt against

this country, and is sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life,

and her property is confiscated except for a discretionary amount to be retained for the necessary living expenses of her family."

Wu continued to explain that this sentence was based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors,

and informed her that she could appeal within ten days if she disagreed.

After hearing the sentence, Jin remained calm

and showed no fear. After the sentence was pronounced, she turned her head and

automatically walked back to the women's prison for detention, and then had

lunch as usual, eating two steamed buns. After the meal, she came to

the wire mesh window of the women's prison, which was just over two square feet,

and met with this newspaper's reporter. Asked if she was preparing

to appeal, she replied that she would decide after consulting with her lawyer, Li Yishen.

Jin said that her concept of life and death was extremely

indifferent. "Anyway, I'm going to die sooner or later," "It's

better to die early than to live badly," and she fully expressed

her realism. "I'm not worried about death, I'm just worried that the prison

won't have a stove in the winter, and I don't have any clothes. How will I survive the winter?"

Jin said that she had been "wronged." "Even if you sentence me for one day, I feel wronged.

Those of you who were in Beiping during the occupation can inquire and see what bad things I did."

She flatly overturned her confession at the Eleventh War Zone Military Tribunal,

saying that she was tricked into signing it, and that she was captured because she was too famous.

Asked why she was so famous, she replied cleverly:

"Think about it, a princess of a fallen country, growing up in exile

in a foreign country, how can people not suspect her?"

After nearly two years in prison, she still stubbornly uses painting,

writing, and feeding insects to pass the nearly ending days behind bars.

### National Assembly Friendship Association and Others Oppose Packaged Elections

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Kuomintang members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association,

the Kuomintang's carefully selected National Assembly representatives, and the Legislative Supervisory Comrades United Association

(including representatives from Zhejiang, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi,

and Beijing), as well as the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association, all expressed their opinions, opposing the lists submitted by the local

election committees, opposing packaged elections, opposing non-vocational group employees participating in vocational group elections,

and advocating free elections. The former two

groups petitioned Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Minister of Organization Chen Lifu on the morning of the 22nd.

The former group held a meeting in the afternoon. The association decided to ask

the Central Government to reconsider the list, otherwise it would not recognize

the National Assembly representatives elected this year.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] The Hubei Provincial National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association, citing the fact that the bandit rebellion has not yet subsided,

telegraphed the Chairman of the National Government again, requesting that the election be postponed

in order to avoid diverting the strength to quell the rebellion.

### Overseas Chinese Selection Methods to be Announced Soon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese participating in elections, relevant departments have drafted methods that are expected to be announced within the next two to three days. However, according to Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Headquarters Committee, these methods still need to complete legislative procedures in the Legislative Yuan, and the fundamental issues still need to be discussed during the next National Assembly session. Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao stated in a press conference on the 22nd, in response to reporters' inquiries, "Regarding the technical difficulties encountered by overseas Chinese voting abroad, the election affairs authorities are currently considering appropriate measures so that the overseas candidates favored by public opinion can be nominated without affecting the sovereignty of their countries of residence." Regarding absentee voting, negotiations were conducted with the United Kingdom but were unsuccessful because the issuance of ballots is considered an exercise of citizenship rights. Furthermore, conducting elections on naval vessels in international waters is beyond the capabilities of our navy. Therefore, if other countries do not agree, we absolutely cannot force the issue and should abandon the idea if consent is not obtained.

### Smooth Progress of Overseas Chinese Elections in Australia and Other Regions

[Central News Agency, Sydney, 21st] The preparatory work for the election of one representative to the National Assembly by overseas Chinese in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Fiji, and the Samoa Islands is progressing smoothly. To date, the local authorities have not interfered. Except for New Zealand, 9,875 overseas Chinese have registered as eligible voters in various regions.

### Public School Principals Participating in Legislative Yuan Elections; School Location as Duty Station

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the question of whether principals of national universities or public secondary schools and above should resign to participate in the Legislative Yuan elections, the Election Headquarters has clarified that participation in elections in areas outside the school's location does not require resignation. The rationale is that principals of national universities or public secondary schools and above are civil servants appointed above a certain level and cannot be considered officials as defined in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan's Election and Recall Law. However, for the application of the same article, only the school's location is considered their place of duty, and there is no so-called jurisdiction. If they are candidates for Legislative Yuan in areas outside the school's location, they are not subject to the restrictions of the same article.

### Strike Once Occurred in Wuhu due to Disputes over Tax Collection

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 22nd] Shops on Wuhu's Chang Street closed down this morning in protest of tax collection. The Anhui Provincial Government specially dispatched officials from the Finance Department to Wuhu to assist the Wuhu Tax Bureau in completing its task within 20 days. Yesterday, four shop employees from four stores were arrested. This morning, when tax inspectors arrived at the Yu Cheng Fabric Store and the Gong Mao Yarn Company, disputes escalated into physical altercations. Three tax officials in the Gong Mao Yarn Company were injured with bleeding head wounds. Wu Junhua, the young owner of the Yu Cheng Fabric Store, was arrested by tax police but was rescued by over a hundred merchants in the street, leading to the strike. After negotiations between Wuhu County Magistrate Mi Shiheng and local gentry Gao Shouheng and others, a solution was reached, and the shops resumed business in the afternoon.

### Salary Adjustment for Taiwanese Civil Servants

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 22nd] Salaries for Taiwanese civil servants will be adjusted starting this month, with an increase of approximately 50%.

### Tianjin Merchants Purchasing Unripe Wheat in Sui; Chairman Dong Qiwu Refuses Payment

[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 21st] Even before the wheat ripened this year, merchants from Tianjin came to Sui with liquid capital to purchase unripe wheat. At that time, the provincial government strictly prohibited it. Now that the wheat is on the market, the buyers are demanding one shi of wheat from the sellers for every 100,000 yuan of advance payment, which is 250,000 yuan cheaper than the market price. Chairman Dong Qiwu, to support farmers and prevent hoarding, specially telegraphed to all commissioners and instructed all counties to allow sellers to refuse to deliver the grain. If buyers collect the grain, it should be confiscated and used as military provisions.

### Zhasake of Yi League Repairs Wangfu Amidst Disaster Relief; Request for Apportionment Met with Stern Rejection

[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 21st] Amidst disaster relief efforts in Yi League, Zhasake Kangdaor of the Dalate Banner is building a Wangfu (princely residence) in Wantaixing, south of Baotou, requiring 20,000 silver dollars, 1,400 shi of grain, 1,000 oxcarts, and countless bricks, tiles, wood, and stone. He requested permission from the provincial government to apportion these costs to the people but was sternly rejected by Chairman Dong Qiwu.

### Strike by Workers in Tianjin's Small Newspapers

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 22nd] Workers in various small newspapers in Tianjin went on strike this morning, the 22nd, to demand a pay increase. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated, and it was tentatively decided to resume work on the 23rd, with a three-day negotiation period. Only the Xinsheng Evening News was published at 9 PM on the 22nd.

### YWCA Discusses Building a Reasonable World

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] At the World YWCA Conference today, General Secretary Wu Simo read congratulatory messages from China, Syria, Canada, Ceylon, Uruguay, India, and other countries. The conference then divided into four groups for discussion: 1. Led by Australian representative Ridge Man, discussing the social prospects of personal relationships. 2. Led by Mrs. Eliot, General Secretary of the National Association of YWCAs of the United States, discussing the distribution of work and rest in an industrialized society. 3. Chaired by Swedish representative Mrs. Stadge, discussing political action and commemorative action. 4. Discussing building a reasonable world out of chaos. At noon, Chairman Shen, the Mayor of the Bureau, the Speakers of the Provincial and Municipal Assemblies, and the Presidents of the Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce hosted a banquet. Chairman Shen sent a congratulatory telegram from Wenzhou, stating that the conference had far-reaching intentions and would benefit the Zhejiang YWCA significantly. Mayor Zhou said that the eight years of the war of resistance had caused much damage, and due to the scarcity of materials after the war, the hospitality was inadequate, expressing his apologies. The President of the Association, Wan Ensi, responded with thanks. The discussion continued in the afternoon.

[Another Dispatch] Liang Han Kuo, the Korean representative attending the World YWCA Conference, delivered a public speech at the YWCA tonight at 8 PM, elaborating on the current situation in Korea and speaking extensively about the painful history of being annexed by Japan for 35 years. He expressed his hope that all countries can trust each other and jointly maintain world peace, and especially that China and Korea can have closer ties in the future.

### Prices in Changchun Skyrocket, Doubling or Tripling in Ten Days

[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 22nd] This agency recently received a letter from Fujianese overseas Chinese in Vietnam stating that the more than 500,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam are currently facing unprecedented losses. The Oriental Huili Bank recently decided to invalidate the 100-yuan notes issued by the bank during the Japanese occupation. Although the total amount of these notes issued is unknown, it is reliably estimated that 70% are held by overseas Chinese. The sudden invalidation has caused significant losses to the overseas Chinese, who hope that the authorities will quickly negotiate a resolution.

### Reflections of the World YWCA Delegates: The Mus Family; Low Status of Women in Mexico; Our Hangzhou Correspondence; Special Correspondent Hong Xucai

Among the Mexican delegates attending the World YWCA Conference in Hangzhou, besides the local president, Mrs. Angeles, were Mrs. Mus and her daughter, who were beautiful, active, and attracted much attention. Mrs. Mus looked no more than thirty years old, while her daughter had already grown into a graceful young woman. Mrs. Mus and her daughter came together, becoming the youngest and most beautiful representatives at the conference.

This was their first time in China, and their impression of Hangzhou was: peaceful, beautiful, elegant, and refined. Miss Mus complained that the conference schedule deprived her of the time to tour West Lake. She said, "The car was driving by the lake, and I really wanted to jump in!"

Both Mrs. Mus and her daughter were talkative. When recounting the customs and traditions of Mexico to reporters, they gesticulated and spoke eloquently.

They described Mexico as having a beautiful environment, a good climate, and not having suffered fatal blows from the World War. The influence of the United States was very great on them, and the people imitated the United States in every way. This trend became more pronounced after the war. Mexicans love to sing, dance, and enjoy life in a relaxed and romantic way. However, the status of women is pitifully low.

Mexican marriage laws have an explicit provision stating that if a husband discovers that his wife has committed adultery, he can kill her on the spot as long as he can provide concrete evidence. Therefore, wives all abide by the way of women, and no one dares to joke with their lives.

Then, what about the husbands? Although the law stipulates that each man is only allowed to marry one wife, very few are willing to comply. Most husbands cannot be satisfied with just one wife. In addition to a legitimate wife at home, mistresses outside are always inevitable. Over time, this custom has simply become a tacit right for Mexican men. The prevalence of this situation is even greater than in China.

The basic reason for allowing this unreasonable phenomenon to exist is still the low status of women. Women are discriminated against everywhere in society, making it impossible for most women to support themselves. Leaving their husbands would immediately become a problem, so everything has to be endured. Moreover, because Mexican men have such powerful patriarchal rights and finding a new wife is easy, men are unwilling to marry divorced women. Furthermore, divorce procedures in that country are particularly difficult, so most wives mostly endure and rarely seek divorce.

The disparity between rich and poor classes in Mexico can be fully demonstrated in wedding ceremonies. Most people there are Roman Catholic, and weddings are held in churches. The wealthy class often goes to great lengths to be extravagant, with grand ceremonies and etiquette, and lavish dinners and receptions, spending thousands of dollars in one night without hesitation. And those who are poor only have the simplest refreshments. Mexican weddings are either very rich or very poor, and there is never anything in between.

They have a unique custom in their weddings: all the expenses for the dinners and receptions are borne by the bride's family. At the same time, before the wedding, the bride has to hold a tea party to say goodbye to her close female friends. Only female friends are invited, and men are not allowed to participate. When these female friends attend the party, each must bring a gift. Most of these gifts are predetermined in scope. For example, if it is decided that it is for the kitchen, everyone will prepare various utensils for the kitchen. On the day of the farewell party, they will bring a complete set of kitchen utensils.

Women from relatively wealthy families are unwilling to work outside after marriage, which is also one of the reasons why women's careers cannot develop. Most professional women are unmarried. The jobs they take are nothing more than typists, female secretaries, etc. The vast majority work as laborers. Not only are women's positions low, but their treatment is also unequal. The difference in pay between men and women for the same work is enormous.

If you were to summarize Mexican women, they can be roughly divided into three categories: noblewomen, farmers, and laborers. Mexico is an agricultural country, and rural women have to go to the fields to work. Like Chinese farmers, in addition to helping their husbands farm, they also have to manage the household and take care of the children, making their duties more difficult and burdensome than those of men. In addition, laborers in cities struggling on the poverty line are subjected to even greater exploitation than men due to gender inequality. Even those noblewomen who sit at home enjoying happiness seem to be doing well, but to put it bluntly, they are still appendages of men. They have to be cautious, always on guard against being abandoned by their husbands.

Mrs. Mus and her daughter are representatives of the Mexican YWCA, and they naturally understand the situation of women in their country more deeply. When they mentioned that women have no equality in politics, society, occupation, marriage, and education, and how sisters in their country suffer in hardship, Mrs. Mus could only shake her head and sigh. And Miss Mus, who is in her twenties, said to the reporter through clenched teeth, "I really hate these men!"

### British Parliament Debate Begins; Eden Criticizes Government's Policy of Compromise; Also Blames Soviet Union for Delaying German Reconstruction

[Reuters, London, 21st] Conservative Deputy Leader Eden, speaking in the House of Commons during a general debate on the government's plan, said that the government's plan to reduce the power of the House of Lords was purely a partisan policy that could not restore the nation's glory or the people's happiness. Eden also said that the government's reduction of the domestic fleet to one cruiser and four destroyers made the British fleet smaller than even the Peruvian navy, a situation that caused serious concern among the people. Referring to the international situation, Eden said that the international situation had deteriorated since Parliament adjourned in August, and the United Nations organization had failed to make any progress. Regarding Europe, there was the emergence of the new Communist International, the intensification of activities by the socialist parties of Italy and France, and the assassination of the leader of the Bulgarian opposition, Petkov. Britain should now adhere to its beliefs in genuine democracy and freedom, and fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements. Merely compromising with others would not achieve anything. Eden also said that Stalin's recent expressions of friendship when meeting with several Labour MPs were difficult to accept when the Moscow radio station continued to vehemently attack the Soviet Union's allies. Referring to the German question, Eden stated that Germany had not yet been given economic unification, not through any fault of the British government, but because of the actions of the Soviet Union. Britain had been carrying out its work in its German occupation zone in accordance with the principles most conducive to the future peace of Europe. Germany should make the greatest contribution to its own economic reconstruction, but Germany must never rearm and become a threat to peace. Eden, referring to Britain's sale of its gold reserves, considered it an extremely serious event. Eden believed that the response of the sixteen European countries to the Marshall Plan was the most significant international event since August, and hoped that future development would be pursued in accordance with this plan, so that the economic recovery of Western Europe could be realized. But he also said: "It is a serious mistake to rely solely on the assistance of others; we must make every effort ourselves; we must face the extremely difficult situation."

Prime Minister Attlee, following Eden's speech, announced that the government intended to reduce the time limit for the House of Lords to delay legislation from two years to one year.

When Attlee said that this measure was a wise precaution, opposition leader Churchill immediately refuted it, calling it a deliberate act of social aggression. Attlee continued: If the House of Lords has no intention of using its threatening power to obstruct the resolutions of the popularly elected House of Commons, then the government's recommendation to reduce the power of the Upper House will not harm the Upper House.

### British Prime Minister Expresses Deep Concern Over the Precarious International Situation

Attlee continued to discuss foreign policy, expressing deep concern over the tense diplomatic situation and the Soviet Union's attitude in the United Nations organization. Regarding the trade negotiations in Geneva, although there were many difficulties, he believed that the majority of the seventeen participating countries would be able to reach an agreement. Referring to the Imperial Preference System, Attlee stated that Britain had no intention of establishing the entire Imperial Preference System. Britain had always remembered to maintain a balanced economic relationship with the Western Hemisphere, and now that it had been able to obtain markets for the export of British and its colonial empire's products, it had always been able to increase the US dollar income of the sterling area. Attlee then discussed the military issue, saying that in the next eighteen months, the military would be greatly reduced. As for the reduction of the domestic fleet, it was entirely temporary. Military personnel would be reduced to a total of 937,000 by next March, a further reduction of 550,000 from the original plan. Attlee acknowledged that the economic situation had deteriorated since Parliament adjourned in August, and the details would be announced by Cripps and Dalton in a day or two. Finally, he said that it was necessary to first straighten things out internally to overcome the difficult period.

### Dismantling of German Factories Distributed to Allied Countries; Some Equipment Already Shipped Out of Germany

[Reuters, Bad Dinsel, 21st] The Allied Reparations Commission announced that of the 682 German factories in the British and American zones of Germany that should be dismantled, 119 have already been distributed to the Allied countries, and the equipment of some factories has already been shipped out of Germany.

### Rockefeller Suggests Establishing an Americas Bank; Aimed at Establishing Trade in the Western Hemisphere

[Associated Press, St. Louis, Missouri, 21st] Howard, Vice President of the International Harvester Company, said today that once the US government's grant program ends, US foreign trade will collapse. Howard, along with Rockefeller, Mexican Finance Minister Betantai, and representatives of American agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups, jointly proposed a plan that would allow American businessmen to help the world and help themselves at the same time. Rockefeller advocated the establishment of an Americas Bank to establish trade in the Western Hemisphere; Betantai said that American businessmen can only get reimbursed by investing in the industrialization of Latin America. According to Howard, normal American exports are now gradually decreasing, not because other countries are unwilling to buy American goods, but because they lack US dollars to pay. Howard advocated that US tariffs should be drastically reduced across the board, which would not only encourage the confidence of various countries, but also guide them to follow suit, which would help the reconstruction of Western Europe.

Postal workers have also demanded an emergency adjustment to the treatment of postal workers before the treatment of civil servants is resolved.

factories will quickly distribute a large amount of their existing stored

cotton yarn to yarn merchants for distribution, in order to

smooth the source of goods and meet the urgent needs of the market, so that supply and demand can be adjusted and market prices can tend to stabilize. On the one hand, negotiate yarn prices and quickly make reasonable adjustments,

### Misunderstanding Arises from One-Word Difference in Railroad Bureau Rice Purchase Truth

[Our Newspaper Report] The Jinghu District Railway Administration

recently purchased 500 dan of rice for its employees from grain merchants in Nanjing. It was mistakenly reported at the time as 500 tons,

which attracted the attention of the Nanjing Municipal Government. Later, after Director Chen of the Railway Bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Communications reporting the details of the rice purchase and the correct quantity and purpose of the rice,

the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to explain to the Nanjing Municipal Government

and contacted the Ministry of Food, and it was unanimously recognized that the 500 shi of rice purchased for the more than 2,000 employees of the two railways

was the minimum necessary and there was nothing inappropriate about it. Yesterday, Director Chen told

reporters: The misunderstanding caused by this incident among some people was entirely due to the one-word difference between "500 dan" and "500 tons."

### Sheshan Catholic Church Children's Camp Visits - Selected from Various Educational Institutions - Divided into Seven Groups for Training

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Children's Welfare Organization Children's Camp, yesterday

To introduce the work of the camp, a special open invitation was extended to the city's press. The camp is located in the Sheshan Catholic Church in Songjiang. Around 10 a.m.,

they boarded a bus from the Shanghai Children's Welfare Organization Federation on Sichuan Road,

and finally arrived at their destination at 11:30 a.m. After a short rest,

they had a simple meal. During the meal, the camp's honorary chairman, Lu Meiseng,

the chairman of the committee, Liu Dewei, Dong Bin, the general manager Cao Yourong, and the director of the document group, Ding Hao, and others, respectively reported on the various aspects of the camp, and

the activities of various children's welfare organizations in the city.

The camp is jointly organized by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Organization Federation and the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association and over forty other units. The main purpose is to stimulate children's interest,

and inspire their love for the community and society. Nearly a hundred children are staying at the camp, all of whom are selected from outstanding children from various children's educational institutions in the city, based on

actual ages of twelve to sixteen years old for both boys and girls, with a limit of three to five children per unit. The camp period is from the 15th to the 26th of this month.

The activity schedule for each day has been arranged, and there are small group activities every day, divided into seven groups: literature, nature, society, singing, drama, drawing, and dancing.

Each group is staffed with dedicated individuals to guide the training, in order to cultivate "little teacher"

talents in each group. When each child returns after the camp period, they can

serve as "little teachers" in various children's welfare organizations. The idea is to allow the unfortunate children who have suffered hardships

to have opportunities for recreational activities in addition to work-study.

Unfortunately, the camp only raised 30 million yuan in funding,

and all the camp's expenses (including food costs)

must rely on this to maintain, which is quite a strain. Dong Bin, the chairman of the camp committee, continued to describe the difficulties in raising

funds, and the plight of the suffering children urgently needing relief. He could not help but shed tears. He loudly appealed to

society to quickly give the suffering children powerful sympathy. Who doesn't have children? In these difficult times, we should

extend our care to other people's children as we do to our own.

At 2:30 p.m., the group of reporters, led by Father Faluo,

climbed the mountain to visit the Sheshan Basilica and the observatory, and returned to Shanghai around 5 p.m.

### Preferential Train Tickets for Military Personnel - Special Ticket Windows to be Implemented Next Month

[Our

Newspaper]

The

New

Regulations

for preferential train tickets for southbound military personnel on the Beijing-Shanghai and

Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have been approved by the Ministry of National Defense and the United Logistics Headquarters

and will be implemented from the 5th of next month. In order to thoroughly

implement these measures, the authorities have specially organized a joint military review office to handle all matters related to train tickets for military personnel.

issuing half-price tickets to military personnel and exchanging free tickets.

must first go to the joint office to obtain a voucher for half-price or free tickets before boarding the train, and then go to the military personnel

ticket window to exchange for a formal half-price or free ticket.

The purpose of this measure is to reduce unnecessary misunderstandings

between military personnel and railway staff or passengers, and there is absolutely no intention to discriminate against military personnel.

Provincial

Delimitation

Conference

concluded

successfully

at 7 p.m.

yesterday.

The agreed-upon

cases will

after being signed by representatives from both the province and the city.

Dong Zhe, Director of the Finance Department, Chen Zimin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Xie Chengbing, Commissioner of the Third Administrative Inspectorate District,

and Huang Sen, Provisional Provincial Councilor. Because of discussions regarding the requests of the people of Xinzhuang and

Zhuang Hongan, County Chief of Baoshan County, Yuan Xiluo, Speaker of the County Council, Xu Jinyu, County Chief of Songjiang County, Liu Jin, County Chief of Qingpu County, Sun Zaishi, Speaker of the County Council, Xu Zhuyi, County Chief of Jiading County, Yang Zhuofu, Representative of the County Council, and Shanghai Municipal Councilors Shi Junren, Zhang Xuelian, Zhang Shouxian, District Chief of Longhua District, and Long Yuyuan, District Chief of Xinjing District, were also present.

Xinzhuang Residents' Representatives Petition

First, Director Zhu and Director Shen successively reported on the significance of today's meeting, which was to listen to the opinions of the county chiefs and residents' representatives, so they were asked to express themselves as much as possible for reference.

The representatives then successively expressed their opinions, and both sides argued especially strongly on the issue of the jurisdiction of Zhucun and Xinzhuang,

engaging in heated debates. Zhang Shiqi and others, representatives of the Zhucun residents, requested that they be incorporated into Shanghai. At 3:30 p.m.,

over a hundred residents' representatives from Xinzhuang went to petition, also requesting to be incorporated into Shanghai. Wu Zunyi

and Xie Chengbing received them and told them that the meeting was in progress and promised to submit the public opinion for discussion at the meeting. Another

debate was triggered during the meeting. Finally, Chairman Zhu Ping summarized the opinions of all parties and said that they would seriously consider them. If an

agreement could not be reached, they would convey everyone's opinions to the central government. The meeting adjourned at 5:30.

Director Tian of the Finance Bureau Opposes Subsidies

At 5:45, a formal meeting continued, with only the official representatives of the province and the city present, still chaired by Zhu Ping.

After some discussion, the Jiangsu Provincial Government requested subsidies from the city government for Qibao, Dachang,

and other newly incorporated urban areas. Director Tian firmly opposed this and no agreement was reached.

Finally, it was agreed that the Jiangsu Provincial Government would submit a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government proposed that, in accordance with the wishes of the local

people, Zhucun Township should be incorporated into Shanghai, but the Jiangsu Province representatives could not agree, and it was agreed to submit the issue to the central government for resolution. Also,

Jiangsu Province may agree to the incorporation of Xinzhuang into Shanghai. Other points are listed below:

Boundary Issues May Be Agreed Upon

Boundary Section: Handled in accordance with the Executive Yuan's instructions,

but taking into account the actual situation, the boundary of the Beidachang District is the Yunzao Creek (the Executive Yuan's instructions originally stipulated the Huangni Creek as the boundary), and the boundary of the Hunanshinzhuang District is the Chunchunjiang (the Executive Yuan's instructions originally stipulated the Hengtang as the boundary). The Jiangsu Province representatives said that they may agree to the above boundaries, but because it involves changing the Executive Yuan's instructions,

it must be submitted to the central government for approval. Subsidy Section:

In 1928, the Executive Yuan's instructions designated the city government to subsidize the Shanghai and Baoshan Counties' surtax amounts, based on the average rate of provincial and municipal land

tax conversion rates. From January to December of this year, it is calculated based on the average of 160,000 yuan from the city side and 180,000 yuan from the province side (limited to the actual collection of grain and public grain).

Land Tax Split 50/50 in 1946

Land Tax Section: The land tax for newlyååº areas in 1946 will be collected by the Shanghai Municipal Government on behalf of the province, and the collected amount will be split evenly between the city and the county. In 1947, the land tax will be collected by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the land registry and grain registers should be transferred immediately.

Public Funds and Assets Section: 1. Public funds and assets belonging to the county shall remain under the jurisdiction of the county government, and those belonging to the district and township shall be transferred accordingly. 2. The original Public Funds and Assets Supervision Committee

should be restored, and personnel should be appointed by both the city and county in accordance with the original plan to form it. Armed Forces Section: Armed forces sections

belonging to the county shall be recovered by the county, and those belonging to the district and township

shall be transferred accordingly.

### Yuan Xiluo Emotionally Kneels and Pleads for Subsidies for Baoshan County

[Our Newspaper] When discussing the jurisdiction of Xinzhuang and Zhucun and subsidies for the newlyååº Dachang and other areas yesterday, the city and county councilors, district chiefs, and residents' representatives present

engaged in a heated debate. Yuan Xiluo, the speaker of the Baoshan County Council, who is over seventy years old, also participated in the debate,

believing that in this atomic age, cities should not be concentrated, but should be dispersed to avoid excessive sacrifice in times of war. Shanghai's population is now close to five million, so it is urgent to disperse it and not expand it further.

Dachang is the essence of Baoshan County, and now that it has been incorporated into the city government, it has greatly affected tax revenue and finances. Therefore, please subsidize the county in accordance with the old practice of 1928. Yuan, out of local people wanting profit,

became emotional and actually knelt before Chairman Zhu Ping, weeping and stating that Shanghai and Baoshan Counties are like brothers. Now that the older brother has developed, and the Dachang district has been incorporated into the city government, please subsidize the impoverished younger brother.

He was helped up by the people sitting next to him. However, Tian Yongqian, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, always insisted on opposing the county's request for subsidies for the newlyååº areas,

believing that the Executive Yuan's instructions did not stipulate this point, and that the Shanghai Municipal Government is self-sufficient and often feels strapped for cash, and it is impossible to subsidize the county every year. After repeated discussions, it was finally agreed that this

request from the Jiangsu Province representatives would be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Meeting, resolved

to request the authorities to return all land and houses of the former enemy-occupied Central Market to restore private property. After the

fall under the business scope of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.

After consultation with the Bureau, it has now been

decided that the Telecommunications Bureau will send personnel to investigate, and it has been determined that:

A pair of open-wire lines is planned to be installed first in Yangsi District.

Yangjing District is twelve kilometers away from the Dongchang Road exchange, and it is also planned to install

a pair of open-wire lines. Other locations are currently under investigation

and planning. However, due to a severe shortage of materials, progress may not be as rapid as expected.

### A Corner of the South: The Voice of Hainan Island

[Special Dispatch from Hainan Island by Our Newspaper on the 18th]

Just as chrysanthemums bloom and parasol leaves fall in the north, as west winds carry geese away, and as crops are harvested,

Hainan Island, secluded in this corner of the south, remains lush and green, with picturesque scenery and no hint of cold.

On the streets, robust women still bare their chests and arms, and in the fields, dark and healthy farmers still work bare-chested, sweating and wielding

their hoes, cultivating their hopes. It is fair and sunny, and Hainan Island still breathes "the breath of spring."

Only the Sound of Footsteps on the Stairs

The idea of Hainan Island

being re-designated as a Special

Administrative Region has been brewing for a year, reaching

its climax in July of this year when General Zhang Xianghua, Director of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, carried a restructuring plan to the capital.

However, due to the inability to resolve issues such as military and financial resources, the call for restructuring subsided as General Zhang

returned to Guangzhou via Taiwan. The people of Hainan not only yearn for provincial status, but also yearn for its realization, but all they hear is the sound of footsteps on the stairs, leaving them deeply disappointed.

In August, Navy Lieutenant General Chen Chou, a government advisor and staunch advocate of Hainan's restructuring, and Army Lieutenant General Huang Zhenwu, Director of the News Department of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, returned to Haikou one after another. Both of them are prominent figures in Hainan, and the people of Hainan held

welcome rallies to solicit their opinions on the restructuring.

At that time, the tone of their replies

was earnest and firm, indicating that the realization of the restructuring

was a matter of time. Subsequently, several

newspapers reported various news about the restructuring and published a list of candidates for the various offices of the Special Administrative Chief Executive's Office, creating

an extremely tense atmosphere. At this time, a delegation of reporters from Beijing and Shanghai happened to visit Hainan Island, and the newspapers of Haikou City

unanimously published editorials

requesting the reporter delegation to assist in urging the government to implement the restructuring, in a well-coordinated and seemingly serious manner. However,

soon it was reported that General Zhang Xianghua had indicated that he would not serve as the Special Administrative Chief Executive, and the restructuring issue

began to decline.

Restructuring Still Falls Through

At the end of September,

after the news

of Song Ziwen's appointment as governor of Guangdong was announced, the general public rekindled their hopes for the restructuring.

Because Mr. Song is from Wenchang County, Hainan Island, and before the war, he was very interested in the development of Hainan Island, and had planned to build

a round-island railway. If the Japanese had not launched the war, it is believed that this plan would have been completed long ago.

However, things turned out to be unexpected.

After Song Ziwen took office, it was heard that he did not think restructuring was necessary. On October

13th, he invited prominent figures from Hainan to a symposium in Guangzhou

on local affairs, and the result was that everyone agreed that restructuring

could be postponed, and that a Pacification Zone should be established instead. Chen Chou or

Han Hanying were considered for the post of Pacification Director to strengthen the suppression of bandits on Hainan Island.

In terms of economy, Song Ziwen plans to set up an industrial police office

on Hainan Island, and plans to appoint his personal secretary Lu Wenlan

as the supervising director to preside over the development of industry. In this way,

the hope that Song Ziwen's appointment as governor of Guangdong would accelerate the realization of Hainan Island's

restructuring has fallen through again.

A Stronghold on the Sea Frontier

Originally,

Hainan Island and

Taiwan were both important military strongholds on China's sea frontier. Relying on the fifty years of management in Taiwan,

the Japanese had enriched their domestic

economy because of this. Relying on the seven years of

development on Hainan Island, they also established a base for their southward advance.

Today, Hainan Island is still scarred and devastated.

It can be said that it is still due to the lack of continued

development and construction, resulting in cultural

backwardness, complex public sentiment, obstructed transportation,

and poor public security, and it seems to be becoming a burden to the country, which is very lamentable.

If we hope to erase these lamentable emotions

and make Hainan Island useful to the country,

it is imperative to support it as soon as possible.

It cannot be ignored. (Chen Meiqing, sent from Haikou City)

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Issues Order to All Counties to Adopt Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices

[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 22nd] The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently ordered all county governments to take the following two key emergency measures to stabilize grain prices: Strictly manage the grain market, supervise transactions, and crack down on formal grain merchants who purchase and sell at inflated prices. Send military police to investigate and prohibit grain transactions outside the market and those who hoard grain and refuse to sell, and prevent grain from flowing into bandit areas.

### Absolute Free Flow of Grain Within Jiangsu Province Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties Not to Prohibit Transportation

[Central News Agency Zhenjiang Dispatch] Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang [Maogong]

issued successive telegrams to all counties, ordering absolute freedom of flow for grain within the province and to various places in Beijing and Shanghai.

Recently, it has been heard that some counties in northern Jiangsu often violate the law and privately prohibit the export of grain, and that a

few authorized persons take the opportunity to manipulate and profit from smuggling, which leads to fluctuations in grain prices and affects people's livelihood.

Therefore, he has again telegraphed to all counties, strictly

ordering them not to arbitrarily impose transportation bans.

### Supervising County Administration Inspectors to Depart Soon Key Points of Chairman Wang's Instructions Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] In order to supervise the county administrations of various counties in both northern and southern Jiangsu and accelerate the completion of tasks, Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang [Maogong]

### Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Leaves Dihua for Beijing and Shanghai Today

[Central News Agency,

Dihua, 22nd] The

Xinjiang Youth

Song and Dance Troupe,

organized by the Propaganda

Committee of the New Provincial Government,

is scheduled to leave Dihua for Beijing and Shanghai

on the 23rd for sightseeing and performances. The head of the troupe, Liu Mengchun, and Aisha

were unable to travel with the troupe due to official business. A grand farewell party was held the night before last at the Cultural Hall,

and they gave a wonderful performance on the eve of their departure. The troupe has a total of fifty-five members, including twenty-one female members and thirty-four male members, with Uyghurs accounting for the majority. Note: The Uyghurs are a Muslim

ethnic group, so their art is largely the same as that of Central Asian Muslim countries. Their dramas are almost entirely historical song and dance dramas of Arabia. This is the first time in hundreds of years that a formally organized Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe has visited the mainland for sightseeing, so local

cultural figures are eager for compatriots in the mainland to encourage them.

[Our Newspaper,

Anqing, 18th] Huang Ziyu,

aged sixty-seven, Anhui

Shouxian County,

Anhui Provincial Assemblyman residing

at No. 17 Hou Weiqiang, inside the city,

joined the Tongmenghui [Revolutionary Alliance] in his early years and made outstanding contributions, serving as the chief of the logistics department and captain of a warship. On the 14th of this month, he went

to the tenant farmers of Laofengtou, Shishan Township, to collect rent and stayed

there. Then, on the evening of the 15th, four plainclothes thugs suddenly

### Xigong Road Hostel and Others Are Under Construction

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 21st] The county government previously had

a plan to develop a new urban area at Sheqiaotou, but due to

limited funding, it is temporarily difficult to proceed. Currently, there are

four official banks and thirty-eight private banks in the county,

scattered inside and outside the city, which is inconvenient for centralized business operations.

Now, there are plans to purchase the Dahechi pond site outside the north gate to build a bank building, but because the owner, surnamed Wang,

has not agreed, the project has not been established. Other methods are being sought nearby

to purchase land. In addition, the post office has also expanded its land purchase by several mu to build a model post office, which is actively

underway. All highway hostels have purchased

several mu of rice fields south of Wuqiao outside the north gate. They are currently

designing and preparing samples, and construction can begin within the year.

The location is near Xishan and Huishan, with beautiful scenery.

The highway connects to Xiyi, Xihu and other sections, and once

built, it will be convenient for travelers. It is heard that there are only five

highway hostels in the country, and Wuxi is one of them. The business of the hostel

is to inspect public and private

cars, refuel and repair them, and provide services to passing

travelers.

### Distributing Cloth in Xiangtan Ms. Mary MacLellan Suddenly Surrounded All Heads of Bao and Gentry Beaten by Poor People

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 22nd] Ms. Mary MacLellan, from UNRRA, went to Xiangtan the other day to distribute cloth.

To save time, 10,000 cloth coupons were to be distributed within one day in thirteen groups.

Due to the rush of time and the difficulty in completing the procedures, most poor people were unable to obtain cloth, so they surrounded Ms. MacLellan

at Yiheping. Fortunately, the police bureau handled the matter properly, and she managed to break out of the encirclement. The poor people vented their anger on the heads of the bao [neighborhoods], gathered at the heads of the bao's houses to make noise, and Chen Kun, the head of the sixth bao in Zhaotan Township, was beaten and injured. His wife's head was broken, and she was seriously injured. On the 20th, 21st, 24th, 25th, and 30th, the houses of the heads of the bao were all

### Completing the Southwest Transportation Network Sichuan Rushes to Repair Three Major Railways

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 18th] In order to cooperate with the central government's five-year railway plan

and build a southwest transportation network, the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Ministry of Communications have decided to immediately start the repair of the Sichuan-Yunnan,

Sichuan-Guizhou, and Chengdu-Chongqing railways. The Sichuan-Yunnan Railway is planned to enter Sichuan from Zhanyi via Xuanwei, Yongcheng, and Dading, and then connect to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway via Xuyong and Luxian to Longchang. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway was originally surveyed to enter Sichuan from Zunyi via Chishui to Xuyong. Now, because the route is too

long and the slope and rise are too large, it has been decided to change it along the Qinghua Highway, passing through Dading to Xuyong, because

the area near Dading is a coal and iron mining area, which is very convenient. The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is the most active. The provincial government has urgently summoned 100,000 laborers to assist in the construction. The Fifth District Highway

Engineering Office of the Road Engineering Office stated that the Yongchuan to Jianyang section of the road crosses the highway in as many as 80 places, which has a significant impact on the internal trunk line transportation and it is necessary to divert the road. Recently, Chief

Engineer Li Changyuan was specially dispatched to lead a survey team to Tongnan and Anyue to conduct a field survey. The survey has now been completed. It has been decided to change the original route from Tongnan Tangba to Anyue to connect to the original Chengdu-Chongqing line. If this is done, the journey can be shortened by

62 kilometers, and the railway and highway can run side by side without conflicting with each other. It is estimated that the preliminary work on the Chengdu-Chongqing

Railway will be completed within this month.

### South Lake Boat, South Lake Water Chestnut, South Lake Crab - Jiaxing Delighted to Receive Huge Investment

(Our Hangzhou dispatch on the 21st) There are particularly many tourists in Hangzhou this year.

The number of tourists traveling from Shanghai and Hangzhou to Jiaxing is also exceptionally high, and according to the local

people of Jiaxing, the scale is unprecedented. From spring

and summer until deep into autumn today, tourists are still

coming in an endless stream. The place to visit in Jiaxing is the Mist and Rain Tower.

Mist and Rain Tower

Located in the center of Yuanyang Lake (also known as South Lake), because Jiaxing

is located on a plain, so when South Lake arrives in summer,

a cool breeze gently blows through the heart and soul. On South Lake, there is a

type of small boat, with a bamboo mat as a canopy, the stern is rowed with a scull, carrying

guests to visit the Mist and Rain Tower, with a unique charm. It is said that many of these

boats come from Xujiaæµ. The people of Xujiaæµ village, give birth to sons who farm, give birth to daughters who row boats,

the South Lake boat girls, are famous on the Beijing-Shanghai line.

Now, in these South Lake boats, there is a cool bed set up,

a silk quilt, and two pillows with embroidered mandarin ducks.

A small half-table leans against the boat canopy, holding

some teacups and the like. If there are one or two tourists, they

can ask the boat to be placed next to the water chestnut and bamboo in the lake, tied with

a thread, and let the boat girl peel some fresh water chestnuts, or get a few

lake crabs, warm up a few pounds of rice wine, and drink with the girls

in the boat. A good boat girl's boat costs about 20,000 yuan per hour.

An old woman's boat also costs 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per hour. These girls rowing the boats,

however, do not know how to swim, but they are very brave. When the boat is swaying

unsteadily, they do not panic at all. I once asked

them why they didn't learn to swim, and they said, "It's not good for

girls to show themselves swimming in the lake."

South Lake Water Chestnut

Sold in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas, the water chestnut

is large, without horns, delicious, and tender.

Once you've tasted South Lake water chestnuts, no one doesn't love them. Legend has it that

when Emperor Qianlong went to the Mist and Rain Tower in South Lake, he found the taste of the water chestnut

very delicious when he ate it, and he casually sighed that the water chestnut had two horns. Since then, South

Lake water chestnuts have had no horns. Thinking about this story now,

it is really too ridiculous. The production area of water chestnuts is around South Lake,

and the production time is from early summer to early winter. Water chestnuts are divided into tender,

old, and very old three types. Tender water chestnuts can be eaten raw, old ones can be cooked,

and very old ones can be dried and eaten. The taste is exceptionally delicious.

The reporter asked a boatman about the water chestnut news this year. She

said that her family has ten acres of water chestnut ponds and has earned

10 to 20 million yuan in the past two months. The water chestnut business is good this year.

It sells for 2,000 yuan per catty in the market. If you know how to bargain,

you can buy it for 1,000 yuan per catty. Roughly calculated, there is at least

an income of nearly 1 billion yuan. This income is

invested in the Jiaxing market. Another product is

South Lake Crab

Crabs are divided into those caught in traps and those with eggs.

Crabs produced within thirty li of Jiaxing

are considered the best, with a fresh taste, firm meat, and large size.

Female crabs are best in September, and male crabs are best in October. The so-called

traps are made of small bamboo branches woven into a bamboo trap shape, placed

in the river channel. When crabs swim by, they enter the maze and are captured.

If the water flow in the river channel is rapid, the crabs will be larger,

the taste will be fresher, and the meat will be firmer.

The most famous crabs are produced near the Sigu Bridge in Xin-Sheng, northwest of Jiaxing,

but the output is only two dan per day, which is less than the demand.

Other rivers or their tributaries near Jiaxing,

all have crabs. Among them, those produced in South Lake

are exceptionally large, so they are called South Lake Large Crabs. Crabs produced near Jiaxing

amount to about 50 dan per day, at 2 million yuan per dan.

Willow crabs are produced near Jiashan, especially in Xitang, Jiashan.

The daily output is more than 100 dan, and the price is 1.4 million yuan.

Jiaxing Crabs

Cost about 2 million yuan per dan. The price

cannot be discounted, but with a daily output of 50

dan, it is already 100 million yuan. Adding transportation costs, when sold to

customers, it will be over 40 to 50 million yuan. Currently,

the freshest crabs in Jiaxing sell for 3,000 yuan per tael, the next best

for 2,800 yuan per tael, and the next best for 2,000 yuan per tael.

The highest price in Shanghai is 5,000 yuan per tael, and the

lowest is 3,000 yuan per tael.

The best time for crabs is after the cold winds start,

after the Double Ninth Festival, when chrysanthemums are slowly blooming, it is the time

for poets and scholars to hold crabs and appreciate chrysanthemums.

Of course, South Lake boats, South Lake water chestnuts, and South Lake crabs all

belong to enjoyment and consumption, but Jiaxing, the place of origin of South Lake

boats, South Lake water chestnuts, and South Lake crabs, welcomes many consumers

to invest. Like this year's liveliness, with so many tourists, there is

at least an income of nearly 10 billion yuan, so the Jiaxing market

has revived again. We hope that the people of Jiaxing will make good use of

this fund and do more to revitalize local construction projects. (Special correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Regulations for Economic Auditing of Private Primary and Secondary Schools Recently Issued by the Municipal Education Bureau

(Dahua News) The Shanghai Municipal Education

Bureau has recently issued the

Shanghai Municipal Regulations

for the Implementation of

Economic Auditing of Private

Primary and Secondary Schools.

The following is an excerpt: This

Bureau is formulating these

regulations to ensure the transparency of private primary and secondary school finances and to urge

the economic audit committees of each school to conscientiously carry out their work.

Private primary and secondary schools in this city should establish an economic audit

committee, which will be responsible for auditing the income and expenditure of all funds

and the reimbursement of all accounts and receipts.

The audit committee of private primary and secondary schools should meet

once a month to audit the monthly income and expenditure accounts, and meet once at the end of the semester and academic year to audit

the income and expenditure accounts for the entire semester and academic year.

Private primary and secondary schools should adopt modern bookkeeping methods: cash

receipts and disbursements, classification ledgers, and daily journals, etc.,

and must follow the prescribed format. Before the start of each year, private primary and secondary schools

should prepare a budget for the entire academic year's expenses and submit it to the school

board for approval before announcing it within the school. All income and

expenditure of private primary and secondary schools should be stored in a bank or money

shop in the school's name, and the interest should be part of the official receipt.

The use of funds by private primary and secondary schools should be based on

the budget, and any expenditures exceeding the budget must

be approved by the board of directors. At the end of each month, private primary and secondary schools

should prepare a monthly statement of income and expenditure. At the end of each semester, they should prepare a budget statement

for the entire semester's income and expenditure. At the end of each academic year, they should prepare a final account and

a statement of income and expenditure and a balance sheet for the entire academic year,

which should be audited by the economic audit committee and submitted to the school

board and announced within the school. If

private primary and secondary schools provide meals, uniforms, stationery, etc.

on behalf of students, the fees may be charged to students at the actual

price, but a detailed list of income and expenditure should be prepared,

together with supporting receipts, and submitted to the economic audit

committee for review before being announced within the school. The

work of the economic audit committee of private primary and secondary schools

may be inspected by this Bureau at any time, and this Bureau may send personnel to participate in various audit meetings when necessary.

These regulations will be implemented after being approved by the Bureau's Bureau Affairs Meeting and reported to the Municipal Government for record.

### Coal Fee Problem Solved for Northern Universities - Tianjin and Peking Advance Payments from Four Banks - Northeast Loaned Locally by Headquarters - Northwest Loans in Progress

(Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd) The Ministry of Education had previously allocated

winter coal fees to Northern universities. This year, the Ministry of Education has requested the Executive Yuan to approve the allocation of

the amount of coal needed for higher education institutions in the North this winter. However, the weather in the North is cold early, and waiting for the Executive Yuan to approve the entire case

and allocate funds would be too late, and prices are rising monthly, so it is necessary to raise funds in advance. Previously, when

Chairman Chiang and Executive Yuan President Zhang inspected Tianjin and Peking, the authorities of the universities in Tianjin and Peking made requests in person,

and submitted budgets showing the number of students and staff and the amount

of coal needed. President Zhang immediately issued an instruction that

the winter coal fees for higher education institutions in Tianjin and Peking should be processed immediately. Therefore, the Ministry of Education

first guaranteed a loan of 7.2 billion yuan from the Four Banks to be used for the coal

fees of higher education institutions in Tianjin and Peking. When the Executive Yuan approves the entire case and allocates the coal

fees, the loan will be deducted. It is reported that in Peking, Peking University

President Hu Shih presided over a meeting of higher education institutions in Peking to discuss distribution and lending methods, and

reported to the Ministry of Education for a guaranteed loan. In Tianjin, Nankai

University President Zhang Boling presided over a meeting of higher education institutions in Tianjin to discuss methods. Recently,

Zhang Boling submitted the results of the meeting and the designated lending

bank to the Ministry of Education for processing. In addition, the Northeast

authorities were requested to provide loans to higher education institutions in the Northeast based on the

conditions of each school. First provide loans to meet urgent needs.

Loans for winter coal fees for Northwest schools (including border areas) are also being

negotiated with the Four Banks by the Ministry of Education.

### Hong Kong Football Match - Kitchee Defeats Star Island - Return from Overseas Tour Suffers Unprecedented 7-2 Defeat

(Our Dispatch from Hong Kong) In the blink of an eye,

it's the weekend again, and there are four football league matches on Saturday alone.

The football scene is chaotic, and football fans are overwhelmed.

Let's first look at today's results and then at tomorrow's Star-Kitchee match.

South China - Cross-Harbor Victory

Saturday, 18th,

both teams

from South China

won. The Bus Company

defeated the Navy 4-1 at the Navy stadium.

Although the team won,

the Bus Company didn't play well enough.

The reason for the victory is that the Navy's strength is too low.

I think that although the Bus Company has considerable

strength this year, they will inevitably be frustrated.

South China crossed the harbor to challenge the Police at the

Police stadium. The Police were lined up to face the enemy. As a result, Chen Dehui

scored three goals, winning by three goals against the Police. The declining South China

is gradually coming back to life. In two internal battles between foreign soldiers, Devon defeated the Air Force 4-1, and St. Joseph also defeated Hong Kong Club 3-1.

Eastern - Draws with Kwong Wah

Sunday, 19th, the Star-Kitchee match

absorbed all the fans, and the other

two matches became unpopular. Eastern

has been determined to reorganize its lineup this year,

and recently recruited Zhu Yongqiang to join,

but unexpectedly, they were held to a draw by Kwong Wah, the weakest team in the Chinese League,

losing five points in total. Although they have the desire to win the championship, the overall

situation is difficult to reverse. The game was decided by two penalty kicks,

each team getting one, resulting in a one-to-one draw.

In a battle between foreign soldiers, Yannis defeated the Artillery 5-2.

Causeway Bay - Stadium Full

The most eye-catching

Star-Kitchee match was held at

the Navy stadium in Causeway

Bay. Fans flocked to the stadium, and the gates were already closed and the stadium was full by 4:30 PM.

Star Island's overseas players are now playing

for Star Island and Kitchee this year. Kitchee is currently

leading the league undefeated, and Star Island's match

is their first after returning from their tour of England. Everyone thought there would be a

fierce battle, but unexpectedly, it was a one-sided affair, and Star Island

suffered a crushing 7-2 defeat. The lineups at the start of the match were:

[Kitchee]

Zhu Zhaoheng

Zeng Zhongyun - Hou Weicheng

Liu Songsheng - Song Lingxing - Liu Qingcun

Jing - Li Zhaorong - Guo Yingqi - He Yingfen - Deng Guangsen

[Star Island]

Yu De

Liu Tianshen - Zheng Ying

Shan Yousheng - Xu Jingcheng - Li Dian

Cao Qiuting - Feng Jingxiang - Wei Huanzhang - Zhang Jin - Li Zhongxian

Star Island - Mistake and Abnormality

Looking at the lineup,

Star Island used Dian

Qi and Fang

Sheng as central defenders. It was clear that they would lose due to the poor arrangement of the lineup.

In addition, the entire team played abnormally, and Zheng Yingquan was injured at the beginning of the match,

making the unstable defense even weaker. The defeat was the result of "abnormality" and "mistakes".

Because Star Island didn't play as well as expected,

Kitchee, of course, played well, attacking from the defense line in a timely manner.

Forcing Star Island to defend was the most powerful link in securing the victory, and Zhaorong's shot,

which was powerful and cunning, certainly made the goalkeeper tremble.

Second Half - Complete Rout

At the start of the second

half, before Star Island

and Kitchee had a chance to stabilize themselves,

Wei Huanzhang scored first. Zheng

Yingquan was injured again. Kitchee

took the opportunity to counterattack, and Guangsen's long shot was successful, tying the score at

1-1. At this time, Star Island retreated completely,

and although Kitchee attacked a lot, they only circled within the Cai area.

Finally, Huanzhang received a wonderful pass from Jingxiang, but his lob shot turned into a wild ball.

The first half ended in a tie.

In the second half, as soon as the game started, after Zhaorong scored two goals,

Yingfen headed in another, and Star Island conceded three goals in eight minutes.

Kitchee took a 4-1 lead in an instant. At this time, Kitchee completely controlled the situation,

and then Yingqi scored again, making it 5-1. The overall situation was set.

Jin Hai then had a chance to break through and scored, making it 5-2. Again,

Yingfen scored, and Yingqi scored a penalty kick from 20 yards,

making the final score 7-2. The entire match was unremarkable, with only shots on goal.

### China United - Draw with Selangor

(Guoguang News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, 22nd)

Shanghai China United drew 1-1 with the Selangor team yesterday.

Han Longhai scored China United's goal.

### Order for Small Football Group B Final Determined - This Week at Nanshi Stadium

(Guoguang News Agency, Nanjing) After the Taiwan Shitan

preparing a grand welcome to show its welcome to the visiting team.

The visiting team will be provided with sightseeing and hospitality.

### Baseball Vanguard Expedition: Coal Corporation and Taiwan Compatriots Alliance Team to Face Fuxing Today at Jiangwan Fudan University Field This Afternoon

Yesterday, the Taiwan Provincial Coal Corporation baseball team played their second match in Shanghai against the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance team, organized by Taiwanese expatriates in Shanghai, at the professional baseball field. The audience was slightly smaller, but the atmosphere remained enthusiastic.

Before the game, Li Weiguang, president of the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance, accompanied by the daughter of Wang Ming, chairman of the alliance's board of directors, entered the field and presented flowers to the visiting team. Xiao Dezong, captain of the Coal Corporation team, responded by presenting a team flag to express camaraderie. The visiting team used their reserves throughout the entire game, ultimately winning with a score of 23 to 3.

Taiwan Compatriots Alliance Suffers a Setback

The game started at 3:30 PM, with Liang Fuchu, Yu Chang, and Gu Degang as referees. After both sides positioned their players, the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance started the attack, but were unable to get on base due to the fierce pitching of Lin Jianwei from the visiting team. The visiting team countered, and the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance made numerous errors. The Coal Corporation team took an early lead of 3-0 in the first inning.

In the second inning, the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance was powerless, allowing the visiting team's Bai Qingchuan, Xue Yongshun, and Chuan Junnai to safely reach base, resulting in another six points for the Coal Corporation team. In the third inning, the visiting team seemed to relax, and the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance rallied, scoring three points. In the fourth inning, the Coal Corporation team became rampant again, ending with a score of 3-0. Riding on their momentum, they continued to press in the fifth inning, initially leading with a score of 6-0. Subsequently, Xue Yongshun was injured in the ankle and left the field. The Taiwan Compatriots Alliance urgently brought in pitcher Li Tiancheng, but it was ineffective. The visiting team ended the fifth inning with a score of 10-0.

By the sixth inning, the Taiwan Compatriots Alliance had completed their attack. Originally, it was the Coal Corporation team's turn to retaliate. However, at this point, with the visiting team leading by a large margin of 23-3, both sides agreed not to continue. The visiting team ultimately won with a score of 23-3, delivering another victory. The game statistics are as follows:

Principal Zhang Yi Throws the First Pitch

This afternoon at 3:00 PM, the visiting team will face the Fuxing team at the Fudan University field. At noon, Fudan University will dispatch a school bus to welcome the visiting team. After arriving at the university, they will visit the school's facilities and farm. A banquet will be held in the evening for a friendly gathering. Principal Zhang Yi will preside over the opening ceremony, and Miss Shao Yingduo, a female student, will represent the Fuxing team in presenting flowers, foreshadowing a lively event on the Jiangwan Road.

The Coal Corporation team has fought two battles in Shanghai, gradually acclimatizing to the environment. To maintain their strength in preparation for facing the Panda and Shanghai Star teams, they decided last night that the reserves will play in today's game. The Fuxing team is composed of Fudan University students and alumni, and was hastily formed, lacking coordination, making defeat inevitable. However, they will strive to compete against all teams. The referees are Wu Bangwei, Liang Fuchu, and Yu Chang.

[Coal Corporation] Wu Wenjun (team leader), Xiao Dezong (captain), Zhang Jiuxiang, Li Minghua, Chen Xiangrui, Wang Jinzhu, Xue Yongshun, Bai Qingchuan, Yan Zhaoyuan, Chen Zhongqi, Guo Fusan, Chuan Junnai, Xiao Songlin, Lin Qixian, Lin Shengwei.

### "Pre-Announcement" Import Licenses: Validity Period Extended to the End of This Year; Woolens Excluded, Still Limited to July 31st

[Report from this newspaper] According to the secretariat of the Export-Import Control Committee: It has been found that for various goods ordered by importers before November 17, 1946, that have not yet been declared and imported, and that meet the various conditions stipulated in the Executive Committee Announcement No. 1 of the former Export-Import Control Committee, "Pre-Announcement" import licenses have been issued separately. However, it was stipulated that all goods must arrive by the end of June of this year, so those arriving in July were refused import by customs or sealed in warehouses. In order to expedite the processing of these imported goods, the committee has now decided on a flexible approach: 1. The validity period of previously issued "Pre-Announcement" licenses is extended to the end of this year, except for woolens, which are subject to separate regulations. (For goods listed in the attached table that still cannot be shipped by the end of this year, a valid supporting document must be prepared and sent to the committee to apply for a "Post-Announcement" import license.) 2. The letter of credit for the "Pre-Announcement" license referred to in the preceding paragraph should be (A) opened before March 1, 1946, and all foreign exchange cleared; or (B) opened before November 17, 1946, and all foreign exchange cleared, or expired without extension, but sold back to the designated bank and definitively paid with foreign deposits before February 17, 1947, with proof. 3. For "Pre-Announcement" licenses for woolens, where the payment has been fully made before February 14, 1946, with conclusive proof, the validity period is extended to July 31st of this year. 4. Any discrepancies between the quantity and value stated on the "Pre-Announcement" license and the goods, or any discrepancies between the starting and ending dates filled in the application and the actual shipping date, shall be handled by the competent department of this committee.

### Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution: Outline Agreed Upon Yesterday, Chairman Liu Takes to Nanjing for Discussion by the Economic Commission

[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to review the joint cotton yarn distribution measures. Review committee members Chu Weijing, Jiang Dixian, Wang Qiyu, and Tang Xinghai attended, as well as representatives from the six cotton spinning associations: Liu Pi, Han Zhiming, Shao Baohu, Zhang Wenkui, Yuan Guoliang, and Zhu Fugu. The meeting was chaired by Liu Siying. First, each of the attending representatives reported on the opinions of private factories regarding the joint distribution measures, which lasted until after 7:00 PM, when the attending representatives first withdrew. Discussion then began, and five points were decided: Establish the outline of the joint distribution measures for general cotton yarn. The joint distribution measures are national in scope, but will first be piloted in the Shanghai area. The original finished product transportation and sales small paper meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee will be renamed the Cotton Yarn Joint Distribution Committee. Production yarn from both national and private yarn factories will be allocated based on Textile Adjustment Committee documents. The Distribution Committee will, each month, review the cotton yarn needs in various regions and their actual sales situation, and create an allocation budget table for distribution purposes. The approved outline of the distribution measures has been taken to Nanjing last night by the chairman of the committee, Liu Siying, and will be presented for discussion at today's meeting of the National Economic Commission.

It is heard that the joint cotton yarn distribution measures consist of nine articles, the main outline: Organize a cotton yarn joint distribution committee, with all agencies and legal entities related to yarn and cloth to be invited as members. All yarn production from both national and private yarn factories must be sold with the documentation of the distribution committee. Distribution will temporarily be limited to cotton yarn, with priority given to the replication industry, followed by yarn merchants. According to a person in charge of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the joint cotton yarn distribution measures are a fixed government policy and will be implemented inevitably. However, the government is determined to implement a reasonable distribution policy, and will absolutely not harm the production of each factory, and the price of cotton yarn, will especially ensure that manufacturers receive legitimate profits as a prerequisite. Therefore, before implementation, opinions from private factories are being solicited first, to prove the authorities' determination to seek the rationalization of distribution measures.

### Negotiated Price Still Unmoved, Cotton Yarn Continues to Decline, Cloth Market Initially Opens Flat and Weak, Recovering to Expensive Near Closing

### The End of the Month Ratio Period is Approaching, and Money is Not Easily Loosened

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's local money market showed a slight loosening in tightness. National banks and bureaus had injected 24.7 billion yuan, but dark interest and external Hua share markups remained firm, the former at 24%, and the latter at 31%. Yesterday, the central bank injected 13.6 billion yuan, foreign banks injected 28.8 billion yuan, the large exchange injected 12.5 billion yuan, and the small exchange injected 16.6 billion yuan.

Also, the end of this month is the money industry's end of the month ratio period, and the banks themselves are in urgent need of capital, so money is unlikely to loosen in the near future.

### Hua Shares Once Moved Upstream, Finally Closed Lower

Hua shares fluctuated wildly yesterday. In the morning market, due to Chaozhou buyers purchasing heavily in the external market, and Henghu setting an example, the market recovered after being weak and was very lively in the middle. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, after the supply and sale of No. 49 and banks, the situation suddenly turned unfavorable. The news that the US loan of 500 million was successful caused many to sell off sharply, and the market was completely changed, ending abruptly at a low price.

The morning opened flat and weak, with Yongsha falling to a low price of 291 yuan for immediate delivery and 292 yuan for deferred delivery. With many buying, external Chaozhou buyers injected over 100 million shares, and the news of Gu Shanchang going to Beijing led to speculation of more favorable conditions, the market rose to a high price of 298 yuan for immediate delivery and 300 yuan for deferred delivery. But this level was not easily broken through, and the market fluctuated. After 10:30, interest rates still opened at 27% and 31.5%, once falling to the morning's initial low price. At this time, many bought spot Yongsha, and there was news of an increase in the negotiated price of yarn and flowers, sentiment remained lively, and Yongsha jumped to a high price of 300 yuan for immediate delivery and 302 yuan for deferred delivery, before closing at prices of 300 yuan and 301 yuan. Other shares also recovered slightly, but the responsiveness was limited. As a result, compared with the previous close, immediately delivered Yongsha, Xinhuo, Meiya, Huachen, Jingfu, and Sino-French rose slightly, Jingcheng, Cement, Qinxing, and Hengfeng were flat, and Xinguang, Xinhua, Match, China Silk, Tongyi, Datong, China Textile, and Zhabei fell slightly, with underwear falling by 5%. For deferred shares, Jingfu and Qinxing were flat, and Yongsha, Xinhuo, Meiya, and Huachen rose, while Xinguang fell slightly.

In the after-market, only immediate delivery transactions were made, with Yongsha once rising to 305 yuan, and Lianhua Land falling back to 300 yuan. National banks exchanged injections, while foreign merchants had injections, selling pressure gradually increased, and with the news that the US loan had pre-loaned 500 million yuan, most sold off, the decline became widespread, this sale killed that sale, and the price gradually fell to a low price of 278 yuan, before closing at 281 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning close, Lianhua shares rose to the limit, Yongsha, Meiya, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Lian Silk fell by 5%, and Xinhuo, Huachen, Yu, Xinhua, Zhabei, and Huaxin fell by about 10%, and other gains and losses were slight. The buying of old shares and bank shares in the external market stopped slightly, and gains and losses were mixed.

### Unified Bonds Recover, Foreign Shares Rise and Fall Unevenly

Public bonds recovered yesterday. Unified C opened at 14,900 yuan, rising from 14,800 yuan to close around 15,500 yuan, up 700 yuan for Classes A, B, and C compared to the previous close, 800 yuan for D, and 1,000 yuan for E, with approximately 4 million yuan in transactions.

Foreign shares rose and fell unevenly yesterday. Guangdong and bank buyers were in, while securities, foreign firms, and money exchange buyers were out. Yi Yarn and other familiar shares rose slightly in the middle, but weakened at the close, falling from 173,000 yuan to close at the morning opening low price. Yeguang had news of increased rent, and banks linked together to absorb and were quiet. Paper had a rumored dividend of 7,000 yuan, and was also lively. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Federation, Deyi, and Yi Bi were flat, Yeguang rose 10%, and Paper and Telephone rose 5%, Yi Yarn fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly.

### Textile Export Committee Discusses Promotion Procedures

[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Export Committee held a committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Shen Xirui, and committee members Yuan Zhongda, Zhang Siyi, Tang Xinghai, and Wu Changfu attended.

The meeting discussed textiles being exported, with factories negotiating directly with foreign countries individually, the issue of bartering cotton for yarn for printing, and hiring the Bank of China and Citibank as intermediary guarantors. The meeting also discussed future exchange settlement procedures, export quality, and quantity, before adjourning at around 5:00 PM.

### Remittance Fees from Taiwan to Shanghai Reduced Again from Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] With Taiwan's financial stability increasing, the handling fees charged by China Southern, Caihua, and Industrial and Commercial Banks for accepting remittances from Taiwan to Shanghai will be reduced again from the 22nd to 4%. That is, each Taiwan dollar is actually remitted at 69.25 yuan of legal tender. The official exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender is currently 1:72. The handling fee charged by the Bank of Taiwan for normal remittances is also 4%. Therefore, the commonly existing black market for Taiwan dollars is expected to be completely eliminated from the 22nd.

### Green Bamboo Shoots Recover Slightly

The recent market for green bamboo shoots has seen a slight recovery, with a difference of 30-40 meters before and after. Yesterday's transaction price for Xinhu was 3.6 to 3.7 million yuan, and the transaction price for Erpai was 2 to 2.2 million yuan.

### Commercial Briefs

The American vessel "Grant Maiser" arrived from New York yesterday carrying 1,000 tons of gasoline.

Cigarettes fell back yesterday, with supply exceeding demand. Ten British cigarettes were down 200,000 yuan from the previous day, and Old Knife was down 50,000.

Daily necessities were heavily sold yesterday, with both Guben Arrow and knife soap falling back 15,000 yuan from the previous day.

Matches fell by 35,000 to 100,000 yuan.

The Central Trust Bureau will purchase Taiwanese coal, transport it to Shanghai for sale, and supply it to meet needs. It is heard that the profits will belong to the Taiwan Provincial Government.

The Shanghai Paper Industry Association Tea Market has suspended trading since the 15th of this month due to market price chaos. According to Association Secretary Zhang Zhenfan, the Tea Market will not resume until the market has recovered to a normal state. The association is currently preparing to take steps to stabilize paper prices.

### New Aesthetics

â Wen Zhaotong

Written by Cai Yi, Published by Qunyi Publishing House

Having let go of the author's "New Art Theory," one should then read his "New Aesthetics." Consequently, I introduced "New Art Theory," and I must also introduce this "New Aesthetics."

From the title, it is evident that it stands in opposition to the old aesthetics. This is because the old aesthetics have completely exposed their contradictions, making it necessary to establish a new aesthetic system with new methods.

What is the old aesthetics? In his methodology of aesthetics, he points out: first, the metaphysical school of aesthetics, which relies entirely on conscious self-reflection to grasp the essence of beauty. The propositions of Baumgarten, Kant, Croce, and even Fechner, which advocate grasping the essence through sensation, and those of Plato, which advocate grasping the essence of beauty through ideas, and those of Colm and Schopenhauer, which advocate grasping the essence of beauty through emotion, all fall into this category. Second, the psychological school of aesthetics, which is the opposite of the metaphysical school of aesthetics in terms of aesthetic method. It does not start from metaphysical philosophical thought but from psychological experience. On the one hand, it rejects the speculative and reflective methods of subjective consciousness and adopts experimental methods. On the other hand, the objects it examines are still the activities of subjective consciousness, and the phenomena are determined based on subjective consciousness. It is also divided into: the pure psychological school of aesthetics, which focuses on the investigation of the conscious activities of aesthetic feeling; and the experimental school of aesthetics, which focuses on the investigation of aesthetic phenomena. Third, objective aesthetics, which examines beauty from art. Taine, Herder, and Guyau advocate studying the basic forms of art from a social perspective. Grosse advocates studying art from an ethnological standpoint. Allan, Spencer, and Cross advocate focusing on the investigation of individual artistic impulses from an evolutionary standpoint.

This "New Aesthetics" lies in the criticism that: "Examining beauty from subjective consciousness, or only examining beauty from art, but the beauty of art is created by subjective consciousness, and the aesthetic feeling of subjective consciousness is a reaction to objective beauty, so the results are all failures" (page 16). It points out that the path of new aesthetics is: "Beauty lies in objective reality, the beauty of reality is the root of aesthetic feeling and the root of artistic beauty. Therefore, the correct path of aesthetics is to examine beauty from reality and grasp the essence of beauty" (page 17).

The entire field of aesthetics can be divided into three aspects: one, the existence of beautyâobjective beauty; two, the cognition of beautyâaesthetic feeling; three, the creation of beautyâart. The existence of beauty is the most fundamental thing. In the old aesthetics, aesthetic feeling and beauty are often confused, and many contradictions are discovered. The author makes a serious criticism of the contradictions of "subjective beauty" theorists such as Fechner, Lipps, Kant, Croce, and Zhu Guangqian, who is famous in our country for his "Literary Psychology," and objective idealism aestheticians, and establishes that: "Beauty is objective, not subjective; the reason why beautiful things are beautiful lies in the things themselves, not in our conscious activity. However, objective beauty can be reflected by our consciousness and can arouse our aesthetic feeling. And the correct source of aesthetic feeling lies in the beauty of objective things. Aesthetic feeling that occurs without objective beauty as a basis is incorrect, false, and even morbid... Beautiful things are typical things, that is, things in which the general is manifested in the individual; the essence of beauty is the typicality of things, that is, the general of the species is manifested in the individual" (page 68).

Regarding the recognition of beauty, that is, the question of aesthetic feeling, the author reviews old theories such as: the intuitive theory of form, the theory of psychological distance, the theory of aesthetic attitude, the theory of emotional transfer, the theory of internal models, and the aesthetics of other physiologies, and points out the correct process and characteristics of the recognition of beauty, and the nature and source of aesthetic feeling. The author believes that: "Aesthetic feeling is originally changing, and the relative discontinuity is a major opportunity for the change of aesthetic feeling" (page 170).

"Beauty is objective, but it can be reflected by our consciousness. The so-called beautiful thing is a thing in which the species' attribute conditions are more dominant than the individual's attribute conditions, that is, the "general appears in the individual" and the type" (page 171). This is the author's basic definition of beauty. From this definition, the types of beauty are distinguished, divided into simple beauty, individual beauty, and combined beauty. The so-called simple beauty refers to the beauty of form, sound, color, Qi, taste, temperature, and hardness. The aestheticians of the past who advocated form attached great importance to it, and believed that simple beauty was everything of beauty. Individual beauty must have its due simple beauty, but it is not a collection of simple beauties. At the same time: individual beauty is neither biased towards form nor biased towards content, but a good match between content and form. It evokes a strong aesthetic feeling, but it is not a super-fast feeling. Realistic artists pay great attention to it. Comprehensive beauty is the inevitable correlation of individuals, and the more dominant the general attribute conditions of the species, the more beautiful it is. Idealistic aestheticians in the past paid great attention to it, and believed that comprehensive beauty was everything of beauty.

At the same time, beauty also has a second classification method, namely natural beauty, social beauty, and artistic beauty. Natural beauty is non-artificial and has nothing to do with human aesthetic recognition; social beauty is artificial and has nothing to do with human aesthetic recognition; artistic beauty is artificial and produced based on human aesthetic sense. Therefore: artistic beauty is generally higher than natural beauty or social beauty.

Since beauty has such types, the types of aesthetic feeling naturally also have their differences. When the object of beauty is combined with the concept of beauty, aesthetic feeling occurs, and at the same time, various accompanying conditions of sensibility, intellectuality, and emotion occur. Conversely, various different aesthetic feelings are caused by these accompanying conditions. This is the difference in the form of aesthetic feeling, which can be divided into majestic aesthetic feeling and delicate aesthetic feeling, and tragic aesthetic feeling and comic aesthetic feeling. Psychologically speaking: majestic aesthetic feeling is a mixed emotional activity of contradictions, and delicate aesthetic feeling is a harmonious mixed emotional activity. Tragic aesthetic feeling is expanded from majestic beauty. Because the stimulus of the beautiful object is strong, it causes an inverse mental response, which is not only a vague feeling of tension and excitement, but also a distinct sadness. Similarly, the aesthetic feeling of comedy is expanded from the delicate beauty. Because the stimulus of the beautiful object is softer, it causes an aesthetic feeling accompanied by a vague mental response.

Art is the creation of beauty, and since beauty has such a classification, art can of course also be

Aestheticians and art theorists have traditionally classified art in three ways: one, classification of time and space; two, classification of still and moving; three, classification of formative and musical. This classification method seems feasible on the surface, but none of them touch the essence of art. Because the essence of art is: "What is the essence of art? We know it is the beauty of art, that is, the beauty of reality reflected by art, the typicality of reality. The source of the beauty of reality, the typicality of reality, is strengthened by artists and created into the beauty of art" (page 249). Therefore, the types of art should be divided according to the types of beauty of the objective things reflected by art, that is, the art of simple beauty, that is, music, architecture, dance, patterns, etc., which are biased towards form; the art of individual beauty, that is, painting, sculpture, which are biased towards the harmonious unity of form and content; the art of comprehensive beauty is literature, drama, and comprehensive beauty is

Generally speaking, it is higher than individual beauty, and social beauty is also comprehensive beauty.

### Introducing "Higher Mathematics for Physics and Chemistry"

â Li Zonghai

First edition, May 1947, Commercial Press

Translated and compiled by Xu Xiejun

Original work by J.W. Mellor

Higher mathematics is a necessary tool for studying natural sciences. The properties of objects in the natural world are constantly changing, and only the laws of higher mathematics can be used to study this ever-flowing phenomenon. For example, differential calculus can investigate how natural phenomena change from moment to moment, and ingeniously use limit ratios to express the rate of change of any uniform and continuous change in an instant. Integral calculus can derive the laws governing the entire process of change from the known properties of natural change in an instant. Infinite series provide an approximate concept of natural change, supplementing the inadequacy of other methods. Analytical geometry can express natural change in geometric figures. All of this proves that to study natural sciences, one must have a deep understanding of higher mathematics; in particular, one must have a clear understanding of how higher mathematics is applied to natural sciences.

However, most common mathematics textbooks only focus on the description of mathematical theory, and do not provide detailed explanations of its application in natural sciences. Students who have learned it can only solve mathematical problems, but cannot understand the relationship between natural phenomena and the pure abstractness of formal mathematics, and cannot discover the complementarity between mathematical methods and natural changes. Therefore, they cannot understand the ultimate meaning of theorems or equations in science that have a mathematical basis, as well as problems solved by applying mathematical laws, and only have a superficial understanding. It is even more impossible to use mathematical laws to study natural phenomena. From this point of view, a mathematics book that takes natural science as a starting point and can describe in detail how mathematical laws are applied to the study of natural phenomena is indeed what beginners in science need. The "Higher Mathematics for Physics and Chemistry" recently published by the Commercial Press is a mathematics book that takes natural science as a starting point. The original author, Mellor, explains several famous natural changes in this book, which is the greatest advantage of the book. This not only allows readers to understand the close relationship between mathematics and science, but also, from the standpoint of a mathematics book, it avoids the old method of teaching mathematics by applying abstract problems. For example, the meaning of the differential coefficient and the limit ratio is described by the speed of chemical reactions, the law of compound interest in nature is derived from the method of finding the differential coefficient of exponential functions; discontinuous functions lead to MendelÃ©ev's work on the existence of hydrated substances in solutions; the law of mass action leads to a detailed study of the steps of integral calculus; the equation of motion of objects is the basis for studying second-order differential equations; the work of Harcourt and Esson introduces the study of simultaneous differential equations; Fourier series is applied to diffusion, and so on. After reading this, readers should have a deep understanding of the method of applying mathematical principles to the study of natural phenomena.

The original book is divided into eleven chapters: Differential Calculus, Analytical Geometry, Functions with Singularities, Integral Calculus, Infinite Series and Their Uses, Solution of Numerical Equations, Solution of Differential Equations, Fourier's Theorem, Probability and Error Theory, Variational Calculus, and Determinants. The exercises in the book are mostly taken from experimental records in scientific journal articles published in Europe and the United States in recent times. At the end of the book, there is also a collection of formulas and numerical tables, which are very useful for reference. The whole book is divided into two large volumes, about 1,000 pages, and the price is

Readers only need to have read elementary algebra and trigonometry, and have a considerable familiarity with the preliminary theorems of physical chemistry, to be able to read this book without difficulty. The author would like to solemnly introduce this book to students who are just entering university and are interested in studying science.

### Anecdotes of Revolutionary History

â Yu Qiruo

Written by Lu Danlin

Published by Datong Bookstore

In the past ten years or so, more than a dozen books on the historical materials of the Kuomintang have been published one after another, some are specialized histories, and some are anecdotes, each with its own characteristics. Anecdotes of Revolutionary History is recently published by Lu Danlin as a continuation of his "Tales of Revolutionary History." This book contains a total of seventeen articles, some of which are textual researches of historical facts, such as the establishment of the Xingzhong Association in Honolulu and party affairs before the Republic of China, the whole story of the uprising of the Great Ming Shuntian Kingdom, whether Li Yuanhong was dragged out from under the bed, and the actual instigators of the Yunnan Uprising. In terms of literature, there are Poems on Huanghuagang, which write about the poems of more than thirty people mourning the martyrs of Huanghuagang, and the literature of the revolutionaries before the Republic of China, which is an interweaving of narration and commentary on the literature of the party members, which is to put forward its era's sense of justice. Regarding the deeds of the Father of the Nation, there are the second and third things about the President's imprisonment in London, the China Bank and the Revolutionary Party, and the President's handwritten letters from the headquarters. Related to the overseas party history are the establishment of the Tongmenghui, the husband regiment of the officer students, and the New Century forty years ago. Huanghuagang is the sacred place of the revolution, and there is an article describing his surroundings, Huanghuagang in full view. There are also several other articles, all related to revolutionary anecdotes and secret histories.

For more than ten years, Lu has been specializing in the study of modern history, especially party history, so what he writes comes from a different perspective from the hearsay circulating in the market. Each article, each event, has its practicality, because many of the materials in it are unique to him personally, and the conclusions are drawn after a detailed textual research and analysis. For example, the two proclamations of the Great Ming Shuntian Kingdom published by the Literature Compilation Institute of the former Palace Museum are generally regarded as cultural relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, but he textualizes that they are the documents of the uprising in Guangzhou by Hong Quanfu and Li Jidang in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu. Another example is the Yunnan Uprising, which most people say was initiated by Cai E, but he takes out real evidence to say that Cai was only an follower, not an initiator. The Xingzhong Association was established in Honolulu fifty-three years ago, and he found the actual direct information from the only earliest records in the world and foreign newspapers from more than forty years ago. This kind of textual research has its unique points.

Ye Gongchuo's preface says: "...Lu Danlin is devoted to historical affairs, and uses his spare time to write a book on the anecdotes of revolutionary history. Although the style is not orthodox history, the records are mostly extraordinary news and facts, which historians must adopt and scholars should have... Danlin's book is detailed and cautious in its narration, and its purpose is unbiased. It can be regarded as a good work of this kind, and it should be made public to the world. Moreover, I hope that Danlin will continue to make more contributions to the vice carriage of the national history, so that the true face of the revolution will be clear in the minds of the people, and its contribution to the great cause of nation-building will be no small matter..." Ye's remarks are also very fair and appropriate, so I have selected a few sentences to cross-reference with my comments.

### The Chimes of Justice

â Shi Bei

Reading Romain Rolland's "The Wolves"

Romain Rolland's life was dedicated to the struggle for freedom, humanity, and justice. In front of his immortal masterpiece "Jean-Christophe," he wrote that this book was "Dedicated to all free souls in the world who suffer and struggle and will eventually triumph." The upright and indomitable spirit is like a white rainbow piercing the sun, enough to be immortal with heaven and earth! As for the play "The Wolves," it is also one of Romain Rolland's great works. It can also be called a manifestation of this spirit, like a chime of justice, its loud sound shaking the earth.

"The Wolves" is based on historical events during the French Revolution in 1792. At that time, the revolutionary army of France was pursuing the fleeing nobles, but was trapped by the Prussian army in the city of Miennes on the left bank of the Rhine. The revolutionary army confronted the enemy and fought a long siege war, trying its best to break through. The progress of the whole play is steady and serious, tense and enthusiastic; in silence, you can hear the distant sound of cannons and rifles, or the hasty footsteps of soldiers on the street, military music, military songs, commands, etc., and the atmosphere of chaos and turbulence is interwoven.

When the country was on the verge of ruin, the officers within the revolutionary army suspected and were jealous of each other. "D'Avaron" in the play was hated by "ThuliÃ©," who was calm and considerate and came from the Society of Scholars, and Commander "Vila," who was brave and violent and came from a pork merchant family, because he was born in the aristocratic class and was arrogant. At this time, Vila took the opportunity to frame D'Avaron. However, the truth of the framed facts was seen through by ThuliÃ©, so he resolutely defended D'Avaron for the sake of justice, forgetting his usual hatred, and at the same time demanded that Vila's treachery be tried. Just as ThuliÃ© was speaking righteously, Vila won the battle, and all the officers in the colleagues blindly supported the meritorious Vila, forgetting justice. In the end, ThuliÃ© was unable to fight alone and sacrificed for justice. The whole play ends here.

After reading this play, we look back at the history of mankind, which has undergone many changes, seas and mulberry fields, unpredictable life and death, just like the greatest drama. Among them, the most valuable thing is the unswerving integrity of justice, but because it is the most difficult to maintain, it is all the more precious and worthy of praise for all ages.

After the Southern Song Dynasty took a partial peace, the world became increasingly chaotic due to the presence of treacherous ministers, and the Yuan army stepped up its offensive. At that time, the government was completely controlled byæåº¸ misgoverning the country treacherous ministers, and only the national hero Wen Tianxiang made heroic struggles in a difficult and dilapidated situation. In the end, although he was imprisoned, his ambition did not change. His "Song of Righteousness" explains what righteousness is: "When the country is peaceful, this righteous energy can shine brightly in the court; in troubled times, it can show people's integrity; this righteous energy of integrity will forever be famous in history, and will last forever; together with the mountains and rivers, it will compete with the sun and moon." His ambition and hisé­å have been fully expressed!

Now let us excerpt a few sentences from ThuliÃ©'s speech in "The Wolves":

"What are we sacrificing our lives for here? Is it for the ambition of a few Jacobin party members? Gesler! The country is using troops for the sake of justice. If the country once violates justice, then what is the difference between it and the lair of the tyrant who wields the same spear? It will be eliminated from the world... Oppressive France will inevitably follow this path. I would rather destroy it with my own hands."

"Everyone, you know how much I hate D'Avaron. Yesterday morning, I even attacked him. But treat an enemy as you would a friend, and maintain your reputation with integrity. If the evidence of his innocence happens to fall into my hands, what should I do? You have to forget the usual hatred and think of a way to correct injustice."

"We should speak from reason. Reason, reason, reason. No one dares to resist when this voice sounds. I obey reason, and if necessary, I can sacrifice my friendship, my hatred, and even my life for it. You also have times when you hear its voice, and you should always follow it. If you want to avoid it, it is extremely tough. It will judge everything...

This is the bone gate of the whole play, and it is what Romain Rolland wants to loudly shout to the world.

In the end, ThuliÃ© that heroically sacrificed, just as Wen Tianxiang died calmly, although they died, they can always "leave their loyalty to illuminate history"! They symbolize the upright souls of mankind that have been reduced but will last forever!

At present, the atmosphere of Chinese society is already corrupt. In order to save the decline, we must fight for the sake of justice, no matter how big or small, and do "Unable to be subdued by force, unable to be seduced by wealth, unable to be moved by poverty." If we act on this and create a good atmosphere; if we compare loyalty and righteousness to the sun and moon, and use righteousness to penetrate the rainbow, then we can find a way out for the people of the scarf kingdom. Romain Rolland's "The Wolves," we have recently been able to see Shen Qiyu's Chinese translation, (Shanghai Camel Bookstore edition), which should be worthy of our special attention. Because it just gives us a great warning and encouragement to improve the atmosphere of society.
