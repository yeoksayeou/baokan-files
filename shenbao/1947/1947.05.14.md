### New Standards for Salary Adjustments: Base of 340,000 and Multiple of 1,800 for Public Educators in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Other Areas

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The measures for adjusting the cost-of-living allowances for public educators and military officers and soldiers have been passed at the political affairs meeting on the 13th and will be implemented starting this month; they will be implemented immediately after being approved by the Executive Yuan committee. According to a source at the Executive Yuan, the standard for adjusting the salaries of public educators this time is 85%, which was drafted after measuring the affordability of the national treasury and considering the price indices in various regions. At the same time, when salaries were adjusted in December last year, taking Shanghai as an example, the price index was 8,200 times that before the war, and in April this year, it was 15,000 times, an increase of about 80%. Therefore, the adjustment standard was determined to increase by 85%. The following are the main points of the adjustment: (1) The proportion of increase in the base number is larger than the proportion of increase in the multiple. The minimum increase in the base number is one time, and the maximum is more than one time. This will make the income ratio of low-level personnel larger. For example, personnel with a monthly salary of less than 200 yuan will increase by at least 85%, and up to 90%. The proportion of increase for senior personnel is smaller. For example, a specially appointed official with a monthly salary of 800 yuan will only increase by 70%. (2) The regions are re-adjusted with reference to the price situation in the local area in order to adapt to the actual situation. For example, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, and Taiyuan, which were originally listed in Zone 2, are now raised to Zone 1. Jiaxing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Fuzhou, and other places originally listed in Zone 3 are now raised to Zone 2. Liuzhou, which was originally in Zone 4, is now raised to Zone 3.

### Adjustment of Salaries for Officers and Soldiers: To Be Approved by the Ministry of National Defense

The adjustment of the cost-of-living allowances for military officers and soldiers will be funded by additional appropriations from the national treasury and will be approved by the Ministry of National Defense in accordance with past practice. This adjustment will greatly increase the burden on the national treasury. The national treasury's monthly burden for civil servants will increase by a total of 125 billion yuan, and the national treasury's monthly burden for military officers and soldiers will increase by a total of 175 billion yuan. In total, the national treasury's monthly burden will increase by 300 billion yuan. The following are the standards for the cost-of-living allowances for public educators: Zone 1, i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, and Bing, has a base number of 340,000 and a multiple of 1,800. Zone 2, i.e., Su, Xijia, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, and Fuzhou, has a base number of 290,000 and a multiple of 1,600. Zone 3, i.e., Kunming and Liuzhou, has a base number of 240,000 and a multiple of 1,300. Zone 4, i.e., Chongqing, has a base number of 200,000 and a multiple of 1,000. Zone 5, i.e., Guizhou, has a base number of 170,000 and a multiple of 800.

[Note] (1) Police chiefs receive 70% of the base number, and police officers receive 60%, plus the multiple. (2) Public servants receive 60% of the base number. (3) For the nine northeastern provinces, the national currency is calculated according to the standards in this table, and then converted into circulating coupons for payment. (4) Taiwan is not included.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xianguang told reporters today that the Executive Yuan's approval of the increase in salaries for military personnel and public educators has already been included in the revised budget of 200 billion, so there is no need for additional budget.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The third session of the fourth National People's Political Council is scheduled to be held at the National Assembly Hall starting on the 20th, with a session of approximately two weeks. During the meeting, the councilors will conduct extensive discussions on current economic, financial, military, and price issues. In particular, this conference will be the last one of the council, and its significance is even greater, as the task of the People's Political Council will end after the National Assembly, which implements the constitution, is convened on December 25th of this year. The various preparatory matters for the conference have been largely completed, and the meeting notice was sent out as early as April 2, inviting the councilors to attend at that time. The notice for the councilors of the Democratic League was also sent out at the same time. However, due to the inability to contact the Communist Party councilors, the Secretariat of the conference has telegraphed the representatives of the Communist Party in the Executive Headquarters to inform them. The Secretariat has now scheduled registration to begin on the 15th. The total cost of this conference is approximately 1.2 billion yuan. The number of councilors was originally 358, but the Shanxi Provincial Council has added four more members in addition to the original four, so the total number of councilors to attend this conference will be 362. The Secretariat of the conference will host a tea party for all councilors one or two days before the conference.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai Councilors' Association held a tea party at Jianguo West Road at 3:00 PM yesterday.

Everyone agreed that the People's Political Council should exert its greatest effort to promote peace and stabilize society in the last conference. Although it is not easy to implement this movement based on conscience, it can first require a ceasefire. Secondly, a comprehensive review should be conducted on the cases resolved by previous conferences to understand the government's implementation situation. The proposals for this conference must avoid trivial matters, and focus on the larger issues, concentrate opinions, and then demand implementation after the resolutions are made. It was also decided to hold another tea party on the 17th in order to solicit the opinions of the majority.

### Democratic League Central Standing Committee Decides to Participate in the Current People's Political Council

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The councilors of the Democratic League have decided to attend the current People's Political Council. This is a decision made by the Democratic League at the standing committee convened at 3:00 PM yesterday. When announcing this news, Ye Duyang, a spokesperson for the Democratic League, said that yesterday's Central Standing Committee was held specifically to discuss this matter. It is reported that the Democratic League councilors are Zhang Lan, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Liang Shuming, and Han Zhao'e.

[Our Newspaper] The opinion of people close to the Democratic League is that there are two reasons why the Democratic League decided to attend the People's Political Council: (1) The People's Political Council is a representative body of public opinion established during the war, which does not violate the principles of the Political Consultative Conference and is not contrary to the purpose of the Democratic League. (2) Qian Duansheng will launch a peace movement in this People's Political Council, so the objective situation is also conducive to the attendance of the Democratic League representatives.

### Now is Not the Appropriate Time to Resume Peace Talks

Spokesperson of the Social Democratic Party Speaks

[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently visited the spokesperson of the Social Democratic Party about the rumor that some councilors will launch a peace movement, and asked about the party's position. According to the spokesperson, the current price fluctuations and social unrest in this city make people deeply feel that ending the civil war is the fundamental solution. But on the other hand, peace is not a unilateral matter. The Communist Party's intentions at this time cannot be predicted. Even if peace talks are resumed, there is no guarantee of success. Therefore, in terms of the objective situation, now is not the appropriate time to resume peace talks. As far as the Social Democratic Party is concerned, everything is done in accordance with the common implementation outline, but if there is a real possibility of achieving peace, it is willing to contribute even without waiting for the two roads to be opened.

### U.S. Troops Withdrawn from Beijing and Tianjin Attacked by Communist Army, Officers and Soldiers Safe, Board Ships to Guam

[United Press, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] Two trains on the Beijing-Yulin section carrying 500 officers and soldiers of the 5th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps arrived safely in Qinhuangdao yesterday. Hours later, the Communist army swept along the railway and attacked the Tanggu-Tangshan section, damaging several miles of tracks. Fortunately, the U.S. troops were safe and had begun to board three transport ships anchored in the port, preparing to depart for Guam. Another approximately 350 officers and soldiers of the 5th Regiment arrived in Beijing by 75 vehicles via the highway yesterday and were originally scheduled to transfer to trains heading north this morning to join the remaining troops in Qinhuangdao. Now, due to the unexpected development of the situation, they remain at the station and have not departed. The vehicles will be transported by waterway. The Communist army cut off the Beijing-Shenyang Railway at two points at night, and the tracks were damaged for one mile at one point. The 5th Regiment is the first major force of the U.S. military to withdraw from China after the end of the Military Mediation Department.

### Rumor Zhou Enlai in Pyongyang

### Fu Zuoyi Arrives in Beijing from Bingzhou, Immediately Meets with Li Zongren to Confer on Shanxi Military Affairs, National Army in Yuncheng Launches Attack and Recovers Strongholds

[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] It is reported that Fu Zuoyi flew to Beijing from Taiyuan at around 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, and immediately went to the Beijing Executive Headquarters to confer with Li Zongren on Shanxi military affairs.

[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] It is reported that Fu Zuoyi is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 14th to report on the situation in Taiyuan.

[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] There was an important military meeting in Beijing on the afternoon of the 13th, attended by Li Zongren, Fu Zuoyi, Sun Lianzhong, and senior officials from the Joint Logistics Headquarters to discuss.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] Fu Zuoyi left Bingzhou and flew to Beijing at 11:30 AM on the 13th. Before leaving, he had a one-hour long talk with Yan Xishan.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] Fu Zuoyi received reporters at 8:00 AM on the 13th. According to him: after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this was the first time he had returned to Bingzhou to pay respects to Yan Xishan and visit friends in Taiyuan. Compared with the miserable situation when he left on November 8, 1937 (Fu was responsible for defending Bingzhou at the time), he was filled with emotions. It is a pity that he could not stay for long. The country is a whole. The safety of Taiyuan is not a Shanxi issue. The chairman will definitely treat it as a national issue. It can be proved by many events that the Taiyuan issue will be properly handled. From the plane, he saw that the fortifications in Taiyuan were very good, and the calmness and determination of the people in Bingzhou were even more infinite power. If the Communist army attacks without measuring its own strength, it is asking for destruction. There are still scattered Communist armies in Chahar Province, and the national army is encircling and suppressing them. In the narrow area of the border area between Chahar, Rehe, and Hebei, the Communist army forces the people to plant opium. Their intention is to protect them when we eradicate them in order to win over the people. Mr. Fu said with certainty that the CCP has failed. This conclusion was reached when Zhangjiakou was recovered. Not only in military and political aspects, but especially in economic policies, the people in the areas occupied or temporarily retained are all tired of the Communist Party. A party whose interests are inconsistent with the interests of the country and the people will never develop. However, it is inevitable that the people of North China will suffer in the short term due to its more than 20 years of history. The future of suppressing bandits is very bright. The Communist Party's mistakes have determined its future of destruction. I do not believe that those who violate history and national interests and the will of the people have any hope of success. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the White Wolf bandits entered Shanxi and occupied many cities and towns. Time is the deciding factor. When the time comes, the suppression of bandits will be successful.

[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] The military estimates that the total number of Communist troops in Shanxi is more than 22 divisions. It is possible that Liu Bocheng's troops will enter Shanxi, He Long will command the military affairs in the southern route, Peng Dehuai will command the military affairs in northwestern Shanxi in Kelan, Xiao Ke will command the military affairs in the northern route, and Nie Rongzhen will command the military affairs in the eastern route in Fuping, attempting to encircle Taiyuan.

[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] Battle situation in Southern Shanxi: (1) The national army in Anyi and Yuncheng has continued to receive air support in recent days. The 67th Brigade of the Communist army's Wang Yong department continued to shell the city on the 12th. The national army is holding on to the fortifications awaiting reinforcements. The situation has reached the final stage. Corpses are everywhere and the smell is pungent. (2) Linfen is still guarded by the national army. The Communist army's attacking force includes one brigade, four regiments, and one artillery regiment.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] According to captured Communist soldiers, the Communist army originally planned to launch a general attack on Yuncheng on the evening of the 10th, but failed due to the unfinished construction. Then, it was decided that each brigade would be responsible for one side on the evening of the 11th, mainly the southwest and northwest. Unexpectedly, the national army launched an attack on the 11th, inflicting heavy damage on them. The attempt to launch a general attack has been defeated.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] The Communist army's 10th, 11th, 12th, 22nd, and 24th Brigades, as well as Sun Dingguo and Wang Tang's troops, and the independent regiments of Yuanqu and Jiyuan, a total of more than 30,000 people, are actively attacking the national army who are besieging the two cities of Anyi and Yuncheng. It is reported that the Communist army has now formed springboard, cloud ladder, and climbing groups, carrying a large amount of explosives and siege equipment, and working together to launch a fierce attack.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th Dispatch] The national army defending Yuncheng launched a powerful counterattack against the Communist army outside the city from noon on the 11th. With the coordinated operation of infantry and artillery, a total of two battalions of the 7,000th Regiment of the Communist army's 24th Brigade were annihilated. The Communist army slightly converged. At 12:00 that night, the Communist army regrouped and launched another fierce attack from the northeast, west, and three sides. By 2:00 AM on the 12th, they were all repelled by the national army. The Communist army suffered heavy casualties and the offensive was frustrated. The national army took advantage of the situation to pursue to places such as Gaojia Plateau and Huai Sh湾 to the northeast, and recovered many important strongholds. There are no Communist troops within ten miles outside the city. In addition, the Anyi garrison recovered the barracks in the east of the city on the 12th, and the Communist army was killed or injured more than 6,000 in one day.

### National Army's Battle Results in Anyang

### National Army Tightens Encirclement in Baoding and Mancheng Area

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 13th Dispatch] The national army in the Baoding and Mancheng area is tightening the encirclement and suppression in recent days.

### More Than One Million Refugees Flee from Communist-Controlled Areas in Northeast

All Parties are Calling for Relief

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th Dispatch] The increasing number of refugees from Communist-controlled areas in the Northeast who are fleeing to the recovered areas due to unbearable pressure from the Communist army has aroused deep concern among the general public. It is estimated that more than one million refugees have fled from Communist-controlled areas in the Northeast in the past year, mostly scattered in Changchun, Shenyang, Siping, and Jilin. About one-third of them have found employment or have entered schools, while the rest are still threatened by hunger and cold. Although the 1 billion yuan in legal tender previously allocated by the Executive Yuan has now been distributed, each person only receives 1,500 yuan in circulating coupons, which has little effect in the current soaring prices in the Northeast. All parties are calling for relief.

The National Army, advancing eastward from Zaoyuansi, clashed with the Communist Tenth Column near Mingyong on the 13th. The National Army on this route is taking a steady and cautious approach, focusing on clearing operations on both sides of the railway.

[Report from our Xuzhou Office, 13th] On the 13th, the Chinese National Army of Shandong continued its advance towards Boshan along two routes, making steady progress. After overcoming the communist First and Third Columns, numbering over 35,000, who put up resistance step-by-step in the mountainous terrain along the way, the right-wing National Army recaptured Miaoshanzhuang, 22 kilometers southwest of Boshan, on the morning of the 13th.

### Shang Zhen Visits MacArthur for Long Conversation; Far Eastern Commission to Replace Council of Foreign Ministers as a Negotiation Body for the Japanese Peace Treaty

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Shang Zhen, the new head of the Chinese mission to Japan, visited General MacArthur at 6:30 PM yesterday. This was Shang's first visit since arriving in Tokyo on May 10th. He was accompanied by the former head of the mission, Zhu Shimin, and the meeting lasted about an hour. Shang declined to disclose the content of the conversation but said that he enjoyed his meeting with MacArthur very much.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Diplomatic authorities here stated today that the Far Eastern Commission may break precedent and replace the Council of Foreign Ministers as the negotiating body for the Japanese peace treaty. It has not yet been decided which international organization should be used to conduct the negotiations. U.S. officials favor the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission, but the Soviet Union has repeatedly insisted that the major powers should decide the major post-war issues. It is reported that Britain and the United States favor the participation of representatives from countries that fought against Japan, such as Australia and Canada, from the beginning of the negotiations. When the four foreign ministers drafted peace treaties with European Axis satellites, these countries were excluded. The Potsdam Agreement of 1945 did not specifically entrust the four foreign ministers or the Far Eastern Commission to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. The Far Eastern Commission was established to deal with Japan, Korea, and other post-war issues in the Pacific region, and its authority has so far been limited to occupation issues. Since returning from Moscow, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall has given serious consideration to preparing for negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty, and MacArthur has also requested from Tokyo to accelerate the preparations.

### Burmese Returned Overseas Chinese Stranded in Guangzhou to Return Home Next Month

No Problem with Employment after Arriving in Burma

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th] The number of Burmese returned overseas Chinese stranded in Guangzhou waiting to return home has reached over 4,000. They have been staying in Guangzhou for more than a year. Initially, the Food Relief Administration provided accommodation and food, but this stopped a month ago. To date, apart from the 400 or so who are temporarily staying in the hostels, the rest are scattered everywhere, and their lives are very difficult. Overseas Chinese leaders in Guangzhou have repeatedly petitioned the authorities to negotiate with the Burmese government as soon as possible to decide on specific measures for repatriating the returned overseas Chinese. According to information from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, regarding the repatriation of Burmese overseas Chinese, the Burmese government, feeling that the post-war environment has changed, is deeply concerned that problems will arise with the lives of the overseas Chinese after they return to Burma. Therefore, it has delayed making a concrete decision. Recently, the Burmese Chinese Association guaranteed that there would be absolutely no problem with employment for the returned overseas Chinese after arriving in Burma. Therefore, the Burmese government has decided to approve the repatriation of overseas Chinese. The representative dispatched by Burma to China to handle the visa for the repatriation of overseas Chinese has already arrived in Xiamen. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has telegraphed the Burmese government, requesting that the representative handling the visa come to Guangzhou. According to reports, the Burmese government has already approved this request. Therefore, the repatriation issue of the Burmese returned overseas Chinese has been largely resolved in principle, and they may be able to return home next month.

### Hong Kong Requests Chinese Telecommunications Bureau to Switch to Landline Communications

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th] There are rumors that the Hong Kong government has notified the Chinese Telecommunications Bureau in Hong Kong to close down. According to Zou Maotong, Director of the Sixth District Telecommunications Administration, the Hong Kong side only requested that wireless communications be terminated at the end of May and switched to landline communications, but did not request closure. He personally went to Hong Kong for this matter and consulted with the Hong Kong Postmaster General on future communication methods. Zou said that China has been operating a telecommunications bureau in Hong Kong for more than 20 years, and has always used landline communications. After the war, due to the destruction of the landlines, the Hong Kong side agreed to temporarily use wireless communications. This time, the Hong Kong side's request is to restore the pre-war communication method. The landline from Guangzhou to Shenzhen within China has long been repaired. If the Hong Kong side can quickly repair the Hong Kong territory, it can be connected and pre-war conditions restored.

This order is unrelated to the previously supplied railway materials. [Report from our Nanjing Office, 13th] All members of the General Officer Class of the Central Training Corps made three specific requests to the Education Director Huang on the 13th: (1) The demobilization allowance should be issued according to the current standard (400,000 yuan per month for a major general).

It is requested that the government be asked to issue 10 million yuan to each person to purchase books, organize academic research associations, and engage in cultural activities. (3) The four tasks to be handled for each officer: retirement, career change, further study, and retention, should be decided and handled separately before the end of May.

### Philippines Plans to Amend Immigration Law, Further Restricting Entry of Overseas Chinese; Immigration Bureau to Submit to the President's Office

[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] The Philippine Immigration Bureau, in order to plan further restrictions on the entry of overseas Chinese into the Philippines, will soon submit several important amendments to the Immigration Law to the President's Office. The main amendments under consideration include (1) increasing the fee paid by foreigners traveling to the Philippines during the war, from US$500 to US$2,500. (2) Limiting tourists to the Philippines to a one-month stay, and issuing temporary visitor permits. (3) Temporarily prohibiting foreigners engaged in business from staying in the Philippines as temporary visitors. (4) Only foreigners who left the Philippines before the end of 1941 can obtain the special treatment for foreigners returning to the Philippines that is deserved. The new regulations for the entry of temporary visitors are intended to enable the government to check the activities of foreigners who originally entered the Philippines under temporary residence provisions. Current regulations allow temporary visitors to stay in the Philippines for one year, subject to a fee of US$500. Philippine Immigration Commissioner Fabre said that in order to curb the illegal entry of overseas Chinese, he has recommended the dispatch of two immigration investigation commissioners to Xiamen, Taiwan, and other Chinese ports.

[Associated Press, Manila, 13th] The Philippine Senate has opposed the passage of the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty, believing that some of its provisions are too generous. The Senate's opposition is led by Senate Government Party Leader and Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Francisco, who is scheduled to submit the committee's report on the 14th. According to Senate sources, while Francisco has consistently opposed the "generous provisions" in the agreement, it is doubtful whether he will win the support of a majority of the members of the Foreign Relations Committee. Although Francisco had the support of a majority of the members some time ago, the situation has changed, as it is rumored that the President's Office is insisting on the early ratification of the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty.

[United Press, Manila, 13th] The Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship is currently awaiting approval by the Philippine Senate. The members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee differ on the terms of the treaty. Today, Chairman Francisco submitted a "no recommendation" memorandum to Senate President Avelino, stating: The members of the Foreign Relations Committee are divided on whether to agree to the terms or strongly request that Article 5, which governs immigration measures, be amended. It is up to the entire Senate to "decide on this action to improve national security." Francisco himself also opposes approving the treaty, so the memorandum also states that Article 5 should be amended in accordance with the same terms in the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation concluded last year, so that the Philippines can freely enact laws to manage the entry of Chinese immigrants. However, international trade merchants from both countries should enjoy the same rights as the people of any third country.

### Several Basic Questions Regarding Athletic Meets

— Zhou Shang

The 7th National Games is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on Double Tenth Day (October 10th) this year, and preparations are in full swing. It was originally planned to be held in Beijing with a budget of 10 billion. In the autumn of post-war recovery, with everything waiting to be done, coupled with the economy being on the verge of bankruptcy, and everyone tightening their belts, there is naturally no such huge amount of idle money. Naturally, the authorities did not approve it. It was then changed to Shanghai to cope with the World Games next year, hoping to collect some ticket money to help cover expenses.

The original motive for this National Games was to cope with the World Games. Speaking of China's participation in the World Games, there is indeed a painful history full of emotion. Lesson drawn from the past can guide one in the future, so we should reflect deeply on the pain. The World Games was originally called the Summer Olympics, founded in ancient Greece more than 2,710 years ago. At that time, all four borders of Greece were enemies, and the government and people were under the oppression of strong neighbors. For the sake of defense, they vigorously promoted martial arts to cultivate the spirit of endurance, bravery, and combat. Turning the pages of Greek education history, the two major subjects of physical education and music dazzle our eyes. Just like in ancient China since the Shang and Zhou dynasties, education emphasized ritual, music, archery, and horsemanship. Greek music belonged to intellectual education, used to cultivate the people's patriotism and religious heart, and taught them by putting the words and deeds of heroes into musical canons. However, relying solely on music was not enough to resist insults, so physical education was used to train the national body. Therefore, athletic meets became a display of the people's health achievements for encouragement.

The athletic events included running, high jump, javelin, discus (made of metal or stone at the time, i.e., the current discus), and wrestling. These five competitions became the famous pentathlon, which was a very important thing in the Summer Olympics because a person who could excel in these five sports was an expert in all kinds of sports. These sports were very important to Greece, coming around every four years. The four-year period between two Summer Olympics was called "Olympiad." The requirements for participants in the Summer Olympics were extremely strict. They had to be citizens of pure Greek descent, and they had to have not violated religion and the state as prerequisites. All athletes had to be able to endure long-term hard training. Many young people dreamed of victory in the Summer Olympics on the track, so that they could receive the honorary reward of a wild olive wreath on their heads.

Today's World Games originated from the Summer Olympics. Unfortunately, over time, abuses arose, so the Roman Pope ordered it to be stopped in 394 AD. It was not until 1892 that Mr. Coubertin, a French expert in Greek literature, recognized the special contribution of the ancient Summer Olympics to culture and called for its revival, so the interrupted athletic meet was revived in 1896, and it continued to follow the ancient tradition. The 11th was held in Berlin in 1936, and China was invited to participate, not hesitating to spend 200,000 yuan and send a large team of people on the first long march of ten thousand miles.

The 139 representatives who participated in the Berlin World Games were miserably wiped out. Not to mention that the famous generals in various men's and women's races were eliminated, even the famous basketball team that had won against Peru could not compete. According to the report, we had 24 penalty shot opportunities, and we were asked to stand still and shoot the ball steadily, but who knew we missed every time. This shows that our physical strength is not as good as others, and our nerves are not stable or healthy!

If you want to know the purpose of athletic meets, you can get a full picture from Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Sixth National Games. He said: "The purpose of sports is to seek the average development of each individual's mind and body, so as to create a sound physique and a strong spirit. The purpose of competition is to cultivate the virtues of discipline, cooperation, courage, and obedience in regulated actions. …It should encourage the progress of the entire nation and revitalize the basic work of the nation… The great cause of national revival in the future should be built on the foundation of sports." The Soviet Union's athletic meets were mass physical performances, aimed at military preparation and increasing the height and weight of new recruits to the Red Army. They also admitted that "mass physical training is mass political training." No wonder at the last "Sports Day," Stalin and Molotov led 5,000 men and women from 16 Soviet republics in collective calisthenics in front of 50,000 people in Moscow, showing the world their healthy bodies.

After looking at the lessons of athletic meets from ancient times to the present and from China and abroad, we want to raise a few basic questions to alert everyone: (1) The purpose of sports is to train the body and cultivate the strength to defend the country; (2) We must cultivate a sporting atmosphere, so that social citizens and school students all have the habit of daily exercise; (3) We cannot expose ourselves to the sun for one day and then freeze for ten days. Society must provide more sports environments. The existing sports fields in Beijing and Shanghai should be used every day and be crowded with people. How can we discard them like worn-out shoes, let them be overgrown with weeds, with grass growing as tall as people, and iron locks rusting so they cannot be opened; (4) Schools should have qualified sports fields, and in the future, they should have gymnasiums and swimming pools. We can have fewer classrooms, but sports space cannot be lacking. We can have fewer books, but sports equipment must be available. Failure in sports still means not graduating; (5) Physical education teachers and sports supervisors must be cultivated in large numbers quickly, and all normal school graduates must be able to serve as physical education teachers.

Currently, the basic work at the bottom of the athletic meet is a major problem. Even the plan of the Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education has been shelved due to lack of funding. Then, should we continue to do superficial decoration that wastes money and manpower? The World Games requires the National Games to produce athletes, and the National Games relies on local athletic meets to produce athletes, plus training and re-election procedures. The funding for this series of activities is considerable, and I am afraid that 20 billion yuan is not enough. Shouldn't we save some funds to train more physical education teachers, add more sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and equipment, and do a few years of solid work to build the foundation of national life, and then attend the World Games is not too late? If we are not prepared at all, temporarily embracing the Buddha's feet, and perform another tragedy of total defeat with a tired and disabled body, it will inevitably turn from a deep wound into a "blood collapse and pus eruption." Wouldn't it be for the sake of face, but instead be burdened by face and lose all face? Why bother? The World Games is a performance ground for the national strength of various countries, so we really cannot help but work hard in a down-to-earth manner. This is not only for the World Games, but also the future of the nation depends on it.

### Socialist Party Opposes Expanding Government; Political Crisis Erupts in Italy; Gasperi Cabinet Submits Resignation

[This Newspaper] London, 13th Broadcasting: As the Italian Socialist Party and the Christian Democratic Party mutually blame each other for the collapse of the coalition government, Prime Minister Gasperi suddenly submitted his resignation to Interim President Nicola today.

[This Newspaper] London, 13th Broadcasting: Italian Minister of Public Works Romita declared that Prime Minister Gasperi and the cabinet will submit their resignations today. Romita told reporters after the end of the emergency cabinet meeting that Gasperi had decided to resign because the Socialist Party accused him of intentionally creating a political crisis. The Italian government has collapsed due to differences of opinion, the biggest reason being the national debt issue.

[United Press] Rome, 13th: Italian Prime Minister Gasperi has submitted his resignation today. Gasperi, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, has served as the Prime Minister of the coalition cabinet since December 1945. He recently visited the United States, hoping to obtain more economic support and reduce the burden of the Italian peace treaty. Gasperi expressed his intention to resign to the President this morning, and after convening an emergency cabinet meeting, he submitted the resignation of himself and the entire cabinet to the Italian President. The reason for the total resignation of the cabinet is that the Socialist Party does not agree with Gasperi's plan to invite all political parties to participate in expanding the cabinet. The Socialist Party itself is willing to merge with the Communist Party. Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party also attacked Gasperi's weakness and inability to get rid of the Communist Party.

All indications show that the United States is trying to weaken the power of the left wing in Italy. The US Ambassador to Italy declared: "The United States has never made any suggestions to Gasperi, and Gasperi has never inquired about any opinions from the United States." However, it is believed that Gasperi, after visiting the United States and meeting with President Truman and senior American officials, has decided to organize a government that excludes the Communist Party.

### Britain Clarifies Position on Greece; Troops Currently Not Withdrawing; American War Equipment Continuously Shipped to Greece

[Associated Press] London, 12th: A Foreign Office spokesman stated today that the US Congress's approval of the aid bill to Greece does not mean that all British troops stationed in Greece will automatically withdraw. These two issues are not necessarily related. Britain only intends to recall its economic delegation from Greece in July. However, according to the British-Greek agreement, 1,200 British army, navy, and air force representatives will remain stationed in Greece to continue training the Greek army. It is not yet known when other British troops stationed in Greece will "complete their mission." Britain supports Greece's amnesty for political prisoners, while also taking into account its internal security. However, the British government believes that it is doubtful whether recommending that the Greek government grant amnesty to the detained political prisoners falls within the scope of the mandate of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee.

[Reuters] Rome, 12th: The Italian news agency reports: American tanks, armored vehicles, and other war equipment, carried by the Greek ships "Ilthis" and "Babe," sailed to Greece from the Italian port of Livorno.

### Greek Anti-Communist Bill Submitted to Parliament for Discussion

[United Press] Athens, 12th: The National Assembly met today, and 30 members, led by Deputy Speaker Jiang Nadasi, proposed a bill to outlaw the Greek Communist Party, pointing out that the Communist Party's platform is to overthrow the government by violence, making it a party that endangers national interests. Liberal Party members expressed their opposition, believing that members do not have the right to propose important bills. Foreign Minister Tsaldaris believes that members have the right to propose any measures. However, the bill proposed by right-wing members is in conflict with the views of the US Embassy, which believes that forcing the Communist Party into an underground party will only increase its opposition forces, and that the actions of the government supported by the United States will be anti-democratic, even though it wants to join Western democratic countries. Congressional observers believe that the purpose of submitting this bill to the Congress now is to enact strong anti-communist measures before the arrival of the American delegation to Greece.

### Final Legislative Process for US Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill

[Reuters] Washington, 12th: The US aid bill to Greece and Turkey was submitted to the joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives today for final review. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on Friday. However, the Senate refused to accept the contents passed by the House of Representatives because it believed that the contents passed by the House of Representatives were different from the contents passed by the Senate. The purpose of today's meeting is to reconcile the two. The main difference between the two is only that the House bill has deleted the declaration of general policy in the introductory chapter of the bill, and the provision that the appointment of the head of the US mission to Greece and Turkey must be approved by the Senate. Therefore, it is expected that there will not be any difficulties during the discussion. [Agence France-Presse] Washington, 12th: Well-informed sources recently declared that President Truman may sign the aid bill to Greece and Turkey tomorrow afternoon.

### Korean Issue Enters Important Amendment Stage; US Submits Another Note to the Soviet Union; Whether Negotiations Can Resume Depends on Soviet Response

[US Information Service] Success Lake, 12th: The US Embassy in the Soviet Union was ordered today to submit a new note to the Soviet government regarding the resumption of the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea. A State Department spokesman said: This new note is a reply to the note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on May 8, and Molotov's note is a reply to the note from Secretary of State Marshall on May 2, regarding the restoration of the US-Soviet Commission in order to establish a Korean interim government in the US-Soviet occupied zones. The spokesman declined to comment on these notes, only saying: The new US note requires a response from the other party. Marshall's note on May 2 was the third note regarding the mission of the US-Soviet Joint Commission, outlining the US interpretation of the Moscow Agreement on the Korean issue. Marshall explained the US government's position, saying that the Commission should not refuse representatives from Korean democratic political parties and social organizations to participate in consultations when discussing the Korean interim government.

[Associated Press] Washington, 12th: Secretary of State Marshall today submitted a third note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, demanding that conditions be negotiated first before resuming the work of the US-Soviet Joint Commission. The full text of the note has not been released, but officials said that unless a satisfactory response is received, preparations for the resumption of negotiations in Seoul on May 20 will be shelved.

### Martial Law on Iraqi Border

[Reuters] Baghdad, 12th: The border area between Iraq and Iran has been declared under martial law because Kurds are crossing the border from Iran into Iraq in large numbers.

### Four-Power Commission Meets to Discuss Ways to Resolve Austrian Treaty

[Agence France-Presse] Vienna, 12th: The Austrian Treaty Commission met today at the Industry Building here to deal with the resolution of the Austrian issue. The first meeting was devoted to discussing the ways and procedures for handling the issue. Photographers were not allowed to enter the meeting. It is said that another meeting will be held tomorrow.

### Possible Further Changes to Senior US State Department Officials; Branden and Fenton May Also Resign

[Agence France-Presse] Washington, 12th: White House Press Secretary Ross recently told the press that Under Secretary of State Acheson has submitted his resignation, which has been approved by President Truman. The President plans to submit the name of former Assistant Secretary of the Army Lovett to the Senate as Acheson's successor in the near future. Acheson's resignation will take effect on June 30. According to well-informed sources, it is also possible that Assistant Secretaries of State Branden and Fenton will submit their resignations. Recently, Congress has severely criticized Branden and Fenton, believing that the former's policy towards Argentina is too firm, and the latter's handling of the State Department's intelligence and propaganda work is inappropriate. Acheson has always been a supporter of Branden, and his resignation will weaken Branden's position, especially since Lovett's policy towards South American countries is very different from Branden's, so his position will be even weaker. Acheson joined the State Department in 1941 as an Assistant Secretary, and was appointed Under Secretary of State by former Secretary of State Byrnes on August 16, 1945. After the death of former President Roosevelt, he strongly defended Byrnes' policy and the Truman Doctrine, and also tried his best to defend Secretary of State Marshall's attacks from Congress, so his position was very important. Defending his superiors was Acheson's main occupation, because important decisions were made by Byrnes, Truman, and Marshall, and Acheson had no power to make any policy decisions. Acheson was fluent, sincere, and repeatedly attended the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to advocate for loans to Britain and loans to Greece and Turkey. He made great contributions to the State Department. According to this question, people said: At present, it is still necessary to wait for Lovett to attend the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to determine whether he will continue the tradition of his predecessor after he is appointed Under Secretary of State. The US government has a tendency to leave important positions to soldiers or people who are familiar with military affairs, but the appointment of Lovett as Under Secretary of State seems to break this tendency, because Lovett is a banker. The liberal minority in the United States has repeatedly criticized the government for the excessive number of soldiers holding important positions at home and abroad.

### Cigarettes Made from Horse Manure

### Issue of Palestinian Independence Not Included in Investigation Agenda; UN Political Committee Passes French Proposal

[US Information Service] Success Lake, 12th: The UN Political Committee voted today to delete the provisions relating to Palestinian independence from the instructions to the special committee investigating the Palestinian dispute. This case was proposed by France. Before the vote, several speakers pointed out that this issue had already been stipulated in the previous agreement on the order to the investigation committee, that is, to grant the committee "the greatest power to identify the truth of the facts and investigate all issues and proposals related to Palestine." As a result of the vote, 29 countries voted in favor of the deletion, 14 countries voted against it, 10 countries abstained, and 2 countries were absent. Among the five powers, only the Soviet Union voted against it.

[Associated Press] Success Lake, 12th: The UN Political Committee's vote to avoid discussing independence by the Palestinian Fact-Finding Committee is a defeat for the Arab Group and a victory for the Jewish Congress. It caused a heated debate at the time, with spokespersons from both the Arab and Jewish sides using malicious words against each other. [Associated Press] Minneapolis, 12th: Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace said in a speech at a banquet of the Non-Partisan Voters Association: The National Anti-Communist Conference is a disgrace. President Truman's test of government officials' loyalty is also not an appropriate measure. Communists should also be regarded as human beings and should not be imprisoned. I recently traveled to Europe and found that everything is open and there is a healthy political climate in all countries. Therefore, I think the United States should be the same. Wallace continued that if the United States can weave freedom and let it move, then I will participate in the presidential migration.

### Difficulties Persist in Forming Japanese Cabinet - Opposition Party Dissatisfied with Socialist Party's Economic Policies - Choice of New Premier is the Biggest Problem

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] On the morning of the 13th, the Liberal Party held an executive meeting to review the results of the four-party secretary-general talks on the 12th. Regarding the emergency breakthrough plan for the economic crisis proposed by the Socialist Party, it was considered to be a socialist-based plan on the Socialist Party's side. A proposal closer to the Liberal Party must be drafted before consultations can proceed. Regarding the allocation ratio of cabinet ministers, Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio proposed that the Socialist Party would get the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Forestry, Minister of Transportation, and Minister of Health, a total of five ministers. The Liberal Party would get the Minister of Interior, Minister of Justice, Minister of Commerce and Industry, and two ministers without portfolio. The Democratic Party would get the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Communications, and three ministers without portfolio. The People's Cooperative Party would get the Minister of Education. At the same time, Secretary-General Nishio proposed that the positions of Cabinet Secretary and Director-General of the Legislative Bureau should be appointed by the Prime Minister from within the Socialist Party. At that time, Secretary-General Ono immediately reminded Nishio to pay attention to the attitude of organizing a coalition cabinet. There was no resolution in today's executive meeting.

[International News Service, Tokyo, 13th] According to observers, the biggest problem currently hindering the formation of a coalition cabinet is the selection of the cabinet leader. If the Socialist Party can use its flexible skills to obtain the consent of all parties for Tetsu Katayama to head the cabinet, then there should be no other thorny issues in the future of the coalition cabinet.

### UN Investigation Team on Greek Border Incidents – Soviet Union Proposes Reducing Powers and Recommends Moving Headquarters to Athens

[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] Tonight, the Soviet Union re-raised the issue of Greece at the UN Security Council. Soviet representative Gromyko spoke for 35 minutes, demanding a major reduction in the powers of the UN investigation team on the Greek border disputes, limiting it to the specific cases designated by the Balkan Investigation Committee, and moving the team's headquarters from Thessaloniki on the border to Athens. It is said that the presence of the commission in Thessaloniki may encourage the activities of some irresponsible and opportunistic elements in Greece, which is extremely dangerous from the perspective of maintaining local peace. Previously, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria refused to cooperate with the team, declaring their opposition to investigating their borders. With Soviet support, the case was raised in the Security Council tonight. The Security Council's Balkan Investigation Committee and the Greek border dispute investigation team are both organized by eleven member states. The investigation committee is now in Geneva, compiling reports to be submitted to the Security Council.

### Jiaotong University's Two Thousand Students Arrive at Zhenru by Truck - Minister of Education Rushes Over Late at Night to Persuade Them - Government Accepts All Demands, But Students Still Insist on Going to the Capital - North Railway Station in Turmoil All Day, Passengers on Two Lines Blocked

[Our Newspaper] More than 2,000 students from National Jiaotong University, in order to oppose the Ministry of Education's change of the school's name and the discontinuation of the navigation management and marine engineering departments, launched a large-scale petition movement to the capital yesterday. At eight o'clock in the morning, the students boarded forty-eight trucks and drove to the North Railway Station. After Mayor Wu heard the news, he rushed to the school in advance and tried his best to dissuade them, but to no avail. Vice Minister Tian Peilin of the Ministry of Education also rushed to Jiaotong University at the same time to meet with President Wu and convened a meeting of Dean Li, Dean Gu, the heads of various departments, and all professors and associate professors, with more than 80 people attending. In addition to Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Chairman Fang Zhi, Director Zhao Zengjue, and Director Gu Yuxiu were also invited to the school to discuss the matter. Mr. Tian, on behalf of Minister Zhu, gave the following affirmative replies to the demands made by the students of the school: (1) Jiaotong University will never change its name, and will never discontinue any departments. (2) The marine engineering department will be merged into the shipbuilding department, and the shipbuilding department will be renamed the shipbuilding and marine engineering department, which still belongs to the School of Engineering. The navigation department will be changed to the navigation management department, which belongs to the School of Management. (3) The school's funding will be increased according to actual needs, on par with other universities. (4) The number of employees will be increased according to regulations, based on the number of classes and students. (5) If there are any unfulfilled matters, teachers, students, and alumni can send representatives to the capital to discuss them in person. The above points were signed by Vice Minister Tian and President Wu, and all those present also signed, and Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Director Zhao, and Director Gu were jointly signed as witnesses to show solemnity. However, at this time, the students of the school were still gathering at the North Railway Station waiting for the train to prepare to go to the capital. Mayor Wu and others immediately rushed to the station to persuade them, and President Wu reported the five measures replied by Vice Minister Tian in writing and orally, and strongly urged the students to return to school. At the same time, the North Railway Station had also received a telegram from Nanjing, saying that Minister Zhu had decided to take a special plane from the capital to Shanghai with Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Education, which was expected to arrive around 2:00 PM. Mayor Wu and others persuaded the students to send representatives to meet Minister Zhu, but the students firmly refused to elect representatives and continued to wait at the station, demanding that Minister Zhu come to the station. The 6th train at 9:00 AM, the 8th express train at 11:00 AM, and the Jinling train at 1:30 PM were still able to leave Shanghai. All subsequent trains were blocked.

### President Writes Proclamation Urging Return to School and Resumption of Classes

At 2:00 PM, Minister Zhu and Vice Minister Ling of the Ministry of Education flew from the capital to Shanghai. Minister Zhu first went to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu, and Vice Minister Ling rushed to the North Railway Station, hoping to persuade the students to return to school in the capacity of an alumnus of Jiaotong University, and send representatives to meet Minister Zhu to discuss everything, but it was still ineffective. At about 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Secretary-General Wu Shaoshu, Commander Xuan, and others went from the North Railway Station to the Municipal Government to discuss solutions with Minister Zhu, and then rushed back to the North Railway Station at 4:30 PM. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Secretary-General Wu, and others acted as mediators and solemnly declared to the students that Minister Zhu had agreed that Jiaotong University would never change its name and allowed the Department of Marine Engineering to be independent. At that time, President Wu Baofeng of Jiaotong University personally wrote a large proclamation, which was posted at the station with eight points: (1) Minister Zhu has allowed the school to set up the Department of Marine Engineering independently. (2) All other clauses discussed and decided by Vice Minister Tian and the school's professor meeting have been fully agreed to by Minister Zhu. (3) The purpose of the student's movement to protect the school has been fully achieved. (4) If the students still need to see Minister Zhu, Minister Zhu is allowed to meet with student representatives at the Central Research Institute on Qiqi Road. (5) Now that the school protection movement has been completed, the school's students should immediately withdraw from the station and return to school and attend classes tomorrow morning. (6) Those who have not left the station by 9:00 PM today or who do not attend class tomorrow morning will be expelled from school.

To maintain the school's reputation. Wu Baofeng, President of Jiaotong University. In addition, the content of the proclamation was broadcast through loudspeakers to ensure that all students knew it. However, the students not only did not comply, but their emotions became more intense and insisted on going to the capital to petition. The station's loudspeakers were also destroyed, and the student representatives could no longer convey the opinions of both parties, and it seemed that there was no way to resolve the situation.

### Students Drive the Train Forward

The students then boarded the train and the students drove the locomotive themselves, leaving the North Railway Station and heading forward. The responsible authorities of the city, in order to prevent the situation from escalating, asked the railway bureau to notify the students that there were sections of track ahead that had been dismantled, hoping that the students would not drive forward automatically. At the same time, in order to prevent any eventuality, Commander Xuan ordered a warning and sent all the passengers waiting for the train out of the station, and the North Railway Station implemented a full curfew inside and outside. After a while, Li Jun, the head of the 4th Regiment of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, led all the officers and soldiers of the 2nd Battalion of the regiment to the station. At the same time, the police team of the police station and the military police company of the North Railway Station had arrived at the station to perform warning tasks respectively. The 2nd Battalion of the Youth Army took a special train to the vicinity of Maigen Road Station to dissuade them from moving forward. It was already 7:00 PM. At about 9:00 PM, President Wu, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, and alumni of Jiaotong University, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun, Director Zhao Zukang, Director Zhao Zengyu, and professors, etc., rushed to Maigen Road Station one after another, persuading them bitterly, and the alumni association specially prepared dozens of public transport buses to take the students back. At the same time, President Wu distributed 2,000 copies of the printed proclamation separately, so that the students could understand the content and have a final consideration. However, the students were still unable to accept the advice because the leaders were absent, and they installed the dismantled tracks and continued to drive. By 12:00 PM, the train had arrived near Zhenru. The railway bureau dismantled the tracks west of Zhenru to prevent the train from continuing to move forward. Mayor Wu and others left Maigen Road Station to the Central Research Institute to discuss with Minister Zhu. Minister Zhu said that the president had issued a solemn proclamation and should follow it. He was very concerned about the students driving to Zhenru automatically, and took a car to Zhenru at 1:30 AM late at night to give a speech to the students and persuade them to return to Shanghai. However, as of press time, the students still showed no signs of returning to school.

Jinan University Students Rush to North Railway Station

Another report: One hundred and fifty to sixty students from Jinan University, in order to support the petition of Jiaotong University students, lined up and went to the North Railway Station last night. They arrived at 10:30 PM. The police officers responsible for the alert did not stop them at the time. The students of Jinan University only learned after entering the station that the students of Jiaotong University had driven away from the North Railway Station and were blocked at Maigen Road Station. The students of Jinan University first tried to walk along the railway line to Maigen Road Station, but were stopped by the police authorities, so they withdrew from the North Railway Station at 11:00 PM and prepared to go to Maigen Road Station by detour. Facilitating Beijing-Shanghai Transportation [Our Newspaper] China Airlines, seeing that the Beijing-Shanghai railway transportation was cut off, in order to facilitate passengers in both places, decided late last night that today's Beijing-Shanghai round-trip passenger planes, in addition to the regular ones, will add three more flights each, the times are as follows: Shanghai to Nanjing, (1) 9:40 AM, (2) 1:10 PM, (3) 4:50 PM. Nanjing to Shanghai (1) 11:20 AM, (2) 3:00 PM, (3) 6:40 PM.

### Students Pull Whistles - Persuasion Unsuccessful

[Our Newspaper's Latest News] At 2:10 AM this morning, Minister Zhu, accompanied by Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Ling Hongxun, Gu Yuxiu, and others, took a car to the Jiaotong University Petition Group's parking place (about one mile east of Zhenru), separated by a deep ditch, and broadcast to the train with loudspeakers and searchlights. Mr. Zhu said in his speech that he had already agreed to the requests of the students and hoped that they would return to school quickly and not be obsessed with their mistakes. Mayor Wu and President Wu's alumni representative Zhao Zukang also added persuasion one after another. The students were silent at first, and then pulled the whistles tightly, as if protesting. Until 3:15 AM, there was still no result.

### China Merchants Bureau Purchases US Tugs - Solid Hull and Perfect Equipment - Customs Sends Personnel to Inspect

[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau purchased a total of more than 100 ships, including US repair ships, pontoons, iron barges, crane ships, and ocean tugs in the Philippines. Of the ocean tugs that have arrived in Shanghai, there are 18, of which three were allocated to the Supply Bureau and 15 were retained. Some are still under repair.

### Li Shengwu's Suspected Treason Case: High Court Summons Xia Zhongming to Inquire About the Takeover of the Shanghai Special District Court; Capital High Court Sends Letter to Investigate Five Points

[Our Reporter] Xia Zhongming, former Vice Minister of the puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, was summoned by the High Court yesterday afternoon to testify. This was due to a letter from the Capital Higher Court, which stated in brief: "This court is handling the retrial of the case of Li Shengwu's suspected treason. According to the defendant, the Action Committee for Taking Over the Shanghai Special District Court was established in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] by the puppet Executive Yuan, which appointed Wang Hanzhang, the puppet Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, as its convener, and had nothing to do with the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration. The defendant secretly delayed and sabotaged the takeover, procrastinating for as long as half a year. Later, Wang Jingwei issued a hand order to cancel the committee, and Li Shiqun sent Xia Zhongming and others with armed forces to assist the Japanese military police in forcibly taking over the court. Regarding (1) the date of the takeover of the French Concession and the International Settlement; (2) whether Xia Zhongming participated in the takeover; (3) whether the takeover was carried out under the order of the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration; (4) whether the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration sent personnel to participate in the takeover; and (5) detailed information on the takeover process." The above five points are requested to be investigated by our Municipal High Court. According to Xia Zhongming's testimony yesterday, "When Li Shengwu served as the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration, I served as an inspector in the puppet Police Administration Department and often lived in Nanjing. I did not take over the Shanghai Special District Court. However, I later heard that Geng Jiaji and the French national Du Ge were sent to take over, which is all on record." He claimed to know nothing about other circumstances. After completing his testimony, he was returned to custody in the detention center.

### Gradually Decreasing Base Salary System; Wu Kaixian Explains the Calculation Method

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, an evening newspaper reported that the cost of living index for this month has been determined to be 15,000 times, but Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau refuted the rumor, calling it absurd. Director Wu said: It is currently only mid-May, so how could the May index be available? The cost of living index for April was approximately 14,800 times, which was proposed as a reference when discussing the unfreezing [of salaries]. The index for this month will inevitably increase compared to that. Regarding the explanation of the progressively decreasing discount of 10% for each 10 yuan increment above the base salary of 30 yuan, it means that those below 30 yuan will be paid according to the full index, those from 30 yuan to 40 yuan will be calculated at 90%, those from 40 yuan to 50 yuan will be calculated at 80%, those from 50 yuan to 60 yuan will be calculated at 70%, those from 60 yuan to 70 yuan will be calculated at 60%, those from 70 yuan to 80 yuan will be calculated at 50%, those from 80 yuan to 90 yuan will be calculated at 40%, and those from 90 yuan to 100 yuan will be calculated at 30%. Those above 100 yuan will all be calculated at 30%.

### After Dealing with the Jiaotong University Student Unrest, Minister Zhu Will Fly to the Capital Today; The Ministry Absolutely Has No Intention to Rename Jiaotong University

[Our Reporter] After Minister Zhu Jiahua's speech to the students of Jiaotong University in Zhenru late last night, he is scheduled to fly back to Nanjing this morning due to important official business. It is reported that Minister Zhu will instruct Principal Wu to handle the students who are unwilling to return to school according to the announcement.

[Another Report] The students of National Jiaotong University went on strike the day before yesterday. After repeated persuasion by the Ministry of Education proved ineffective, the students gathered at the train station again yesterday morning, demanding to take the train to the capital to petition. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua attached great importance to this upon hearing the news and flew to Shanghai from the capital yesterday afternoon. After getting off the plane, he held discussions with various parties and instructed Wu Baofeng, the president of Jiaotong University, to order the students to leave the station and return to school immediately to earnestly rectify education and maintain social order. At the same time, he sent representatives to talk with the Academia Sinica. When the students refused to comply, Zhu then told Principal Wu, "(1) The students are gathering in crowds and occupying the station, obstructing traffic and acting excessively. They should be ordered to return to school immediately to earnestly rectify education and maintain social order. (2) The two specialized subjects of marine engineering and driving at Jiaotong University were originally temporarily handled by Jiaotong University during the Anti-Japanese War because the Wusong Merchant Marine School, which was relocated to Chongqing, caused trouble and was suspended. Last year, the specialized school was restored, and the ministry ordered that it be managed by that school again. In terms of the school system, this is extremely reasonable. He barely acceded to the Shanghai authorities' and local people's concern for the security of Shanghai and temporarily allowed the school's School of Management to add a maritime management department, and the School of Engineering to add a marine engineering department. As for the two specialized subjects, they will still be handled according to the previous order until each class graduates. (3) Regarding the rumors of renaming Jiaotong University, etc., the Ministry absolutely has no such intention. Principal Wu has already stated this on record. Moreover, the Ministry has always valued the long history and past achievements of Jiaotong University and will spare no effort to seek the development of the school. The facts are all there, and they are well known to the alumni of the school."

### Medical Education Conference Discusses the System of Medical and Pharmaceutical Education Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The Medical Education Conference continued to be held at the Ministry of Education all day on the 13th, with 78 to 88 people attending. Chairman Liu Ruiheng presented the review results of the six groups of medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing, midwifery, and health education. After that, the conference conducted a comprehensive discussion, added opinions separately, and conducted a detailed study of the academic system curriculum and implementation of medical and pharmaceutical education. Regarding "medical education," both the United Kingdom and the United States admit university graduates and then study for another four years before practicing medicine. China, in order to suit the national conditions, could not adopt a dual-track system, on the one hand, to increase the years of advanced study in medical colleges from a theoretical point of view, and on the other hand, to train medical personnel through specialized and specialized fields from a practical point of view. Only a single-track system can be implemented to cultivate universally applicable medical personnel to meet social needs. Regarding "medical education," in the vertical aspect, such as medical colleges and vocational medical schools for specialties and nurses and midwives, a three-track system is adopted due to the different levels. In the horizontal aspect, attention is paid to the mutual connection and cooperation of medical schools at all levels to achieve balanced development. In addition, after the revision of the curriculum textbook standards for medical education, medical talents can be increased and improved in the future.

The Hong Kong team took the lead with a score of 3 to 2 in the first half. There were more than 8,000 spectators, and the atmosphere was not enthusiastic.

After 14 minutes, Grinas shot a cold arrow from 25 yards away, and the Hong Kong goal was breached, making it 1-1.

Novgorod's corner kick was sent in, and Mallory flicked it in front of the goal, chasing the score to 4-5. However, the good times did not last. In less than a minute, Zhaorong blocked a gap, and Jin Hai scored a goal, making it 6-4.

### Representatives of the Yingtze University Petitioning Delegation Came to Shanghai Yesterday to State Their Position; They Would Rather Disband If the School Relocation Issue Is Not Resolved

[Our Reporter] The Yingtze University petitioning delegation, which was blocked halfway during its trip to the capital, was persuaded by Chairman Shen and Director Li of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allow the students to send ten representatives to the capital first, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Yingtze University petitioning delegation, in view of the fact that previous petitioning representatives have returned without success, will no longer suffer oppression and wear and tear in this petitioning endeavor. Specifically, representatives Huang Chuqing and Dong Fuguan were dispatched to Shanghai yesterday to state the position of all students of the school to the newspapers. The main points are as follows: (1) School site issue: absolutely leave Jinhua. If the Ministry of Education still does not consider a solution, they would rather disband and will never give up halfway. (2) Principal issue: The Ministry of Education has repeatedly stated that the principal has already been internally appointed, but it is incomprehensible why the appointment has been delayed. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education will immediately announce the new principal's choice when the representatives arrive in the capital. (3) Restoration of the Medical School: This time, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education has explained to the petitioning representatives of Chinese universities across the country that the Ministry of Education has not specified that the Chinese Department of the Yingtze University Medical School will no longer enroll students. Therefore, the school should be returned to Yingtze University from today and start enrolling students during the summer vacation this year.

### Renewed Confidence as Monetary Conditions Ease; Chinese Stocks Surge Again; Four Banks and Two Bureaus Inject Over 30 Billion

With the resumption of telegraph services and the easing of monetary conditions, confidence was restored in the Chinese stock market yesterday.

Di Yong Yarn approached its limit up, numbers 152 and 228 sold off, slightly rebounding near closing, with slightly lower bids after closing. In the end, compared to the previous closing prices, Xin He, Mei Ya, Xin Guang, Jing Fu, Qin Xing, and Xin Hua hit their limit up, Yong Yarn rose by one percent, and Yong Gong rose slightly less than one percent.

Lian An's new shares are scheduled to resume trading on the morning of the 15th, with a trading unit of 10,000 shares.

### Government Bonds Rebound

Government bonds rebounded yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 12,100 yuan in the morning. Although room 360 sold off, rooms 503 and Run De bought in, pushing prices up to 14,400 yuan at the close. In the end, compared to the previous closing prices, Jia and Yi rose by 1,400, Tong Bing rose by 2,200, Ding rose by 1,600, and Wu also rose by 1,000 yuan, with approximately 7 million in transactions. In the afternoon, off-market bids rose to around 15,500 yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Gradually Recover

Foreign stocks fluctuated with the Hong Kong exchange rate yesterday, initially rising before retreating mid-session. Yi Yarn opened at 61,000 yuan, rising from 63,500 yuan before falling to 57,000 yuan. It hovered around 59,000 yuan at the midday close. In the afternoon, it gradually recovered to close at 68,000 yuan. Securities brokers first bought and then sold, while Guang and Bei brokers bought in. Retail investors sold. Rubber stocks were actively traded. In the end, compared to the previous closing prices, Yi Yarn, Hang Ye, and Gang Ye each rose by 30%, Zhi Ye rose by 20%, and the remaining stocks rose by 10% to 15%.

### Tea Market Lacks Vitality

The foreign-managed tea market, which has been sluggish for a long time, continued to be dull yesterday due to the persistent lack of buying interest, with little actual trading. The future outlook is precarious. As for red and green teas exclusively for domestic sale, the process remains stable, as supply and demand are balanced, with little fluctuation in sentiment and prices similar to the previous day.

### Implementation of Rice Rationing for Public and Educational Personnel; Social Affairs Bureau Preparing Quickly; Limited Rice Arrivals and Rising Asking Prices Yesterday

[Our Correspondent] Since the authorities decided to ration rice monthly to teachers and staff of private primary and secondary schools in the city, boarding students in public and private universities and secondary schools, factory workers, and the poor, the Social Affairs Bureau has stopped selling 9,000 bags of white japonica rice daily on the market since the 12th. The Social Affairs Bureau will publish the application form formats for rice rationing for schools and factories in the newspapers today. Schools and factories can then prepare the forms according to these formats and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau. Mr. Wu Kaixian acknowledged that rice prices might fluctuate during the period before the cessation of rice sales and before the implementation of rice rationing, so the Social Affairs Bureau is preparing the rationing as quickly as possible. Due to the urgency, the rationing and sale may be implemented before the official document from the Food Administration arrives. Yesterday, 2,997.5 shi of rice arrived at the North City Market, and 887 shi arrived at the South City Market. Asking prices rose compared to the previous day, with prices in the South City being higher than those in the North City. High-quality white japonica rice was priced at 310,000 yuan, medium-quality at 305,000 yuan, and low-quality at 300,000 yuan. High-quality Bo Dao rice was priced at 305,000 yuan, medium-quality at 300,000 yuan, and low-quality at 295,000 yuan. High-quality early rice was priced at 293,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan, and low-quality at 285,000 yuan. High-quality Yang Xian rice was priced at 300,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 295,000 yuan. High-quality Bai Yuan rice was priced at 310,000 yuan, medium-quality at 300,000 yuan, and low-quality at 290,000 yuan. High-quality Yin Yuan rice was priced at 305,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 294,000 yuan.

Another report: Yesterday, more than 2,000 rice shops in the city were operating as usual. Most replenished their stocks to meet retail demand. Sources have not yet increased significantly, and the market situation is tight.

The flour market was initially firm but then retreated, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales remained strong, with prices rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Oil cakes and miscellaneous grains declined successively. Soybean cake transactions were very sluggish, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans weakened further by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, corn decreased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and red sorghum continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Sesame sales were sluggish, plummeting by 10,000 yuan, with few buyers. Raw peanuts sales were sluggish, falling by 20,000 yuan. The oil market was in a slump, continuing to fall. Soybean oil plummeted by 20,000 yuan, and raw oil fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan due to small recoveries in Qingdao. Sesame oil, clear oil, and rapeseed oil all saw sharp declines of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

### Request for Demolition of Japanese Cement Factories; Satisfactory Outcome; Awaiting Formulation of a Plan to Submit to the Reparations Committee

[Our Correspondent] The National Cement Industry Association, in order to petition the government to negotiate the demolition of Japanese cement factories to be used as reparations to benefit reconstruction, dispatched representatives last Friday to Jinling to petition the Executive Yuan, the Political Yuan Reparations Committee, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Resources Committee.

According to Mr. Xi Zhengxiu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Association who participated in the petition, speaking to reporters yesterday: The outcome of this trip was very satisfactory. The Association's petition was based on two points: (1) The Japanese cement industry had 38 factories before the war, with an annual output of 40 million barrels. Its own consumption was only half of this, and the rest was mainly sold to our country and the South Sea Islands. (2) If domestic order is restored, a large amount of cement will be needed during the construction period, and the current domestic production capacity cannot meet this demand.

Based on the above reasons, the government was requested to do two things: (1) Negotiate with the Far Eastern Reparations Committee to include Japanese cement factories in the scope of reparations. (2) Order the representative stationed in Japan to promptly issue a statement to the Allied Headquarters stating that our country should retain the right to request the demolition and compensation of the remaining Japanese cement industry equipment.

As a result of the petition, the Political Yuan Reparations Committee has agreed to consult with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Resources Committee to formulate a plan. Then, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will instruct our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, to formally negotiate with the Far Eastern Reparations Committee.

### Allocation Plan for Coal Used by Factories in May Approved

[Our Correspondent] The second meeting of the Civil Coal Allocation Committee was held at the Fuel Management Committee yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Representatives from the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the Garrison Headquarters, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Coal Industry, the Machine-made Coal Ball Industry, and the Inland River Shipping Industry attended. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Zhang Shanyang, Deputy Director of the Fuel Management Committee, and adjourned at around 6:00 PM after discussing more than ten cases. The allocation plan for 15,000 tons of coal for factory use in May was approved. Due to time constraints, the allocation for this month will still be distributed according to the original allocation plan of the Fuel Management Committee. The improved allocation plan will be discussed in a small group meeting to be held this Friday or Saturday, and once approved, it will be implemented next month.

### Central Bank Explains How to Identify 5,000 Yuan Counterfeit Bills

Recently, counterfeit bills have flooded the market, and the types have been increasing from time to time. It has been reported that among the 2,000 yuan bills of the grass-green version issued by the Central Bank in 1947, many have been found to have been altered to 5,000 yuan bills with the same pattern and color. The identification of this type of counterfeit bill is very obvious: (1) The paper quality of genuine bills is better. (2) The middle of the "3" in the serial number on the front is slightly red. (3) The "5" character on counterfeit bills is fuzzy and not glossy. (4) Genuine bills were printed in 1945, while counterfeit bills were printed in 1947. (5) The bottom of genuine bills has the words "Central Printing Plant," while counterfeit bills have the words "Central Printing Plant Shanghai Plant." (6) The signatures of the Director and Deputy Director on the back of genuine bills are "Li Junbang" and "Yin Fu," while those on counterfeit bills are "Liang Ping" and "Chen Tingzuo." (7) The "2000" on the back of genuine bills is in round font, while that on counterfeit bills is in square font.

### Disposition of Raw Silk Material Pending Final Decision

[Our Correspondent] It is understood that the number of silk factories in the country is more than double the amount of raw materials, making allocation very difficult. The Silk Cocoon Production and Sales Guidance Committee has held two meetings to discuss the matter, but has not been able to make a final decision. It is reported that the revised measures are currently being consulted with the silk reeling guilds of the Third District. It is understood that the silk reeling guilds of the Third District held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, attended by Chu Fucheng, Leng Yuqiu, and others. Once definite opinions are obtained, they will be submitted by the Silk Guidance Association for a final decision.

[Another report] The third meeting of the Silk Cocoon Production and Sales Guidance Committee is scheduled to be held at the China Silk Company at No. 216 Laobaizi Road at 10:00 AM today. The main agenda items are to review the qualifications of silk factories applying for cocoon and silk loans and to approve the amount of cocoons to be purchased. The Shanghai Cigarette Factory Industry Association believes that the government's current foreign exchange allocation for tobacco leaves is still 8 million US dollars, a meager amount that is insufficient for the needs of the various cigarette factories in the city. In addition to petitioning the authorities for leniency, it also convened a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss how to allocate this 8 million US dollars of tobacco leaves among the 93 cigarette factory members. After deliberation, it was decided to form a small committee to handle the matter in a unified manner. Yao Shushen, Zhang Yuwen, and eight others were immediately elected as committee members, and it is planned to petition the authorities to allow the association to directly obtain foreign exchange on behalf of the cigarette factories in production. Before approval is obtained, all tobacco leaf raw materials purchased by import companies must be sold to officially producing cigarette factories and must not flow into the hands of non-industry persons to avoid hoarding and speculation and affecting the proper production of cigarettes.

### Calm Silk Market; Weak Silk Fabrics

The rayon market was extremely stable yesterday. No. 120 Kosan Yukari opened at 5.78 million yuan. Due to the state of demand exceeding supply, the asking price gradually increased, reaching 6.3 million yuan for a deal of one case, with the closing price being 6.2 million yuan. There were no transactions in the afternoon. The closing price was 16 million yuan, 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day.

The silk market remained calm. Although monetary conditions were tight, asking prices did not easily fall, especially for A-grade silk, which was quite scarce on the market. Calculating the cost, it was beyond the 20 million mark, so the asking price yesterday was still 20 million yuan, with no transactions. C-grade silk was priced similarly to the previous day, but the payment terms were all five- to seven-day promissory notes. Dried silk, another name for inferior silk, was only asking for 13 million yuan, but there were no buyers.

Silk fabrics were uniformly weak. Quilt covers fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in asking price. Da Cheng checked crepe was priced at 26,500 yuan to 27,000 yuan, 2,600 yuan less than the previous day. The reason was that monetary conditions were quite tight, and all parties were willing to cut losses to sell, which led to this situation. Hang goods, such as Hang silk gauze, were reported to be lower in Hang City, and transactions in Shanghai City were very scarce, so yesterday's price fell by 1,000 yuan per tael.

### Industry Peers Absorbing Raw Materials

[Our Correspondent] Due to tight monetary conditions for factories, familiar raw materials have become sluggish in the raw materials market. Unfamiliar raw materials have been imported at very high prices, so industry peers are absorbing them. According to industry insiders, raw material prices are rising daily. Even if imports can be cleared smoothly, they are still more than twice as low as the current Shanghai prices. For example, Vaseline is a popular item for summer sales. The current import price is 9.5 to 10 US cents per pound, and with shipping costs and interest converted, the cost has reached more than 5,000 yuan, so ordering from abroad is not as cost-effective as absorbing spot goods.

### Jute Bags Trend Upward

[Our Correspondent] With more goods being shipped from Shanghai to other ports, and with the cocoon season approaching, the use of jute bags is increasing, and actual sales are becoming more frequent. Indian 2.5-pound green line bags have risen to 33,000 yuan per bag, 3-line No. 1 bags to 14,000 yuan, and white line No. 1 bags to 14,000 yuan.

### Request for Flexible Measures for the Transportation and Transshipment of Yarn and Cloth

[Our Correspondent] The Cotton Spinning Industry Association of the Sixth District held a general membership meeting of yarn mills with more than 4,000 spindles yesterday. After discussion, two important motions were passed: (1) Passed the motion to subscribe to 10 million US dollar price coupons. (2) Since the Executive Yuan promulgated three measures to suppress yarn and cloth prices, the transportation and transshipment of yarn and cloth between Shanghai and the interior has been completely paralyzed. It was resolved to request the association to send a letter to the Textile Management Committee, within ten days, to formulate alternative measures to ease the industry's difficulties.

Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves in Principle

[Our Correspondent] According to the Textile Management Committee, the general principles of the yarn and cloth transshipment measures have been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Implementation rules must now be drafted based on these general principles, and they will be announced and implemented soon.

### Import and Export Association Resolves Four Important Cases

[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association recently held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, resolving four cases:

(1) The National Bank requires that all foreign exchange entrusted for sale must be settled by the 24th of this month. Many members of the fur industry have not been able to sell their goods due to the sluggish overseas market. They plan to request the National Bank to extend the deadline. Resolution: Jointly apply with the association to the National Bank and the relevant authorities to request the cancellation of the deadline. If necessary, send representatives to petition the relevant authorities.

(2) It is heard that the chain system still needs to be exchanged between the export and import authorities. It is hoped that the authorities will adopt it so that the current situation of the industry can be rapidly improved.

(3) Hold a preparatory meeting to generate representatives for the general membership meeting. The preparatory meeting will be held in six sessions, with representatives generated at the end of this month and the beginning of next month. The date of the representative general membership meeting will be decided at the next meeting of directors and supervisors. There will be approximately 340 representatives.

(4) Compile a membership directory to be completed by the end of this month.

### Industrial and Commercial World Third Issue Published

The third issue of "Industrial and Commercial World," published by Pan Shihao and edited by Yuan Bairi, was published yesterday. In addition to the two major features written by experts, "The 10,000 Yuan Note" and "The Future of Rice," there are also several insider news stories. The price per copy is 2,000 yuan.

### Applications for the Second Quarter's Quota Allocation Reach Over 15,000

[Our Correspondent] The reporter visited the Quota Allocation Office of the Import and Export Control Committee yesterday and asked many questions. The relevant person in charge of the office provided explanations, the main points of which are recorded as follows: (1) The quota allocation for the first quarter has been completed to 90%, and the quota allocation for the second quarter is currently underway. To date, a total of over 15,000 applications have been received, with a total application amount of 630 million US dollars. (2) In the past, the review of the qualifications of importers and the allocation of import quotas were generally based on statistical data from 1946. Since this method is more favorable to importers in Shanghai, all regions across the country have been asked to provide other reference materials (such as pre-war import quantities), which will be adjusted for fairness. (3) The reason why imported goods must be operated by importers: (a) Importers can also regulate and supply various imported goods needed by inland manufacturers. (b) Importers approved for registration are qualified to operate the import business according to the regulations. (4) Although the application for importer qualifications has been closed, the following two types of importers can still apply for registration and await approval: (a) Importers established before the war with business operations. (b) Exclusive agents of famous foreign manufacturers. (5) To avoid importers ordering imported raw materials that do not meet the needs of general manufacturers, the office has prepared a detailed list of the quotas for various imported goods and the quotas allocated to each approved importer and sent it to the Industrial Association for reference and overall consultation. Before issuing permits, the office also requires each importer to provide a contract for the sale of its imported goods to various manufacturers to prove it. Therefore, the difficulty of importing goods that do not meet actual needs can be easily resolved.

### A Complete Picture of Hefei

— Urgent Dispatch from the 2nd. Our Hefei Reporter, Bai Ping

Today, Hefei, though the political center of Anhui Province, and with no confirmed date for the provincial capital to return to Anqing, is dilapidated and old. The progress since the initial victory two years ago has been very limited. The people living here are waiting for the construction of Hefei. However, at present, construction is out of the question. In principle, the provincial capital is still to be moved back to Anqing. The provincial government has some reservations about building up the current capital, Hefei. Let the reporter sketch a brief outline of Hefei and wish it rapid progress from now on.

Within Cultural Circles – An Utterly Desolate Scene

Let's first take a stroll through the cultural landscape. Hefei currently has four daily newspapers and one weekly newspaper. The "Wan Bao" and "Anhui Daily" are broadsheets, each publishing one sheet daily. The "Hefei Daily" and "Gongzheng Bao" are quarto-sized, each publishing one sheet daily. The "Xiaoyao Jin Weekly" is a quarto-sized publication of four pages per issue. None of these five newspapers are purely privately owned, but they all suffer from the same malnutrition. They are short on staff and short on money, relying solely on the hard work of "active duty" personnel. There are four news agencies: Jianxing, Chaoran, Minben, and Huazhong, which release news dispatches daily. Since the implementation of emergency economic measures, the pressure from high prices has intensified their struggle. There are over a dozen bookstores, large and small, with sluggish business and deserted entrances. These bookstores mainly sell books and periodicals published in Shanghai. In Hefei, prices are high, and making money is difficult. Most of those who love to read newspapers are poor scholars, while the wealthy lack the time and interest. There are many who browse in bookstores without buying, but very few actually open their wallets to purchase. There are also several establishments that specialize in renting and selling books, and their business seems slightly better than that of bookstores. Unfortunately, most of the rentals are illustrations from "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin." There is still no sign of fresh publications, which is a great disappointment for book and newspaper enthusiasts.

Speaking of the publishing industry, it's even more pitiful. "Anhui Politics," "Anhui Literature," "Anhui Health," and "New Learning Style" are all published by government agencies, each providing theoretical analysis and publicity for their respective areas of responsibility. These periodicals are almost always difficult to produce. Printing conditions limit them, and funding is also a major issue. In this situation, trying to find a publication purely for the sake of culture is like "wearing out straw sandals with no place to be found."

There are also organized music and drama groups here, but there are no professional workers. Instead, these are amateur activities by civil servants. Due to time and economic constraints, there has never been a public performance. For example, a month ago, the newspaper reported on the upcoming performance of "Sunrise," but to this day, it remains silent and unseen.

Construction – Willing Heart, Powerless Hands

It is said that when the provincial government moved to Hefei after the victory, there were plans to improve the streets of Hefei. I heard that the plan was quite ambitious. If implemented, many houses would have to be demolished, and the streets would be wide and flat, allowing Hefei to make more than a decade's worth of progress. However, more than a year has passed, and apart from a few streets where the original, chaotic rubble has been replaced with pebble-paved dirt roads, the rest remains uneven and bumpy, making walking difficult. This is naturally not because the construction authorities are unwilling to work hard. They understand the people's situation, but there are too many difficulties in implementing the plans. Liu Yiyan, the director of the Construction Department, once told reporters: "The government itself has no money. There are very few wealthy merchants in Hefei. Rebuilding the streets would bankrupt many people. If merchants voluntarily demolish their houses and improve the streets, I would absolutely welcome it, but I cannot order them to do so forcefully. Since the victory, the people have been deeply impoverished. We can only make do for now, especially since the provincial capital is not permanently located here." This is the main obstacle to building Hefei!

Money is needed in peacetime, money is needed in wartime, and money is also needed after victory. Since the victory, the construction of the nation has begun, and the first thing needed is construction funds. However, what is lacking today is precisely money. There are two major problems in Hefei that urgently need to be solved: the drinking water problem and the lighting problem. However, due to the money problem, these cannot be resolved. Hefei is long from east to west and short from north to south. The people who built the city in the past diverted the river outside the east gate (connected to Chaohu Lake) to the west of the city, perhaps to address the city's drinking water problem. However, over time, this river has been neglected, and today, the large culvert under the east gate city wall is completely silted up with mud. The river within the city is almost level with the land. As a result, the residents of the city have no choice but to drink the salty water from wells. People who come to Hefei for the first time invariably suffer from drinking salty water tea. Salty water is indeed not suitable for drinking. In the summer, a cup of tea turns black in no time. Moreover, there are many private wells, adjacent to open sewers. Almost, sewage and well water have become a cyclical process, which is really detrimental to hygiene. Furthermore, there is the lighting problem. Hefei still has no electric lights (the electric light factory that existed before the war was destroyed by the Japanese). Residents use kerosene lamps or even vegetable oil lamps, which is extremely inconvenient and harmful to people's eyesight. Government agencies are particularly inconvenienced. Last year, I heard that the river within the city was to be dredged, and an electric light factory was to be established. However, until now, "we only hear the sound of the stairs," and "no one is coming down."

Recently, the provincial government decided to establish a Hefei Municipal Preparatory Office, to be concurrently handled by the Department of Construction. I hope it will not be just an institutional name.

Underground Banks - Strutting Proudly

Hefei is the center of Anhui. The total land area of the county is 6,035 square kilometers, the cultivated land area is 3,157,731 mu, and the population is 1,274,384. These three figures are the highest among all counties in the province, but the economic value of Hefei is less than that of Wuhu and Bengbu, and therefore it is less prosperous than these two places. Currently, according to statistics from the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, there are only 54,000 people within the city of Hefei. The local population is small, and it is not a major transportation route, so commerce is suffocating in a state of depression.

In today's sluggish national economy, commerce in Hefei naturally appears desolate and bleak. However, one thing that differs from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhu, and Bengbu is that seven or eight out of ten larger businesses are established through shareholding. There is, of course, nothing to say if they earn profits. Even if they lose money and cannot maintain operations, shareholders with strong capital can increase their shares, or the original shareholders can withdraw, and new shareholders can be added. The store still exists. Furthermore, inland commercial transactions generally follow the principle of selling at the cost of purchase, buying high and selling high. Losing money is a rare occurrence. Also, for example, if the price of a certain commodity in Shanghai rises, it naturally rises here as well. Sometimes, when the price in Shanghai falls, it does not immediately fall here. It must go through a period of time before it falls. As a result, very few stores here go bankrupt. When bankruptcies were most prevalent in Beijing and Shanghai, things here remained calm. Therefore, there are no major sales or auctions with marching bands to attract customers throughout the year. It is always so plain and unremarkable, maintaining the old city's market.

A businessman said that Hefei merchants are willing to borrow from underground banks rather than from banks because merchants see money as circulating capital. When borrowing, they calculate the interest. The interest rate for borrowing from banks is 1.2%, and collateral is required. The repayment period is also fixed at one month or several months. Moreover, finding a guarantor is troublesome. Underground banks are different. Lenders always know the details of the borrowers and have friendships. Collateral is not necessarily required. Although the interest rate for borrowing money is higher than that of banks (1.5%), if they borrow today, money will come in tomorrow, and they can repay part of it. There are also no office hour restrictions. This is more convenient than paying interest in advance to a bank, and the effect of turnover is the same. Therefore, underground banks are more active than banks. The reporter has been in contact with many civil servants. From conversations, I know that they all find their current positions difficult to endure. As a result, they believe that everyone is the same. Changing careers would be the same thing. They can only muddle along day by day. One civil servant said: "I am not an expert in my current profession, and changing professions would make me an outsider. People in every profession complain. If I leave this profession, I will still miss it." Life is stressful, and civil servants endure the mechanical routine of going to work and getting off work in this conflicting mood.

We hope the government will pay attention to the lives of civil servants. Constantly letting them sigh and endure days is detrimental to administrative efficiency.

### A Glimpse of Taiwan Province

— Air dispatch from Chiayi, 4th day. Di Dong

Hakka People - Living Comfortably

The locals here, apart from a very small number of indigenous people - the Gaoshan tribes - are mostly compatriots from the Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The total population of the province is said to be 6.5 million, with the Gaoshan tribes accounting for about 300,000 to 400,000, the Hakka people for over a million, and the rest being Minnan people from Fujian. The Gaoshan tribes still live in the deep mountains and rarely interact with people in the plains. Their lives are still semi-primitive. They speak native dialects and Japanese and have fierce temperaments. It is said that the Hakka people, because they came to Taiwan relatively late, also live in more remote mountain villages. However, they are rich in diligence and endurance and can fight against nature with their natural abilities. As the saying goes, "Outstanding people and a blessed land," they have also achieved great things through their unyielding, brave efforts. Many barren mountains have been reclaimed, and many wildernesses have been turned into rice paddies. They have created another situation and a base for life. Look! Aren't the Hakka people in that village all living happy and comfortable rural lives? Most of the compatriots from Fujian Province live in cities and rely on handicrafts for a living. After the restoration, because various factories, large and small, were severely damaged during the war, and the government was limited in manpower, resources, and raw materials, it was unable to resume work for a while. In the past, they generally felt the pain of unemployment for a short time.

Spring All Year Round - Pleasant Climate

The climate in Taiwan is generally similar to that of the Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The climate is hotter south of Chiayi, but because it is surrounded by the sea, the temperature changes drastically. The weather changes between cool and hot in a single day. However, it can be said that Taiwan has spring all year round. Apart from June, July, and December, which have very short periods that seem to have some distinction between winter and summer, most of the days are warm and pleasant. Even in winter and summer, there is no need for light furs to keep out the cold, or it will be too hot to bear. Because there is spring all year round, fruits are produced in all four seasons. The author believes that what is especially worth reporting is the watermelon. Here, it is not only a good product for cooling off in the summer, but it can also be enjoyed in the winter. As for bananas and oranges, it goes without saying that they are available all year round.

Taiwan Provincial Newspaper Employees Call

Since the unfortunate February 28th Incident occurred in Taiwan Province, in addition to a few newspapers being sealed by the authorities, the remaining newspapers that have been approved for registration by the Ministry of Interior, such as "Industrial and Commercial News," "Economic Daily," "National Affairs Daily," and "Ziqiang Daily," have also been temporarily suspended due to martial law. Now, it is learned that since the suspension of these newspapers, the authorities have not formally notified them of the news of resumption of publication, resulting in employees' lives being extremely difficult. It is hoped that Chairman Wei will take appropriate measures to quickly address the unresumed newspapers after taking office in order to maintain the lives of the newspaper employees.

Spring and Autumn

### A Record of Green Mountain Students Performing and Sightseeing

— Li Dongfang

The six states of New England are the oldest among the forty-eight states of the United States and also hold a leading position in culture. Every year, all secondary schools hold an annual drama competition, which greatly contributes to promoting the study of drama and improving the interests of residents.

This year, the preliminary competition for the schools of Green Mountain State happened to coincide with the spring break of Green Mountain University.

If it hadn't been for the encouragement and enthusiastic help of the veteran drama practitioner and friend of Chinatown, Mr. Carl Glick, I would not have received such a good opportunity. Although Mr. Glick is not a native of Green Mountain State, he has an indissoluble bond with it. Thirty or forty years ago, he promoted the Community Theater Movement everywhere, and his footprints can be found in states across the east, west, north, and south. However, he believes that Green Mountain State is the most beautiful, and the "Green Mountain State Teachers Union" also knows that Mr. Glick loves their hometown the most, so every year they invite Mr. Glick to serve as a judge for the drama preliminary competition. This is somewhat related to my stay in Green Mountain (I am ashamed!), so I had to accompany him around the state out of a sense of duty.

The two of us traveled together, covering the entire state.

We went as far north as St. Albans, as far south as Arlington, and as far east as St. Johnsbury. And to Middlebury. We traveled along the lake and through the mountains.

In every place, there must be a secondary school principal to provide gentlemanly hospitality in the New England manner. The two of us would politely decline, return to the hotel to enjoy the local cuisine, then take a nap, drink wine, and stride into the auditorium of the secondary school in a grand manner for dinner.

In each auditorium, there were an average of three, four, or even five one-act plays to watch. The actors were all secondary school students, innocent and carefree, very happy to have the opportunity to express themselves. Ninety percent of the audience were also secondary school students, appreciating the achievements of their classmates on stage. Whether the actors made a mistake or made a correct gesture, the classmates in the audience would applaud. Whether a sentence was spoken incorrectly or correctly, there would also be applause. Especially when a kissing scene occurred, in addition to applause, there would also be wild boar-like roars. Even in the United States, secondary school students still have a sense of rarity and preciousness about kissing.

Out of the thirty plays, Mr. Glick selected six to participate in the New England finals. I would like to introduce the three that I preferred among these six: (1) "Who Says Can't?" (2) "Good Night, Please!" (3) "The Hungerers."

"Who Says Can't?" was written by female writer Ratharyn. Mc Clure and performed by students of Rellows Free Academy in St. Albans. The plot is very simple but caters to the tastes of secondary school students. At the beginning, a brother and sister are sharing breakfast with their mother, fighting over cake. The mother seems to favor the boy, often telling the daughter to go to the kitchen to get things, walking in and out, without telling the son to do it. Moreover, the older brother likes to bully his younger sister, mocking her for not knowing how to dress up and for not having been kissed by a man even at the age of sixteen. — I think this is probably an exaggeration by the writer. American women who have not been kissed by the age of sixteen are probably not a minority. — The younger sister is extremely angry and seeks advice from her female classmates. The female classmates teach her many seductive postures. She learns them very clumsily. A man comes, who is the older brother's classmate, but he doesn't understand her painstaking hints at all, which is really worrying. Who knows, the older brother happens to come home and suspects that there are questionable signs, sternly scolding his classmate for not flirting with his younger sister and not kissing his younger sister without his permission. The classmate is angered by him and kisses her for real, "Who Says Can't?" — The younger sister wins. The older brother has no choice.

"Good Night, Please!" was written by James Daggett and performed by Waterbury High School. When the curtain rises, a middle-aged man is lying in bed, snoring loudly. His daughter, wife, and brother-in-law come to visit one after another, trying to wake him up. He drives them away and continues to snore. This is an afternoon, not an evening. He has been sleeping for three days and is not sick. He is the manager of a bank and has many official matters waiting for him to handle. If he continues to snore like this, who knows how much it will affect the confidence of depositors. So, the daughter, wife, and brother-in-law want to use every method to prevent him from sleeping anymore. He protests loudly, saying, "I have worked hard for twenty years without stopping for a moment. Don't I have the right to rest for a week and sleep to my heart's content?" The highlight of this play is the actors' "pantomime."

"The Hungerers" was written by William Saroyan, the author of "The Human Comedy," and performed by Rutland High School. It describes a writer, with a tattered shirt, buried in his work on a typewriter. He imagines the protagonists in his mind visiting him one by one, causing him trouble. The first one to come in is a Young Capitalist and a salesman for the "Saturday Evening Post," asking him to subscribe to a copy of the "Saturday Evening Post." The writer says, "I have no money." The salesman says, "Why doesn't anyone in the world want to subscribe to the "Saturday Evening Post?" The writer says, "Are you hungry?" The salesman says, "I'm afraid I'm a little hungry. The day before yesterday morning, I remember I seemed to have had breakfast once." Then, a woman comes in. The salesman and she talk. The writer asks them both to leave, but this young woman is also a hungry person and refuses to leave. The writer asks her if she really needs bread or if she needs love. She says, "I don't know." The writer says, "You obviously need love more." The woman asks him very directly: "Do you love me?" He says, "No." The young woman cries loudly. He quickly says, "I can love you, I...really love you." The young woman says, "I can't believe it." But she certainly feels much better. The writer says, "If I still had five cents on me, I could take the manuscript to the publisher and sell it." — He sympathizes with this salesman and this hungry young woman and resolutely tells the salesman to take the typewriter out and sell it for five dollars, four dollars...one dollar, it can't be less than one dollar, hoping everyone will have a good meal. After the salesman takes away the typewriter, he tells the young woman about an experience from his childhood.

He says: "When I was very young, I liked grapes, but I had never eaten them. One day, I saw that the grapes on the shelves of a family looked very good. I looked at them for a long time, thinking about their taste. But the owner came out and thought I was stealing grapes and wanted to catch me, so I ran away..." The young woman asks, "What happened later?" The writer says, "The story is over." The young woman says, "How tragic!" and bursts into tears.

The salesman comes back, and the typewriter has not been sold. The three of them, plus an old woman who walks in later, all starve to death. Before starving to death, they say many philosophical things...However, it turns out to be a spring dream, an illusion.

The students of Rutland High School are full of energy and are able to perform this play, which is not easy. I think they have a good chance of winning an award in the finals.

Among the other twenty-odd failed student drama groups, many fail because they like to play old women too much. Female students are fond of imitation, and there is a tendency to play old women in both China and the United States. To be honest, I don't understand their motives.

The choice of script and the director's skills are, of course, factors in victory and defeat. Some schools fail not because of the students but because of the director. I suggested to Mr. Glick that the schools perform the same script so that the selection would be fairer. He said, "There are also problems. Because the judges get tired after seeing the third school, and the scores become more and more harsh."

### Prayer

— By Karel Capek of Czechia, translated by Gao Lang

Oh, Lord, Creator of the beautiful land, look upon our suffering and despair; to You, we need not describe the misfortunes we have suffered or how we have bowed our heads. We do not bow our heads in shame, nor is there reason for shame, though fate strikes us like iron. Yet we have not been crushed; nor have we failed to show our courage, and our nation will not lose its glory; it has only lost a part of its body. We are like a man bound to the teeth of a wheel, who first tastes the most cruel suffering, and yet he still lives. Our nation lives in extreme suffering, yet it feels that life is still so powerfully alive.

Oh, Lord, Creator of our nation, to You, we need not recount our calamities in detail. Yet, for our one and only demand, we strive to the end, and our mouths and hearts will never let it be lost, and that is faithfulness. Faithfulness is in our hearts, in our history. We will never betray the faithfulness in our history. We, who strive for faithfulness, have a more beautiful and hopeful future and growth, and more flowering and beautiful fruits; what is temporary violence?

Greater than violence is truth, for truth is everlasting, and even in times of hardship, we must solemnly swear never to be lazy. Now we must work even harder for our country, for its inner strength and unity. Only excellent people can save a nation, and we will work for the positive side of history. In our fate, a world-class drama will be performed with great and glorious effort.

We are not at all afraid of the trends of world events; on the contrary, no combination of barbarian forces can compare to the freedom, peace, and equality demanded by nations, countries, and peoples. We must work patiently; we must love our country even more than in the past; and we must have great love for each other. We believe that the most important thing is to take on the mission on earth; in the present of the dark period indicated by European history, we will build our country into a promising future as soon as possible.

Oh, Lord, we do not pray for revenge. Yet we wish you to encourage us with the spirit of faithfulness and hope; may you not censure our failures and disappointments. Just let each of us explore how to serve the eternal destiny of our country in the future, and we do not need anyone to be disappointed. We need faithfulness. We need inner strength, and we need love that effectively increases our strength tenfold.

One cannot call a country small, because its great faithfulness is enough to build a long-term future.

### Believing in Gong Ding'an's Poetry

— Li Baifeng

Presented to Zhu Dayan of Xiushui and Yu Zhuming of Qianxi

Hidden deep within the city's bend, his garments worn,
His official integrity befits his poetry;
Each enjoys a clear reputation throughout the land,
His youthful laments for salt's hardship, magnificent.

Some suspect the River Fen School and Du Fu's style,
Shame prevents tracing their origins;
If ever scattered in the sea of writing,
Only inspire a new spirit, not be a teacher.

Only inspire a new spirit, not be a teacher,
Shame prevents tracing their origins,
Hard to find a proportion for historical accounts,
White waves from the west strike the banners.
I heard tears fall south of the Yangtze,
Again making the old tree in the mountains a home,
Worldly vicissitudes unsettle the heart,
People say the vastness of forty years.

Alone he went among men, alone he returned,
Sir, his collected works will be compiled again;
Wept on the road below Mount Zhi,
The Dao site soaked in the rain of the Flower Heaven.

Singing and weeping, words of truth,
A feather-record is also a thorny path;
Old friends still protect him underground,
Perhaps it is Youtan manifesting.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 508

— Ye Jingfeng

She first giggled, then vigorously shook her head like Bolang's, making her two small braids bounce back and forth, switching places from left to right. The one in front moved to the back, and the one in the back jumped to the front, before casually saying, as if nothing was amiss:

"That doesn't matter."

What was that supposed to mean? When people ask your name, it's a common courtesy, a way to start a conversation and address you properly. Reciprocity is essential, a fundamental aspect of social interaction, so how can she say "doesn't matter"? What exactly does "doesn't matter" imply? Does it mean she's not here to talk to Tsurumi, and whether or not she reveals her name is irrelevant? Or does it mean her name is unnecessary, regardless of whether people ask?

Upon hearing these peculiar words, Tsurumi was momentarily puzzled, unsure of her intentions. He could only assume the young woman was somewhat naive. However, her lively eyes suggested intelligence, and despite her youth, such ignorance seemed unlikely. Therefore, having asked her name and who her brother was, why such a "special" response?

"Oh..."! Tsurumi was increasingly perplexed.

"No," she said, seeing Tsurumi staring blankly, probably realizing she had embarrassed him. She added an explanation to her "doesn't matter" statement: "I originally wanted to talk to my brother, and it also concerns you, sir. Since my brother isn't here, it doesn't matter if we talk." With another giggle, how was Tsurumi supposed to respond? If Tsurumi said, "If what you wanted to discuss with your brother also concerns me, perhaps you could enlighten me directly," who knows what kind of "concern" she meant? Was it to tell her brother not to involve Tsurumi in this dispute? Or did she want to understand Tsurumi's own situation? The scope of this "concern" was vast and limitless. Was it appropriate to ask her directly? Even if Tsurumi disregarded these hesitations and asked her to elaborate, he had to be wary of another casual, "doesn't matter"! At that point, Tsurumi would likely be at a complete loss.

However, saying, "I don't know who your brother is, and I can't say for sure if he'll come or not... In other words, since you think it doesn't matter if we talk, please leave," was also impossible. First, her brother might actually be Shouyi, Li Ming, or that Korean comrade, one of those three. Such discourtesy would surely offend them. Second, after saying "doesn't matter if we talk," the woman stood motionless, not showing any intention of leaving. Tsurumi was truly at a loss.

### The Lamp

— Si Min

A lamp, it is a beautiful soul!

When the sun drags its heavy steps down the hillside; when night builds black walls around the fields, the lamp, like blossoming flowers, blooms all over the city or the entire city. If you want to say that the lamp is like a star on the earth! Then, your imagination is more beautiful

Seeing the lamp, we think of light and tomorrow.

The lamp is the eye of wisdom. Because of her instructions, you will jump out of the maze of life and recognize your own path. And you will not stumble.

In the revelation of the lamp, people go in different directions to hunt for their hopes and happiness!

Don't despise her, and don't dislike her being too small. No matter how dirty the corner is, she can shine it. Where she goes, life will be stubborn, and the despicable and sordid will be completely exposed.

Tell me, what ecstasy would a wandering ship, lost in the night-shrouded strange sea, feel when it saw the light?

Assuming there is such a lamp, I thought so. She is infinitely large, I hold her, in this long night that is difficult to dawn, I run around frantically; summoning the victims with an excited voice....

——Thoughts after the Second Symphony Concert

The Municipal Symphony Orchestra held its second concert at Xin at 5:15 pm this month, embellishing this beautiful May - the season of music, bringing a lot of sublime spiritual pleasure to music lovers.

I went to listen, and now I will briefly and ramblingly describe my feelings as follows:

(1) Although there were only five major programs scheduled this time, they represented the works of composers from Germany, England, Austria, France, and the Soviet Union, each with its own characteristics. The Municipal Symphony Orchestra truly lived up to its name by introducing world-famous music.

(2) In terms of general performance results, this performance was not only more advanced than the last one, but also quite successful. Professor Fu Hua seemed a little "stage-frightened" during the last performance because he hadn't conducted for a long time, but this time he was more than competent. In particular, when conducting Haydn's Symphony No. 4 in D major (the very famous "Clock Symphony"), he was powerful and expressive, and the meaning of this symphony, which is quite close to "program music," was fully expressed.

(3) In the program of Saint-Saëns' "Cello Concerto," the pure skill and understanding of the music by the cello soloist Shevtzoff sublimated the style and fantasy of this modern French romantic composer, highlighting it vividly. I have heard Shevtzoff's cello solo several times, but this performance achieved unexpectedly satisfactory results.

(4) In fact, the eight Soviet folk songs have a stronger song flavor than folk songs. In terms of the music itself, they are far less rich in folk song atmosphere than Soviet folk songs such as "Vanka" and "Volga Boatmen's Song." The characteristic of these eight folk songs is that they still maintain the consistent style of Soviet music in terms of melody and rhythm. (The most obvious is that many songs use minor keys.)

Based on the situation of the two performances, I would like to offer two suggestions to the Municipal Symphony Orchestra:

(1) The number of concerned seats is too small, only accommodating more than 500 people, so there are many listeners who are unable to attend and withdraw. In order to facilitate the public to have the opportunity to appreciate good music, the group should immediately find another performance venue. Fortunately, it is now the beginning of summer and the weather is getting warmer, so it seems possible to resume the past open-air performances in Yiyuan.

(2) In order to promote Chinese music, it is best to arrange some Chinese music programs for each performance, such as Huang Zi, Zhao Yuanren, Ma Sicong, and other outstanding Chinese composers. They have many orchestral works or new creations in instrumental music, which should be introduced to music listeners as much as possible, so as to arouse the general public's awareness of Chinese music works and seek the progress of Chinese music.

Before being executed by firing squad, Tani Hisao, the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, wrote in his will to his wife in court: "On ×× day of × month of Showa ×× year, I was executed in Yuhuatai, Nanjing. I will be forever separated from you. My body will be buried in a foreign land, and my soul will return to your side." If you didn't know who wrote this letter and what crime he committed, after reading these sad and mournful words, I'm afraid everyone would give sympathy and pity.

During the Anti-Japanese War, many undelivered family letters and diaries were often found on the corpses of fallen Japanese soldiers. Inside, the longing and emotions for their hometown, parents, and wives were beautiful, gorgeous, and moving. If the evidence wasn't certain, who could believe that people with such rich emotions were the ones who committed rape and murder without doing evil.

So it makes us think of a question: How can people full of animal desires and animality have normal humanity?

My explanation is: Japanese militarism trained the Japanese nation to become descendants who believed in authority; they had no reason, no feelings, only violence, only blood; but when they were relatively sober, they inevitably revealed the feelings of human nature; so they were anti-war, tired of war, afraid of death, homesick, and sentimental, showing the contradictions of their dual military personality everywhere.

### Past and Future

— Guo

Man A: I saw a palm reader, and he predicted that I would have a serious illness.

Man B: But haven't you already had a serious illness six months ago?

Man A: I told him that too. But he said, "You haven't washed your hands in six months, what can I do?"

### "White-Collar Workers"

— A Lin

Speaking of which, it may make those who have the theory of bedbugs in the United States happy. Just as we have the problem of price wages, the United States also has the problem of prices and wages. It is only that prices in the United States have only risen by 53% during and after the war, while our prices have risen by at least 10,000 to 20,000 times. Therefore, in the United States, wage disputes between workers and employers continue to occur, and the government recognizes that this is the right of the workers. However, it is said that "white-collar workers" do not have such good fortune. Because they have no organization, they cannot act as a group.

This example can arouse our sympathy across the Pacific Ocean, because for the sake of being gentlemen, for the sake of this little status, we can only live in the office, not dare to hum to the employer, because if you "act rashly," you will be dismissed, suspended, and hire someone else. When wages are owed, workers can protest. When wages are far less than prices, workers can demand increases. However, only you white-collar workers can shout and listen to the employer's instructions.

Today, many office gentlemen are paid half as much as their tea room workers. This is a great irony to intellectuals. Originally, "white-collar workers" cannot have any professional unions. Even if they meet, they can only ask each other how the weather is today.

The suffering of "white-collar workers" is the same at home and abroad. This is also a miracle of the 20th century.

Film Talk

### "Orphans of the Storm"

— Zhen

"Orphans of the Storm" is a film made in wartime in England. The story simply depicts a young couple with a mediocre and rigid life. The husband is an accounting manager in a large company. Later, he was drafted into the army and joined the Royal Navy. Then, his wife also joined the Women's Royal Naval Service. Military life put the two people on another new life. They became younger, lively, and brave. Three years later, the two people met again on a vacation. Before meeting, they both had the idea of ​​divorce. When they met each other, they were surprised by the unexpected changes in each other. The idea of ​​divorce became a thing of the past, and they reconciled.

Obviously, such a story was made to encourage soldiers fighting in the war. It depicts the rigid life of the British in a comedic tone. On the other hand, it emphasizes how lively and brave the lives of those soldiers defending their country are. They embarked on a new life in the anti-fascist war. This new life not only defended democracy and the country, but also consolidated the happiness of the family and the security of love. This obvious contrast is powerful and correct. Because only by eliminating the brutal fascist bandits can we guarantee freedom and happiness in the democratic world. The author is smart and appropriate, and arranged these small stories with a high degree of humor. Although some places are inevitably exaggerated and the love changes between men and women in the war are written so casually, as a comedy theme to deal with, these are harmless to the theme.

The couple Robert and Cathy, played by Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr respectively, are particularly rare. Robert Donat's characterization of the husband's personality and appearance before joining the Navy is more vivid than the later plays. The quarrels with his wife on the street and the ridiculous scenes in the hotel during the holidays are also quite successful. And Deborah Kerr, who plays the wife, is still a new star on the screen, but her refined and profound acting skills have given the character of Cathy a rich life, and there is a kind of shining brilliance hidden in her simple and unpretentious acting skills. This is indeed a commendable success. In addition, Glynis Johns' Daisy and Anturde's Ana are also not weak.

In addition to the rich and excellent acting skills brought by these actors, we cannot but mention the achievements of director and producer Alexander Korda. He handled this play delicately and appropriately, especially from the continuous development of the play and the coordination of the external modeling of the couple. We saw the director's ingenuity, and the grasp of atmosphere and rhythm, and the handling of characters and scenes all showed the director's excellent talent

This is a rare good film recently and is worth recommending to readers.

### On Fraud

— Xu Shougu

Obtaining property by fraud, and committing illegal acts through fraud, are all crimes. But what I'm talking about is fraud that is not prohibited by law. Does this make you incomprehensible? Please let me finish. There are three types of fraud that I call not prohibited:

(1) When judges interrogate cases, they often use deceptive and intimidating words to make the accused confess their crimes themselves, so as to facilitate the judgment. This is called fraud, and sometimes it is necessary, so it is not prohibited by law.

(2) Detectives handle cases with extremely secretive and unpredictable methods. Law enforcement agencies use them to catch thieves and do not punish them for fraud. It is clear that the law does not prohibit them.

(3) In times of war, offense and defense, advance and retreat, are of utmost importance. If enemy spies find out, it is difficult to avoid being deceived. Therefore, there is a saying that war is not averse to deception. This word fraud is also not prohibited by law.

### Literary and Art Circles

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Company Commander Liu was also very considerate of the hardships of his subordinates.

"Let her go somewhere else..." He hoped to take care of both sides.

However, the fat woman in the car couldn't bear it anymore.

"Why do you want me to get off the car? I also bought a ticket!" she said angrily, her face flushed.

"If you have a ticket, go to the back!" Director Xiong, who had been sitting in the office for a long time and didn't go out often, was certainly not very clear about these situations. "This is the driver's seat. You female passengers are not allowed to sit here!"

"Bullshit!" The fat woman simply didn't pay attention to his splendid military uniform. "Isn't the one you brought also a woman? I won't let you! I won't let anyone!"

Director Neng was furious.

"Driver, drag her down!"

However, the driver couldn't do anything! He took too much money from others.

"Get down first! I'll think of another way for you!" Company Commander Liu, who was related to him, saw that the situation was very embarrassing, so he took a step forward and said to the fat woman whose face was as red as a large pig liver in a not very loud voice, hoping to coax her off the car and then deal with it.

Unexpectedly, this woman was also particularly stubborn.

"No, I won't get off!" She refused resolutely, speaking with a full mouth of Hunan dialect; her eyes were wide open, like a fierce beast defending its position, staring at the group of eight or so middle-aged people called Director Hou. He was very calm, and he was obviously confident in his heart. He turned around, put his hands behind his back, and looked leisurely at other places; but his young wife couldn't hold back and glared back at the fat woman on the driver's seat, her face full of displeasure.

Director Tai, who had achieved success at a young age, thought this was too much and glared his eyes, preparing to give Company Commander Liu, who was in charge of the motorcade, a hard time on the spot. (70)
