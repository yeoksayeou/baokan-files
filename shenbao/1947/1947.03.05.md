### National Army Advances on All Fronts, Completely Clears the Southern Bank of the Songhua River; Communist Stronghold on the Changtao Line Also Shaken

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 4th] The National Army is still making every effort to pursue the remnants of the Communist forces. It is reported that in a single day on the 3rd, the National Army advanced an average of one hundred li on all fronts. Due to the rapid progress, the military authorities here could hardly maintain regular telephone contact with the forward units today. However, according to intermittent news, the units pursuing north from Dehui have reached the bridgehead on the Songhua River bank and joined hands with the defending troops inside the stronghold. The National Army units pursuing northeast from Dehui and those pursuing northeast from Jiutai have all reached the Songhua River one after another. The units pursuing north from the Tumuling area west of Jilin have crossed the river to the north. Therefore, as of noon on the 4th, the area occupied by the Communist bandits in this battle has been completely recovered. Except for a few defeated stragglers, there are no traces of Communist troops on the southern bank of the Songhua River.

[Another Dispatch] Lin Biao's spring offensive has suffered a disastrous defeat, with rapid and divided retreats and greatly reduced morale. The National Army units converged in Dehui on the 3rd. The Communist forces there fled east and northeast. The National Army, which had been holding the city in isolation, was greatly encouraged and is now making every effort to pursue the remaining Communists. The National Army on the left flank recovered Nong'an on the 2nd, and another unit has advanced to the vicinity of Halahai. All fronts have made progress, and the situation on the Songhua River front has completely changed.

[Another Dispatch] The main force of the Communist army on the Changtao Line has suffered a terrible defeat. The elite troops of the National Army, sweeping northwest across Nong'an, annihilated a large number of Communist covering troops at Zhao's Market, twenty li north of Nong'an, at dusk on the 3rd. Currently, the National Army is pursuing the remnants of the Communist forces, and the Communist stronghold, the Gorlos Wang Mansion, on the Changtao Line is wavering.

### Key Party Members Arrive in Nanjing Yesterday; Comprehensive Government Reorganization Begins, Chairman Chiang to Host Banquet for Party Leaders Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] There was a grand gathering at Sun Ke's residence at 5:00 PM this afternoon. Those attending the government reorganization included Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen. From the Democratic Socialist Party were Zhang Junli, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Sun Baogang, Wan Renqian, Tang Zhuxin, Liu Zhongyi, and Wang Shixian. From the Youth Party were Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Jiaju, Chen Xiuping, Liu Dongyan, Zhang Zizhu, Xie Chengping, and Zhang Bolun. Zhang Junli presented the Democratic Socialist Party's views on the government reorganization, which were roughly as follows: (1) The future government should be a responsible cabinet system with clear powers; (2) The power of the Legislative Yuan should be strengthened, such as reviewing the national budget; and the reorganization of the government should be effective. The Youth Party's views were still to reorganize the Executive Yuan and the National Government Committee; they also mentioned participating in local government. They then proceeded to dinner and dispersed at about 9:00 PM. Government officials continued their discussions afterward. The meeting did not yield any results today. Lei will invite representatives from both parties for breakfast on the 5th for further discussions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to host a luncheon on the 5th for Zhang Junli, Xu Fulin, Sun Shigang, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, and Zhang Bolun, from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, to listen to their views on the comprehensive reorganization of the government.

According to Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party, they came to Nanjing to provide opinions on the institutional aspects of the government reorganization. However, only seven standing committee members of the party came to Nanjing, which is less than half, so the views exchanged at present must be finalized after they return to Shanghai. Jiang also denied rumors that the party had requested the replacement of Premier Song Ziwen. Another senior member of the Democratic Socialist Party stated that the party's suggestions on government reorganization still include adopting a cabinet system, and during the transitional period before the implementation of the constitution, the powers of the Legislative Yuan should be expanded. The Executive Yuan must be responsible to the Legislative Yuan.

### Approximately Forty Taiwanese Compatriots Killed or Injured in Disturbances

Supervisory Yuan Cables Supervisor Yang to Investigate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Disturbances occurred among the people of Taipei, with reports of deaths and injuries. Upon hearing the news, the Control Yuan immediately telegraphed Yang Lianggong, the Supervisory Commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, to go to investigate immediately.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] A telegram from the American News Agency (Associated Press) received here stated: "Citizens have now suffered 3,000 casualties." This information is absolutely inaccurate. A reporter learned from reliable sources that, as of the 3rd, approximately forty Taiwanese compatriots had been killed or injured. When patrolling military camps discovered Taiwanese people destroying houses and beating people, they would first fire warning shots to disperse them. If the Taiwanese did not attack the military police, they would never open fire in retaliation. However, the number of mainland government personnel and their families who were beaten, injured, or killed has exceeded 400. The American News Agency also claimed: "Taiwanese people requested protection from the US Consulate," which is also not true. It is reported that at 5:00 PM on the 1st, several mainlanders fled into the US Consulate, and the Taiwanese people surrounded the consulate. The US immediately called the Public Security Bureau and requested that the mainlanders be taken back. The Public Security Bureau retrieved them four hours later. The US did not request the Public Security Bureau to send troops to protect the consulate, only stating: "If the Public Security Bureau prevents mainlanders from entering the consulate again, the consulate will not be surrounded by Taiwanese people again."

### Cooke Arrives in Qingdao

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] Admiral Cooke, Commander of the US Southwest Pacific Fleet, arrived in Qingdao by plane from the United States on the afternoon of the 4th.

### Communist Party of China Entrusts China Democratic League to Keep Material in Various Places; Shanghai Office of CPC Announces Closure

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Zhou Enlai of Yan'an recently telegraphed Zhang Lan of the China Democratic League, requesting that he keep the materials left by the Communist Party in five cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Kunming. Dong Biwu is currently negotiating with the government. After obtaining the results, he will hand over the goods according to civil law procedures.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has formally announced its closure. Except for Dong Biwu and four others who had previously gone to Nanjing, Chen Jiakang and 28 others (including the staff of the Xinhua Daily in Hankou Road) will leave Shanghai for Beijing this morning and then return to Yan'an. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has added a first-class carriage to the express train leaving for Beijing at 9:00 AM this morning for them. The houses left by the CPC are temporarily being guarded by the Lujiawan Police Sub-bureau.

[Our Newspaper] Whether the representative of the CPC in the UNRRA will retreat at the same time as other CPC personnel has not yet been instructed by the Central Committee. Director Huo was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai last night, but it has been learned that he will postpone it until tonight. This reporter visited Wu Yunfu yesterday, who said that, according to the principle of relief without discrimination, the representative of the CPC in the UNRRA still hopes to remain in Shanghai, because UNRRA also has two organizations within the CPC areas. However, everything will be decided after Director Huo asks the government for instructions. If he still has to retreat, he will not be able to accompany the CPC personnel who left Shanghai this morning.

### The Investigation Report on the Shanghai Gold Rush Case by Four Supervisory Committee Members is Released

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Since the gold rush occurred last month, the Control Yuan immediately dispatched Supervisory Committee members He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wan Can, as well as auditors Fan Shiyu and Wang Shimin from the Ministry of Audit, to Shanghai for a thorough investigation. They have now returned to Nanjing and prepared a detailed report to the Control Yuan. The original text of the report has been disclosed, as follows: "The committee members were ordered to go to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold case and arrived in Shanghai on February 16th to begin the investigation. Since various relevant agencies in Shanghai were simultaneously responsible for investigating or handling the gold rush after it occurred, including the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Shanghai Economic Supervision Group, and the investigation personnel sent by the Ministries of Finance and National Defense, although their missions were different, their target was the gold rush case. Therefore, the committee members maintained contact with all parties during the investigation and will report the known information and analysis and judgments based on various investigation materials separately as follows:

First Investigated Item: (A) Investigation of the Central Bank's Gold Trading Situation Since the Central Government decided to implement the policy of buying and selling gold in early March of last year, the Central Bank was responsible for handling it on March 8th. The people actually responsible for the implementation of this task were Bei Zuyi, the president of the bank, Lin Fengbao, the director of the Business Bureau, and Yang Anren, the deputy director. The methods of selling gold were divided into two categories: open allocation and secret sale. The open allocation method was based on the Shanghai gold price at 10:00 AM every day by the Central Bank Business Bureau to determine the Central Bank's daily price. According to the number of requests from members of the Gold Industry Association and the Goldsmith Association, the five designated businesses, including Tongfengyu, Taikangrun, Dafengheng, Fang Jiuxia Changji, and Yang Qinghe Faji, were responsible for purchasing, distributing, and allocating to the member applicants. The secret sale method was that the Central Bank Business Bureau, after the daily open allocation, based on the market situation, at any time based on the highest fluctuating gold market price, sold it in batches through the above-mentioned five businesses to stabilize the gold market price. During the past year, the Central Bank Business Bureau has been found to have the following facts in the execution of the allocation and sale work, which is worth paying attention to: (1) Since the Central Bank implemented the gold trading, the methods and procedures of all work were not formally stipulated in writing, but were decided by Bei, Lin, and Yang of the bank. (2) The original regulations for daily open allocation applications by businesses and firms in the two associations were soon abolished, so that the determination of all open allocation and secret sale prices and the establishment of transactions were only determined by the Central Bank and the five designated firms through telephone conversations. In addition, there were no formal contracts and vouchers for the transactions. (3) The gold stored in the Central Bank was originally in the form of 400-tael gold bricks, but when sold, it was in the unit of bars (10 taels). According to Directors Lin and Yang, the Central Mint did not have complete gold melting equipment, so Tongfengyu was responsible for the distribution. Tongfengyu, Dafengheng, Hongfengyong, Shengyuanyong, Jiuchengyong, Yangqinghe Zhiji, Yufayong, and Xianghe signed contracts with Tongfengyu to decompose the 99 pure gold into gold bars and distribute them to the gold firms and goldsmiths. The Central Bank gave Tongfengyu a smelting loss of 3 fen per 10 taels (see Lin Fengbao's interview transcript and Zhan Liansheng's interrogation transcript). (4) Of the five firms designated by the Central Bank, only Tongfengyu was opened by Zhan Liansheng. The other four firms were reportedly introduced by Zhan Liansheng (see interrogation transcripts of Zhan Liansheng, Fang Jiuxia, Taikangrun, and Yang Qinghe). (5) All five designated firms must have Zhan Liansheng's signature and seal to receive gold bars from the Central Bank (see the same transcript). (6) Before the Central Bank assigned the responsibility for allocation to the designated firms, a total of 65 firms applied to be responsible for the allocation, but only five were designated. Among these five, Tongfengyu did not yet have a business license from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. According to their registration, the capital of Tongfengyu was 15 million yuan, Taikangrun was 2.4 million yuan, Dafengheng was 10 million yuan, Fang Jiuxia Changji was 9.1 million yuan, and Yang Qinghe Faji was 9.6 million yuan, while the registered capital of the gold firms and goldsmiths that applied but were not designated was much larger (see Attachment 7). (7) Since the Central Bank implemented the gold trading last year, there has been a detailed English report to Premier Song every day. Only this year, the Ministry of Finance notified the Central Bank to report the gold sales situation. From January, the Central Bank began to submit a weekly gold trading statistics table. (8) According to the Central Bank's report, except for the gold trading figures from March to November of last year, which are confidential and cannot be fully questioned and reported, the number of gold bars purchased in December was 2,056, and the number sold was 78,306; the number of gold bars purchased in January was 300, and the number sold was 68,454; the number of gold bars purchased in February up to the 15th, when sales were stopped, was 135, and the number sold was 10,986. The income was only from gold mines, so in fact, only gold was sold, and no gold was bought. (9) From January 4th of this year to the date of suspension, the Central Bank entrusted five firms to allocate and sell 79,382 gold bars, with Tongfengyu having the most, accounting for 43,597 bars, followed by Taikangrun, 16,247 bars, Dafengheng, 7,359 bars, Fang Jiuxia Changji, 4,502 bars, and Yang Qinghe Faji, 7,837 bars. Tongfengyu accounted for about 55% of the total sales. (10) According to the number of gold bars allocated and sold by the Central Bank from January 4th to February 15th, there were different numbers listed in the account books of Tongfengyu and the other five firms every day, and the total numbers also differed (see Attachments 8 and 9). (11) The Central Bank suddenly stopped allocating and selling gold on February 10th, causing the gold market price to rise. According to Director Lin and Deputy Director Yang of the bank, the suspension was instructed by Bei Zuyi, the president of the bank. The committee members believe that this incident was a major cause of the gold rush and telegraphed Chairman Chiang about the case on February 20th. [Continued on Page 2]

### Chiang, Concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, Presides Over Routine Meeting; Economic Commission Reorganized Under Executive Yuan; Revised Organic Statute Sent to Legislative Yuan to Complete Legislative Process; Price Control Incorporated into the Commission's Responsibilities

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Executive Yuan held its 778th routine meeting at 10:00 AM on the 4th. Chiang, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, presided. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs, and Qin Dechun reported on national defense. The meeting resolved to approve amendments to the Organic Statute of the Supreme Economic Council: (1) The name is changed to the National Economic Council; (2) Originally under the National Government, it is now reorganized under the Executive Yuan; (3) The responsibilities of the council are expanded to include "the promotion of specific economic measures," such as the promotion of import management, export promotion, public works, and price controls; (4) The number of ex officio members is increased to include the Director of the Water Conservancy Commission and the Governor of the Central Bank. There will also be 10 to 20 other members. The President arrived at the Executive Yuan at 10:00 AM. After the agenda items were discussed, he gave an impromptu address to the heads of various ministries and commissions, urging them to strengthen administrative efficiency in the future and earnestly implement the emergency economic measures plan. The meeting ended at 11:30 AM, after which he went to the President's office to review official documents, leaving the Executive Yuan at 12:20 PM.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Since its establishment in accordance with the order of the National Government, the Organic Statute of the Supreme Economic Council has not yet completed the legislative process in the Legislative Yuan. This is because the Legislative Yuan believes that since the Supreme Economic Council is subordinate to the National Government, and the matters under its jurisdiction are similar to those of the Executive Yuan, the matter was delayed for discussion. Recently, the Organic Statute of the Council was amended and approved at the Executive Yuan routine meeting on the 4th, reorganizing it under the Executive Yuan and renaming it the National Economic Council. Its Organic Statute is not significantly different from the previous Organic Statute of the Supreme Economic Council, with only slight revisions, and it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan immediately to complete the legislative process. Also, at the routine meeting, the Price Control Commission was approved to be subordinate to the National Economic Council. The President of the Executive Yuan serves concurrently as the Chairman of the Commission, and the Vice President of the Executive Yuan serves concurrently as the Vice Chairman. The heads of the ministries and commissions of economics, finance, food, agriculture, and social affairs, the Governor of the Central Bank, and the Mayors of Nanjing and Shanghai serve as members. A routine meeting is held once a week to determine principles, and the implementation is the responsibility of the relevant agencies.

Chairman Orders Earnest Handling of Distribution of Goods to Public Servants

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] President Chiang attaches great importance to the distribution of daily necessities to public school teachers and civil servants. At the Executive Yuan routine meeting on the morning of the 4th, he instructed the responsible personnel to handle the matter earnestly and promptly so that all public school teachers and civil servants can receive tangible benefits.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The supply of daily necessities for the residents of this city has been decided to be handled by the Executive Yuan reviewing the lists, the Bureau of Supplies distributing purchase certificates, the material production agencies supplying materials, and the municipal government contacting and supervising the distribution stores to handle everything separately. However, for the sake of planning and verifying the distribution of goods, a Capital Daily Necessities Distribution Commission will be established to be responsible for handling the matter. The commission will be formed by representatives from the Executive Yuan, the Bureau of Supplies, and the ministries of social affairs, economics, food, and finance. Under it will be established general affairs, verification, food, coal, cloth, oil, sugar, and salt groups. Distribution will begin soon.

### Legislative Members Jian Guansan and Others Suggest Method for Handling Overseas Deposits; Buy 40%, Requisition 40%, and Levy Income Tax; Legislative Yuan Refers to Finance and Economic Committees for Review

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] At the 316th routine meeting of the Legislative Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 4th, newly appointed legislative members Rui Yifu, Liu Jiaju, Lian Tianxiang, Fu [blank], Guo Chushang, Wang Jun, Fu Wangliang, and Bai Zhaofeng attended for the first time. President Sun presided. Before the meeting began, a brief introduction was given to the new members. Then, routine cases were discussed. Fu Sinian and [blank] Ben [blank] attended on behalf of Academia Sinica to explain the revised Organic Law of Academia Sinica and the draft Statute of the Council of Academia Sinica. It was then passed after discussion. The Organic Law of the Population Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior and the Organic Law of the Water Conservancy Demonstration Project of the Water Conservancy Commission were also passed. In addition, Jian Guansan, Liu Butong, and others proposed a temporary motion, suggesting that the Supreme National Defense Council should buy 40% of the existing deposits of Chinese citizens abroad in the form of ten- or twenty-year public bonds, requisition 40% in the form of donations, and levy a progressive comprehensive income tax on the overseas deposits that have already been withdrawn, based on the original amount of the deposits. The reason is that during the War of Resistance, the overseas deposits of Chinese citizens should have been requisitioned in accordance with the British example. Recently, due to the urgent economic situation and the surge in the use of foreign exchange, the Supreme National Defense Council passed a resolution on February 16 to buy overseas deposits. However, the US government has already unfrozen the deposits, and the depositors have already withdrawn and used them on their own, or used the names of foreign people in order to escape. Therefore, although the government now has a resolution to buy them, the result may not be very fruitful. In order to meet the needs of financial and economic needs, and to remedy this defect, it seems appropriate to buy 40% in the form of public bonds. The current legal exchange rate is 12,000 yuan per US dollar. If foreign deposits are bought with legal tender at this exchange rate, it will inevitably accelerate the deterioration of inflation and expand the flow of floating capital, which will be more harmful than beneficial. It seems appropriate to buy 40% with long-term public bonds of ten or twenty years to delay the burden on the national treasury. At the same time, 40% should be requisitioned in the form of donations. In the 33rd year of the Republic, the government held gold deposits, and then strongly donated 40%. Overseas deposits have no legal basis and are to evade funds. If they are not required to donate 40%, it will inevitably make people feel unfair. At present, US dollar foreign exchange has a fivefold profit in one year. If no order is given for donation, how can the government gain the trust of the people? As for the overseas deposits that have already been withdrawn, a progressive comprehensive income tax should be levied on the original amount. Since the unfrozen deposits are donated and requisitioned, and the depositors who have already withdrawn the deposits are ignored, it is inevitable that one will be treated generously and the other will be treated harshly. Therefore, they should also be made to bear the obligation to pay taxes to the state. Regarding the implementation methods, they advocated that the Executive Yuan draft them and send them to the Legislative Yuan for review, in order to comply with the legislative process and to have a basis for dealing with foreign countries in the future. It was resolved that the case be referred to the Finance and Economic Committees for review.

### Japan's First Batch of Reparation Factories Designated as 923; Last Year's Sino-Japanese Trade Volume Approximately 10 Million US Dollars

### Shanghai Gold Rush Investigation Report; Continued from First Edition Above

Gold Sales Situation of Gold Shops and Silver Shops

(B) Investigation of the Gold Sales Situation of Gold Shops and Silver Shops. There are two types of gold traders in Shanghai: gold shops, which are engaged in gold trading, and silver shops, which are engaged in the sale of gold ornaments. Silver shops use the sales volume of customers as the standard, and transactions are limited to gold ornaments, so their throughput is smaller. Moreover, silver shops often have a long history and value credit, and their operations are more stable and less likely to engage in risky speculation. Therefore, silver shops have received fewer gold bars from the Central Bank in the past year. Gold shops, on the other hand, specialize in gold speculation and trading. Large customers mostly gather in gold shops, so the fluctuations in the gold market and the determination of gold prices are all controlled by the gold industry. Therefore, in the past year, the amount of gold sold by the Central Bank and purchased by the Gold Industry Association has been far greater than that of the silver shops. In addition to formal gold shops, there are also merchants who specialize in buying and selling on behalf of customers. Most of them have no formal storefronts and have not been registered, but their trading activity is very high, and speculators flock to them, forming a disguised gold exchange, which has a lot of adverse effects on the gold market, and the local authorities have failed to ban it in advance. Even among the 65 firms that applied to undertake the distribution work mentioned above, 44 have not registered and obtained business licenses, and some of the five designated firms have also not obtained business licenses. The daily control is not strict, so speculators can disrupt the financial market and act recklessly, which is a neglect.

Zhan Liansheng Has Controlling Power

As for the situation of the above-mentioned five firms undertaking the distribution of gold from the Central Bank, after the committee members questioned them one by one and investigated all aspects of the situation, the following facts are noteworthy: Although there are five firms in name that undertake the distribution of gold from the Central Bank, in fact, not only Tai Kangrun, Dafengheng, Fang Jiuxia, and Yang Qinghe are all introduced by Zhan Liansheng, the host of Tongfengyu, but also all the melting of gold bars and the distribution of gold bars by the Central Bank are handled by Tongfengyu and Zhan Liansheng. Therefore, Tongfengyu and Zhan Liansheng not only fully understand the total amount of gold sold by the Central Bank since March 8 last year, but also clearly have complete control over the other four as a whole. It is obvious that a gold shop and merchant engaged in gold speculation can understand the bottom line of the Central Bank's gold sales and control its peers with one hand, creating a gold rush at the appropriate time to take the opportunity to profit.

Central Bank Employees Suspected

The daily gold allocation price of the Central Bank is determined based on the reports of the five companies talking on the phone. Since the five companies are all under the control of Zhan Liansheng, the determination of the gold price is naturally easily manipulated by him. The Central Bank's daily allocation of gold, in addition to the applications of members of the two associations, does not ask how the distribution situation is or how the selling price is after the five companies purchase it in secret, because the Central Bank thinks it is free trading, which inevitably gives people the opportunity to manipulate it. The five firms that undertake the allocation of gold also purchase gold from the market at the same time. In particular, Tongfengyu purchased a large amount of gold before the government announced the suspension of gold sales, which is not only unreasonable but also suspected of manipulating the market after hearing the news. After reviewing the allocation accounts of the five companies, there are many entries for Central Bank employees, including Wang Songwan, the manager in charge of the gold treasury account, who also has gold bar purchase accounts. It is suspicious that the personnel of the Central Bank, which is implementing the gold allocation business, have this trading behavior, using their powers to collude with merchants for profit.

Editorial

### The Problem of Loans for Impoverished Students

The Loan Committee for Impoverished Students, initiated and organized by various sectors of this city, was formally established yesterday. Council Speaker Mr. Pan Gongzhan was publicly elected as the chairman to oversee all matters. According to Speaker Pan, the committee plans to raise one billion [currency units] for loans. In addition to the five hundred million approved by the municipal government, the remaining five hundred million must be raised through appeals to all sectors of society. Furthermore, as schools at all levels have already started classes, impoverished students urgently need loans. Therefore, before the fundraising is completed, the committee will borrow five hundred million from various banks. It can be said that, broadly speaking, the loan problem for impoverished students this semester has been resolved. However, technically, there are still several issues that need to be discussed.

The first is the issue of loan allocation. Because the total loan amount is limited to one billion, there is an inverse relationship between the number of loan recipients and the amount of the loan they receive. If the number of loan students is set too high, the amount of the loan they receive will be reduced. Given the current environment in Shanghai, where fees at all levels of schools are quite high, a small amount will be of no help. Even if impoverished students receive a loan, their financial problems will not be solved. Conversely, if the loan amount is increased, the number of loan students will inevitably decrease. However, in today's Shanghai, impoverished students are ubiquitous. How to ensure that all impoverished students can receive loans remains a serious problem. Therefore, how to allocate the loans is indeed worthy of careful study by the committee. We have investigated the tuition fees of schools at all levels in Shanghai and will provide a hypothetical allocation for the Loan Committee's reference: set the number of primary school loan students at three thousand, with a loan of one hundred thousand per person; set the number of secondary school loan students at two thousand, with a loan of two hundred thousand per person; and set the number of university and college loan students at one thousand, with a loan of three hundred thousand per person.

The second is the matter of reviewing loan applicants. Students eligible for this loan must simultaneously possess the following two essential conditions: first, their family circumstances must be genuinely impoverished; second, their academic performance and conduct must be truly outstanding. Neither can be lacking. If a student's family is impoverished but their academic performance and conduct are not outstanding, they are not eligible for a loan. This is because the loan is raised from society, and society is only willing to help outstanding students who cannot afford to study. Conversely, if a student's academic performance and conduct are excellent but their family is not impoverished, there is no need for them to request a loan. Allowing them to fraudulently obtain a loan would deprive other impoverished students of their rightful share, which would run counter to the purpose of society's fundraising to help impoverished students. Therefore, all students who wish to apply for a loan must first consider whether they possess these two essential conditions. At the same time, according to Speaker Pan, the application and disbursement procedures for loans will be handled jointly by the Loan Committee and the school authorities. Therefore, we believe that the school authorities should bear more responsibility for the review work.

The third is the issue of fundraising from all sectors of society. "It is most joyful to do good," is something everyone knows. Especially when it comes to helping impoverished students, as long as one's financial ability allows, everyone is willing to contribute generously. Therefore, raising five hundred million for loans from society is not a difficult task in itself. However, the Shanghai market has recently experienced another wave of soaring gold prices, which will inevitably have some impact. Some may even have difficulty taking care of themselves. However, education is the basic work of the nation, especially for those impoverished students, most of whom are outstanding students. In the future, they will all be pillars of the nation and backbones of society. How can we sit idly by and watch these outstanding students drop out of school due to economic difficulties? Therefore, from the standpoint of promoting education and culture, and thinking about the next generation, we must appeal to all sectors of society in Shanghai, requesting that all sectors of society contribute their efforts and money to ensure that the amount the Loan Committee wants to raise can be raised in the shortest possible time. As the saying goes, heaven helps those who help themselves. Helping impoverished students continue their studies is more meaningful and valuable than any other relief effort. It not only directly helps a large number of impoverished students but also indirectly cultivates many useful talents for the country and society. It achieves two goals with one action, so why not do it?

Fourth, schools at all levels have been in session for many days, and how to pay tuition has long made ordinary impoverished students restless. Furthermore, the application procedures for loans have not yet been completed, and the review is not a simple task. Therefore, some people inevitably feel that education loans are like "spring implementing winter orders." This is indeed the case, but we should actively launch loan work, and especially hope that the school authorities at all levels will earnestly assist in completing the initial review work in the shortest possible time, so that ordinary impoverished students can receive loans as soon as possible and no longer suffer from overdue fees.

Finally, we must say a few words to impoverished students with excellent character and academics. It is not a shameful thing for you to receive a loan from society because your family is impoverished and unable to afford your education. In the current environment, the difficulties of the national economy have reached an extreme, and parents' inability to afford their children's tuition has become a widespread phenomenon. In the past, we often heard that a few students, influenced by the vanity of Shanghai society, were ashamed of being impoverished and stubbornly refused to apply to the school. This misconception should be corrected. Therefore, we hope that impoverished students at all levels of schools in this city will actively apply for loans so that the purpose of establishing the Loan Committee for Impoverished Students can be fully realized. As for students who receive loans, they should recognize the current economic difficulties, appreciate the virtue of social relief, cherish the precious time of studying, and work harder and strive for self-improvement to cultivate themselves into talents who are truly useful to the country and society. Only in this way will they not fail the expectations of society for the next generation.

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 4th broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault signed a 50-year military alliance in Dunkirk at 2:45 PM (Greenwich Mean Time, 10:45 PM Shanghai Time). Ninety percent of Dunkirk was destroyed after the battle. The population is only five thousand, one-sixth of the pre-war population. Bidault left Paris at 9:50 AM this morning (5:50 PM Shanghai Time) and arrived in Dunkirk directly at 2:00 PM. Bevin arrived in Calais at 1:30 PM and then arrived in Dunkirk. After Bevin and Bidault signed the "Dunkirk Agreement," they delivered speeches. The content of the alliance will be announced later. After signing the agreement, Bevin will fly directly to Moscow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and Bidault will fly to Moscow tomorrow after returning to Paris.

[Agence France-Presse, Dunkirk, West 4th Dispatch] French Foreign Minister Bidault arrived here at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin also arrived at 2:00 PM, with the crowd cheering along the way to celebrate this signing ceremony.

[Agence France-Presse, 4th Dispatch] The signing ceremony of the Anglo-French alliance will be held in the Dunkirk City Hall. The location is not spacious and can only accommodate 150 people. In addition to Foreign Minister Bidault, the French delegation also includes Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chauvel, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mauvill, and Director of Foreign Economic Affairs Alphand. In addition to Foreign Minister Bevin, the British delegation also includes British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper, British Military Attaché to France General Jones, and British Embassy Counselor Sir Pierson Dixon. Foreign Minister Bidault and French Ambassador to Britain Massigli will represent the French government to sign the alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin and British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper will represent the British government to sign the alliance treaty. According to news received here today, Foreign Secretary Bevin and his party originally planned to take the destroyer "Bicester" to Calais, but now it has been decided to switch to the ferry "Invicta" because the equipment inside the warship is not suitable.

The Content of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty Does Not Include the Concept of a Western European Group

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] "The Times" recently reported that the Anglo-French alliance does not contain any provisions that would give rise to the concept of a Western European group. Moreover, the provisions of the Anglo-French alliance may be expanded into a four-power pact in the future. The economic cooperation provisions only confirm the situation that already exists between the two countries. "The Daily Telegraph" reported that once the alliance is signed, a copy will be telegraphed to London immediately and submitted to the House of Commons for discussion. The full text of the alliance will not be released until it has been approved by Parliament.

### British and American Foreign Ministers Depart for Moscow

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Special Dispatch] The delegation of the United States attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference will be led by Secretary of State Marshall. They will leave here at 9:00 AM on the 5th on four special planes, accompanied by Marshall's assistants and thirty-six American journalists.

[Associated Press, Paris, 4th Dispatch] After signing the Anglo-French alliance in Dunkirk, British Foreign Secretary Bevin went to the Belgian border to take a special plane to Moscow. Bidault will return to Paris for a while and fly to Moscow on Wednesday morning.

[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] On the eve of his departure for Moscow, Foreign Secretary Bevin met with reporters and said: "I feel that we have now reached a stage where people have realized that we must solve world problems and establish a path for future human progress." Bevin said that he was in good health and had high expectations for the Moscow Conference. He said, "I am going there with hope, although it is difficult to predict how things will develop during the conference, I am still as optimistic about the outcome of the conference as I have been in the past."

[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] Reliable sources said: Foreign Secretary Bevin and Secretary of State Marshall may discuss the Greek issue in Moscow. The British side suggested that if the United States provides economic assistance to Greece, the British army must continue to be stationed in Greece. Bevin and senior officials of the British Foreign Office are considering this point. A British government spokesperson pointed out that the British government's previous statement on Greece had indicated that the number of British troops stationed in Greece would be greatly reduced. London political figures believe that the US government's request for the British government to consider whether it can cancel the decision to withdraw British troops stationed in Greece within three months is indeed a difficult problem for the British government to deal with.

Eight Issues to Seek Resolution

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] Regarding the China issue, well-informed sources here said that US Secretary of State Marshall will raise this issue for discussion at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. When the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed, the Soviet Union agreed not to hinder President Chiang's efforts to establish a united government for the whole country. Now that the United States has announced its withdrawal from China, the British side hopes that the Soviet Union will be able to abide by its promises even more. According to sources close to the British government, Foreign Secretary Bevin will resolve at least eight issues of great importance to world peace during his trip to Moscow, including the China issue. It is expected that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference will last for two months. The eight issues that Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to resolve are: (1) the German issue and the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany; (2) the Austrian issue, and a peace treaty with Austria may be signed in Moscow; (3) the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should conclude a four-power pact to ensure that Germany is permanently disarmed; (4) the issue of revising the Anglo-Soviet alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin may also hold talks with Stalin to discuss amending the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin will bring a draft with him and hand it over to Stalin as soon as he arrives in Moscow; (5) the Dardanelles Strait issue. The Soviet government has expressed its hope to amend the Montreux Convention. Foreign Secretary Bevin has also notified the Turkish government that the Montreux Convention must be amended by an international conference of the treaty's signatory countries to alleviate Turkey's fears; (6) the Greek issue. This issue will be discussed by Foreign Secretary Bevin and Secretary of State Marshall; (7) the Palestinian issue; (8) the China issue.

### US House of Representatives Debates the Greek Issue

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The US House of Representatives began debating today the British's urgent request for the United States to assist in dealing with the Greek issue. At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall also attended a meeting of the House Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss the general situation abroad, especially the Greek issue. A Republican congressman told the House that the State Department's foreign policy is firm and realistic, which is enough to prevent Greece from being controlled by the Communist Party ordered by Moscow and to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming a Mediterranean power. I am pleased with this.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] At a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee today, Secretary of State Marshall reiterated the British's request for assistance to Greece. This matter may cause the most intense debate on post-war foreign policy. The detailed content of Marshall's proposal is unknown, but it is known that Marshall urged the committee to approve American loans to prevent the establishment of a communist regime in Greece.

[Central News Agency, Athens, 3rd Associated Press Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the Greek government has instructed its ambassadors in Washington and London to express their agreement to the Anglo-American agreement on the future of Greece.

Guerrillas in Northern Greece

[Reuters, Athens, 3rd Dispatch] Greek officials said: The Greek military authorities have evidence that since the United Nations investigation team arrived in Greece a month ago, the guerrillas in northern Greece have still received weapons from the air, which are supplied by Greece's northern neighbors.

Hurley's Remarks

[United Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 3rd Dispatch] Former US Ambassador to China General Hurley told reporters today: "One of the two things, the US withdrawal from China and the entry into Greece, must be a mistake. The reason why he resigned as ambassador to China was because the United States was entering a strong power policy of colonial imperialism, which was the opposite of Soviet imperialism. The US decision to aid Greece is proof of this."

### British Cuts in Military Spending

More Than Half of the Army Personnel to Be Reduced

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] The Ministry of the Army recently submitted the budget for the fiscal year 1947-1948, which greatly reduces military spending and the number of troops.

### The Korean Provisional Government May Be Established Within Days; Syngman Rhee as Head, Kim Koo as Deputy

The United States and the Soviet Union Should Abide by Their Promises to Complete the Unification of Korea

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 4th broadcast: US Republican Representative Shafer made a speech in the House of Representatives, stating that the Soviet Union is now treating Korea in the same way as it treated Poland, making it another puppet state of the Communist Party. The British Commonwealth has established a puppet communist regime in its occupied area, claiming that it allows Koreans to exercise autonomy, while using various methods to turn Koreans in the area into communists. In December 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union reached an agreement in Moscow to reunite Korea and establish a unified provisional government for the whole country, but this resolution has not been implemented due to the Soviet Union's obstruction.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Kim Yang-yong, chairman of the Korean Political Affairs Association, recently delivered a broadcast speech, suggesting that the United States and the Soviet Union should formally or informally discuss the Korean issue at the Moscow Conference. The main points of his proposal are as follows: (1) The "unnatural" demarcation line of the 38th parallel in Korea should be removed.

### Stalin Resigns from Military Post; Bulganin Succeeds as Minister of Defense

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch] Moscow Radio recently broadcast the news that Marshal Stalin has resigned from his concurrent post as Minister of Defense due to the burden of other duties. He will be succeeded by General Bulganin, Deputy Minister of the Military and Political Affairs. General Bulganin was born in 1895. He served as the manager of an electrical machinery manufacturing plant. During the war, he served as the political commissar of Marshal Zhukov, Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army. In 1944, he was appointed Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He was soon promoted to general and succeeded Marshal Voroshilov as Deputy Minister of Defense. He was then transferred to the post of Deputy Minister of the Military and Political Affairs until now.

[United Press, London, 3rd Dispatch] Unofficial Soviet sources here believe that Stalin's resignation from military posts at the age of sixty-seven does not have any special significance. The reason for his resignation is that his duties are too heavy to bear, which is indeed the case. As the Soviet Union recently focused on increasing industrial production and accelerating the implementation of the current five-year plan, his resignation from concurrent posts is related to this. Stalin still retains the posts of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and Chairman of the Control Commission. Bulganin once served as Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, which is actually the Deputy Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. During the war, he was transferred to important military posts and was recognized as a talent in diplomacy and administration, not just a great soldier. When he served as Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet during the war, he was able to give full play to his talents.

### It Is Rumored That Stalin Would Agree to the Tanaka Memorial; Tanaka Revealed It in the Far East Court

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] Japan's wartime parliament speaker Tadahiko Okada revealed in the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal today that Stalin had agreed to the plan to establish an autonomous government in Asia in the 1926 "Tanaka Memorial," but he also admitted that there were no documents to prove it. The memorial planned to maintain peace in Asia and to link Korea, Manchuria, and the southern region of Lake Baikal in Siberia into a buffer neutral zone. Stalin had expressed his agreement, and China was also very likely to agree. However, there was widespread opposition in Japan because "some Japanese people did not want Korea to become a part of the autonomous region." The plan was eventually scrapped due to the death of Zhang Zuolin in a car accident, which led to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Okada also said: "Because Stalin expressed his agreement in a secret meeting, there were no documents."

### Truman Arrives Safely in Mexico City; Delivers a Speech Emphasizing the Good Neighbor Policy

[United Press, Mexico City, 3rd Dispatch] US President Truman arrived here today by plane from Kansas City for a three-day goodwill visit. Mexican President Alemán and senior government officials warmly welcomed him at the airport and fired a 21-gun salute. As Truman drove to the US Embassy, the two-mile-long route was decorated with the flags of both the United States and Mexico, and tens of thousands of farmers and workers cheered along the way with their families. Upon arrival at the US Embassy, welcoming crowds scattered flowers along the way. Mexican President Alemán then hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace. At the end of the banquet, Truman delivered a speech to the crowd. The cheers of the audience rose and fell like thunder. Truman said: "The United States is determined to fulfill its promise to help small and weak countries around the world deal with oppression. This voice of the United States can be heard everywhere in the world, and it is clearer and more powerful than before." Truman then elaborated on the doctrine of non-interference, guaranteeing that the United States would be faithful to the doctrine of non-interference in both words and spirit, but this does not mean that it is unconcerned about the situation in other countries. Truman said: "The major events of one country may have a profound impact on other countries. If any member of a group of countries violates the recognized principles of conduct, the whole group must feel concerned. The doctrine of non-interference means that strong countries have no right to use their power to force weak countries to accept their own will. We wholeheartedly accept this doctrine as the cornerstone of the entire American system. Without it, we cannot be good neighbors. This is the obligation stipulated by the Good Neighbor Policy and is a part of the basic international law common to all American countries. The pursuit of collective security in the world has been carried out simultaneously with the gradual recognition of the doctrine of non-interference. We have made encouraging progress in building a group of countries to deal with violating countries by law. The Charter of the United Nations is a prominent example." Truman also expressed the friendship and trust of the American people to the Mexican people, and finally said: "Although the road to friendship with neighboring countries and even the whole world is long and tiring, we should complete it. The United States and Mexico must not let each other down."

[United Press London, 3rd] Moscow Radio announced today that the so-called statement by Hodge, the US military commander in southern Korea, that the Soviet Union is conscripting 500,000 soldiers in northern Korea is completely unfounded and purely fictitious.

Republican Congressmen Discuss Foreign Policy

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The House of Representatives today debated the foreign policy and budget bills. Republican Congressman Herbertson stated: "If it is said that our country's 60 million producers can bear the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the world, this is a mathematical error." While we can supply considerable food and medicine to alleviate famine and suffering, the economic fallacy assumes that we can revive the world. Republican Congressman Meyer mentioned Greece, believing that the country is the last remaining hope of democracy in the Balkans. However, Republican Congressman Hoffman warned that the United States should pay more attention to domestic affairs before American youth can be sent abroad to resolve disputes in Greece, the Balkans, and Iraq. Republican Congressman Buffett stated that future loans to Greece raise the question of whether the United States will continue to be played by Stalin in economic terms. For several years, the United States has poured tens of thousands of British pounds into China, France, and Yugoslavia, but who can say that these countries are further away from communism than they were two years ago?

### US Conscription Law to be Abolished at the End of the Month

Truman Advocates No Further Extension

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman today proposed to Congress that the conscription law be allowed to expire at the end of the month. The President's message stated that the purpose of the conscription's termination is to reduce the army to 1.7 million men by July 1.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] President Truman has sent a message to Congress requesting that the conscription law not be extended, but according to well-informed sources, this does not mean that the US government will abandon its compulsory military service system. It is expected that Truman will submit a compulsory military service bill to Congress in late March or early April.

[Report from this Newspaper] Although the Economic Supervisory Group has concluded its work, the economic investigation network responsible for monitoring the market and stabilizing prices is still actively carrying out its tasks. According to a report from the Supervisory Bureau yesterday, the bureau received a confidential report stating that Huang Hanliang, director of the Chung Hsing Bank in this city, was illegally buying and selling gold and US dollars.

However, the personnel of Abis Co. denied buying and selling gold and currency after the promulgation of the economic emergency measures, and claimed that it was not illegal to possess gold and currency. As for the rumor that the New Company and Abis Co. are joint companies and are related to this case, the company, which is engaged in the stock business, continued to operate yesterday.

Auckland was furious and claimed that he had never encountered such a thing in his 35 years in China and would definitely fire Li. Li then requested that he be paid three months' severance pay in accordance with the dismissal procedure. After arguing indecisively, he called the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to send someone to mediate. After some explanation, Li wrote a letter of repentance to express his apology for his improper attitude, and the 73,000 yuan difference was paid as usual. A storm subsided.

### YMCA Fundraising Conference: Celebrities Attend the Opening Ceremony; Mayor Wu's Wonderful Analogy of the "Taiji Diagram"; Speaker Pan Elaborates on "Serving Others"

[Report from this Newspaper] The 47th fundraising conference of the YMCA in this city was held at the Shanghai Sports Association on Maoming South Road, formerly the French General Association, at 12:00 noon yesterday. Mayor Wu served as the general captain of the fundraising campaign, and more than 500 celebrities from all walks of life participated. The conference was presided over by Dr. Gu Huiqing. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Kong Xiangxi, Ren Zhi, and Chen Ganchen, the general secretary of the association, gave speeches. There were also entertainment programs such as a solo by Xu Aijuan and a piano performance by Zeng Huixi. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and it did not end until 3:00 p.m.

Yesterday, Mayor Wu used the Taoist Taiji diagram as an analogy for today's society. He said: The Taiji diagram has two colors, black and white, which are symbols of darkness and light, and also indicate that there are two forces of good and evil in society. If the evil forces prevail, the world will be in great chaos. Therefore, everyone should have the determination to fight against the evil forces. In this era, to dispel darkness, we must improve people's hearts and support the good forces in society. The YMCA is a good force in today's society, so we must do our best to support it and make it thrive, so as to promote society to the path of truth, goodness, and beauty.

Speaker Pan said: Unity is strength in everything. Anything can be achieved if many people work together. On the contrary, if it only relies on the strength of a few people, even small things are difficult to succeed. Today, the YMCA has begun fundraising, and so many people have participated, so the result can be predicted. The purpose of the YMCA is "not to be served, but to serve." Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, social morality in our country has declined drastically. The only way to save it is to benefit the people with the spirit of "serving others." One of the twelve rules of the Kuomintang states that "helping others is the source of happiness." The true happiness in the world lies in sharing happiness with others. The YMCA has always been service-oriented, and we must cherish it. We deeply hope that this fundraising can be successful quickly, so that the YMCA's achievements can be promoted.

### The Qingpu Fifteen-Life Case Concludes: Witnesses, from Children to the Elderly, Appear in Court Kneeling and Begging for Justice; The Two Defendants Claim That Those Killed Were All Robbers

[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Zou Baoxian, the head of the Xi'an Township in the pseudo-Qingpu County, and others brutally murdering fifteen people from northern Jiangsu Province concluded in the High Court yesterday morning. The sentencing is scheduled for the morning of the 11th.

The case occurred on February 28, 34th year of the Republic. The plaintiffs, Gu Nianlin and others, sailed in small boats and anchored near the old Zhaihe River in Xiaoyin Township, Xi'an Township. Because it was the beginning of the lunar new year and there was no work to do, Gu's eldest daughter, Huang Gu's, eldest son-in-law, Huang Kaishan, second son-in-law, Zhou Zhenghong, and Cui Xiaogouzi, Ji Kejun, Ji Deng's, Liu Shizizi, Liu Xiaowuzi, Meng Er, Gu Changguan, Ji Bubi, Zhou Liu and his wife, Liu Jinzhi, and Liu Xiaoerzi, sixteen people in total, went ashore to pick grass for fuel.

At that time, Cui Xiaogouzi removed the bamboo fence of the villagers of Xiaoyin Township, and had a quarrel with Yang Ada, Chen Amu, and others. They then beat Xiaogouzi and others. Zhou Liu refused to accept this and argued with them. Yang Ada, Chen Amu, and others abandoned Cui Xiaogouzi and beat Zhou Liu, who was injured and died on the spot. Yang Ada and others knew that they had caused trouble, and reported to the township head Zou Baoxian. At the same time, Baozhang Xue Shunde beat the gong to gather a crowd of thirty to forty people, armed with shoulder poles and rakes, who surrounded and beat the victims. Except for Zhou Liu, who had already died, and Liu Xiaoerzi, who took the opportunity to escape, the remaining fourteen people were tied up. At night, Zou Baoxian, Yu Kesheng (township head of Xiaoyin Township), Xue Shunde (Baozhang of Xi'an Township), Yang Ada, Chen Kemu, and others discussed and inhumanely murdered all fourteen members of the Huang Gu family, including men, women, the old, and the young, to silence them. The case has been filed by the High Prosecutor's Office as a public prosecution for murder by traitors, and the High Court has opened trials to investigate. Zou Baoxian and Chen Amu were brought to trial yesterday morning, while Yu Kesheng, Xue Shunde, and Yang Ada are all at large. Zou stood in the defendant's dock, wearing a dark gray old silk-faced cotton robe, with a dejected look. Chen Amu stood to Zou's right. The victim's family, Gu Nianlin and others, more than ten people in total, sat in the audience. They were all old, weak, women, and children, wearing tattered clothes and looking haggard. Among them was a little girl of five or six years old, with white threads tied in her braids, who seemed to be an orphan of the victims.

Zou Baoxian confessed: The fifteen-life case did happen, but they were bandits, and the incident occurred in Xiaoyin Township. Chen Amu confessed: They were robbers who tied me up from my bed. President Xiao rebuked: You have confessed that you have no property and are working for others. What is the use of bandits binding you? Chen was speechless. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Gu Nianlin, was called to testify. Gu said: He is sixty-one years old and from Funing. He described the experience of being killed in detail. When he spoke of the sad part, he suddenly trembled all over, knelt down with a plop, burst into tears, unable to speak, and kept shouting "Justice, sir!" The court officials hurriedly invited three doctors and nurses from the prison hospital to take care of him. After the prosecutor requested that he be punished according to law, the lawyer appointed by the court, Lu Zongzhao, stood up to defend the defendant. The court ruled that the case would be sentenced on the morning of the 11th. The defendant's request to meet with his family was denied, and he was still escorted back to Zhongjian Prison.

### Li Qingping in Prison: Unable to Spend the Spring; Confined Behind Iron Bars, Her Beauty Becomes More Gaunt

Li Qingping, a young female painter, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of being a traitor last summer after holding an art exhibition in Shanghai. She was interrogated once, but the date of her retrial has not yet been set. During Qingping's initial trial, she used her eloquent tongue to offer various ingenious defenses to the judge, stating, "My life is dedicated to art; if one has art, why be a traitor?" To understand her life behind bars, a reporter specifically visited the Tilanqiao Women's Prison to inquire. With the permission of the prison section chief, we were led on a tour by Director Zhuang of the Supervisory Section. Female traitors are housed on the second floor, several sharing a room. The floors of the rooms are extremely clean, and each room is equipped with a bed and a flush toilet. Because the female traitors are awaiting trial, they are forbidden from receiving visitors according to orders from above, so the reporter could only stand outside the main railing and look inside. Through the small window, Li Qingping was seen wearing a light blue Western-style suit, her face even more gaunt than during the trial. According to the reporter's inquiries, they are not allowed to read newspapers or bring in books, and of course, they have no way to paint for recreation. Li Qingping's life consists of waking up early and going to bed late, doing morning exercises on the rooftop terrace, and talking with the other female traitors to pass the day.

[Report from our Newspaper] The Changning Road Branch Bureau learned late the day before yesterday that a bloody incident had occurred in Zhongshan Park and that the injured person had been sent to Renai Hospital. After investigation, it was learned that the injured person, named Wang Yujiong, was a lieutenant investigator of the Military Police. Last summer, a labor dispute occurred at the Anle Woolen Mill on Changning Road, and he went to mediate, so he was familiar with both labor and management. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, someone suddenly called Wang in the name of Deng Zhongyuan, the manager of the factory, and arranged to meet at the Rongkang Restaurant in Jing'an Temple at 7:00 PM. Upon arrival, he met a Zhang Yinqing, who claimed to be Deng's representative. Zhang told Wang that Deng's son had recently been kidnapped, and Deng wanted to trouble Wang to represent him in contacting the kidnappers, who had scheduled negotiations tonight on the lawn of St. John's University. After tea for more than ten minutes, they took a rickshaw to the university, where they stayed for two hours without seeing anyone. They then walked to Zhongshan Park for a rest. Zhang suddenly took Wang by surprise, pulled out a dagger, and stabbed him in the back of the head. As Wang attempted to draw his gun to retaliate, Zhang struck a second time, injuring a wrist and causing Wang to drop his firearm. The pistol was activated during the fall, however no injuries occurred. Wang fled to the toilet and was later escorted to the hospital by the patrolling police. Section Chief Shi and others went to the Anle Factory and other places late at night to investigate and apprehend the culprit but were unsuccessful. At around 6:00 AM, Zhang happened to pass by the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Changning Road and was finally arrested by the officers involved. A light blue cloth mask, a bunch of keys, a dagger, and a pistol (taken from Wang), and two rows of bullets were found on his person. He was taken to the bureau for questioning. He confessed to being 20 years old, from Jiangyin, and a trainee at the Anle Factory, but was actually a foreman. He confessed to stabbing Wang. It is reported that the contents of the case are complex and are still under investigation.

On the company's orders, he accompanied the vehicle to protect it and unfortunately sacrificed his life.

### Young Woman Unhappily Falls into Prostitution; Deeply Repents and Asks Legal Experts to Open a Path to Rehabilitation

To the Editor: I am a poor, pitiful girl, 17 years old. Unfortunately, I lost my father, and my home is desperately impoverished. My father's burial was difficult, and I thought and thought but could not find a solution. My kind mother, unable to bear it any longer, actually sold me for 1 million yuan to another person to pay for my father's burial for a term of two years. Now, the person holding me is forcing me into prostitution, causing my body and soul to suffer all the pain in the world. I am weak and helpless, and there is no one to turn to. I am truly at the end of my rope, trapped in despair. In this time of loudly proclaiming "democracy," such a heinous act is harmful to social morals and human ethics. Your newspaper has always provided a service to society and is a mouthpiece for the people. It will certainly be able to grant a corner of its pages to expose this situation, to uphold justice, and to help me find a "lighthouse" in the vast ocean. I would be deeply grateful! I humbly present a few points, please enlighten me as follows: (1) Will the person holding me be subject to legal sanctions for forcing me into prostitution? (2) I have been a prostitute for nearly a year, and the 1 million yuan deposit has long been exceeded, but I have no way to save up money to redeem myself. Do I have the right to leave? (3) Can I publish a statement in the newspaper declaring my withdrawal from prostitution? Can I get legal support? Yours sincerely, Junli from Suzhou, February 10, Changshu.

[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) The person holding you is guilty of a crime against public morals under the criminal law. (2) Using a person as collateral is illegal, so there is no need to mention the issue of redemption money when leaving. (3) Publishing a statement in the newspaper is of no help. It is best to seek assistance from the Women's Association or the police station.

### Reply to Readers

(2) To Mr. Sheng Nan: The Qingxia Relief Fund is temporarily limited to this city, so your request is difficult to process.

(3) To Mr. Chen Qiren: According to a letter from Mr. Lin Huaguo, if your daughter has a foot disease and it is indeed athlete's foot, applying Huatuo Ointment three or five times will cure it. This is his personal experience. I am informing you specifically.

### Chinese Artist's Woodcut Exhibition in London

[British Information Office, London, 3rd] The Contemporary Chinese Woodcut Exhibition, initiated by the Chinese Ministry of Information, opened at the China Society here today and is scheduled to last for three weeks. The exhibits are wartime woodcuts collected by the Chinese Woodcut Artists Association. The purpose of the exhibition is to "allow British art colleagues to learn how China used woodcuts during the war and how Chinese woodcut artists continued to engage in art despite the harsh environment." The woodcuts are the works of more than 40 artists, most of whom are not professional woodcut artists. In fact, some are painters, some are sculptors, and some use woodcuts as a pastime. Since the artists are not professional experts and lack the necessary tools and equipment during the war, their work is extremely difficult, which makes this exhibition even more colorful. There are no fewer than 118 woodcuts on display, including 20 by Wang Zhi (transliteration below), 13 by Lu Tian, and 7 by Ci Ziwen. The themes and styles are different, proving that Chinese woodcut artists have reached a very high standard. At the same time, various aspects of Chinese life and its people are vividly presented in the woodcuts. The visitors who came to the exhibition were moved by the high style and realism of the works.

[Our Report] In the Second Basketball League, there were three matches last night. In the women's division, the Women's Youth Purple team defeated the Power team with a score of 44 to 17, which was no longer related to the overall situation. In the men's Division 1, the Sealand Blue team defeated the Giants. The Foreign Legion fought among themselves. The Giants were greatly affected because the star player Pi Gaonai did not come and Gu Fo was absent in the first half. The result was 53 to 48. In the final match, the Chinese United team defeated the Railway Beijing team with a score of 64 to 39. The battle of the Foreign Legion was the most exciting of the three matches, and more than 500 spectators were extremely excited.

Women's Youth Purple Defeats Power Team

Qian Chuping of the Women's Youth Purple team opened the scoring, and Zhu Jinjin made a free throw. Gu Liqian of the Power team scored five points, surpassing them to make the score 3 to 5. Then Chu Ping Wu and Hua Wu of the Women's Youth Purple team each scored a goal, and the first quarter ended with a score of 11 to 5, with the Women's Youth Purple team winning. In the second quarter, the three players scored another eleven points, and the Power team was stuck without any points, making the score 22 to 5. The third quarter was still tense, and the score was 34 to 9. At the end of the fourth quarter, the Women's Youth Purple team defeated the Power team with a score of 44 to 17.

Sealand Blue Defeats Giants

In the battle between the Giants and the Sealand Blue team, the Giants seemed to lose their souls due to the absence of Gu Fo and Pi Gaonai. Kaijie Milov also put on his uniform and came on the court, but it was still difficult to resist the frenzied attack of the Sealand Blue team. When Hailu Haiflu and Peter Jones scored 13 points, the Giants only scored 3 points. Funik scored three goals and made two free throws, but the difference was still wide. In the first half, the Sealand Blue team had a significant advantage with a score of 27 to 15.

In the second half, Gu Fo arrived and Qiang Dulai replaced N Sasha Sijin, intending to reorganize their forces and revive themselves. After Funik and Gu Fo each scored two goals, the score gradually approached (32 to 23). Tao Bolingji was good at operating, and when the score was 35 to 27, the difference was only 8 points. The Giants called a timeout, wanting to make a move. Funik carried the ball inside and scored, and Qiang She Lai followed, making the score 37 to 31, a difference of 6 points. At this time, the two armies fought hand-to-hand, and the movements resembled wrestling. Peter Men of the Sealand Blue team was the pillar of the whole team, commanding the battle, and calmly coping with the tense situation. The report said that in the last four minutes, the score was 48 to 41. At one minute and 30 seconds, it was 53 to 46. Fulu was called for a foul and graduated, and was replaced by Boss. In the last three seconds, Bo also got sick. Four people fought to the end, and the result was 53 to 48. It was quite difficult for Sealand Blue to win.

Chinese United Defeats Railway Beijing

The Chinese United team competed against the Railway Beijing team in the third match. Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, and Bao Songyuan of the Chinese United team competed for shots, and Gao County scored eight points. Yang Xian of the Railway Beijing team broke the record. In the first half, the score was 31 to 14. Seeing that there was a lack of stimulation, most of the fans withdrew.

When the sides changed again, Zhang Liangxiong of the Chinese United team replaced Chen Xuechong. Last night, Li Zhenzhong sat under the scoring board in plain clothes as an observer. When the score was 37 to 20, Xue Chong replaced Songyuan. After that, Jiang Guoping and Sheng Dongyu of the Railway Beijing team scored enough points to compete with the Chinese United team, but the Chinese United team was deeply rooted and still defeated the Railway Beijing team with a score of 64 to 39.

### Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team to Visit Southern China, Hong Kong, and Macau in Mid-Month

Since the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team was organized and established by Mr. Qu Yaokang last year, it has successively competed against the leading Chinese and Western teams in the city and won all the matches with brilliant results. The team originally planned to go to the United States, but due to various problems, it could not be resolved, so it was shelved. Recently, the Shanghai Star Team decided to go to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou first. This matter has been negotiated and arranged by the team leader, Mr. Qu Yaokang. Team leader Qu was originally scheduled to take a China Airlines flight to Hong Kong first yesterday, but temporarily changed the flight due to the inferior climate in Hong Kong, and left Shanghai on a flight at 9:30 AM this morning.

At 3:25 PM yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu Guozhen inquired about the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team's visit to the United States and Southern China, and summoned Qu Yaokang to the Municipal Government for a face-to-face consultation. Mayor Wu was very concerned about the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team's visit. In order to facilitate the team, the Foreign Affairs Office specially prepared letters of certification and sent them to the governors of Hong Kong and Macau and the mayor of Guangzhou. As for the passport issue for the visit to the United States, it was promised that after the visit to Hong Kong was completed, a request would be made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply for the passport. The Mayor also gave encouragement to the team's trip. The meeting ended at 3:30 PM.

In addition to team leader Qu leaving first this morning, the Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team will depart by China Airlines flight in mid-month. The full list is recorded below:

Qu Yaokang (Team Leader), Xi Chuanming (Executive), Lu Hanjun (Captain), Wang Youxin, Wang Changhou, Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, Huang Zhijun.

### Notes by the Basketball Court

When the two Foreign Legion strong teams met in the Basketball League, only 60% of the seats in the Municipal Gymnasium were occupied last night, which can be said to be unexpected. Basketball fans who know the sport should not miss this great battle.

At the start of the match, the Giants could not prevent Fulak, the center of the Sealand Blue team, from grabbing the ball under the basket because Gu Fo was absent, causing Fulak and Blok to take things as if they were taking things out of a bag, and the score created a situation of ten to one, nineteen to three, and even twenty-six to eight.

After thirteen to three, the Generals of the Giants fell into panic, and frequently made futile long-range shots. Tao Bolingji's mid-range shooting was nineteen off. At this time, the Giants completely collapsed, only being beaten and not being able to talk about defensive tactics.

In the first half, the Sealand Blue team led by as many as twelve points. At the beginning of the second half, Gu Fo arrived, and the Giants had one more tall player, gaining an advantage in ball possession. Funik was dedicated to guarding Fulak at this basket, and the difference between the two was only two inches. Gu Fo was responsible for initiating the counterattack, and Funik and Gu Fo each scored, and the score was forced to 30 to 15, and then to 30 to 21. When the score was 35 to 25, Tao Boling and Funik each scored a goal, and the Giants were only six points behind. There were still nine minutes left, which was the only good opportunity to reverse the situation in yesterday's match, but the Giants were unable to control and utilize it.

When the score was forced to 53 to 46, Fulak was fouled and left the court, and there was only one minute left. Before long, Blok was also penalized, and the Giants only added two points by Kayno Milov to complete the match.

If Gu Fo had been on the court all the time, the situation would have changed and it would have been difficult to predict. Since the Giants have been defeated again and again, the championship will become a situation where the Chinese United, Sealand Blue, and Shantou teams compete against each other. (Chang Nian)

Yesterday, both bulls and bears on the Hua stock market proceeded cautiously. Besides some mutual liquidation, there was no unusual activity. The market was generally stable during the morning session. In the afternoon, news spread that the police bureau had withdrawn its monitoring personnel, and buying interest gradually increased, suddenly displaying unusual brilliance.

### The Silverware Industry Quietly Awaits Its Fate; Some Are Temporarily Dealing in Refined Silver

The national silverware industry's joint petition delegation returned to Shanghai from Beijing and held a congress of representatives from various regions in Shanghai. As a result of the discussion, all the representatives from various regions, except for one person from each region who remained in Shanghai for liaison purposes, returned to their respective places to report the proceedings. However, although the authorities sympathized with the current situation of the silverware industry as a result of this petition, they were particularly considering ways to make accommodations. However, the industry has been closed for a long time, and the expenses such as staff salaries are huge, so the losses are quite large. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly decide on improvement measures. It is learned that some of the smaller silverware shops in Shanghai have declared liquidation due to their inability to maintain operations. There are also some small silverware shops that have temporarily engaged in buying and selling refined silver and setting gems for customers in order to maintain their current livelihood. According to people in the industry, if the authorities still do not announce a solution in the short term, it is feared that a small number of silverware shops will be forced to liquidate.

### Insurance Industry's Premium Income Can Reach 10 Billion Per Month

[Our Newspaper] According to Lo Pak-chen, chairman of the National Federation of Insurance Business Associations, his estimates are that the monthly premium income of the national insurance industry has now reached the target of 10 billion yuan. Currently, the insurance industry is planning to initiate the organization of a general insurance group in order to seek to absorb premiums, diversify risks, and avoid the outflow of profits. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has recently improved its tax collection methods for the insurance industry. For example, business tax is now collected according to the amount of capital, and stamp tax is changed to a tiered fixed tax rate. In addition, the China Trust Bureau's price index insurance advocated by Mr. Lo had a total premium income of more than 45 billion yuan last month. Because the cost of living index has been frozen, the index on which the bureau is based has also been frozen. However, he is currently considering how to make appropriate adjustments based on the monthly price differences announced by the Bureau of Social Affairs.

### Ping Shui Colourless "Taipan" Brand Officially Sells the First Batch

The "Ping Shui" Colourless "Taipan" brand tea, which is sold to the Americas, has been frequently inquired about by the Shanghai Tea Company in this city regarding the new tea from the 35th year. At present, a batch of about several hundred boxes has been officially sold, with a price of 450,000 yuan per dan. The market atmosphere is still very stable. It is learned that the company still has a batch that is currently being negotiated with the Chiu Hing Tea Company. It is said that the two sides are not far apart, and the problem can be solved smoothly. As for other varieties such as Special Grade and Special Eyebrow, each has its own supply and demand, and the process is lively. As for black tea, which is watched by British export houses, the situation is again stagnant because the importers are suppressing prices and the suppliers are reluctant to sell. Domestic sales of red and green tea are scarce, and the market is as calm as ever.

### Tea Purchase Problem; Hope for Early Resolution

The government ordered the Central Bank to purchase tea at the end of the lunar year last year to alleviate the difficulties of tea merchants and approved the purchase center price. More than two months have passed, but it has not been realized. In the blink of an eye, the Qingming Festival is approaching, and the new tea is on the market. The old tea has not been sold, and how will the new tea develop? This issue is not only a concern for the tea industry itself, but also for those who are concerned about international trade. According to the tea industry, the recent official market price is 1 million yuan to 850,000 yuan for Qimen tea, 515,000 yuan to 460,000 yuan for Pinglu tea, and 610,000 yuan for Red tea. Since the responsible authorities do not allow the requested price increase, it seems that they can allow tea merchants with sales capabilities to prepare funds to redeem the pledged tea, so as to avoid delaying the time and causing stagnation.

[Also] The executive committee of the Export Promotion Committee, because most of the executive committee members are designated, so except for the chairman, Pei Tsu-yi, who resigned due to his resignation as the president of the Central Bank, there is expected to be no change. However, the committee will also not convene an executive committee meeting within a week due to the transition between the old and the new.

### Coal Market Continues to Weaken

The market for bituminous coal fines is continuing to weaken due to the period of coal allocation and distribution, and the market price is falling again. Although the trend of bituminous coal lumps is relatively stable, the market price has also slightly declined. Only the high-grade white coal lumps are still standing firm at the peak price due to the scarcity of arrivals. Low-grade goods are also affected by the weakness of bituminous coal and have slightly declined. Although there is a shortage of white coal fines in the market, sales are also sluggish due to the high price. Charcoal is generally squeezed down due to the slump in the coal market.

### Rice Market Digests Plainly; Prices of Miscellaneous Grains Turn Weak

Yesterday, the rice market had a strong source and digested plainly, with a total of more than 18,000 shih arriving. The price of japonica rice in the north and south was high, flat, and successively reduced, and the middle and lower returns were small by more than 1,000 yuan. White yuan was firm, and Yin yuan had no honor or disgrace. Indica rice was in a flat and weak position.

The oil market was quite turbulent. Raw materials fell, the market was sluggish, soybean oil fell by 10,000 yuan, raw oil fell sharply by 20,000 yuan, clear oil fell sharply by more than 20,000 yuan, and sesame oil also fell by 10,000 yuan.

The transaction of soybean cake was scarce, and the market form was not good. Northeast and Yangtze River soybeans are gradually pouring in, the digestion is clear and loose, the market situation continues to go downstream, and the price falls by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Sesame also showed softening and returned to a small 3,000-5,000 yuan. The sale of raw kernels was also sluggish, and the price fell by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Broad beans were extremely sluggish, and the price fell sharply by 10,000 yuan. Green beans also fell by a small 3,000-5,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed the decline by 1,000 yuan. However, red beans were uniquely strong, rising in price by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and were still smart. Cowpeas were firm. The powder market became weaker due to the arrival of Changxi Benfen, and the price fell by a small 1,000 yuan. Foreign rice followed the trend and was flat and soft. Wheat bran, in rural villages, was looking forward to the supply of relief wheat bran, and people's hearts were weak, falling by 1,000 yuan. Today, the prices of various grains have fallen unanimously.

### First Batch of Edible Oil Distributed

7,300 dan of soybean oil

[Our Newspaper] The Sheng Hai Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office has already distributed 1,100 dan of sesame oil and 7,300 dan of soybean oil in the first cycle since the resumption of oil distribution. If the delivery procedures for this batch of edible oil can be completed before this Friday, the second cycle of edible oil distribution can be started on Saturday.

### Oil Market Calms Down

The Shanghai Edible Oil Business Association received instructions from Mayor Wu and the director of the Food Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating that the recent rise in the oil market in Shanghai was purely due to merchants manipulating transactions. The authorities maintained the distribution volume of legitimate civilian edible oil and would never interrupt it, so it would never be affected. It is hoped that the industry will quickly investigate and rectify itself and not engage in illegal transactions. The association will notify all members separately to investigate and put on record, so the oil market turned calm yesterday.

### 10,000 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Are Distributed Monthly, Maintaining a Flat Price

[Our Newspaper] Wu Chao-hung, chairman of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, recently made a statement regarding the report that the distribution price of Taiwan sugar would be adjusted. He said that the company has always恪守 the price stabilization policy of the Resources Committee, and the distribution price has not only been lower than the market price, but also has been stable. And the monthly distribution quantity is also enough for the needs of the city. The company's distribution quantity is still maintained at 10,000 tons per month. The average monthly distribution is four times, that is, each issue is still distributed four times, that is, each issue is still distributed 2,500 tons. As for the supply of sugar to public education personnel, the company negotiated with the Bureau of Social Affairs in both Beijing and Shanghai separately, and the company delivered sugar to the Capital Consumption Supply Office and the Shanghai Public Education Personnel Consumption Cooperative on a monthly basis, which was converted into a flat-price distribution.

### Rayon Continues to Trend Downward; The Market is Full of Selling

Yesterday's rayon market was full of喊聲 in the black market because all the silk shops had to pay taxes and deliver fixed orders, and they were eager to sell. The asking price continued to trend downward. No. 120 Takayama Shiny opened at 7.1 million yuan in the morning and closed at 6.9 million yuan, a decrease of 400,000 yuan from the previous day. Semi-gloss and other grades were scarce and the asking price remained the same. Factory business also fell yesterday. Foreign firms had no transactions. Grade B was quoted at 8.3 million yuan and there was no reply. Grade B of user silk was opened at 7.6 million yuan, a decrease of 300,000 yuan from the transaction price of foreign firms the previous day. There were few openings for the remaining grades, and the asking price also decreased by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The transaction of silk goods was still silent, and the asking price mostly remained unchanged.

### Silk Exports This Year

Can Maintain a Ratio of 8 to 2

[Our Newspaper] The joint meeting to decide this year's spring silk plan has not yet been decided due to changes in the personnel of the Central Bank. According to the business department of the China Silkworm Company, the basic standpoint of the China Silkworm Company is to take into account the costs of silkworm farmers and manufacturers, thereby assisting them in their development, and the amount of future loans is planned to be 90% of the actual needs. As for exports, some silk fabrics can be sold to Southeast Asia, and the bulk of exports to the United States is still raw silk. The acqusition of foreign exchange is of course more cost-effective in raw materials. However, the quality and color of domestic products do not fit the American society, and at the same time, the United States also has a large number of factories, so its demand for foreign countries is raw materials rather than finished products. Moreover, the production capacity cannot meet the needs of other countries. Therefore, the ratio of silk exports this year will not exceed a ratio of 8 to 2.

### Too High Production Costs; Intestine Casing Exports Are Difficult

[Our Newspaper] Since the Central Bank's exchange rate for the pound sterling has been lowered, the export material that has encountered the same difficulties as tung oil is the intestine casing exporter. The price of the intestine casing to Europe was originally higher than that of New York, but due to the shortening of the British exchange rate, it is now equal to the New York market price. According to the New York market price a month ago, the price per pair fell from US$0.62 to US$0.50 to US$0.52, and the market situation was quite weak. The converted national currency of light intestine per barrel of 1,250 pairs is about 7.8 million yuan. After deducting freight and other expenses of about 1 million yuan, the total is 6.8 million yuan. However, the manufacturing cost of Shanghai intestine, the purchase price of fresh intestine per pair is 2,400 yuan, and the production cost of each type is 7.6 million yuan. In fact, it is higher than the foreign market price, and export is difficult. It is estimated that the minimum monthly export volume of intestine casing can reach 700 barrels, and the annual export volume is 8,000 barrels, which can be exchanged for US$52 million, which is not a small amount. However, according to the current solution to the difficulties, the purchase price of fresh intestine should be lowered to within 2,000 yuan per pair, so that the production cost can be reduced, and the production funds of manufacturers can be revitalized as much as possible. If the financial industry can provide a large amount of loans, designate its export to settle the bandit and recover its principal and interest, then the export prospects should be improved.

### Tung Oil Trends Downward; Prices in Producing Areas Remain Firm

[Our Newspaper] According to a merchant in this city, the recent tung oil market situation is that because the price of the pound sterling has been lowered, the cost of shipping to British regions in Europe is equivalent to a 20% discount, which is almost the same as the New York market price. If calculated at £220 per ton, the converted price per city dan is 440,000 yuan. After deducting interest, taxes, freight, insurance, etc., the export price per city dan is at most 340,000 yuan. The New York market price is US$0.37, and the current price converted to national currency is 444,000 yuan. After deducting foreign expenses, it can only be exported to 360,000 yuan. Today's tung oil market is hit by this sudden blow from exports. Although the asking price is around 400,000 yuan per dan, I am afraid there is still a downward trend. The yesterday market price in Hankow was 398,000 to 400,000 yuan, Chongqing was 300,000 yuan, and Zhejiang (Hangzhou) was 380,000 yuan. Tunxi was 360,000 yuan.

### Four Banks Approved a Loan of 5 Billion to Purchase Northern Jiangsu National Cotton

The Great Life Textile Company previously applied for a loan of 20 billion yuan to purchase national cotton from Northern Jiangsu. The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs transferred the loan to the Four Banks for approval. It is now learned that because the National Bank has not established an institution in Nantong, the Four Banks approved the National Bank to deposit 5 billion yuan in the Bank of China in Nantong first in the form of consignment. The local Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will provide loan to each yarn factory according to a ratio of 3:3:2:2 for cotton collection. The target will be handled by each factory designated by the Textile Management Committee.

### Before Peace and Order Are Restored, the Central Bank's Policies Will Not Change Suddenly; Secretary Kim's Statement to Reporters

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Chang Chia-ngau, the president of the Central Bank. Chang had not yet arrived at the office, so he spoke with his secretary, Kim Hou-cheng. Kim said that Chang had given a detailed talk on his views on the current economic and financial situation in China on the day he took office. Moreover, the National Government has just promulgated a new economic emergency measures plan, and the Central Bank should also complete its mission under the overall strategy. Kim believes that there is no lack of criticism from the outside world on the various economic measures implemented by President Song in the past, but most of them are irresponsible criticisms. Now, because domestic peace and order have not yet been restored, the national revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced for a while. During this period, it is often difficult for the Central Bank to drastically change its previous policies. He hopes that after the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the intricate and complex relationship between the entire international community can be clarified, so that the issue of domestic peace and order in China can move from emotional to rational resolution. Then other secondary issues can also be resolved at the same time.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Rise; The Authorities' Admonitions Have No Effect; The Market Has to Close Early

Yesterday, the yarn market saw an even bigger surge, because the textile construction allocation on the previous day was insufficient, causing buying interest from all parties. In addition, weaving factories frequently added allocations for 20s and 42s, causing all counts to rise by 100,000 to 200,000, so that the transaction price has exceeded the textile construction listed price by 5%. The chairman of the Yarn Business Association, Tang Chi-liang, and the two committee members, Wu and Gu, warned the industry in public to abide by the price limit for buying and selling, so as to avoid government interference. However, although the words were earnest, they could not curb the rising trend, so they had to ring the bell to close the market early.

The initial opening of the cotton cloth market for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was flat, and the price per piece was still 153,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the yarn market was performing well, and the price of cloth sold by the textile construction company was higher for the stacked list than for the spot, which made the buying interest stronger and people's hearts firmer. Longtou cloth rose step by step, and finally reached 160,000 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan from the previous day. The prices of other brands also followed up by 3,000-5,000 yuan. However, there was a glut of 190 American Shilin spot goods, and the price was down by a small 10,000, to 370,000 yuan. The market for colored cloth, serge, etc. was firm.

### Yarn Business Association Holds a Meeting to Study the Reasons for the Surge

[Our Newspaper] After the authorities stipulated that the transaction price of the cotton yarn market in this city should not exceed 5% of the listed price of national and private yarn factories, the past transaction situation was quite able to abide by the regulations. However, in recent days, the Valley Factory has not opened much yarn, and the demand from customers is eager. Yesterday at around 11:30 a.m., there were not many sellers in the market, but there were still many buyers raising prices to collect yarn, and there were cases where the legal profit exceeded 5%. The market manager felt that the responsibility was too heavy, so he asked the person in charge of the yarn and cloth group of the Economic Supervision Team for instructions. It was believed that transactions that exceeded the legal profit should be strictly cracked down. If there are still exceeding cases today, the market should be suspended for one day. After hearing the news, the Yarn Business Association immediately convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and they all believed that the suspension of the market would lead to adverse consequences such as fluctuations in yarn prices, which did not seem to be a good policy. They then consulted with the person in charge of the yarn team again. It was heard that the person in charge said that he could not be responsible for the consequences of the suspension of the market, so it was decided to open the market today. However, the directors and supervisors of the Yarn Business Association and the person in charge of the yarn and cloth team decided to convene a meeting at 9:30 a.m. today to study the reasons for the surge in cotton yarn prices in order to find a solution.

### Jinyun Mountain Foothills, Jialing River Banks: A Scenic Corner of the Capital, Beibei Under Construction

— Chongqing Airmail, February 18th, Peng Zi

Eight years of war once transformed Beibei, following the changes of Chongqing City, into the unique darling of the Southwest. It changed from a country bumpkin to a most modern girl, from a desolate wasteland to a civilized city, and from a suburb with the most backward education to the pagoda of a cultural zone. Xiaba, on its opposite bank, is one of the famous "higher cultural sites" of Sichuan Province, while "Beiquan," on its left, is a renowned scenic spot praised by everyone.

Source of Culture, Avenue of Construction: The flames of war brought prosperity to the entire Southwest, and Chongqing became the center of administration and commerce during the war of resistance. Hundreds of millions of people came from the endless Yangtze River to this mountain city shrouded in misty seasons, and even more millions transferred to Beibei. Many people left traces of their fleeting lives here, and many spent their leisurely years in this embrace surrounded by mountains and rivers.

Beibei, full of vitality and a source of life, this beautiful scenic area on the banks of the Jialing River has expanded. Politically, it has independently become a provincial-level institution – the Beibei Administrative Bureau. Thus, this place was once the "Second Lushan" for party and state dignitaries, and men of letters and poets, to build "waterside residences" or perhaps "seek ancient books." As a famous cultural and scenic area, strangers would fantasize about it as a miracle that could not be painted. The relocation of several institutions of higher learning is painstakingly opening up the source of culture in this corner of the Bashu mountains and rivers.

Today, after the war of resistance ended and institutions moved eastward, perhaps taking away more of Beibei's population, this city, nurtured by culture, is embarking on the avenue of construction under industrial prosperity. The massive project of the Dashiliang Hydropower Plant, the direct tramway to Yubei, and the Jialing River Bridge – these are all worth mentioning.

Electrifying Eastern Sichuan: Relying on Beibei

Following the Tennessee Valley Authority project, every corner of China is actively harnessing rivers and utilizing hydropower. The Jialing River is one of the faster-flowing rivers in Sichuan Province. From Hechuan downstream, from Xixiakou to Beibei, the water is steep and dangerous, with natural rock formations, resembling the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Although the mountains and water power are not as majestic, the local residents call it the "Little Three Gorges," that is, the Three Gorges on the Jialing River. After successive inspections and surveys by American hydraulic engineers and experts specially dispatched by the Water Resources Commission of our Executive Yuan, it was determined that the water power could be utilized to build a large hydropower plant. Starting from Dashiliang on the upper reaches of Beibei, three dam base caves will be built, each 50 meters deep. The above-ground dam construction will involve 1.4 million cubic meters of stone. The entire project can be completed in three years. During floods, it can generate 80,000 kilowatts, and during low water, it can generate 60,000 kilowatts. All construction expenses were negotiated by Mr. Lu Zuofu, General Manager of Minsheng Company, and it was decided that the project would be jointly invested by Minsheng Company, the Resources Commission, and the Canadian government. Based on current living standards, it is estimated to require US$8 million. Eight generators, each with a capacity of 10,000 kilowatts, have been ordered in the United States. The experts in charge of the project will be selected by the Canadian government and our Executive Yuan. The Beibei Administrative Bureau is currently mobilizing laborers to build the dam base, and it is expected to officially commence construction next spring. Once this hydropower plant on the Jialing River is completed, it will likely supply electricity to Chongqing and the counties along both banks of the Jialing River, making the eastern part of Sichuan a small electrified world. At the same time, it can regulate floods and droughts on both banks of the Jialing River. Upstream of the Little Three Gorges, large inland river ships of up to 3,500 tons can navigate.

Under the principle of developing Beibei's electrification and construction, it is planned to build a direct tramway to Yubei, starting from the Dashiliang Hydropower Plant area in Beibei and ending in the eastern suburbs of Yubei. Following a straight line, the entire journey will be only 40 kilometers, and the tram ride will take only two hours. All construction costs and plans will be shared by the Beibei and Yubei authorities, and construction can also commence next spring. Public servants and teachers will be given a 20% or half-price discount, making future Beibei a weekend getaway for public servants and teachers in Yubei and making future Beibei the center of electrification in eastern Sichuan.

Building a Bridge, Adding Scenic Spots

There has never been a bridge across the north and south banks of the Jialing River. Therefore, the Beibei local authorities plan to build a Jialing River Bridge to connect direct traffic between Beibei and Xiaba. Surveying began several months ago. The highest flood level is 52 feet, and the lowest water level is 8 feet. The total length is approximately 1,000 meters. The water-inundated stone beam next to the hydropower plant is used as the east bank bridge base point. Work has already begun to fill the stone foundations of the bridge piers on both banks, and it can be completed in one year.

The historical and cultural landscapes of forests and springs are the unique advantages of Beibei as a scenic cultural area. In addition to the Beiquan Park Management Office separately established for Beiquan, Mr. Lu Zuofu, General Manager of Minsheng Company, and local gentry Mr. Wu Congju have invested in repairing all the historical sites and scenic spots in Beiquan, most of which are in good condition and truly spectacular. General tourists, appreciating the scenic spots, all have a feeling of beauty and longing. However, there are still a few scenic spots, such as the Feilai Pavilion on the highest peak of the park, which has been damaged. Overlooking the outside scenery of the park from there, it resembles a summary of a legal case. The Baiting Pavilion under the pavilion, which was inscribed by President Yu Youren as Qingshan Lvshui Baiting Pavilion, is also preparing to be renovated and become a standard weekend getaway for public servants and teachers in Chongqing. Beibei has built a new National Assembly Hall, which is magnificent in scale, only lacking the equipment for heating and cooling pipes.

The prospect of sports and culture is to expand on the existing good foundation, which can be divided into two parts. One is to add various facilities to the "People's Sports Field" and increase indoor facilities, and regularly hold sports meets. Expanding the library and science museum: "Beibei Library" is a spiritual food storehouse in Beibei, with a collection of more than 400,000 books, and some books that are now out of print. In fact, the museum was the "Minsheng Company Employee Library." Recently, it was invited by the Beibei authorities to move, which is also due to the close relationship between the Beibei administrators and Lu Zuofu. Therefore, in terms of Beibei's construction, Minsheng Company's achievements are paramount. In the future, it is planned to expand it and become a standard library in Sichuan Province. Beibei Science Museum, now renamed "China Western Museum," has a rich collection, collecting all kinds of special products related to the west and the country, especially the large-scale models in the mineral and mechanical exhibition rooms, which are exquisite. It is planned to expand and enrich it: it is one of the important parts of the Beibei construction plan. The Canadian government recently informed Lu Zuofu that it will donate a modern small mechanical model to the "China Western Museum." Soon, it will be brought back by the new Minsheng Company ship, which will be of great help in enriching the cultural development of Beibei.

Expanding Industry, Developing Minerals

The Beibei jurisdiction originally had the largest mining combination in Sichuan Province – Tianfu Coal Mine Company, which mines in Baimiaozi and Houfengyan in the Beibei jurisdiction. The company has its own railway, 30 kilometers long. The mining volume and mineral quality are the best in Sichuan Province. There is also Fuyuan Coal Mine Company in Xixiakou, north of Beibei, and Daming Textile Factory in the western part of the urban area, covering an area of about 100 acres and employing thousands of workers, which can be expanded due to the power generation of the "Dashiliang Hydropower Plant," making Beibei electrified and industrialized.

Enriching the cadres at all levels in Beibei and making them the backbone of the future northern region is also one of the most important policies of the Beibei authorities. The past cultural development has laid a foundation. The Beibei Children's Welfare Area of the Ministry of Social Affairs is perfectly constructed and is a model in primary school education. The secondary school has the famous Jianshan Middle School in eastern Sichuan, which is run by Lu Zuofu and can also be said to be indirectly presided over by the Beibei authorities. In addition, there are national women's teacher's affiliated middle schools, Mianren Lixin Senior Commercial Vocational School, etc. Higher education has the Xianghui College in Xiaba, which are all ideal construction cadres for the Beibei authorities. At the same time, running public schools by local authorities is also part of the plan.

"Building Beibei, Electrifying Eastern Sichuan" can be realized in just three years. The local authorities are currently doing their best to look forward to a bright future.

### Hidden Worries of the Food Adjustment Agency: A Glimpse of the Zhenjiang Flour Mill

— Zhenjiang Express News, February 2nd, Our Reporter Ge Xianglin

The Zhenjiang Flour Mill is the only large factory in the provincial capital. The reporter recently visited the factory and was accompanied by the factory to tour the various departments of the factory.

Magnificent Appearance, Beautiful Environment

The factory site is located in the northwest of Zhenjiang, covering an area of more than 50 acres. The factory buildings are quite spacious, with a five-story steel-concrete machine room that can accommodate machines producing 7,000 bags of flour per day, standing on the Xinhe River embankment. In Zhenjiang, it is considered the tallest and largest building. There are more than a dozen large warehouses, all surrounding the machine room, which can accommodate nearly 200,000 large bags of wheat, 300,000 bags of flour, and 100,000 large bags of bran. In addition, there are material dining rooms, medical teams, repair rooms, silk drawing rooms, offices, and more than 40 staff dormitories for workers to live in, but because part of the staff dormitory is occupied by military police, the factory inevitably suffers from housing shortages. The factory is adjacent to the long-defunct alcohol factory, and behind it is the scenic Jinshan Temple. In front of it is the match factory, so the factory is not only magnificent in appearance, but also has a very beautiful environment.

Six Departments of Equipment, Still Considered Perfect

The factory's equipment is divided into six departments: power, wheat cleaning, flour making, packaging, and repair. The power department has two diesel engines with 520 horsepower and 175 horsepower, and a 680 horsepower motor. The flour-making department only has the equipment of a steel mill, which is still usable. From a modern perspective, although most of these machines are not new, they are still one of the well-equipped factories in the Jinghu area in China, which is currently backward in industry.

Transportation is Quite Convenient

Another unique advantage is that it is built on the right bank of the Xinhe River. Wheat boats can directly reach the factory gate. Zhenjiang West Railway Station and the riverside station are not far away, and trucks can directly reach the factory. Transportation is very convenient, which is of great benefit to business. However, it is said that the Xinhe River is dry in spring, and ships are not easy to enter - it is hoped that the water conservancy authorities will pay attention to the issue of dredging in the future. In addition, the factory is only separated by a river from the wheat-producing area in northern Jiangsu. Usually, it does have a geographical advantage in terms of raw material supply. However, even today, when northern Jiangsu is not very stable, it is inevitably affected to a considerable extent.

Directly Managed by the Food Department

According to the person in charge of the factory to the reporter: The factory was founded in the second year of the Republic of China, originally named Yicheng Flour Mill. It was not until the 25th year of the Republic of China that it began to take shape. During the Anti-Japanese War, the owner was unable to operate it, and all the shareholders announced the dissolution of the liquidation and sold it to the Japanese firm Xinjing Foreign Firm, which then increased its shares to expand its business and changed its name to Zhenjiang Flour Mill. After the victory, the factory was taken over by the Food Department and handed over to the Jiangsu Field Tax and Food Administration Office for direct command and supervision. Hong Qichen, Deputy Director of the Field Tax and Food Administration Office, was appointed as the director, and Shen Hengshan was the deputy director. There are six sections and offices under the department, including general affairs, business, engineering, materials, and accounting. There are currently more than 50 employees, who work together in a division of labor, and the management is also quite strict.

Limited Horsepower, Low Output

Under the wave of the current industrial depression, factories are frequently encountering difficulties, and the Zhenjiang Flour Mill is no exception. It is said that the factory had considerable difficulties at the beginning of its takeover. The first was the raising of working capital, and the second was the inability to supply a large amount of electricity in Zhenjiang. After several attempts, fortunately, the factory had diesel engines. After rushing to repair, reorganize, and add parts, it changed to using diesel to drive the machines and managed to operate hard. Finally, on April 14th last year, it officially resumed work and milled the first bag of flour after the victory. However, the horsepower of the diesel engine is limited, and it can only drive one-third of all machines. It is estimated that the daily output can reach about 3,000 bags. Since the start of work, the factory has indeed done a lot of work in terms of military food supply, civil food adjustment, and refugee relief. Because of the limitation of insufficient power, the factory's machines cannot be fully operated, so the direct technical workers required are only more than 100 people. At present, there are about 200 people, including dock coolies, temporary workers, and indirect workers, for a total of less than 300 people, including employees. However, it is estimated that the number of people who rely on this flour mill to maintain their lives directly and indirectly is more than 3,000. It can be seen that the large-scale start-up of factories is of great help in solving social unemployment and refugee relief problems.

Difficult to Collect Materials, Sales Stagnant

However, now, the factory is also inevitably encountering the current difficulties in business, just like other flour mills. The first is that raw materials are not easy to purchase, and sometimes the supply is interrupted, which inevitably leads to shutdowns. During the shutdown period, various expenses cannot be reduced by a single point. If the factory is shut down, it will be difficult for the factory to compensate, and it will inevitably be unable to maintain it. The second is that there are few export goods (flour), sales are stagnant, and funds are invisibly frozen, and the entire business will inevitably fall into a state of paralysis. This is the most difficult thing for the factory at present, and it is hoped that all parties will come up with the strength to rescue the crisis of this food adjustment agency.

Artificial Kerosene is Easy to Cause Disaster

Editor: Recently, fires have occurred frequently, and the loss of life and property of citizens has been severe. Instead of investigating afterwards, why not take precautions? Statistics on the causes of previous fires show that many were caused by the burning of kerosene. Greedy merchants and distributors are selling artificial kerosene to make huge profits. Users are unaware and think it is cheap, so they compete to buy it, but they do not know that they are setting themselves on fire, and it is too late to regret! Because the raw materials of artificial kerosene are diesel, Su La oil, or rosin water, plus gasoline and other products. If gasoline is not added, the odor is heavy, the firepower is weak, the wick is hard, and waste is excessive, so it is necessary to add highly volatile gasoline to cover it up. However, if it is burned for a long time, the oil pot is heated, and the gasoline is easily expanded into gas and explodes, causing a disaster that cannot be contained, not only causing damage to itself, but also endangering the neighbors. The harm of this matter can penetrate into rural villages and towns, so it should be strictly noted. Therefore, when buying kerosene, you must pay attention to the quality. Especially recently, the so-called flat-price kerosene on the market, selling for 700 or 800 yuan per catty, is highly dangerous artificial kerosene. Because the wholesale price of Mobil and other companies is more than 1,100 yuan per catty, there is absolutely no reason for the selling price to be lower than the cost. Citizens must not be greedy and buy it. The plan to get to the root of the problem has three points: (1) The municipal authorities strictly ban manufacturers and vendors of artificial kerosene. (2) The police station should send personnel to investigate kerosene retailers and accept citizens' reports. If anyone buys, sells, or hides artificial kerosene, they should be charged with endangering public safety. (3) Citizens should mutually advise their neighbors not to buy artificial kerosene to protect their own safety. If they find that a shop has adulterated artificial kerosene, they should report it from a public morality standpoint and widely publicize it. In fact, most kerosene buyers are nearby. In case of a fire, the shop itself may also be affected. Even if they make a fortune by artificial kerosene, it is exchanged for the lives and property of others. Ill-gotten gains cannot be held for long, please think twice! (Ming)

### Wealth and Benefit for the People Timber: Teak Planting Method, Eagerly Awaiting Widespread Trial Planting by the People

— Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Liu Jun'e

More than 33 years ago, I was invited by the British Indian government to transfer from Rong to Yu and fly to India to work on insect research at the Darala Royal Forest Institute. Darala is located on the southern foothills of the Jia Malaya Mountains, approximately 30 degrees north latitude. The temperature is similar to that of Shanghai. I saw a large area of teak trees planted in the tree planting trial area of the institute, with as many as hundreds of trees, all without branches, but standing more than ten feet high. At that time, I paid special attention to it.

It is found that teak is a kind of expensive timber, easy to plant and fast to become timber. The wood is hard and dense, naturally light yellowish-brown. The best point is that any woodworm cannot bore it. Not only can it be used to make beds, cabinets, furniture, mirror frames and other decorations, but it can also be used as building materials, national defense materials, railway sleepers, and shipbuilding. The selling price is quite high, and those who plant it will make a lot of profit. In addition to successful trial planting in its tropical territories, the British government has also successfully trial planting in northern India. A plan has been set to increase planting by 1,500 acres in Myanmar and 4,600 acres in India each year. The successive central forest officers stationed in India have all written special publications on the research on teak planting, and its wealth and benefit for the people can be imagined.

The roof slabs of the houses of officials and staff at the Darala Research Institute are infested with termites and must be replaced every three to five years. Otherwise, there is a risk of falling. However, the beams, pillars, doors, windows, top panels, floors, and all wooden parts of the "Official Reception Center" and the director's residence are completely made of teak, and there is never a danger of termite damage.

The natural distribution area of teak trees in India and Myanmar is approximately 5 to 26 degrees north latitude; the artificial planting area is approximately 20 to 30 degrees north latitude. Since the British have achieved success in trial planting, the southern parts of Kang, Tibet, Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces in our country, and the entire parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, must all be suitable for teak planting. Moreover, not only Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian had termites in the early years, but in the past two years, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Nanjing and other places have gradually had termites introduced. Since the victory and return to the original location, public and private agencies and people returning from the southwest to the east must have brought a lot of termites in their wooden boxes and woodenware. Therefore, I am eager to introduce this valuable and useful teak tree into our country and make it a domestic timber. Therefore, one or two months before leaving the Darala Research Institute in the winter of 34, I specially entrusted the central forest officer in the institute to purchase several pounds of teak seeds. He asked me for a mailing address, and was willing to wait for the teak seeds to be harvested in the spring of 35, and ordered his staff to send them as a gift. Now I have received a sack, which is very gratifying. Now I will translate the summary of the planting method of the teak seeds so that domestic forest agencies and individuals who are willing to try planting can send letters to ask for trial planting: (Mailing address: No. 3, Lane 2, Huacun, Wuyuan Road, Shanghai.)

(1) Soaking seeds: From early February to early March, soak the seeds in shallow pots of water for three days, remove the water and expose them to the sun for three days, then soak them for three days, then expose them to the sun for three days. Repeat this soaking and drying for about a month, and there will be an intention to germinate.

(2) Land preparation: During the seed soaking period, you should choose a place with a clear south facing, sufficient light, and fertile soil, loosen it to a depth of one or two feet, and water it to moisten it for future use (all grass roots and broken bricks should be removed from the soil, and any larvae should be killed).

(3) Sowing: When the seeds are about to germinate, draw several lines on the prepared land vertically and horizontally. The distance between each two lines is 5 inches. Dig a pit about the depth of a grave at the intersection of every two lines. Put a seed into each pit. Add soil about one inch thick to cover it. If you want to help it germinate early, you can also cover it with a little rice straw. The soil in the pit must always be kept moist, but not with standing water.

(4) Transplanting: After sowing, you must pre-select a piece of land with a south facing, sufficient sunlight, and fertile soil, loosen it to a depth of one foot, and often water it to moisten it. Wait until the seedlings grow to three to seven inches high, and have one or two pairs or two or three pairs of tender leaves (about one to three months), then you can move them and transplant them. Make the vertical and horizontal distance between every two plants 6 feet. In less than a year, they can grow to more than ten feet. (Each seed can produce three or four seedlings, but only one seedling is left in each plant's position, and the rest are removed.) If there are weeds bullying them, they should be removed.

[Announcement]: Those who send letters to this port to ask for teak seeds, please write clearly the name and address for registration. Each request for one hundred seeds costs 500 yuan in legal currency (please bring the money to get the seeds within three or four days after sending the letter).

Those who send letters from other ports, each hundred seeds costs 5,000 yuan. Each four hundred seeds costs 10,000 yuan (please attach five or ten thousand-yuan stamps in a registered letter, and the seeds will be mailed without delay.)],

Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbal Medicine

### Regarding Mr. Zhang Xixian's Thirteen-Ingredient "Lung Disease Effective Formula"

— Mou Yunfang, Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters

Zhang Xixian, the police chief of Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province, suffered from lung disease for over four years. It would improve and then relapse. In the winter before last year, it relapsed again, with profuse hemoptysis. Many doctors were at a loss. Later, a friend passed on a thirteen-ingredient lung disease effective formula, and after taking more than twenty doses in a row, he walked as healthy as normal. Also, Mr. Wang Zuyang suffered from lung disease, and X-ray examination showed that the tissue of the left lung was completely destroyed, and the condition was serious. After taking this formula, he gradually recovered. Mr. Zhang, feeling the pain of his previous illness, wanted to widely disseminate this formula to help those who suffer from the same disease.

Since its publication in Shen Bao, it has attracted much attention. Some people spare no expense to re-stencil and distribute it, and it became popular overnight, spreading by word of mouth. From December 1st, sixteen pharmacies, including Hu Qing Yu Tang, donated and published large advertisements for the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association to promote effective national medicine formulas to help the poor and sick, and sponsored the donation of 20,000 doses. The Shen Bao's social service column reported on the donation process on December 22nd. Since the beginning, various pharmacies have enthusiastically supported the effort, and by December 18th, a total of 23,000 doses had been donated. This kind of benevolence and righteous act is commendable, but whether this formula has a truly effective treatment and whether it has other side effects is a question that urgently needs to be studied. On May 19th of last year, Mr. Chen Cunren of Shen Bao published the results of his research, believing that the formula has the effect of nourishing and tonifying the lungs, increasing fluid, dispelling heat, and nourishing blood. In response to inquiries in the Shen Bao's service column on June 3rd, he pointed out the irrationality of the original formula and, for the sake of rationality, modified the original formula. Therefore, I also need to discuss this effective formula.

My first criticism of this formula is that the use of Bai Zhi (Angelica dahurica) and Hong Hua (Safflower) is unjustified. For lung disease with hemoptysis, using a small amount of Hong Hua can be said to be acceptable, but using Bai Zhi to treat lung disease is absolutely wrong. Mr. Chen said: "It is indeed necessary to consider when using Bai Zhi." I think there is no need to consider it. Bai Zhi is a diaphoretic medicine containing volatile oil with irritating properties. Not only should it not be used for lung disease with night sweats and tidal fever, but according to the logic of the prescription, it should not be an irrelevant and incongruous ingredient in such a formula. Mr. Chen said, "Bai Zhi should be changed to steamed Bai Bu (Stemona)," which is very reasonable because Bai Bu can treat chronic cough. Secondly, the dosage of the drugs is unreasonable. Mr. Chen said: "The dosage of Hong Hua and Gan Cao (Licorice) should be light, and the dosage of Sheng Di (Rehmannia glutinosa) and Bai Pi (Morus alba root bark) should be heavy." He revised the dosage of each drug in the original formula to make it reasonable. I think the dosage of Shu Di (processed Rehmannia glutinosa) also needs to be revised. If Shu Di is unnecessary and Sheng Di is already present, it's better not to use it. If Shu Di needs to be used, a dosage of two qian (a traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 3.7 grams) is too light.

The whole formula has thirteen ingredients. Apart from the incongruous Bai Zhi, it is what traditional Chinese medicine calls a "Gan Han" (sweet and cold) formula, which is effective for treating lung disease with dry cough, insomnia, irritability, dry mouth, and other symptoms of deficiency and excitement, which are so-called "Yin Deficiency with Fire Blazing" diseases. This is because "Gan Han" drugs have nourishing and calming effects. Although lung disease is a kind of Yin Deficiency with Fire Blazing disease, the patient's constitution and the causes are different, and the symptoms of lung disease are not uniform. Some have hemoptysis, some have night sweats, some have tidal fever, some have nocturnal emission, some have insomnia, and so on. The severity varies, so simply using "Gan Han" drugs will not be effective for everyone.

(Note: Mr. Chen Cunren's long article of more than a thousand words on the newly written effective formula for lung disease was published in the News on February 28th, and it was developed from recent experiments. Those who are concerned about this formula should refer to it.)

### Do Not Mistake the Following Symptoms for a Cold and Treat Them as Minor Problems!

— Chen Cunren

The Inner Classic says, "Harm from wind in the spring." The climate in spring changes from cold to warm; however, at this time the cold has not subsided, and the warmth is only slowly emerging. The change between cold and warm is quite drastic, sometimes with spring cold snaps and sometimes with spring warmth. The regulation of body temperature is most likely to be disrupted, so colds arise, resulting in a wind-cold syndrome.

Mild colds may manifest as nasal congestion or itchy throat with coughing. Severe colds may involve chills and fever. They may heal without medication, or heal with diaphoretic medicines, or heal with two or three days of diaphoretic medicines. As for those complicated with other diseases, or those with weak lungs that develop complications, the treatment method will be more difficult. However, the general public's view is that colds are minor problems and not worth paying attention to; unaware that "a cold that does not heal turns into consumption" is meant to warn people against underestimating colds. Furthermore, most Chinese people do not pay much attention to medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, and are therefore ignorant of the identification of symptoms. Because the biggest symptoms of a cold are chills, fever, and cough, people often mistakenly think that anyone with chills, fever, and cough has a cold, delaying treatment and inevitably leading to major changes. This is not to be ignored, so it is specially pointed out.

Wind-Heat

Wind-heat is a type of typhoid fever. Its characteristics are intermittent fever that lingers and does not subside, similar to ordinary typhoid fever with a cough. At the beginning of the disease, there is a feeling of chills and an increase in body temperature, which is very similar to ordinary severe colds, so it is easy to overlook and delay treatment. Because as a result of overlooking it, not only is treatment not sought immediately, but the person may also work while sick, exhausting their physical and mental strength, consuming their resistance, like letting a wolf into the house. Or they may have no dietary restrictions, burdening their digestive work, leading to accumulation and indigestion, greatly affecting the stomach and intestines, and increasing the heat, like adding fuel to the fire.

Typhoid fever requires dietary restrictions, which is common knowledge that everyone knows. People with colds, except for a loss of appetite and a desire to eat less, do not have the same dietary restrictions as in cases of typhoid fever. Therefore, the biggest adverse consequence of misdiagnosis is food stagnation, which is what the Treatise on Typhoid Fever calls "Yangming disease." Commonly referred to as "fire typhoid," "vertical head typhoid," and "leaky bottom typhoid," these are all dangerous symptoms of typhoid fever. The cause is mostly due to a lack of dietary restrictions. Wind-heat is mistaken for a cold, so the consequences are often unimaginable.

Lung-Wind

Lung-wind refers to shortness of breath, coughing with wheezing, fever that does not subside, which is what is now called pneumonia or bronchitis. The meaning of the word "wind" has two meanings: one refers to its source, meaning caused by wind-cold; the other refers to its symptoms, meaning that there is a danger of stirring up wind. The latter meaning is most easily seen in children who suffer from it, so children with pneumonia often have the possibility of seizures.

The occurrence of lung-wind is caused by exposure to wind-cold, where the virus reaches and harms the lungs, so the symptoms of the respiratory system are the most obvious. In the early stages, when the symptoms are still superficial, it is not difficult to mistake it for a cold. However, this disease changes quickly, and if medicine is not used early, or if the medicine is not appropriate, there will be major changes, endangering life.

Measles

Measles initially presents with fever, coughing with wheezing, runny nose, which is no different from a cold. It is not until four or five days later, when red spots appear around the ears, on the chest, and on the back, that it is known to be measles.

Measles is most afraid of wind-cold, which is known to everyone. In addition to wind-cold, diet should also be paid attention to. If measles is mistaken for a cold, the preventive measures will not be very careful, or there will be repeated exposure to wind-cold, binding its external defenses, preventing it from reaching the surface quickly, or being harmed by diet, causing loose stools, so taking the opportunity to invade internally, then the measles toxin will be entrenched internally, with the risk of sudden changes.

### Ginger

— Zhang Ruwei

People only know that ginger is an ordinary vegetable seasoning, but if used properly, it can not only be palatable and filling, but also bring the dead back to life. Pickled ginger can treat nausea and vomiting, sugar ginger can cure abdominal pain, ginger tea can stop diarrhea, ginger and jujube decoction can stop malaria, and scallion and ginger noodles can induce sweating and cure colds. These are all significant and effective products in dietary therapy. If used in medicine, fresh ginger can dispel cold, release the exterior, stop vomiting, and resolve phlegm. When roasted with fire, the taste is acrid with a hint of bitterness, and its nature becomes very hot, removing cold in the stomach. When charred black, it has a charcoal-like effect and can also warm the meridians. If dried old ginger is used, it is dried ginger, which can warm and guard the middle energizer and strengthen the heart and calm the spirit. Other wonderful uses, such as ginger peel's ability to disperse water edema and ginger juice's ability to remove stubborn phlegm, are too numerous to mention. The spiciness of fresh ginger is not as stimulating as chili peppers, and it can also detoxify and remove filth, so those who cook fish and shrimp need ginger, and eating large crabs without ginger also feels uninteresting.

### Agrimony

— Zhang Yanren

Agrimony's original name is Long Ya Cao (dragon tooth grass), commonly known as Tuo Li Cao (debility grass), named because it can treat debility and labor injuries. Its efficacy is described in detail in the Materia Medica and has always been valued by our Chinese medicine community. Since 1937, Professor Wu Yunrui of the Medical College of Fudan University in Shanghai tested the results, proposed the pure effective ingredients, and applied them to clinical practice, its effect is even more remarkable. In the past, this product was not only valued in the medical community, but the experimental merits have long been commonly used by the people. One often sees villagers who have debility, labor injuries, and hemoptysis picking it from the fields, exposing it to the sun, decocting it, and taking it, which has always been effective. Examining the nature of this product, it is bitter, astringent, and slightly warm, containing colloid, a mild compound, vegetable sterol, and a sweet substance, that is, vegetable mucilage, which has the effects of anti-inflammation, astringency, increasing cell resistance, and promoting blood coagulation. It has special effects for hemoptysis, nosebleeds, and uterine bleeding, especially for chronic weak patients and those who are weak and powerless after a serious illness. Regular consumption can also strengthen the heart and nourish it. A strong heart will improve blood circulation, and the complexion will become ruddy. It really has the effect of preventing disease and prolonging life. Among the domestic medicines, why is this product the only one? There are many effective ones, like mountain treasures, rare and wonderful things are lined up, and they are easy to pick up. Why not improve ourselves? Speaking of building Chinese medicine today, extracting the essence and improving medicines is a major prerequisite. I hope that the Chinese people will rise up together to do it.

### Cold Prevention

— Shen Caizhi

(1) As the saying goes, "Don't wear too little in the spring breeze," which is the meaning of the ancient poem "The willow breeze blowing on the face is not cold," meaning the warmth of spring. However, the saying also goes, "Spring overcastness can freeze old oxen to death," which shows that the cold and warmth in spring are abnormal and the climate is changeable, especially in the first and second months of the lunar year. Therefore, in terms of clothing, pay attention to the thickness of clothing and do not adhere to seasonal clothing.

(2) When the sun is weak or the climate is cold and smoggy, and you feel cold, change your clothes at any time and never endure the cold by wearing single clothes. Those who go out should pay special attention to this point. As the saying goes, "Always bring clothes for the third and ninth months," which is to prevent catching a cold.

(3) After sweating, body temperature drops sharply, and the pores are not firm. The ability to prevent cold is weak. Wind and cold can easily enter, so do not sit or lie in the wind, seeking temporary comfort.

(4) When going out, if clothes are wet from rain or snow, find a way to change them quickly and do not force yourself to endure it.

(5) Bedding should not be too warm at night, because sleeping too warmly and exposing the body easily leads to colds.

(6) When getting up in the morning, do not open the window until your clothes are buttoned. Those in a warm room should not rush out; it is best to rub the face, forehead, nose, and heart with both palms before opening the window and going out to prevent catching a cold.

### Research on Using Cotton Thread to Treat Measles

— You Xuezhou

The custom is to use boiled cotton thread to treat measles. This method is used to penetrate the measles when it first appears. I wanted to understand its nature, taste, and function, but when I looked through the Materia Medica, it was not mentioned. Although the Dictionary of Pharmacy has a statement about penetrating measles, it was not satisfactory. I thought about the difference between cotton and cotton thread in terms of categories, one is an agricultural product, and the other is an industrial product, so there must be differences; if analyzed chemically, there may not be much difference. If this thing really has a medicinal effect, then the flower and the thread have only gone through a spinning process, and the essence has not changed. Why not use cotton to treat measles, but insist on using cotton thread? Isn't there "a reason for everything"? One day, I happened to read Shao Qinfu's "Throat Measles, Diphtheria" chapter, in which there is a sentence: "If the neck is swollen on both sides, like a bag, it is the so-called throat measles bag. It is appropriate to add detoxification and swelling reduction products, such as silkworms, red peony, Belamcanda chinensis, puffballs, licorice, fritillaria, peach kernels, and green cotton thread." I couldn't help but suddenly understand!

Shao Qinfu's so-called throat measles, diphtheria, refers to two syndromes: ulcerative throat measles and diphtheria measles. Ulcerative throat measles is scarlet fever—also known as red measles—which the ancients often confused with the measles that occurred in children. Although the spots of scarlet fever are smaller than measles when they first appear, they soon densely cover the area, and the throat is very easily ulcerated; severe measles can also form patches and cause throat pain, and even ulceration. The special symptoms of scarlet fever, in addition to sore throat, include a tongue with raised papillae and a "triangular area" of the nose and mouth that does not develop red measles, so there is a clear white triangle; those with severe measles who develop pneumonia also have this symptom. The use of cotton thread was originally for ulcerative throat measles, so it is also used for measles.

However, the use of cotton thread to treat measles is for the throat symptoms, and not only is the throat ulcerated, but also swollen. Looking at the sentence in the article, "It is appropriate to add detoxification and swelling reduction products," the role of cotton thread is to detoxify and reduce swelling, and has nothing to do with penetrating the measles.

Moreover, the point to pay special attention to when using cotton thread is "green" cotton thread, not ordinary "unbleached" cotton. In old-fashioned dyeing workshops, blue is used indigo blue, and indigo blue can detoxify and reduce swelling, so the use of green cotton thread to treat "throat measles bags" is to take advantage of the power of indigo blue.

Spring and Autumn

### Preface to Essays on Drama

— Ye Dejun

Last winter, I sorted out the papers and essays about Chinese novels and dramas I had written over the past ten years or so, estimating that there were more than 200,000 words. Many of the short essays were notes made to suit the length of the supplement, and the preparations were not very in-depth. There was really no need to publish these scattered chapters, so I resolutely deleted them all. The remaining papers were only 130,000 to 140,000 words, which were compiled into a book called "Collection of Essays on Vernacular Literature." "Rixin Literature Series" planned to include it, but due to the limitation of the number of words, it was difficult to include all of them. Therefore, I first extracted several articles on opera and compiled them into a book called "Essays on Drama" to let them meet the world first. The remaining textual researches on novels and ballads will be compiled into another book called "Fish Clothing Collection."

This thin booklet of 50,000 to 60,000 words only has six articles. Although it is inevitably thin, I still like it. I think: rather than writing general theories or outlines, it is better to write some special studies in a down-to-earth manner; writing a literary history without any original ideas is not as good as a solid small textual research. This is naturally just my idea and may not be agreed upon by others; however, I myself like to take this circuitous path. Although these short essays and textual researches may not be exhaustive, I always want to do my best to make them substantial. Naturally, there are also documents that have not been noticed, such as the author of "Taiping Yuefu," Wu Zhensheng. I did not think that Li Ji's "Qi Su Lei Zheng" actually had his biography. This kind of omission is inevitably a negligence, and the difficulty of complete textual research is certainly known to those who have experienced it.

I myself have no collection of books, let alone rare or precious books, and doing small textual research requires books as a basis, so the suffering is even deeper. The books cited in the essay "The Disaster of Performing the Palace of Eternal Life" are all ordinary Qing Dynasty documents, but if there were no provincial library for reference, it might not be possible to write it even now. I have collected a lot of documents about the old Lang and the Ming people's enthusiasm for opera, which can be written into a not very short paper, but in the end, because one or two Ming printed books have not been found, I had to let it run aground. The abandonment halfway through the compilation of historical materials of Ming Dynasty opera writers is also similar to the above situation. Textual research without books, wanting to have rich harvests, I am afraid it will become a vain wish. Having been trapped in the southern border for many years, what else can I say? When will I be able to use the library next to the Jinbie Yuzhuang Bridge that I once lingered and couldn't bear to leave? This is even more unpredictable. Although specializing in this kind of thing is inevitably a self-inflicted hardship, I still want to continue to do it as far as my ability allows. The result, of course, is difficult to predict. This is exactly: Bieshan Quhai are trivial matters, and I will spend my life studying the classics.

### Dream Traces

— Yang Yifu

In my memories, it seems a piece of music is playing, like Chopin's "Serenade." It is filled with blue emotions, stirring the broken strings of my heart—that deep affection, deep melancholy, that boundless tenderness, boundless sorrow, causing me to be melancholic, to be sentimental, even to shed tears.

I have never forgotten that evening in the late autumn of 1943.

The pattering drizzle, the rustling cold wind, adorned the quiet twilight. After my illness, I lay quietly in bed, gazing at the irritating sky outside the window, so desolate, so bleak, and yet so lonely. Yes, lonely, I felt a loneliness I had never experienced before, waves of thoughts constantly rising and falling, broken and fragmented, intermittent. I was wondering: When will I recover my health? When will I be able to go to school? The motherland is in the midst of storms, and many people are dedicating their lives, while I am struggling in the pain of illness… I couldn't help but think of my many friends, thinking of the warm friendship they gave me, especially Hua Hua. He treated me so well. Thinking of him reminded me of the bright moon without a night robe, a lighthouse in the sea. He brought me warmth, brought me light, brought me hope, making me forget a lot of pain and reducing much of my loneliness. At this moment, I deeply realized the meaning of the phrase "To have a true friend, one can die without regret…"

Suddenly, a crisp telephone ring interrupted my thoughts, breaking the silent atmosphere. I immediately got out of bed, walked to the desk, picked up the receiver, and heard my uncle's voice:

"…Is this Yifu? How are you these past two days? Are you feeling better?"

"Thank you, Uncle, I'm better… Are you looking for Mom? She's out. Is there anything I can do?"

"She's out… Well, please tell her to pack my two leather suitcases. I'm coming to pick them up tonight."

"What? Uncle, are you leaving already? So soon?" I hurriedly asked him, "Then, what about Hua Hua and the others?"

"Hasn't he told you? We had already agreed to leave together…"

"Is this true? Hua Hua is leaving too?…" After hearing the words "Hua Hua is leaving too," I no longer heard anything else that was said. Finally, he hung up the phone. "I don't believe it, I don't believe it. He never said he was going to leave. This is impossible. Hua Hua can't leave me. I have to go see him…" I muttered to myself like a madman. I quickly put on my clothes, threw on my coat, and went downstairs. At this moment, I had forgotten that I was still a patient, a patient who needed to rest for half a year to recover. When I opened the front door, the old nanny who was taking care of me came out in surprise and asked me, "Miss Yifu, what are you doing?"

I didn't have time to explain to her. I hurriedly said to her, "I have to go out now. Tell Mom later that I'll be right back." I quickly closed the door. I only heard her calling me from inside the door, but I had already rushed out onto the street and jumped into a rickshaw.

The rain had stopped, and the wind was blowing relentlessly. I sat in the rickshaw, lost in thought, not knowing how much time had passed. The rickshaw had already reached the intersection of Shanzhong Road. I got out of the rickshaw and walked into a small alley. I gently rang the doorbell.

"Who is it?" It was Hua Hua's voice. I could tell.

"It's me, Hua Hua," I shouted involuntarily.

"Who? Yifu? How did you get here?" He walked out in surprise and took my hand.

"I thought you had already left…" Tears that I had been holding back for a long time were already hanging in the corners of my eyes. At that moment, I felt like I had gained everything in the universe.

"No, aren't I right here?" He said gently and calmly, "Yifu, how could you forget that you're still recovering from your illness… Okay, enough said. Hurry, I'll take you back right away." As he said that, he took my arm, and we quickly got back into a rickshaw.

The sky was already approaching evening, and in the hazy twilight, the streetlights gradually lit up.

"Hua Hua, I beg you not to leave me," I leaned against him and said softly.

"Yifu, let me tell you," he said slowly, each word striking my heart, "If you weren't sick, I would have already rushed to the land of freedom. It's because of you that I've delayed until now."

"Really? Hua Hua, thank you. But I'm afraid, I'm afraid I'll lose you."

"Why do you say that?" He gazed at me. "Please believe me, Yifu. The first time I saw you, I liked you. I also have an incomprehensible feeling for you. It's admiration, it's worship, it's respect. I'm just the most ordinary person among ordinary people. However, I have my ideals, I have my beliefs. For the sake of the motherland, I must stick to my post and do my part. Yifu, I hope you can understand me and give me encouragement and comfort."

I raised my head, gazing at him, tears falling one by one. "Hua Hua, I understand you. Please forgive me for my selfishness just now."

"Don't say that. From now on, I will work harder for you."

"Hua Hua, go. I hope you can fulfill your ideals. I have nothing to say. I can only bless you. Hua Hua, please forgive me. I really don't have the courage to think about it anymore…"

"Yifu, don't talk too far ahead. When you're healthy, I'll come back to pick you up. Then, we can work together, live together. Are you happy?"

"Yes, I hope so too. But who knows what the future holds…"

"Believe me, Yifu, I won't forget you. I'll never forget you," he said passionately.

The rickshaw had stopped at Jiangning Road. We got out of the rickshaw and stood under the streetlight on the street. In the hazy night fog, he held my slender hands tightly and said, "You should be happy for me. Why are you sad and crying? Promise me you'll take good care of yourself."

I nodded slightly, opened my tearful eyes, and gazed at him, saying, "You must come back to pick me up, right?"

"Yes, in a few days, I'll definitely come back to pick you up." After saying that, he kissed my wet cheek. "Hurry up and go inside! Don't stand on the street. You'll catch a cold."

"No, I want to watch you leave first today," I said with a tearful smile.

He knew that I was very stubborn, so he said, "Okay, then I'll go first." He then walked forward. Suddenly, he turned around and said to me, "Why aren't you going home yet? It's very cold on the street. Hurry up and go inside! Goodbye!" After saying that, he quickly walked to the opposite side of the road.

"Goodbye!" I shouted loudly, "Are you coming to see me tomorrow?…" He didn't seem to hear me and gradually walked away. Only when his figure disappeared into the night fog did I lift my heavy steps and walk home.

When I got home, fortunately, Mom hadn't returned yet. I lay down on the bed and felt feverish all over, as if I were burning. So, I fell asleep without knowing anything.

When I was more conscious, Mom told me that Uncle and Hua Hua had already left.

After that, I spent lonely days, taking medicine, reading books, and listening to music at home every day. My health gradually improved. At the same time, I often received letters from Uncle and Hua Hua, knowing that they were both working on the front lines and that their work was extremely tense. They were probably unable to return to Shanghai for a while. But they said that they would find a way to pick me up when they had the opportunity. However, soon, transportation to Chongqing became increasingly difficult, and their letters gradually became less frequent.

Waiting, waiting, waiting every day for their news. Finally, I received Uncle's last letter, a few brief words telling me that Hua Hua had suddenly disappeared, his fate unknown. But this news had not been confirmed. It was simply a bolt from the blue. I was stunned for many days. But I didn't believe it. I had strong faith. I believed that this news was not true.

Finally, the bells of peace rang throughout every corner of the universe. With a half-joyful and half-fearful heart, I waited for their return. Sure enough, Uncle returned, and he confirmed the unfortunate news of Hua Hua's disappearance. His whereabouts are still unknown. But in this vast universe, where can I find him?

Although I am a stubborn girl, I couldn't restrain my emotions and couldn't help but shed tears. I didn't say a word, just wept silently to myself.

Uncle understood me best. He saw me enduring the pain, and unknowingly, I had obviously become depressed and haggard.

He often took me to the park for walks and accompanied me to concerts. But I couldn't cheer up. My heart became more and more depressed, as if a layer of deep blue was painted on a clean white cloth, symbolizing melancholy, sorrow, and endless mourning.

One day, Uncle suddenly said to me, "Yifu, are you going to be sad forever? Listen to me, maybe a change of environment will be good for you. How about I find a job for you? Would you be willing to try it?" For his kindness, I agreed.

So, I became a teacher at a church middle school, spending my time reading and grading papers every day. My mood slowly got better. Now, I feel that work is indeed the sweet cake of life. I understand the true meaning of life even more: Some people in the world live for others, and some people live for themselves. But people who live for others can obtain eternal happiness.

However, I can't forget Hua Hua. Every morning in the faint dawn, at dusk in the misty drizzle, or in the midnight of starry sky, his figure constantly lingered in my mind, surrounding my soul.

Every morning, when I walked to school, passing by that small chapel, I would always raise my head, gazing at the statue of the Virgin Mary hanging on the wall. I was silently praying: Bless him with peace, bless him with a safe return. Although no one knows when he will return, I still prayed every day, praying and searching. (January 30, 1947)

### Flowers and Birds

— Zhang Shuqi

### Snow Seals and Dissolves Guyuan – Memories Beyond the Great Wall

— Lin Yongquan

April,

Lonely Guyuan,

Receives the travelers of last night,

Receives that group,

Of people from afar riding in cars,

The people of Guyuan are amazed,

The people of Guyuan are staring at people from a mythical land,

The people from afar are depicting,

A primitive picture.

The next morning,

The sound of roosters awakens,

The primitive dream of the people from afar,

The people from afar compete with the sun to rise early.

But the dawn of Guyuan,

Has no bright colors.

The lonely sky and

The lonely earth face each other.

It is snowing in Guyuan,

Beautiful snowflakes,

Falling piece by piece on the dusty streets.

But the large convoy,

Braving the snow filling the sky,

Floats across the bright white carpet.

And the snow continues to fall,

Snowflakes cover the tracks of the vehicles,

Snowflakes, like fluttering white butterflies,

Holding the cold morning wind,

Dance in front of the vehicles,

Dance on the faces of the people in the vehicles.

The snow is getting heavier,

The earth is covered with a white blanket,

Soldiers wearing thick white velvet clothes,

Like piled snowmen,

Are towed away by snowplows,

Towed into the misty sea of snow.

The snow falls so silently,

The earth is so lonely!

Loneliness seals Guyuan,

The lonely people from afar,

Go to the lonely distance.

Note: Guyuan is in Gansu province, a stop on the way from Shaanxi to Ningxia.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 190

— Ye Jingfeng

There is still something else. We can say that Yaoqun and Hucheng, from Mr. W's perspective, are in the position of a liaison organization. With Yaoqun and Hucheng, he can contact the organizations to which I and Tsurumi belong. And the potential forces in the Northeast are something that Mr. W should try to bring into cooperation, and the medium for this liaison, Hucheng and Yaoqun, should be the most suitable people. Moreover, although Hucheng is only a child of twelve or thirteen years old, because of his amazing martial skills and wisdom, no one in the mountains of the Northeast does not know him, no one does not admire him. Therefore, like Yaoqun, he is specially favored by Mr. W.

From this point of view, Mr. W's politeness to the two of them is not beyond reason.

Mr. W listened to Yaoqun's report, and saw that she had already answered the incoming calls according to his intentions, and thought it was very satisfactory. Only then did he leisurely signal to the young warrior who had just come in to report.

"...The advance scouts who were just sent out have encountered obstacles, and it seems that they are preparing for special operations. ...The lookout post in this building reports that the west, northwest, and southwest sides have suddenly been 'swept clean.' Within two thousand meters, there seems to be enemy surveillance!"

The people in the room could still remain calm after hearing this report, only Little Hucheng showed a slight agitation on his face. This agitation was due to two factors: The first factor was not entirely due to the stimulus of the report. From my observation, the main reason was still the hissing sound emitted by the special device's signal and the flashing, dazzling red light, which caused a reaction in his curiosity.

According to Mr. W's later telling us, this signal was originally a device that was kept in reserve. Before Song Zheyuan withdrew, there was nothing to be alarmed or reported at all. Even if the hidden forces of Japanese spies were very large, because this place was extremely well-protected, they could not detect it. Even if they did detect it, it was unlikely that they would dare to "disturb the earth on the head of a tiger" here. Now that Peiping has fallen, who would have thought that this thing that was kept in reserve would actually be used? It has actually come on stage to perform.

This set of things was originally arranged by the technical experts of the department. The alarm sound was not loud, but it was extremely harsh. The light was extremely strong. Even if it was released in the daytime, it was like a strong flash of lightning, dazzling and flowery. After it was installed, the main switch was set up in the main telecommunications room. Mr. Shi even issued an order for this: Except for the discovery of sudden dangers that affected the safety of the headquarters on the lookout posts such as outside the gate, in the hall, on the roof, etc., it was strictly forbidden to use it lightly.

With such a harsh hissing sound and glaring light bursting out at the same time, and with Tsurumi's various warnings and speculations beforehand, it was tantamount to the initial suggestion of hypnosis. How could a country child like Hucheng who had never been baptized by electricity not feel stimulated when he saw it? However, it was only limited to a kind of sensory stimulation, and there was no element of fear at all.

The second factor that caused him to be agitated can be said to be an expression of excitement, like a long-serving dragon horse in the battlefield, either smelling a bloody smell or hearing a burst of gongs and drums, thinking that there will be a good fight again, and then neighing vigorously, expressing that it can't wait to go to the battlefield immediately and gallop around.

As for Mr. W, he was of course more calm than us when he heard these reports. This calmness came purely from nature, without any pretense, not like what Shanghai people call "getting into character"; because he had a plan in mind. I only saw him pondering slightly, then picking up the direct phone in the building and issuing orders:

"Headquarters Number One, there are obstacles in the west, southwest, and northwest. Assault each action detachment, dispatch in order, detour from the east, scout one thousand meters, seven hundred meters, four hundred meters; avoid encountering combat; go to the advantageous location of the second branch in Central Park, lie in ambush and gather, and wait for secondary orders!

"...Headquarters Number Two; quickly send out the 'Fortune' notice on the second floor, the 'Warning' notice on the third floor, and the 'Friend' notice on the fourth floor; on the fifth floor, restore the 'scattered formation' and prepare the 'cold' command.

"...Headquarters Number Three; quickly arrange the back aisle on the second floor and prepare for service on duty."

Free Talk

### Solitary Mooring Musings

— Wang Cong

To the Editor of Free Talk, forgive my poor talent, as I have long written for the newspaper, ashamed of having no brilliant ideas to offer. Instead, I think of an old horse, halting by a bridge, raising its head and neighing, its ambition stretching a thousand miles. So I imitated its form, writing as the brush moved. The title is: "Solitary Mooring Musings." The words "Solitary Mooring" are based on Chapter 20 of the Tao Te Ching, "I alone am still, showing no sign of activity," as an introduction.

Blake said in his "Auguries of Innocence":

"To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour."

These lines of poetry are not just charming, as some might say, because they contain infinite wisdom.

"Before me, I see no ancients; behind me, I see no successors. Thinking of the vastness of heaven and earth, I weep alone in sorrow." This is the work of our great poet Chen Zi'ang at the Tower of Youzhou, filled with compassion and the illusion of history.

This emotion is shared by all humanity, ancient and modern, East and West. We can compare it to Shelley's "To the Moon":

"Art thou pale for weariness / Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth, / Wandering companionless / Among the stars that have a different birth, / And ever-changing, like a joyless eye / That finds no object worth its constancy?"

Ju sent a short letter from the distant Northland, quoting Dickens, "Between people and their souls, there is an immeasurable mystery." How impenetrable a thing is man; the word "pain" is the same for everyone, but the essence of each is incomprehensible to each other.

I suddenly remembered, one summer evening three years ago in Chongqing, Ju and I sat at the door to enjoy the cool air, and I groaned two lines of poetry: "Across the river, the lights are bright, but the light does not cross the river."

A cold scene – a long silence between us.

"Look at the lights on the other side, in clusters, naturally becoming many small groups, and yet, the two closest lamps don't know how far apart they are!" Ju said heavily.

The weather was terribly muggy, and the stars twinkled in the sky.

"The stars in the sky are the same. So-called proximity is only felt from the perspective of objective conditions. Aren't people's hearts the same? For example, we..."

I don't remember what else I said that night.

In short, the stars and hearts were in a flurry, and I couldn't tell what was what.

That night, it was extremely late. I don't think we ever spoke much again afterwards. We both immersed ourselves in the sea of stars or the sea of hearts.

When Lin Daiyu was dying in Xiangyun's room, it was Jia Baoyu's wedding night. If dying is the greatest pain in life, then this wedding night would be terribly tragic.

How cursed is fate!

Brother Bao affectionately lifted the veil of hope, only to suddenly find that the bride was not Sister Lin, but Sister Bao? Oh, it's Sister Bao!

When Lin Daiyu was about to leave this world, she uttered her last words: "Baoyu! You are good! You are good!" Then she took her last breath.

"How far apart are the two hearts that are considered closest!"

### Terrible Apprehension

— Qi Lou

Old people have many apprehensions, and therefore old nations like ours have many apprehensions. Apprehension arises from a loss of trust in oneself, and therefore even a child's inauspicious joke can, in the eyes of an old person, destroy his life.

Those who have many apprehensions are bound to be suspicious. To a suspicious person, any irrelevant words can be dragged onto his own head, like the distant relatives in China who claim kinship for thousands of miles. Thus, the speaker suffers.

There is a writer who unfortunately still lives in a large family, which naturally includes men, women, old and young. The wives who have been married into the family come from all directions, and his uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters are engaged in various occupations. In short, a large family is like a small society, and unfortunately, it is a society of suspicion and apprehension.

This writer recently wanted to write a novel. But thinking about it, the story must have a villain; this villain is either a man or a woman; either an adult or a child; either a father or a son; speaking of his or her profession, he or she is either a salaried worker or a boss; either employed or unemployed. Speaking of his or her origin, he or she is either from the south of the Yangtze River or the north of the Yangtze River. No matter how he tries to think outside the box, he can't escape this circle. This villain always seems to be shadowing someone, and shadowing someone will cause protests and disputes.

So for a period of time, this writer only wrote about foreigners, that is, so-called exoticism. But later, his cousin married a foreign woman, and even exoticism became a taboo.

So this writer could only write about turtles and rabbits; until now, his pen is only filled with these things, and he really (to his credit) writes them without any human touch.

### The Ways of Shanghai People

— Leike

The first sigh of a country person arriving in Shanghai is "It's hard to walk." But what about Shanghai people? Now let me tell you, those who are afraid of difficulties are country people. True Shanghai people are not afraid of the difficulty of walking.

For example, here he comes. Just look at him wearing a newly made uniform – a Melton cloth coat – and you can know that he is seven parts a Shanghai person. You see the sidewalks are crowded, a sea of people, truly "vehicles cannot turn, people cannot be seen." But our Shanghai person is leisurely, looking left and right, as if in the sea of people, he is a free fish. Even on the traffic lane, he can pose with a splayed gait, performing a stroll. Going back and forth in the piles of vendors, he can better show his ability to be resourceful. I say he looks left and right, but most of the time he is not looking at the goods, but at the women in front and behind. However, sometimes you can't tell clearly, because the way he looks at people is exactly the same as the way he looks at goods.

Now look at him waiting for the tram. He is not in a hurry. He buys a pear from a fruit stall on the side of the road. The tram is already coming over there, but he still wants the vendor to peel it for him. So he holds a snowy white pear high. When all living beings are scrambling like sesame seeds squeezing mung beans up and down, this fish has already swam through the sea of people and climbed onto the tram. If the pear juice gets on you, it's your bad luck.

He doesn't want to squeeze into the carriage. The seat next to the tram driver is his best box. He is not a dwarf, standing in this place he can see both inside and outside the car. So he eats the women's tofu while eating the pear, and speaks eloquently, and everyone gives him some face. In an instant, the pear is finished, and he takes out a clean white handkerchief, and after the handkerchief is a toothpick. So he leisurely picks his teeth. Maybe he will just leave the toothpick in his lips like this, or maybe he will change it for a cigarette.

So he takes out his lighter.

Even if the sky falls, Shanghai people are still Shanghai people.

### Strange Events of the World

— Hua

In Canton, Ohio, USA, a woman asked for a divorce, complaining that her husband was "unpleasant, irritable, morbid, cold, malicious, jealous, annoying, arrogant, ruthless, stingy, gluttonous, selfish, absent-minded, rude, inconsiderate..."

In Guisborough, England, a policeman named Joseph Wood arrested a man named George Wood, brought him to court, and a man named Robert Wood testified that he stole wood.

### A Gift for a Performer—New Words on Couplets, Eight

— Listening to Pines

Master Tai Shi Jian had already established his literary reputation early on. The Shen family and my family have been close friends for generations, and we also have deep ties of kinship, so I know him very well. Master Jian has been living in Shanghai for a long time and relies on Vice Minister Shao Xiaocun. Their friendship has lasted for many years, and its beginning was actually due to a couplet. When Master Jian first arrived in Shanghai, Shao Xiaocun had just been appointed as the Taiwan Provincial Governor. He was also in Shanghai and happened to meet at a banquet. The Vice Minister was fond of a performer, named Yinzhu, and intended to take her as a concubine. He said she was as beautiful as a crabapple flower and wanted to write a couplet as a gift to her. The host of the banquet, knowing his intentions well, said to Master Jian, "Vice Minister Shao is about to go to Taiwan and is thinking of finding a talented person to be his secretary. Are you interested?" Master Jian came to Shanghai thinking of finding a teaching position, which the host also knew. So the host praised Master Jian, and the Vice Minister also hinted at asking him to compose this couplet. Master Jian considered both embedding the name Yinzhu and considering the name "crabapple," while also implying the intention to conceal her beauty. The threads were complex and difficult to encompass. Suddenly, he thought of two idioms and used them to complete the couplet: "Silver candles burn high, fearing the flowers will fall asleep deep in the night; Pearl curtains are half-rolled, like a familiar swallow returning." The first line uses a line from Su Dongpo's poem about crabapple blossoms, and the second line borrows the image of a familiar swallow to prophesy her return. It's a natural and ingenious match, the likes of which has never been seen, but it really took a lot of effort. It can truly be said to look easy but be actually difficult. The above couplets are sometimes light and graceful, sometimes complete and solid, sometimes bold and unrestrained. The couplets by the gentleman and the minister excel in simplicity, while this one excels in richness. Moreover, the former came from one's own inspiration, while the latter was ghostwritten for someone else. The difference in difficulty cannot be measured by distance. Vice Minister Shao was overjoyed to read this couplet and asked Master Jian to write it on a gold-lettered couplet scroll. The writing was both elegant and beautiful, and the calligraphy was even more powerful and exquisite. Everyone at the table struck the table and praised it, saying that both the writing and the calligraphy were excellent. I say that Master Jian's life is full of interesting affairs. This couplet is the epitome of his interesting nature. (To be continued)

### Reading "Standard"—One of the Book and Newspaper Introductions

— Guo Hua

After seeing the name "Standard," anyone who loves humility cannot help but feel that the host of this weekly magazine is a bit arrogant. After reading its content, one feels that they are not so conceited. The "Editor's Note" states: Standard "itself has no standard, its standard is only the standard of its writers," and its standard will gradually form "after fortunately being able to publish several issues." Once this is said, many people can calm down.

Wei Jinzhi's "A Dying Man" in this inaugural issue is indeed a piece of considerable weight. His heavy, simple pen is used to narrate a heavy and simple story, making the reader feel that every sentence and every word is not frivolous. If this work is taken as the standard, readers welcome the birth of such a pure literary weekly.

Besides this, Zhu Guangqian's translation of "Echo Chamber" is extremely charming, and Yuan Shuibai's translation of the Hughes Poetry Selection is easy to recite. As for Zuo Lin's "Record of Returning Souls," only one-third is published in the first issue. I think I will wait until I see its performance before speaking.

In this era where publishing must lose money, the host is actually able to produce such a pure literary weekly. Even if they are not arrogant, they are bold enough.

### "Adding Flowers to Brocade"

— Meng Ping

Ten years ago, Xiao Zhao and I lived together in an apartment-style hotel in Tokyo. Besides studying, we discussed a person's philosophy of life. He was very smart, and he knew the ways of flattering superiors and blowing for subordinates. In his words, only one or two sentences out of ten were true, and the rest were all lies. He said that people in the world only "add flowers to brocade" and never "provide charcoal in the snow." What is "friendship"? "Money" is friendship. Friendships outside of money are shallow and superficial and do not work for personal prospects. To get the favor and promotion of supervisors, one must spend a lot of money on entertainment. The more money spent, the deeper the supervisor's friendship with you. Once the friendship is deep, any problem can be discussed. When first meeting someone, be sure to elevate your status and not show your true colors or appear poor. Xiao Zhao's words reflected the reality of society, which I understood. But I strongly opposed this way of life. "Those who travel different paths cannot make plans together," so we went our separate ways.

Last spring, due to the high cost of living and the difficulty of maintaining a family, I left the position of quasi-civil servant (not a civil servant but with civil servant treatment) and engaged in business. An outsider doing outsider things, the result was failure.

This cost of living was so oppressive that one could not breathe. Wife crying, children wailing, how to survive? I thought of returning to a teaching position, so I went to find Xiao Zhao. Xiao Zhao was the secretary-general of a certain city's party branch, and at the same time, he was also the principal of a certain municipal middle school and a confidant of the director of the education bureau. With our past friendship, he should be able to help me find a middle school teaching position and would not shirk responsibility.

Xiao Zhao readily agreed. When the schools opened, Xiao Zhao's reply arrived. Upon opening it, it said, "Tried every possible way, but to no avail. Our school's appointment letters have all been issued for a year, and I am very anxious. Please try every possible way to avoid failure," and so on. I understood the reason. I wanted a teaching position, not a principal position, and I also had a brief acquaintance with the director of the bureau. Perhaps I needed "charcoal in the snow." So I looked for department heads, factory directors, etc. The result was always a little hesitant. The result of searching only proved the truth of the saying "adding flowers to brocade."

### Sardines

— Yu Wangwo Painting

(Made in Shanghai)

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Everyone resumed talking, while rearranging the tables and chairs and stepping up preparations for dinner.

After working all day, everyone's mood also needed to relax! The older child playing the harmonica leaned against the window and played the tune of "The Flag is Waving." Seven young people in Hawaiian shirts surrounded him, singing loudly in chorus. Two or three girls walked into the washroom arm in arm. Even Lu, the cripple who harbored a strong sense of melancholy all year round, temporarily relaxed his eyebrows, which were usually knitted together, took out a Hongyin brand cigarette, faced the window, and smoked leisurely.

After a while, the stairs and the corridor were filled with miscellaneous footsteps, interspersed with the sound of bowls and dishes colliding. The "long-awaited" dinner was finally served. Three tables were set up together in the two connected offices, but there were twenty-five or six people, and it was too crowded to sit down. Anyway, this group of young people never paid attention to etiquette. As soon as they grabbed a bowl and chopsticks, they ate standing up. But today there were too many people, and the result of the grab was that one person lost both chopsticks and a bowl, and that was Lu, the cripple who was used to sighing.

"Don't rush, please go ahead! I'll ask Lao Huang to get me some. Alas! This place is really poor, and there aren't even enough bowls when there are more people!" He dropped the cigarette butt he was sucking on and watched the others eat and drink like hungry tigers without any hurry.

The handyman Lao Huang did not wait for him to speak, and had already gone downstairs to find him a bowl and chopsticks.

Lu, the cripple, approached a table by the window and craned his neck, wanting to see how many dishes there were on the table. Suddenly, a person next to him pointed to the outside of the door with the chopsticks in his hand and winked at him. He understood what it meant. Lao Huang, who went down to find the things, could not possibly be back so quickly. Under the door frame on the left, half a person's body was exposed. It was a woman, facing outwards, so only half of her curly long hair could be seen, half of a faded white-background red-flower cheongsam, and a bare, slender leg, with an old cloth shoe underneath. Obviously, she had been leaning against the door for quite some time, because she did not speak and was facing away, so few people noticed.

Lu, the cripple, frowned and scrutinized her half-figure for a minute or two, and suddenly realized. He shook and swayed as he walked over, wanting to speak, but was stopped by the man with a pockmarked face.

"Is that Miss Jin?" He managed to squeeze out the words, and his pockmarked face turned red.

The woman turned around in horror, opened a pair of dull and glazed eyes, looked around at the people around her, and only after seeing a familiar face did her expression gradually calm down, and she reluctantly squeezed out a meaningless smile.
