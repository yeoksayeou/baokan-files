### Declaration of the Third Plenary Session

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China was unanimously adopted at the tenth session on the afternoon of the 24th. The full text is as follows:

This plenary session of our Party is the first gathering after the victorious return to the capital. The time since the last plenary session is exactly one year. During this year, the greatest achievement in Chinese politics has been the convocation of the National Assembly and the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China.

The purpose of the Father of the Nation's advocacy of revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China, and the consistent efforts of our Party since the success of the Northern Expedition, have finally been realized after countless twists and turns. This meeting is held three months after the promulgation of the Constitution. On the one hand, we are pleased that the implementation of constitutional government is expected and that the long-cherished wish of national construction has been fulfilled. At the same time, we examine the current situation of our country. The devastation of the post-war period has not been alleviated, the progress of reconstruction is obstructed, peaceful unification has been undermined, the fruits of victory cannot be promoted, the people's livelihood is difficult, society is unstable, the economy is exhausted, and people's hearts are scattered. We are deeply saddened by the difficulties of the nation's destiny and feel the great responsibility of the revolution even more. We are guided by the Father of the Nation's principles for our struggle: to save the country, save the people, and save the world with great benevolence; to distinguish right from wrong, separate benefits from harms, recognize the times, and know ourselves and others with great wisdom; to have doctrines, purposes, and knowledge with great courage. Therefore, "the world is for all" is the breadth of mind of our Party, serving the people is the duty of our Party, keeping pace with the times is the characteristic of our Party, and persevering in righteousness is the fundamental reason why our Party has overcome difficulties and fulfilled its responsibilities. We have long prepared to return power to the people during the intense period of the War of Resistance. In the past year, in order to enable patriotic and aspiring people to jointly shoulder the responsibility of promoting constitutional government, we have repeatedly expressed our willingness to work with the wise men of the country to overcome difficulties. Now, the agreement to expand the foundation of the government is being implemented. The day when the reorganization of the National Government is completed will be the time when the period of political tutelage begins to end. From then on, the position of our Party and its relationship with the government will be different from the past. However, our Party's sincerity in saving the country and the people, implementing doctrines, and defending the Republic of China should be actively inherited, and we will never shirk it in the slightest. At this meeting, we have made detailed plans on how to revitalize our Party and enrich our Party so that it can adapt to the responsibilities of the new era. We are willing to list the important tasks that should be strived for in the future based on the results of reviewing the domestic and international situations and in response to the major and urgent needs of the current country and nation, and briefly state them to the people of the country.

Complete Constitutional Preparations and Establish National Construction Framework

First, complete the preparations for constitutional government and establish the framework for national construction. The consistent goal of our Party's 50 years of struggle is to remove obstacles to democracy and create a Republic of China that implements the Three Principles of the People. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, for 20 years, the work of national construction has been repeatedly hindered. However, after eight years of the sacred War of Resistance, the Father of the Nation's Three Principles of the People were finally accepted by the whole country as the highest guiding principle for establishing the country, with the goal of building a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. Now that the period for implementing the Constitution as decided by the National Assembly is only nine months away, all preparatory procedures need to be completed with sincerity and trust with all parties and social elites. At this time when the implementation is approaching, the formulation of constitutional laws and regulations, the protection of the people's freedom and rights, the review of existing laws and regulations, the establishment of central and local systems, and the smooth promotion of elections at all levels are all fundamental to establishing the framework of constitutional government. This meeting has made special resolutions on the preparations for the implementation of constitutional government, learning from the past mistakes in the early years of the Republic of China, deeply considering the importance of long-term peace and stability of the country, and believing that the promotion of local autonomy at the grassroots level, the cultivation of the concept of national responsibility among all voters, and the confirmation of the truth that local development and national unity complement each other are especially important considerations for the government after the reorganization. Our Party comrades must, on the one hand, cooperate sincerely with all political parties and support each other, and at the same time, go deep into the people and take on the responsibility of publicizing constitutional government and awakening the people, so that all our compatriots can truly exercise their civil rights and lay a good foundation for the beginning of constitutional government.

Eliminate Obstacles to Unification and Consolidate National Foundation

Second, eliminate obstacles to unification and consolidate the national foundation. The biggest obstacles to national unification, political democracy, and economic construction after the victory of the War of Resistance are the Communist Party's armed disturbances. The National Government's policy of political settlement is based on the spirit of great benevolence and great courage of the Father of the Nation, hoping to move them with consistent sincerity and achieve the goal of peaceful unification, and to alleviate the suffering of the people after the war. In the past year, the government issued orders to stop conflicts three times, and continued to conduct military mediation and negotiations. However, the Communist Party, believing in force and abandoning good faith, carried out a total mobilization in its occupied areas during the government's repeated concessions. Finally, it rejected the government's order to cease fire on the spot, refused to participate in the National Assembly, demanded the cancellation of the Constitution passed by the National Assembly, and launched a full-scale military offensive while the National Army was complying with the ceasefire order, making it impossible to realize the government's policy of political settlement. Wherever the Communist Party's armed forces invaded, the people were either forced to flee or were brutally robbed and killed. The suffering was indescribable, and national unification and social order were undermined. Economic construction and reconstruction were also hindered by its complete destruction of transportation. On the day this meeting was held, the Communist Party's army was launching a full-scale rebellion. We deeply believe that if the country cannot be unified, all kinds of political and economic construction cannot proceed, and the independence and freedom of the country and nation will lose their guarantee. In order to safeguard the survival of the country and nation and to save the people in deep water, this meeting believes that the National Government must take firm and rapid measures to curb the military rebellion of armed violent groups. In the future, after the government is reorganized, our Party will still uphold its consistent revolutionary spirit and jointly assist the government with all parties to eliminate this greatest obstacle to national unification, political democracy, and economic construction. We believe that the policy of peaceful unification should be supported, and the national foundation and people's safety must have strong guarantees. The soldiers who have been fighting for a long time have sacrificed and struggled to save the country and the people. Their hard work is admired by us, and their purpose is only to promote the Communist Party's awakening. Only if the Communist Party is aware that the motherland cannot be betrayed, the people cannot be deceived, and force cannot be relied on forever, and sincerely repents, abandons the illusion of force, and stops destructive work, and transforms from an illegal armed group into a legal ordinary political party and engages in legal political activities, then we firmly believe that the day when the Communist Party expresses with facts that the country's unification, democracy, and construction are effectively guaranteed will be the time when the people of the whole country and the Communist Party can coexist peacefully.

Implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and Stabilize Economic Order

Third, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and stabilize economic order. Today, another serious obstacle to the country's survival and the people's livelihood is the economic imbalance. Our country was originally an agricultural country that was self-sufficient in production. In the past century, it has been reduced to an economic semi-colony. The National Government established its capital in Nanjing and was determined to build, but within three years, natural disasters and man-made disasters came together. After the September 18th Incident, the Communist Army's violent occupation and Japan's oppression and aggression echoed each other. The government did not have time to breathe and could not devote its full strength to economic construction. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the manpower and resources of the front and rear were exhausted and used for the war of defending the country. After eight years of sacrifice, the only economic foundation was destroyed. The financial and economic difficulties and the people's livelihood difficulties after the war are inevitable facts. After the victory, our country's economic construction failed to quickly obtain full cooperation from international capital and technology, and the implementation of economic policies inevitably sacrificed economic measures to meet financial needs, and financial policies could only take into account current revenues. As it has evolved to this day, prices fluctuate, production stagnates, economic order loses its normality, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and the living conditions of those who are employed are inadequate. This meeting believes that the only way to remedy this is to implement the economic policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The meaning of the Principle of People's Livelihood created by the Father of the Nation is to equalize land ownership and control capital, and to formulate strategies for industrial construction, develop national capital, and encourage the people of the whole country to work hard to rebuild production. The goal of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to improve the living standards of the majority of the people and enable the people of the whole country to enjoy a sufficient life. Therefore, all government economic policies must be aimed at the majority of the people, and financial policies and systems must be fundamentally coordinated with this principle, with finance coordinated with the economy, and the economy focusing on production.

More than 80% of our country's total population are farmers. According to the economic policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, we must address the actual needs of farmers' lives, and we must also base on the economic strength that farmers can produce, and help them to fully develop. In the future, we should especially follow the policy of balanced development of agriculture and industry that has been decided in the past, so that economic recovery and construction will not be concentrated in cities, but will be popularized in rural areas, and the construction of industry should be based on agriculture. Only by concentrating the national manpower, material resources, and financial resources on agricultural and industrial production, and coordinating the use of financial, fiscal, and production policies, and effectively promoting land reform and agricultural improvement, can the output of various daily necessities, industrial raw materials, and export materials be increased day by day. Only if industrial production and development, the existing agricultural production, and rural industries advance simultaneously, can our country's unique economic advantages be effectively utilized. This not only establishes a self-sufficient foundation, but also increases purchasing power and promotes foreign trade to reach a normal state. This is further supplemented by rational management of finance, awards for private industrial production, improvement of methods for lending funds, and universal construction of cooperative organizations. At the same time, the whole country sincerely abides by the laws and regulations on emergency economic measures, so that the currency issued by the country will not create rampant hot money, and a small amount of hot money will not cause the bad result of rising prices. It is hoped that the budget can be balanced on schedule and the currency system can be stabilized. This meeting has made specific resolutions on economic reform, and the main point is to change the general concept of the past in order to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. It is believed that today's economy must first return to normal before we can talk about construction, we must grasp the fundamentals before we can solve the difficulties. The government must establish credit, and all measures related to economic and financial measures should be widely consulted and carefully decided in advance. Once promulgated, they should never be changed halfway, and then we can expect the people to abide by them together. We sincerely hope that the government and the people of the whole country will work together to promote its implementation.

Seek Independence and Equality and Devote to International Peace

Fourth, uphold international justice and dedicate to international peace. Our country's foreign policy has consistently taken seeking national independence and equality and promoting world justice and peace as its highest goals. The Father of the Nation has always instructed this, and the National Government has inherited and implemented it for 20 years, and its main points are nothing more than this. It is true that our country has been established in the universe for 5,000 years, and the reason for its establishment is based on the ancient precepts of "the world is for all" and "befriending the benevolent and being a good neighbor," and the traditional spirit with which we treat ourselves and others is "not regretting the widows and orphans, and not fearing the strong." Only with the virtue of not regretting the widows and orphans can we have the determination to not fear the strong. Benevolence and courage are consistent. In the past, the violent Japanese invaded and aggressed by relying on their strength. In order to protect our survival and uphold justice, we concentrated our strength and fought a hard war of resistance for eight years. When they were defeated and surrendered, we announced the policy of not remembering old grudges, and sent Japanese prisoners and Japanese residents back to their countries safely. This spirit of our country is nurtured by the national virtues of 5,000 years. Our country has never had the ambition to dominate the world, nor will it rely on others and look up to them in order to lose its principles due to the changes in the international situation. What we value is that the integrity of territorial sovereignty must be maintained, the status of international equality must be difficult to protect, and the position of justice and reason must be respected. Based on the experience of revolutionary salvation, our Party firmly believes that an independent, autonomous, strong, and prosperous China is an indispensable condition for ensuring world peace, and without a solid guarantee of world peace, China's construction cannot proceed smoothly to completion. Therefore, our respect for justice is to fulfill our nature, and we regard the establishment of world peace as a matter of our own interests. Today's world situation is still in a state of instability. However, the wisdom that mankind has gained from the painful sacrifices of this great war should be the main force for firmly establishing international peace and security. We sincerely hope that the organization of the United Nations can quickly grow and become stronger, and that all international disputes can be resolved satisfactorily within the framework of the United Nations, based on justice and treaties. As a member of the common war of resistance, our China should consistently strive for mutual trust and mutual assistance among friendly countries. We also hope that friendly countries of the United Nations will deeply understand the great relationship between world security and the fate of mankind in the future, and with their far-sighted vision, put themselves in the other's shoes in everything, cooperate with each other without discrimination, so as to lay the foundation for human peace and create a foundation for eternal peace.

### Legislative Yuan to Hold Regular Meeting Today to Discuss Presidential Election and Recall Law, Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law Drafts Completed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold its 319th regular meeting of the fourth session at 9:00 AM on the 25th, during which the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law will be discussed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The draft of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law has been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan's Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee on the 24th and can now be submitted to the general assembly. The main point of contention during today's discussion is the issue of election supervision. According to the original draft, election supervision offices in various localities would be committees, while a national election headquarters would be established, with the National Government appointing five to seven members. Provincial offices would be headed by the provincial governor, with three to seven members also appointed. There was considerable debate regarding the number of Legislative Yuan seats for each province. It was generally agreed that discrepancies in the years of population statistics could easily lead to abuses. It was finally decided to base the calculations on the Ministry of Interior's statistics from March 1946. Another major issue was the method of nominating candidates. It was reported that the original plan required only the joint nomination of 500 electors, which was generally considered too few. Some advocated requiring at least 10,000 joint nominations. It was resolved that candidates for regional representatives must have 5,000 nominations, professional representatives must have 500 nominations, and women representatives must have 200 nominations. The only unresolved issue is the division of electoral districts. Some favored large electoral districts, while others favored small electoral districts, which will need further study in the future. Other key points of the draft are: (1) Legislative Yuan elections will be conducted by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot; (2) Nationals who are 20 years of age or older and do not have any of the following conditions are eligible to vote, and those who are 23 years of age or older and do not have any of the following conditions are eligible to be elected: (A) conviction of a crime under the Criminal Code, (B) corruption, (C) legal incompetence, (D) mental illness; (3) Each elector has only one vote.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to a Legislative Yuan member from the Democratic Socialist Party on the 24th, the party has only two important opinions on constitutional and legal matters: (1) Regarding election supervisory bodies, the party hopes that committees with participation from all parties can jointly manage them to avoid manipulation; (2) It hopes to implement the latest proportional representation system to protect both electors and candidates. It is reported that the Youth Party's legislators share the same views as the Democratic Socialist Party on the issue of election supervision.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 24th] Local newspapers here have widely reported that Chen Yanjiong will be acting as the Chairman of the Chinese Changchun Railway, causing concerns from all sides.

Enrich Educational Content, Cultivate the Vitality of Nation-Building

Fifth, Enrich Educational Content and Cultivate the Vitality of Nation-Building. During the review of domestic politics, socio-economics and other matters, this meeting deeply felt that the greatest regret and deficiency in the nation-building work of China was the incomplete educational facilities and the increasingly empty educational atmosphere. During our eight years of war of resistance, although the number of schools and students increased, the sacrifices and damage to education were also the greatest. Such as the simplicity of equipment, the lack of funding, the poor lives of education personnel, the wandering of students, and the lack of conditions for clothing, food and hygiene. This tangible loss is enough to affect the physical and mental health of the next generation of the nation, and what is even more heartbreaking is the intangible loss in spirit. Since the transition from the War of Resistance to the later period, due to the changes in the social economy, the disparity between the rich and the poor, the suffering of practical life, and the loss of moral standards, the general social customs have been decadent, and only profit is respected. Integrity is regarded as pedantic, and self-love is regarded as backward. Even our noble and clean institutions of learning cannot withstand the invasion of realism, or even be infected by speculation. The starting point is subtle, and the harm is extremely fierce. Dedicated educators feel the pain of being unable to clap with one hand, and students with unsettled blood energy cannot obtain solid cultivation. The relationship between teachers and students, and even the value of passing strangers, leads to short-sighted people pursuing low-level material desires, and more superior youth often become the objects of political struggles. The times are leaping forward, and the youth on whom the lifeline of our nation-building depends, are exhausting their energy in empty and inappropriate political activities. Nation-building requires a profound academic foundation, but today most young people inevitably neglect the advanced studies of basic academics. Nation-building must have specialized techniques of all kinds, but today most young people still cannot settle down to receive practical skills training. If this continues, young people will not recognize the times, themselves, or the needs of nation-building, and will mislead their extremely precious lives. This meeting, thinking of this, cannot but have unlimited hidden worries for the China of the future, and hopes that those in the education field who are concerned about the future of the country will actively remedy this phenomenon. Our government must also attach importance to education, enrich its funding, enrich its equipment, and enrich the content of its teaching, so that students feel the joy of studying and the preciousness of learning, so as not to be empty and mislead themselves. We also hope that comrades of our party engaged in education and cultural undertakings will pay attention to this phenomenon, and work hard and resolutely to cultivate the vitality of nation-building for the country.

The Future of Nation-Building is Bright, Must Overcome Difficulties

The above points are all related to the vital interests of the current state and people, and are also the key to the success or failure of the nation-building cause. They are specially marked and elaborated. Other matters are detailed in the resolutions. This meeting, which lasted for ten days, deeply felt the bright future of our Chinese nation-building cause and the certainty that the policy of peaceful unity and democratic construction could be achieved. At this time, there are indeed many difficulties and obstacles standing in our way, but as the ancient saying goes, "Sincerity can penetrate even metal and stone." In the past eight years of the War of Resistance, the powerful enemy was finally defeated. In the two years after the war, the worries and hardships have gathered, and they are also being cleared one after another. If we can sincerely unite, be selfless and impartial, not divide into factions, and move forward courageously in the face of adversity, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and break through all obstacles, to fulfill the legacy of the Father of the Nation and complete the entire task of nation-building. Our party dedicates itself to the revolution and only asks for responsibility, not for rights. If it benefits the country, we will risk our lives. From now on, all comrades of our party should strengthen their faith, fulfill their talents, correct their shortcomings, do their best to strengthen themselves, serve the people, and be loyal to the country, so as to follow in the footsteps of our national patriots and not fail the Father of the Nation and the martyrs, nor fail the anti-Japanese martyrs and the fellow countrymen who have been displaced and suffered hardships after the war. Today's staunch struggle is to achieve the brilliant and solemn future. This is our declaration. (The End)

Editorial

### The Brightening Domestic Political Situation

The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang (KMT) has been discussing current political, economic, military, and diplomatic issues for several days. Not only have important resolutions been passed and effective measures adopted, but these measures are also what the people of the country have been longing for day and night. Therefore, Nanjing has been filled with an optimistic and bright atmosphere these past few days, making everyone feel optimistic about the future of the country. However, the implementation of the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session depends on the government in the future. Therefore, the reorganization of the government is still the focus of the people's attention. Yesterday, it was reported that the government had discussed the reorganization of the government with the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social leaders, and has made significant progress, and an "Joint Governance Program" has been negotiated. Although it has not yet been approved by the parties, the content of this Joint Governance Program has very important implications. According to various newspapers, the main points are as follows:

(1) The peaceful construction program will be the guideline for the policies of the reorganized government; (2) The principles of political democratization and nationalization of the military will be earnestly implemented to promote political progress; (3) The issue of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) should be resolved through political means. Negotiations will be held when transportation is restored and the CCP abandons armed force or accepts reorganization; (4) A system of responsible cabinet government will be implemented. When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the administrative authorities must attend to provide explanations; (5) Before the implementation of the constitution, the president of the Executive Yuan will be appointed by the chairman of the National Government, but must be agreed to by all parties participating in the government; (6) Each province's administration adheres to the principle of separation of military and civilian affairs; (7) Laws and regulations established during the period of political tutelage due to special needs and the established organizations must be abolished and dismantled after the government is reorganized; (8) Tax collection agencies should be reorganized and tax collection procedures simplified; (9) The personal freedom and freedom of speech, assembly, and association of the people must be guaranteed and strictly enforced; (10) Foreign policy should be based on equality and goodwill; (11) Foreign debt should be used for productive construction; (12) Representatives from all parties must be included in the provincial, municipal, and county councils and local governments.

These twelve points are not only a common governance program that the people of the country unanimously demand, but also an important charter for the next nine-month transition period. We believe that all parties in the country will gladly approve it. Because the practical and easy-to-implement democratic constitution passed by the National Assembly last year will be implemented on December 25th of this year. However, from today until the date of implementation of constitutional government, there are only nine months left. In such a short period, how can we not accelerate the completion of all the necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutional government? Therefore, from the day the National Assembly closed, we, the common people, have been eagerly hoping for the reorganization of the government to immediately begin preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. At that time, because peace talks could not be restored and the parties hesitated, the reorganization of the government was delayed again and again, until early March of this year when there was a glimmer of hope. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party finally joined the four institutions (Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, National Political Council, and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association), but this move can only be regarded as a prelude to the two parties' participation in the government, and cannot be seen as an expansion of the foundation of the government. The real reorganization of the government still lies in the reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan. Therefore, at that time, all parties were still extremely eager for the reorganization of the government, but the parties could not help but hesitate to jointly assume political responsibility, and then successively expressed that the government would be reorganized after the closing of the KMT's Third Plenary Session. Now that the KMT's Third Plenary Session is about to close, the reorganization of the government is indeed imminent.

As for why we ordinary people are so eagerly awaiting the reorganization of the government? Simply put, because the current period is a transition period for the KMT to end political tutelage and implement constitutional government, the main task of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government must still be the responsibility of the KMT. However, the foundation of the government must be expanded to include the leaders of various parties and social leaders, thereby demonstrating the KMT's sincerity and determination to return power to the people. At the same time, after the government is reorganized, a new batch of blood cells will be added, which will definitely play a considerable role in the innovation of politics and the promotion of constitutional government. However, how should the government be reorganized? What kind of government will be formed after the participation of the parties? In advanced democratic countries, there is naturally no problem, but in China, which is about to implement constitutional government, at least technically, some difficulties will inevitably be encountered. The government representatives and the leaders of the parties, despite much travel between Nanjing and Shanghai, have not been able to negotiate a solution, and that is the reason. However, the government's request for various parties to participate in the government and the various parties' request for the government to expand its foundation, although the positions of both sides are different, the goals they hold are the same. In other words, it is hoped that during this transitional period, all the necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutional government will be completed, so that China's politics can embark on the path of true democracy. As long as this goal can be achieved, no matter how the National Government Committee members are distributed? No matter how the various departments under the Executive Yuan are allocated? The government and the parties can have no objections, but how can the parties believe that the reorganized government will be able to complete this task? There must be a common governance program among the parties. The purpose of negotiating a common program this time is also here. With a common program, as long as the reorganized government implements it earnestly, the parties will not have to ask how many members are participating in the government. Therefore, the negotiation of a common program is indeed a preliminary success in the reorganization of the government, and it is worthy of our celebration.

Finally, we must point out that the biggest feature of the Common Program is that it still uses the peaceful nation-building program passed by the Political Consultative Conference as the guiding principle for the reorganized government's policies. The government and various parties' repeated statements to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference not only dispel malicious criticisms attacking the government for undermining the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but also prove that only the government and the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party are truly able to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The editorials of this newspaper for more than a year have all said this when discussing peace talks. To be honest, if Chinese politics does not embark on the path of political democratization and nationalization of the military, and blindly wanders at the crossroads, there will never be a way out. When the Political Consultative Conference concluded successfully, we wrote an article celebrating the future of the country; when the CCP attempted to expand its territory by force and destroy the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we repeatedly advised the CCP not to be obsessed, otherwise it would not only be self-destructive to the people of the country, but also be enough to plunge the country into a state of eternal doom. Therefore, we still hope that the CCP can have a great epiphany now. Put down your weapons, the government will not be tough on the CCP to the end because of the restoration of Yan'an. As long as the CCP has the sincerity to put down its weapons, the government will be able to sincerely resume peace talks with the CCP and resolve the CCP issue through political means. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has announced at the Third Plenary Session that the KMT is preparing to regard itself as an ordinary political party. Yesterday, at the Central Memorial Week, he said that all KMT members must fully prepare in the next nine months so that they can stand on an equal footing with other political parties and engage in political competition. If the CCP also considers itself an ordinary political party, appeals to the people with its ideology, and relies on public opinion in everything, then it should also put down its weapons and compete for power with other political parties through legitimate and legal procedures. Even if it fails due to competition, it can still maintain its existing status, which is a thousand times better than the CCP's current use of force to seize power, which is spurned by the people of the country! I hope the CCP can wake up and realize, and I hope that the domestic political situation will be brighter and more promising from now on!

### Seeking Compromise on the German Question, Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters New Stage, British and American Foreign Policies Fully Converge

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 24th broadcast: Reviewing the two-week-long four-power debate, it is found that Britain and the United States hold the same foreign policy on the German question. In previous foreign ministers' meetings, the opinions of Britain and the United States on the German satellite country treaty were not the same, but there has never been such a close consensus of opinions as this time. The four powers are adjourned today to allow the special committee to reconcile and compare the various proposals put forward in the past two weeks. The special four-power committee will report on the key points of agreement and conflict tomorrow, so as to determine the steps to be taken in the future.

[United Press Moscow, 24th dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to resume tomorrow, and the diplomatic struggle over the German question will enter a new stage. Both the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain intend to make the German government most favorable to their own political system, so they are planning strategies separately, and must make the German government's mode the same as their own. The four foreign ministers' representatives are also discussing the German peace treaty, working hard to reduce various political and economic proposals, and reporting the agreed and disagreed points to the foreign ministers. An American official said that this week is a critical period, and the result will show whether this Moscow meeting can be expected to achieve concrete results on the entire issue.

[United Press Moscow, 23rd dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will take a two-day break today, and the foreign ministers need to sort out the documents, proposals and plans of the two weeks of meetings. US Secretary of State Marshall stayed indoors almost all day today. According to his adjutant, Marshall has no plans to meet with Marshal Stalin. The foreign ministers' meeting has been going on for two weeks, and Marshall and Bevin have not proposed to meet with Stalin, and Stalin has not proposed to meet with Marshall and Bevin. People have begun to express surprise at this.

[United Press Moscow, 23rd dispatch] Although the distance between the opinions of the four powers in the foreign ministers' meeting is far, senior American officials here have expressed "limited" optimism after two weeks of the meeting. They believe that it is too early to predict the outcome of the foreign ministers' meeting at present, but pointed out that the progress of the foreign ministers' meeting is faster than expected. In just two weeks, except for the issue of Germany's future borders, which is the US plan to disarm the German army, which has not yet been mentioned, almost all the items on the agenda have been discussed. The foreign ministers will conduct real negotiations from next week, which may shorten the distance of opinion divergence or find a compromise solution. Only after several days of such negotiations can it be expected whether a basic agreement on the principles of the German peace treaty is possible.

Without any results, it was decided to hand it over to the four foreign ministers for discussion.

[United Press Moscow, 23rd dispatch] The four foreign ministers are currently discussing the Austrian peace treaty, of which there are seventeen key points, and the opinions of all parties have failed to converge. US Secretary of State Marshall recently made a proposal to postpone the discussion of technical programs and first reach a basic agreement, so as to break this stalemate. According to Hua's representative Clark: The four foreign ministers are currently drafting the final report, so as to submit it to the foreign ministers' meeting for discussion on Saturday, and then listen to the opinions of the Austrian representatives. The main point of contention in the current stalemate is the issue of German property that has been moved away from Austria. The Soviet Union believes that it has the right to move it, while Britain and the United States insist that it cannot be moved. Marshall now advocates postponing the discussion of technical issues and first determining the interpretation of German property in Austria. This proposal will now be submitted for discussion at the four-power meeting on Tuesday.

The key points of the disputes listed by Clark are as follows: (1) There are two conflicting opinions in the preamble, namely, A Which other countries can be allowed to participate in signing the contract; B The United States does not regard Austria as an enemy country, so should Austria bear the responsibility for participating in the war. (2) There are six conflicting opinions on political clauses, namely, whether the Allied powers and Austria should bear the obligation to maintain Austria's independence, the issue of prohibition of annexation, whether Austria's borders should be based on the borders of 1938, or whether the territorial demands of Yugoslavia should be recognized and modified, and so on. (3) There are five conflicting opinions on military clauses, namely, whether Austria will supply its military needs with its own military equipment, whether it should be prohibited from researching or manufacturing certain military materials, and whether the Allied powers need to send a military delegation to Austria to monitor its implementation of military clauses, and so on. (4) In addition to the issue of German property, what the Allied powers cannot agree to is whether Austria should restore to its original state the property of the United Nations that was robbed by the Axis countries within its territory, and whether it should compensate for the war damage suffered by the property of the United Nations at the price, and so on.

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 24th broadcast: The Moscow Pravda reported today: The Soviet Union has acquired German assets as Austrian compensation, the total amount of which does not exceed 10% of Austria's total industrial productivity. In various industries, the part occupied by the Soviet Union is only 2.3%. The newspaper condemned Britain and the United States for coveting Austria's industry and attempting to undermine the Potsdam Agreement on Austrian compensation.

### Vastly Different Opinions Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the Issue of Universal Disarmament

[United Press Success Lake, 23rd dispatch] The United Nations Disarmament Commission is scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 24th. It is said that the Soviet Union has drafted a detailed plan for world disarmament, but this statement cannot be confirmed so far. British and American representatives hope that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko can clearly put forward some concrete suggestions. British representative Sir Jaddagan and US representative Johnson have been ordered to oppose any suggestion of the Soviet Union to start disarmament in the near future, because Britain and the United States believe that disarmament is absolutely impossible before establishing a solid guarantee and the United Nations establishes a "peacekeeping mechanism". And before the establishment of international control of atomic energy, disarmament is just hope. Gromyko has repeatedly ridiculed the views of Britain and the United States, and pointed out that this is an imperialist argument. British and American representatives believe that the only reasons why the Soviet Union is so keen on rapid disarmament are (1) to stir up the issue of disarmament to obstruct the progress of national control of atomic energy, because the Soviet Union is the only major country that opposes the US atomic energy control and investigation plan; (2) to regard it as a propaganda effect, using the issue of disarmament to take the initiative in the United Nations organization and force Britain and the United States to follow suit. In order to avoid the Disarmament Commission from being involved in the issue of atomic energy, the US representative insisted on defining a clear boundary between the two committees, and all atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction should be discussed by the Atomic Energy Commission. It is also learned that the Atomic Energy Commission will start another new stage of the meeting from the 26th of this month, and the Trusteeship Committee will also start its first meeting on the 26th.

### Hoover Strenuously Advocates, Rejuvenating German Industry

Anti-Soviet Law Undermines Potsdam Agreement

[United Press Washington, 24th dispatch] Former US President Hoover submitted the third German-Austrian economic survey report to President Truman, suggesting to restore German industrial production and reduce its military potential. He also pointed out that the production policies implemented by the Soviet Union and France in Germany are undermining the Potsdam Agreement, and the relief plan implemented by Britain and the United States in Germany is paying compensation to the Soviet Union and France on behalf of Germany, resulting in a sacrifice of 70 million US dollars per year for British and American taxpayers.

### Yalta Secret Agreement Stipulates, German Prisoner Labor as Compensation

[United Press London, 24th dispatch] Foreign Minister McNair confirmed in the House of Commons today that the three powers stipulated in the Yalta Secret Agreement that the labor of German prisoners of war should be used as part of the compensation.

### US Senator Coleman Advocates, Taking Economic Retaliation Against the Soviet Union, and Emphasizes the US Peace Policy

[United Press Washington, 23rd dispatch] Congressman Coleman, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, proposed today that the United States "should expose the Soviet Union's paper tiger and deal with it with the only means it understands, namely economic retaliation." Coleman also said that he will submit a bill tomorrow to advocate a stronger attitude towards all communist-controlled governments, and the United States shall not lend to them or provide other assistance. The content of this resolution is as follows: (1) The arrears shall not be cancelled before the conditions stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act are fulfilled; (2) The United States shall terminate all forms of assistance to any government that fails to fulfill the United Nations Charter; (3) The United States shall not grant new loans to such governments, and those that have been negotiated shall be suspended pending their fulfillment of political agreements; (4) Prevent such countries from obtaining US industrial secrets and other confidential national defense information; (5) The United States and other countries should take completely mutual measures for factory practice or visits, and should not be merely a unilateral act; (6) The United States should prevent excessive exaction of German compensation, so that it can be self-sufficient, and terminate the relief expenses of the Allied powers; (7) Notify the whole country and declare that the purpose of the US policy is to seek and maintain a just and lasting peace in the free world. Coleman admitted that this bill was issued against the Soviet Union, but also said that some governments have failed to fulfill political agreements and hold free elections in liberated areas.

### Before the Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill is Passed, the United States Plans to Allocate 100 Million Yuan First, to be Used as the Initial Expenses of the Entire Plan

[United Press Washington, 24th dispatch] President Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey to prevent communism is currently being discussed in Congress. It will not become law until mid-April, but the deadline for British troops to withdraw from Greece on March 31 is approaching. Therefore, some people in Washington are moving today to authorize President Truman to borrow 100 million US dollars from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation first, so as to cope with the situation after the withdrawal of British troops from Greece. President Truman's plan requires a total of 400 million US dollars to aid the Greek and Turkish governments and provide civil and military guidance. The temporary allocation of 100 million US dollars is roughly to fill the initial expenses of this plan to fill the gap when the United States has not yet stepped in after the British side withdraws from the Middle East. Assistant Secretary of State Clayton was summoned to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today to review the funds in President Truman's plan in detail. At the same time, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has also begun to study this plan, summoning Acting Secretary of State Acheson to attend the meeting and present his views. Democratic Senator Lucas said: If the two parties can overcome this test of cooperation, it is expected that President Truman will invite the Republican Party to discuss other issues of foreign policy. According to observers, the State Department's announcement of the Soviet Union's secret documents on the "nerve war" against Turkey has greatly stimulated members of Congress and will intensify efforts to complete the legislative procedures for President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey bill as soon as possible.

### Acheson Continues to Explain the US Policy of Aiding Greece and Turkey

The Purpose is to Maintain Democratic Politics

[United Press Washington, 23rd dispatch] US Acting Secretary of State Acheson declared to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday: A proposal for the United States to lend 400 million US dollars to Greece and Turkey is aimed at safeguarding the basic principles of the United Nations and assisting the people of each country to determine their own political system, but the US government does not want them to adopt the US government. When asked whether this proposal is a plan for the "equilibrium of power" policy, Acheson replied: "Greece is not only one of the ancient countries in the world, but democratic politics also originated in Greece. Now the country is in a difficult state of economy and finance. Our aid to the country is to give it an opportunity to gain a foothold and protect its democratic politics." When asked whether the US plan is aimed at communism or the Soviet Union, Acheson replied: Except for the division of labor, it is not a blow to anyone. We do not want to attack any country, nation or government. This move is not a crusade with any political significance. The United States has no intention of maintaining the status quo in these countries. When asked what the consequences would be if President Truman's plan was not approved, Acheson replied: I think the result will inevitably make the countries in the Near East have a strong feeling that the United States does not care about fulfilling its guarantee to maintain free nations and free institutions.

### Former Kwantung Army Staff Officer Denies Supporting Puyi

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th (Special Dispatch)] Katakura, a former staff officer of the Kwantung Army, testified as a defense witness for Japanese war criminals at the Far East International Military Tribunal this morning. He denied that the Kwantung Army had worked to establish the puppet state of Manchukuo. He insisted that Puyi fled to the Northeast of his own volition and that the Kwantung Army did not order him to go. He claimed that Kenji Doihara notified the Kwantung Army on November 9, 1932, that Puyi wished to go to the Northeast as soon as possible, which should be supported by all 30 million people of the Northeast and the Japanese. According to another telegram from Doihara, Puyi planned to go to the Northeast before the Liaodong Bay froze in winter. Katakura strenuously defended Jiro Minami, who was the Minister of the Army at the time, stating that the Ministry of the Army had strictly ordered the Kwantung Army not to interfere in the movement to restore the monarchy in the Northeast. Doihara was sent to Tianjin by Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army Honjo Shigeru in November of the following year. His special mission was to gather intelligence in the Pinghan area, explore Puyi's intentions, and study the policies to be adopted if Zhang Xueliang took action south of the Great Wall. Doihara was specifically ordered not to make any promises to Puyi.

### Following Truman's Order to Purge Official Corruption, Congress Begins Action, Plans to Withhold Funding to Force Dismissal of Suspicious Elements

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Following President Truman's order to purge official corruption yesterday afternoon, Congress today proposed withholding funding to force the dismissal of officials with suspicious words and deeds who are disloyal to their duties. The House Appropriations Committee has refused to allocate funds for the Director of the Mediation Service, Warren, hoping that the House will approve it. The committee believes that Warren had joined "a front leaning towards the Communist Party," but Warren stated that he was unaware of the nature of this organization and has withdrawn from it. Some congressmen are now also discussing refusing to allocate funds to Lilienthal, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. President Truman's appointment of Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission had previously drawn criticism.

### US Publishes Report on Greece and Turkey, Lists Reasons for US Support of the Two Countries

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The State Department has just released a report on Greece and Turkey, in which it accuses the Soviet Union of waging a war of nerves against the two countries and attempting to obtain special privileges to control and defend the Turkish Straits. Regarding Greece, the report states that the presence of British troops in Greece is believed to be the main factor preventing the governments of Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria from taking aggressive action. Furthermore, the United States believes that if Britain and Greece can reach an agreement to annex Cyprus to Greece, the United States is willing to support it. The United States supports Greece maintaining its 1939 borders but opposes Greece's demand to acquire the Northern Epirus province of Albania. However, the United States does not object if Greece presents this demand to the Council of Foreign Ministers. The United States also supports the transfer of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece but opposes changing the Greek-Bulgarian border. These issues will be decided after the treaties with the Axis satellite states come into effect.

The report further reveals that the United States has begun negotiations with Greece on a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation and has informed Britain and Greece that it opposes the British proposal to establish a Greek commercial corporation. The United States believes that the military occupation of Greece implemented under the Anglo-American Agreement of 1942 has a stabilizing effect on Greece. The United States has recently suggested to the Greek government that it broaden its government base to include all loyal Greek parties, whether or not they participate in the current parliament, but that extreme leftists who attempt to undermine Greek independence and right-wing reactionaries who refuse to cooperate with truly free elements should be excluded from the government.

The report further reveals that the number of British troops stationed in Greece has been greatly reduced in recent months and can no longer be regarded as an operational force. The number of British troops in Greece will soon be reduced to 6,000, so the British presence in Greece has only a political and psychological effect and may have some effect in preventing aggression against Greece by the three countries of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. These three countries have an aversion to Greece and harbor territorial ambitions. Due to the weakness of the Greek military, Greece's three northern neighbors, acting alone or independently, could easily seize part of Greek territory if there were no international considerations. If the troops of the three countries invaded Greece and clashed with British troops, the political situation would inevitably become more serious. The report continues: The United States believes that the Greek National Liberation Front is not sufficient to represent democratic Greece and that the Greek Communist Party and its affiliated organizations are a serious threat to the Greek state. The 13,000-strong armed forces controlled by the Communist Party are roughly equal in strength to the poorly trained and poorly treated Greek government forces.

The report concludes by stating that the United States is deeply concerned about the security issues arising from the dilemma between Greece and its northern neighbors. The United States believes that this security issue is fundamentally related to the security of the United States itself. (Note: Although the public statements of President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Undersecretary of State Acheson did not explicitly mention the Soviet Union, the official documents received by the US Congress directly name the Soviet Union, accusing it of waging a war of nerves against Greece, of being hostile to the current Greek government, and of obstructing the UN agency's investigation team on the Greek situation.)

Regarding Turkey, the report states that Turkey feels that it has fallen into an extremely difficult position with regard to the Soviet Union, and the tension between the two countries has not eased. The Soviet Union's continued attempts to enjoy special privileges to control and defend the Turkish Straits have stalled negotiations to revise the Montreux Convention. The Soviet Union has ambitions for certain strategic locations in northeastern Turkey. Turkey deeply hopes to restore the country to political normalcy, begin the demobilization of its troops, and revive its national economy, but its entire people are united in resisting foreign aggression and believe that the integrity of the Middle East and the independence of the nation are necessary for world peace. US financial loans to Turkey are sufficient to ensure its sovereignty or territorial integrity from threats.

The report states, regarding the Straits issue: Turkey is firmly opposed to any treaty revisions that would infringe upon Turkish sovereignty over the Straits, but the Soviet Union seems determined to participate in the control and defense of the region. Regarding the Soviet Union's demands for the Kars region and the Ardahan province, the United States believes that neither historically nor legally is there sufficient justification for its demands. The Soviet Union's goals are to protect the security of the Caucasus oil fields, gain access to the Persian Gulf, and pressure Turkey to establish a Turkish regime that caters to Soviet desires.

The report further states that the demands of the Georgian Soviet Republic for land in eastern Turkey have no ethnic basis and that Georgia's demands involve the entire relationship between the Soviet Union and the Middle East today.

The economic portion of the report states that Turkey must maintain a large military force, and its military spending exceeds half of the nation's total income, so its economic situation is very difficult. Trade between Turkey and the Soviet Union has almost completely stopped, and the United States has become Turkey's best customer and its main source of supply.

### Central Bank Employees Found to Have Purchased Gold: Assistant Managers, Directors, and Others Receive Penalties of Dismissal and Demotion. All Accounting Records of Tongfengyu Gold Shop Sent to Court. Police Bureau Denies Investigation Team's Request to Access Records

Regarding the gold rush case, in which employees of the Central Bank were found to have purchased gold, the bank has thoroughly investigated and handled the matter. The names and quantities of gold purchased by all employees have been verified and reported to the bank's governor, who has referred the matter to the personnel department for disciplinary action. It is learned that four individuals, including Wang Songtao, assistant manager of the business bureau, Wang Yuanqing and You Di, deputy directors, and Da Fu, clerk, have been dismissed. In addition, it is rumored that many others have received penalties of demotion and warning.

(Reported by this newspaper) The sensational gold rush case, which began with accusations by supervisory committee members You, Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Yunsheng being arrested, has subsided after Lin and Yang were temporarily released to handle the handover of duties, and Zhan was sent to court for detention and interrogation. Recently, the Ministry of Finance suddenly reopened the investigation into this case. He Qi, an advisor from the Ministry of Finance, and Fan Shixing, an auditor from the Auditing Department, were ordered to come to Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, they visited Fang Zhichao, director of the administrative division, and Xu Youzuo, chief of the fourth section, at the police bureau, requesting access to all accounting records relating to Zhan Yunsheng's handling of the Central Bank's gold allocation, as investigated by the former Economic Inspection Team's Gold and Currency Group. However, the police bureau believed that since the case files and the suspects had already been sent to the court, the police bureau should be responsible to the court and could not hand over the accounting records to other agencies, so the request was denied. After several hours of negotiations, Advisor He and Director Fang contacted the head of the district court by telephone, and it was finally decided that the police bureau would first transfer the accounting records of Zhan Yunsheng of Tongfengyu Gold Shop to the court in accordance with the procedures. If the Ministry of Finance needed to access the records, they could directly contact the court. All accounting records were personally sent to the district court by Section Chief Xu at 5:30 PM yesterday. The Economic Inspection Team conducted a very detailed investigation into the corruption in the Central Bank's gold allocation, and the impeachment brought forward by the supervisory committee members was largely based on this investigation.

### Speeding Up Screening of Opium Addicts; Expected Completion within Two Months

The municipal government recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Interior stating that there are still over 4,000 registered opium addicts in Shanghai who have not been screened, and that the crackdown on unregistered opium addicts should be intensified. Based on this, the municipal government immediately ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to comply. The Police Bureau has reported the progress to the municipal government, stating that a total of 6,060 opium addicts have been registered in the city. In accordance with regulations, screening began on July 1, 1946. Due to the limited number of beds in the Shanghai Opium Addiction Screening Center and the limited number of people it can accommodate, the screening has been conducted in batches, with a total of 1,225 people in each of the two batches, totaling 3,605 people. The number of opium addicts who have not been screened is actually only 2,455, and a large number of them have died, moved, or have incorrect addresses, making it impossible to serve summons. Currently, the Bureau of Health has designated 15 municipal public hospitals to assist the Opium Addiction Screening Center in carrying out the screening work. At the same time, the Bureau is supervising the various sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction to investigate and identify unscreened opium addicts and summon them for screening in batches. It is expected that all screening will be completed within two months. As for unregistered opium addicts, the Bureau has been strictly cracking down on them, without the slightest懈怠. It is estimated that 2,264 opium offenders have been arrested as of the end of January this year, and the Bureau will continue to supervise its subordinates to earnestly crack down on them.

### Pig Bristle Industry Gradually Resumes Operations: Wage Adjustment Resolved

(Reported by this newspaper) The pig bristle industry in Shanghai was previously facing difficulties due to the sluggish market, and various foreign firms and companies were laying off employees or shutting down due to lack of profit. The livelihoods of over a thousand workers in the industry were difficult, and disputes often arose over demands for resumption of work. Around the beginning of this month, the market improved, and various firms and factories gradually resumed operations, rescuing the unemployed workers. In order to stabilize their lives, workers demanded that the management adjust wages according to the cost of living index. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened representatives from major firms in the industry and labor representatives for mediation, and a wage adjustment plan was agreed upon: (1) For bristle sorting from 2 inches to 2.7 inches, the base salary is 23 yuan per dan; for 3 inches and above, the base salary is 20 yuan per dan.

### Coal Supply to Shanghai Decreases, Fuel Management Committee Faces Great Difficulties. 6,000 Tons of Stored Coal to Be Reallocated to Public Servants and Teachers

Yesterday, Xie Baokang, the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, stated that the committee was instructed by the Executive Yuan to prepare approximately 6,000 tons of coal for the 120,000 public servants and teachers in the city. Therefore, the 6,000 tons of retail coal originally intended for allocation to residents will be reallocated for coal balls to public servants and teachers. Recently, the source of coal has been scarce. The amount of coal transported from North China to Shanghai this month is only 80,000 tons, but the city's average monthly consumption is more than 140,000 tons. This 80,000 tons can only supply the needs of public utilities. Last month, coal for factories was also allocated from the only 50,000 tons of coal in stock to solve the immediate problem. Therefore, it is impossible to supply retail coal on the market. However, we hope that the source of coal will be unimpeded.

### Fake Police Bureau Deputy Director Rao Shu Tried; Eloquent and Energetic, Claims He Only Acted in a Play

(Reported by this newspaper) The case of Rao Shu, suspected of being a traitor, was heard at the High Court yesterday afternoon.

He then served as the Inspector-General under Shigeru Gojima, the Chief of the Special Higher Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, and later as the Deputy Director of the Puppet Fuzhou Road Police Bureau. After the victory, he was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau and sent to the court for interrogation. Rao was eloquent and energetic when answering questions in court yesterday. He stated: I originally served in the Central Bureau of Statistics and was sent to work in Shanghai during the War of Resistance. In the autumn of 1939, I was captured by Li Shiqun's subordinates at the Great World and detained at 76 Jessefield Road. I was detained for two and a half months. During my detention, I discussed with two friends that we would act in a play. Although we could not eliminate the special agents of the "Peace Movement," we could at least save a few people. That's how I joined the puppet organization. At first, I served as the section chief of the Second Division of the Puppet Special Service Headquarters, translating English newspapers. Later, I was transferred to serve as the Deputy Director of the Wuhan District. In Hankou, I met Gojima Shigeru, the Chief of the Special Higher Police of the Japanese Military Police, and I had a very good relationship with Gojima. Whenever comrades working for our side were arrested by the Japanese Military Police, I would always use Gojima's connections to try to bail them out. Later, Gojima Shigeru was transferred to serve as the Chief of the Special Higher Police of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, and I also came to Shanghai to work with him. I saved so many people that I can't remember their names. I was just goofing around while working in the puppet organization. If the court investigates and finds that I ever arrested anyone, I will commit suicide. Please investigate my crimes. I don't want to be let off easily, but I can't be wronged either. Subsequently, Lan Chengzai, a staff member of the Military Intelligence Bureau, testified in court that he was arrested by the enemy Military Police in Shanghai in 1942 and sent to Nanjing. He was released on bail by Rao Shu, thus avoiding disaster. At this point, the court adjourned the hearing, stating that further investigation was needed.

### Hsu Wei-chen's Sentence Reduced to Four Years; Hsieh Hsiao-chu Denied Bail

[Our Report] Hsu Wei-chen, the former president of the puppet Shanghai High Court, was originally sentenced to ten years' imprisonment by the High Court. The defendant appealed and applied for a retrial by the Supreme Court. After review, the Supreme Court held that although the defendant had participated in the puppet organization and taken over the Shanghai court, which constituted damage to the judicial system, the defendant claimed that he had been forced to take the puppet position due to pressure from the enemy and puppets, and the duration of his service was very short, having resigned before June of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942). Taking the circumstances into consideration, the original judgment was revoked, and the sentence was reduced to four years' imprisonment. The judgment has already been delivered to Shanghai.

Furthermore, Hsieh Hsiao-chu, chairman of the puppet Chemical Raw Materials Trade Association, has been sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment. He recently requested bail for medical treatment due to illness, but the High Court rejected his application.

### Merchants and Residents of Sevenpin and Tsaohoking Petition for Highway Operating Rights

[Our Report] Approximately 500 merchants, residents, and stores in Sevenpin and Tsaohoking are jointly petitioning the Municipal Council regarding the dispute over the operating rights of the Tsaopin Highway. The petition states: "The entire route of the Tsaopin Highway and the land taxes over the years have been paid by the residents. A Transportation Committee has been organized by the chiefs of the villages along the road, representatives of the district, councilors, and impartial gentry. However, there has been no formal passenger transportation service. When the road was first built, the Shanghai-Minhang Transportation Company intended to invest, but for ten years, there has been no communication. Now that the Tsaopin Road Transportation Committee has been organized and is beginning to operate vehicles, the Shanghai-Minhang route's vehicles are rashly operating on this road, obstructing the local public-operated vehicles. They want to take the operating rights of the highway based on an undetermined road from ten years ago, disregarding local public opinion and undermining public welfare. Therefore, we request that the authorities uphold local public interest, not advocate for private enterprises, and make a reasonable resolution with the Shanghai-Minhang Company. At the same time, we request the Public Utilities Bureau to issue a business license to the Tsaopin Highway Transportation Committee, to comply with public opinion and benefit transportation."

### Kuo Chi Righteous School Builds Schoolhouse, Privately Contracts to Demolish Air Raid Shelter, Suspect Accused of Stealing and Selling Enemy Property, Evidence Seized

[Our Report] At around 10 a.m. on the 17th, Sergeant Cao Shih-ching, a police officer from Post No. 659 of the Sports Association Road Police Station under the New Market Street Police Precinct, seized a suspect named Che Shih-chi, a demolition foreman, and Che Chi-kuei, who were privately transporting bricks and stones from an enemy air raid shelter, at the Sung Hu Road intersection in Wuchiaochang. He also impounded a Kuo Lei No. 16514 transport truck loaded with 3,000 bricks, as well as the driver, Yu Zhong-he, and brought them to the station for questioning. According to Che Chi-kuei's confession, on December 9th of last year, Chang Kuo-hsien, a representative of the Kuo Chi Righteous School, wanted to build a schoolhouse and planned to demolish a damaged air raid shelter built by the enemy and puppets in the Fudan University sports field. It was estimated that over 100,000 bricks could be obtained, and they planned to sell them to fund the schoolhouse construction, using the rubble, all the iron bars, and broken cement to offset labor costs, and a contract was signed. The demolition has now been completed, and a total of 160,000 bricks have been obtained. The precinct sent officers to investigate and summoned the school's representative, Chang Kuo-hsien, for questioning. According to Chang, he had initiated the establishment of the Righteous School last year, and because there were many students and the schoolhouse was insufficient, he planned to sell the bricks from the air raid shelter to fund the construction of the schoolhouse. According to the investigating police officer, the Kuo Chi Righteous School has not yet been registered and approved by the Education Bureau. Zhang Kuo-hsien and Che Chi-kuei are suspected of colluding to steal and sell enemy property. After reporting the situation to the General Bureau, they were handed over to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution yesterday on charges of damage.

### Shanghai Prison Factory: Prisoners Work Hard to Produce; A Five-Story Gray Building with Various Manufacturing Workshops

[Our Report by Our Writer] In the old days, prisons caused great physical and mental suffering to prisoners. After leaving prison, good people turned bad, and bad people turned worse, and society never had peace. Modern prisons have completely adopted progressive measures, not only passively punishing, but also actively reforming, turning bad people into good people, and useless people into useful people. Not only are food and housing hygienic and comfortable, but they are also trained in work skills, so that each person has a skill that will enable them to become a productive member of society after leaving prison, rather than a parasite on society. After visiting the Shanghai Prison Factory, I was even more amazed by the progress and rationality of modern prisons.

The factory is located behind the prison office, in a five-story gray building. Upon entering, there are signs that read "Silence", "Maintain Order", and "Keep to the Right". The factory starts work at 6:30 a.m. and ends at 5:15 p.m. Meal times: 7:50 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Workers wear gray prison uniforms and are numbered. There is no fixed salary, and payment is based on work performance. On the north side of the first floor is the iron factory, with 15 workers, who use black iron and white iron to make iron pipes, iron buckets, and other items. On the south side is the box-pasting factory, with 205 workers, who paste matchboxes for China, Liming, Great China, and First-Class match factories. Each person can paste 400 to 500 pairs of boxes per day. The highest daily production can reach 70,000 boxes. On the north side of the second floor is the factory office, and on the south side is the wood lacquering factory, with 40 workers, who make tables, chairs, boxes, and sofas. After completion, they are painted by lacquerers. Most of the orders come from furniture stores. On the north side of the third floor is the sandblasting factory, with six electrically powered machines. On the south side is the towel factory, with 82 hand-cranked wooden machines. Unfortunately, both places have been shut down due to the fact that cotton yarn raw materials have not yet been allocated. On the north side of the fourth floor is the printing factory, with 84 workers and 20 large and small machines. They mostly print stationery for the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which is then bundled into packages of 2,500 sheets and sent to Nanking. On the south side is the typesetting factory, with 39 workers, who are divided into typesetting, inserting characters, distributing characters, proofreading, lead plates, collating, type casting, and lead line departments. On the north side of the fifth floor is the binding factory, with 63 workers, who make envelopes, bind books, paste matchboxes, and print red and blue lines in forms. Among them is a kind of hard-covered, finely bound accounting book, which is entirely made by the factory workers. On the south side is the sewing factory, with 70 workers and 19 sewing machines, who make Chinese clothing, Western clothing, military uniforms, gloves, cloth shoes, and leather shoes.

After a hurried tour, there are managers in each room, wearing black uniforms, who explain the details to the visitors. The prisoners are all immersed in their work, happy, quiet, and focused. If I forgot that this was the Shanghai Prison, I would never imagine that they were people who had lost their freedom. "Clothing, food, housing, and work", the four major needs of life, are all solved here, although there is one drawback – no freedom.

Everything else is quiet and focused, just no freedom.

Silk factories in various places are unable to operate at full capacity throughout the year due to a lack of raw materials. Therefore, there is no need to renovate the two factories' ordinary silk machines to resume operations.

### Reader Consultation: Medical & Health

(I) Chronic Cough

Zhu Guanghua asks: I am already seventeen years old, but still haven't developed. I am as thin as a rail, and often suffer from asthma. Medications are ineffective. Recently, I had an X-ray, which revealed a dark spot in my lung, but no other symptoms of lung disease were observed. I would like to ask: (1) Is this condition bronchitis or pneumonia? (2) Does this condition affect development? (3) What medicine can cure this condition?

[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] Judging from the points mentioned in your letter, it can be definitely diagnosed as asthma, which is also related to the climate. Here are the answers to your three questions:——

(1) It is definitely not pneumonia. Whether you had bronchitis in the past is unknown. (2) It does have an impact on physical development. (3) During attacks, in addition to anti-asthmatic drugs, Anto Vaccin or Asthmolzsin can be used. Changing location for recuperation (dry climate, such as Pingjin, etc.) sometimes also produces good results. It is more difficult, but after development and growth, it can sometimes be cured.

(II) Opacity in One Eye

Lin Yongming asks: Last year, I suffered from conjunctivitis, which took over a month to heal. However, since then, my vision has been blurred. I consulted a specialist doctor who said it was corneal opacity and required long-term medication to clear it, but there has been no improvement to date. I don't know how to treat it.

[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] Your condition is likely corneal opacity, or Pannus caused by trachoma. It cannot be definitively diagnosed without a personal examination. Neither is an incurable disease, and ophthalmologists can diagnose and treat them. As for the pain in the right brain, you can try taking Phenacetin Comp. Tabl or Veganin Tabl. If it is ineffective, you should seek treatment from an internist immediately. Also, please have an ENT doctor examine your nasal cavity for any illnesses.

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, the government adopted a quota allocation system for paper imports.

According to someone familiar with the publishing industry: this amount? even if it is fully supplied to the national textbooks for the autumn semester, it will still be far from enough. Recently, the Ministry of Education has adopted a free printing and supply method for national textbooks, and there are no statistics on the number of prints.

Under the current situation of high paper prices and printing costs, it is heard that major publishing companies have no intention of continuing to operate this business, which has no legal protection of copyright property and no guarantee of operation. They have switched to investing in various series of books, approved textbooks, stationery instruments, and the printing of valuable securities.

### Rice Market Transactions Sluggish; Clear Oil Surges by Over 10,000 Yuan

Yesterday, over 9,000 dan of rice arrived in the north and south markets. Shop sales were slow, and market transactions were sluggish, with very few deals made. Northern market japonica and indica rice and yuan rice all fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan, while southern market early indica rice also fell by 1,000 yuan. White Xian yuan was flat. Flour supply and demand were balanced, but the supply of foreign flour was plentiful, and the situation was clearly weak, falling slightly by 300-500 yuan. Bran sales remained strong in rural areas, continuing to rise by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were sought after by Shanxia and Taiwanese traders, and the market was brisk, rising steadily and increasing by over 1,000 yuan again.

Yellow soybeans were successively absorbed by Nanyang factories and local firms, with strong demand and rising prices, continuing to rise by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were selling well for foreign firms and were increasingly popular, gradually soaring and rapidly rising by 12,000-13,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were actively sold in Nanyang, tightly locked, fragrant and dry, rising steadily and continuing to rise by 3,000-5,000 yuan.

### Automobile Imports Prohibited; Strictly Enforced Starting Tomorrow

Amid the restrictions on automobile imports, new automobiles continue to arrive in abundance. According to the person in charge of the Import Administration, new automobiles will not be allowed to be imported or sold from February to April of this year. Only private automobiles with complete documents and confirmed for private use will be allowed to enter. The automobiles currently arriving in abundance were approved during the first commission in the winter of last year. The deadline for their mass import had long expired, but due to the short time frame and incomplete handling of procedures, the deadline for importing approved automobiles has been extended to the 25th of this month. As the deadline is approaching again, the office notified relevant inspection agencies yesterday. Today is the last day for automobile merchants to import new automobiles. Starting tomorrow, the import of large quantities of automobiles from abroad for sale in Shanghai will be prohibited. Whether automobile imports will be allowed in the second quarter of this year is still under consideration by the office.

### Report on Inspection of Banks and Money Shops Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] The inspection work of banks and money shops in Shanghai was previously carried out by the Ministry of Finance, the Auditing Department of the Central Bank of China, and the Jin Chao Team of the Garrison Command, lasting two months and now coming to an end. All reports were previously carried by Mao, a counselor from the Ministry of Finance, and Gao Fang, director of the Auditing Department, to Beijing to present them to Minister Yu in person. It is reported that a total of 44 companies were inspected this time. How the case will be handled separately in the future will be decided by the Ministry of Finance based on the report. There are no plans for a second inspection, as rumored. However, the Ministry of Finance's original plan to inspect Shanghai's banking industry annually will likely begin in the near future. It is reported that Counselor He of the Ministry of Finance has arrived in Shanghai and is currently consulting with the Auditing Department of the Central Bank on how to proceed.

### White Coal Briquettes Are Firm

Due to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval of the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee's request, white coal and coke will be purchased by the government and not allowed to be freely transported, so holders are taking the opportunity to raise prices, and market prices have risen sharply. The market for bituminous coal dust remains weak, while the market for bituminous coal briquettes is short of goods, and market prices are extremely strong. Bituminous coal storage blocks are flat. Coal balls sales in various stores remain slow, and factory prices may fall again.

### 4,000 Cases of Rayon Have Been Shipped from Japan

[Our Report] It is reported that the first batch of rayon from Japan, totaling 4,000 cases, exchanged by the Central Trust Bureau this year has been shipped from Japan and arrived in Shanghai.

### Tea Exporters Raise Opinions on Loan Suspicions and Promotion Methods; Central Bank and Tea Merchants Exchange Views; Submit to the Executive Yuan for Approval After Consultation

[Our Report] For the export of tea in 1946, after the Central Bank convened a meeting with the Agricultural Bank of China, the Central Trust Bureau, and relevant tea merchants to discuss solutions (details were recorded in this newspaper on March 13), it is now reported that the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association has officially written to the Central Bank, based on the opinions discussed on that day, proposing four points to change the "Packing Loan" and centralized promotion methods, as follows: 1. The Central Bank instructs the Central Trust Bureau to lead representatives of various tea merchants to organize a promotion committee to export and promote all boxed tea. 2. Please have the Central Trust Bureau provide packing loans of 120%, and after repaying the principal and interest of the mortgage loan from Zhongchen Bank, the remaining funds will be disbursed to the tea merchants. 3. All remaining Kihong, Tunlu, and Pinglu tea that has not been mortgaged, as well as Wenhong, Wenlu, Ninghong, and Kihong by-products such as flower scents, should also be approved for packing loans in the same way. 4. The sales price obtained from the promotion, after expenses, should be converted into legal tender according to the current exchange rate to repay all principal and interest of the packing loan. The remaining amount will be settled with the tea merchants at 70%, and 30% will be given to the Central Trust Bureau. It is heard that the Central Bank has also replied, agreeing to the first point without objection. Regarding the second point, the Central Bank stated that "packing loans" are commercial transactions. In the future, tea merchants cannot claim that they cannot sell all the exported tea and not repay the loans. Regarding the third point, the Central Bank agreed to include the remaining 4,000 dan of Kihong, Tunlu, and Pinglu tea that has not been mortgaged in the packing loan. Other teas such as Wenhong and flower scents are awaiting approval from Vice President Liu. Regarding the fourth point, the Central Bank believes that the sales price obtained from the promotion should be used to deduct the purchase cost (i.e., the price stipulated in the original purchase plan), packing loan interest, and export expenses, and then the remaining amount should be settled with the tea merchants at 70%, and 30% should be given to the national treasury. The above-mentioned plan exchanged by the Central Bank and the tea merchants will be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan.

### Many Cotton Yarn Sellers; Prices Fall Compared to Saturday

Yesterday, the yarn market opened fairly stable, but as buyers held back and many traders sold, 20-count to 32-count yarn fell by 80,000-90,000 compared to last Saturday. 42-count double-strand yarn fell more significantly due to the continued offerings from Fangjian Company, and local factories had ample inventory, falling by 120,000-130,000 compared to last Saturday.

### Sugar and Cloth Shipped North

### Yarn Industry Market Establishes Market Management Rules

In order to bring market transactions into order, the Yarn Industry Market in this city has specially formulated market management rules, which will be officially announced and implemented today. The main points are as follows: (1) Permitted entry units and number of people: 1. National industry member companies shall not exceed two people. 2. Yarn brokers must join the Yarn Broker Association as members. 3. State-owned and private yarn factories are allowed eight people each. 4. Replenishing factories and merchants are allowed to send one representative each. (2) Matters needing attention for representatives of each unit in the market: 1. Whether it is the buyer or the seller, they must deal in spot cotton yarn. 2. In principle, both parties shall complete the transaction on the same day after the transaction is completed. If there is a separate procedure for the delivery date, it must be agreed by both parties. (3) Representatives of industry members are limited to spot goods for the sale of cotton yarn by their own company or for selling on behalf of customers. If they are selling goods, they should abide by legal profits. If they are selling on behalf of customers, they should be limited to commission income. (4) The representatives of each yarn factory shall, in principle, sell the products of their own factory. (5) Representatives of each merchant, whether replenishing industries or merchants from all over the country, shall, in principle, purchase the cotton yarn they actually need. However, in addition to replenishing factories in this city, if merchants from all over the country need to resell cotton yarn that has already been purchased due to changes in its use, they should only sell it to industry members of this association. (6) Yarn brokers shall limit their business scope to introducing transactions between buyers and sellers and shall only take the stipulated commission amount as their income. (7) All transactions shall be signed with a transaction order, indicating the name, quantity, price, and delivery location of the goods, and signed as the standard.

### Five Types of Imported Materials Approved Last Winter Must Be Imported Before the End of This Month

The Customs Import Administration was an independent agency. Since the establishment of the Import Management Committee, the work of the agency has been incorporated into the committee, but it still handles the review of five types of imported materials, namely sugar, tobacco leaves, gasoline, automobiles, and films, according to past regulations. It is reported that the above-mentioned five types of materials approved last winter must be imported before the end of this month, and contracts will be cancelled if they are overdue.

### Silver Shops Hold Joint Meeting to Discuss How to Resume Business; Representatives Sent to the Municipal Government and Social Affairs Bureau to Request Instructions

[Our Report] After the Ministry of Finance separately formulated ten management measures for the receipt, redemption, and manufacture of gold jewelry in the silver shop industry, the silver shop industry in this city and representatives of the same industry from Ping, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei and other places held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss how to manage the industry after the promulgation and implementation of the new management measures. According to the news released by the industry after the meeting, since the promulgation of the measures for the disposal of gold jewelry, the silver shop industry nationwide has suspended business at the same time and has twice submitted requests to the relevant authorities in the central government, stating their grievances, which have been considered and adopted. Now that the Ministry of Finance has separately formulated and promulgated new management measures, there has been no response to the industry's request to allocate raw materials from the Central Bank in various places. Article 4 of the measures still has gaps. Namely: (1) In the future, it will be difficult to balance the receipt and redemption of gold jewelry. As a result, there will only be redemption and no receipt, creating a phenomenon of excess demand over supply, which the industry is really uneasy about. The industry has always held a small profit position, and the price difference between entry and exit is not expected to be too far, so that it is in line with the actual situation, and customers are happy to buy and redeem. (2) Regarding the approval of prices by the competent authorities, it is hoped that it will be based on the principle of speed and simplification, and the industry association will submit a request for record. Therefore, the business hours of the industry must be discussed with the competent authorities before a decision can be made. It is reported that the industry has appointed Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, Chen Dezhang, Qiu Yunken, and other five people to submit a request to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau this morning to ask for instructions on future business issues.

It is also heard that the silver shop industry in Nanjing will also hold a meeting with representatives from Anhui and Hunan today to discuss future business issues and will request the Ministry of Social Affairs and other agencies to amend the measures.

### Fangjian Sells Yarn

There were a total of 1,244 applicants, including 877 manufacturers and 367 yarn numbers.

### New Price for Cotton Yarn Acquisition Announced: Textile Control Board Implements Immediately; February Difference Also Paid Out

[Report from our newspaper] The new price for cotton yarn acquisition in March, after being approved by the Overall Economic Council's Price Committee, has been instructed and issued to the Textile Control Board yesterday and will be implemented immediately. The maximum acquisition price for 20-count standard yarn is 3.15 million yuan per piece. Currently, the Textile Control Board will issue a preliminary amount of 2.8 million yuan per piece for cotton yarn acquired this month, regardless of its count or type. Furthermore, regarding the February acquisition price for yarn, after the price of 20-count standard yarn was adjusted from 2.5 million yuan to 2.75 million yuan per piece, the Textile Control Board has completed the issuance of the difference as of yesterday.

The adjusted acquisition prices for various counts of cotton yarn in February are as follows (in thousands of yuan): 6-count 1381 yuan, 8-count 1648 yuan, 10-count 1915 yuan, 10-count B 1701 yuan, 12-count 2083 yuan, 14-count 2250 yuan, 16-count 2416 yuan, 20-count 2750 yuan, 20-count double-strand 1989 yuan, 21-count 2854 yuan, 21-count double-strand 2921 yuan, 22-count 2986 yuan, 23-count 3118 yuan, 26-count 3427 yuan, 30-count three-strand 4243 yuan, 31-count 3872 yuan, 32-count 4044 yuan, 32-count double-strand 4317 yuan, 33-count 4181 yuan, 34-count 4318 yuan, 40-count 5142 yuan, 40-count three-strand 5594 yuan, 42-count 5388 yuan, 42-count double-strand 5083 yuan, 42-count three-strand 5868 yuan, 60-count 7924 yuan, 60-count double-strand 8604 yuan, 80-count 11051 yuan, 80-count double-strand 12091 yuan, 84-count 11603 yuan. The prices of all the above yarn counts include commodity tax and are based on Grade A yarn. In addition, the acquisition prices for Grades B, C, D, and E differ by 2.5% for each grade. Each piece of cotton yarn is based on 400 pounds of machine-packed cotton yarn as the standard.

It has been learned that after the decision was made that the maximum factory price for free trading of cotton yarn by private factories in March should not exceed 3.7 million yuan for 20-count standard yarn, the excess portion of each 400-pound piece of cotton yarn from private factories in the city will not be proportionally priced upward because it does not comply with the standard yarn regulations.

### Orders for Soda Ash and Ammonium Sulfate Have Arrived

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the sales of soda ash in the city have become sluggish. Yongli Company has shipped 450 tons of soda ash from Tianjin, but cannot accommodate it, and has distributed it to Hankou, Shantou, Chongqing and other places. The sales order for ammonium sulfate has expired, and the goods within the customs gate are in short supply. Yongli also has limited inventory because the Nanjing Ammonium Sulfate Factory has stopped production. The factory price has been frequently raised, to 3 million yuan per ton. The market sales have become active, but the largest customer, the Taiwanese group, has not yet arrived in Shanghai to purchase.

### Tung Oil Market Quiet

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, there was no large-scale trading of tung oil in the market. There were occasional futures transactions, but the amount was small. The spot price for full-weight white oil barrels was 440,000 yuan, with few sales. The sales of Xihong oil were still good, at 370,000 yuan per barrel of 83 market catties, and seemed to be slightly higher. Aohong oil was little changed.

### Bristle Prices Decline Again

Pigs: Foreign prices are frequently falling, and the market situation is extremely weak. The price of Shanghai bristles has also turned weak. The delivery price for New Spinning bristles has fallen from US$2.10 to US$2.00 per pound, Sichuan bristles to US$2.50, and Hankou bristles to US$3.50. Yesterday, the market price for Shanghai bristles in boxes (133 pounds) was 2.8 million yuan per sima dan, a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to Saturday, equivalent to 3,176,000 yuan in national currency at the foreign exchange rate. Sichuan bristles were quoted at 3.8 million yuan, with no transactions, equivalent to 3,970,000 yuan in national currency at the foreign exchange rate. Hankou bristles were quoted at 5.2 million yuan, also with no transactions, equivalent to 5,717,000 yuan in national currency at the foreign exchange rate. The prices of all bristles are higher than foreign prices, and exporters are unable to purchase them.

### Introduction to Cotton Spinning Engineering

— Lü De

This comprehensive book, divided into two volumes, the first volume of which was published in the middle of this month, is sold by Longmen Bookstore. In addition, Jian Shui He Da's recent book "Textile Mechanics" contains new and unique material. Both of these books are very suitable for reading by those in the textile industry.

### After the Cancellation of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, Export Subsidies Can Still Be Granted

After the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank was cancelled, regarding the announced export subsidy measures, if export foreign exchange is sold to designated banks, a double subsidy can still be granted. However, when designated banks pay this subsidy to exporters on behalf of the government, they must comply with the following regulations: (1) Calculation standard: The subsidy is based on the starting price of the goods at the port of export, and transportation insurance costs are not included. (2) Payment time: The subsidy is paid when the exporter submits all export documents to the designated bank. (3) Reimbursement by the Central Bank: The subsidies paid by the designated banks can be settled with the Central Bank at the beginning of each week, based on the total export foreign exchange income of the previous week. However, designated banks may also request immediate reimbursement from the Central Bank at any time. (4) Entrusted exports: From now on, designated banks must not, without the permission of the Shanghai Central Bank Business Bureau or its branches, accept export goods sold by foreign firms and issue customs export certificates for such export goods. The application for this entrustment must be accompanied by the exporter's official invoice, stating the name of the ship, the trustee, the nature, quantity, etc. of the goods. The application may be approved on a case-by-case basis. The payment of the subsidy by the bank must wait until the price of the goods has been received. The payment for these export goods must be received within six months and must be guaranteed by the entrusted bank.

### Anecdotes from Yan'an Before the Restoration

— A Taoyuan Air Dispatch on the 14th, by Huang He

I recently obtained a copy of a secret internal directive document from the Communist Party in the Jiji-Jin area. It roughly stated: "The basic task of our party at present is to overthrow the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship government, seize political power, and establish a proletarian dictatorship. In order to accomplish this overall political goal, all regions must fully support military victories, actively complete the mobilization of militia to participate in the war and expand the army. We must destroy social ruling forces, severely crack down on wealthy landlords and rich peasants, and the gentry class to create chaos in rural areas and agitate the peasants, so as to increase the difficulties for the Kuomintang's governments at all levels, reduce their prestige, and prevent the replenishment of stubborn troops (referring to the open army). We must also use various forms and slogans to mobilize the people to oppose the Kuomintang's dictatorship, and oppose American aid to China. We must strictly implement the food and material blockade policy, and universally destroy the railway transportation that the stubborn troops regard as their lifeline. All cadres must resolutely overcome the concept of peace, prepare for twelve years of armed struggle. Regarding the people's widespread war-weariness, we should expand the propaganda of 'use armed struggle to win peace' and 'there will be no genuine peace unless the Kuomintang's rule is overthrown,' mobilize forces, and gradually change this mentality."

This secret directive document is truly a confession of their launch of war, destruction of peace, and all conspiracies and crimes in various regions!

Furthermore, Bai Sha Jun, a young cultural worker from Yan'an, presented me with his recently completed "Miscellaneous Thoughts on Yan'an." After reading it, I couldn't help but feel emotional. The "Yan'an" formerly touted itself as a free garden of new Chinese culture. However, the cultural workers who pioneered this free garden were subjected to unbearable contempt and attacks, to the point where they didn't even have the freedom to breathe. Reality made them pessimistic, disappointed, and depressed, but the Communist Party further placed their lives in a bleak situation. Those who know the inside story of the Communist Party are not surprised, but it is indeed necessary for the general readers who do not have a deep understanding to observe calmly. I have specially selected excerpts from the "Collection of Miscellaneous Thoughts" related to cultural figures in Yan'an to inform distant readers:

"Wild Lily" is Thorny; "August Village" is Unfortunate

The writer Wang Shiwei is one of the most unyielding. The Communist Party added the so-called "National Special," "Japanese Special," and "Special Envoy" titles to him, but people jokingly called him "Three Departments." However, he was somewhat unyielding to the evil forces, so he is still imprisoned today, and his thorny "Wild Lily" is still deeply stinging the Communist Party.

Another person who, after Wang Shiwei, has a bit of backbone is the author of "August Village," Xiao Jun. I remember when "Artists and Politicians" was causing an uproar, he boldly poured cold water on it, scolding it as "dogs fighting." He gave full play to the instincts of an artist, but the increased pressure in life forced him to set up a small stall in the new market in Yan'an. When his wife's due date was approaching, the writer was on the verge of having no rice to cook. If it weren't for the fact that he fortunately met a kindred spirit, a shepherd boy, who gave him half a catty of millet a day, he would have awaited "newness" while he himself was about to "metabolize." How unfortunate is "August Village"!

Li Youran Asks for Porcelain Teeth; Chen Tie Geng Gets Mental Illness

The translator Li Youran, after all, had a nine-point "old-fashioned" aura. When he was surrounded and struggled against by the so-called "masses," the atmosphere was tense, but he remained calm as usual, not showing any fear. Standing on the podium, he kept confessing to everyone that he was not a special agent. As a result, after being "bound hand and foot" and beaten up, he still asked the chairman to compensate him for the porcelain teeth that had been knocked out.

Under the same struggle, the woodcarver Chen Tie Geng was frightened by this and became mentally ill, smiling at people all day long. It is said that Chen was an important cadre who had held many positions, but his composure was much worse than that of Mr. Li. This may be because he was older.

Hei Ding is Forced to Confess; Chang Hong Gets Hit on the Head

Hei Ding was forced to confess his "special agent" relationship, and that was not enough. He was also forced to report on the history of special agents at the "Lu Xun Academy of Arts." In a helpless situation, he pointed out that Ai Qing, Hu Feng, Mao Dun and others were all Kuomintang special agents, and said that the Kuomintang was really rich and that these people were completely bought with a lot of money. At the time, many people didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

In addition, the old poet Gao Chang Hong, former member of the "Crazy Wind Society," in order to pursue "revolutionary truth," did not hesitate to travel over mountains and rivers, experiencing hardships on a long journey, from the rear to Yan'an. As soon as he entered the border area of "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia" at Gulin, he was detained by the local county government. After many explanations, he was still not released. As a result, he was escorted to Yan'an. As soon as he arrived, he was put under "special agent" surveillance by the Communist Party because "Lu Xun had scolded him." The second time, when people were silently holding rectification discussion meetings, this white-haired and honest man suddenly appeared in front of people with blood flowing. Gao cried, "Iodine iodine!" This "newcomer" was accused of hating the Communist Party and was hit on the head with a stick. From then on, people never saw Gao Chang Hong again, nor did they ever see his "political poems."

"Boredom" Rubs Bellies; Spring Breeze Sends Songs

Precisely because culture is boring, "folk dances" are popular in Yan'an. Every Saturday night, a group of mentally distressed and extremely bored cultural figures and young students gather in the courtyard or on the open ground under the moon to dance. Accompanied by the monotonous erhu, some even dance all night long. When the villagers saw this, they couldn't help but sigh and say, "Why rub your bellies so hard?" How could they know that these gentlemen were really bored!

Before the restoration, Yan'an presented a desolate scene. In the hazy moonlit nights of the sweeping sands, the songs of young people often echoed in the cold air: "Some are hugging their wives, some are pessimistic and disappointed," and also adapted from the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" school song, "On the banks of the Yellow River, a group of people have frozen to death, the Chinese nation, unlucky descendants..." which also often blew into people's ears with the spring breeze.

### Discussing the UNRRA Executive Headquarters Social Welfare Work Conference and Reviewing the Executive Headquarters' Emergency Relief and Welfare Undertakings in the Past Year (Part 2)

— De Wei and Zhan Dehou

In terms of food relief, in addition to distributing grain, collective feeding stations were also set up in refugee settlement areas or areas with severe food shortages. Refugees could come to the stations to eat. There were many types of stations, including porridge factories, affordable canteens, nutrition stations, and steamed bread and pancake distribution stations. The number of stations established by each branch office ranged from eight to seventy, totaling 138, benefiting 8,379,426 people. In addition, Hunan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hubei, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Shandong used mobile kitchen cars shipped from Australia to travel around areas with large numbers of refugees to help them eat. These kitchen cars could prepare food for 600 people within an hour. During the winter relief, the food prepared by the kitchen cars was placed at several fixed distribution points, and many families who could not cook led their children, bringing utensils to the stations to receive the food and take it home. In addition to general food and clothing relief, in order to solve the housing problem for refugees returning to their hometowns, the Executive Headquarters allocated special funds to the Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangxi branch offices for construction in the most severely damaged cities and villages, building public housing or "good neighbor" new villages. Other branch offices also allocated funds from their operating expenses to repair houses or use military tents to build temporary shelters and refugee dormitories. In Jiangxi, the emergency measure for housing was to organize refugees in a work-relief program to build low walls with mud and use tents as roofs, organizing tent villages for the refugees to live in themselves. Welfare was implemented in the villages, and sanitation was managed. In order to save manpower and financial resources, these tasks were organized by the villagers themselves, and the branch offices were only responsible for providing materials and guidance.

(1) Placement of Dependent Children

The principle for the placement of dependent refugee children is to return those with families to their families, and those with relatives to their relatives, so that they can re-experience normal and warm love. The Executive Headquarters sent more than 210,000 refugee children back to their hometowns with their families and assisted the Wartime Child Welfare Association in sending 2,256 nursery students back to their hometowns. For those who truly had no home or relatives to return to, the branch offices cooperated with local original social welfare organizations to establish 15 temporary shelters for dependent children, accommodating more than 8,000 children. More than 5,000 children were entrusted to existing orphanages.

(2) Promoting Child Nutrition

The Executive Headquarters used milk and cod liver oil shipped from abroad by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Since September of last year, nutrition stations have been established, using 20,000 tons of materials, and adding canned food, soy flour, and noodles. Some nutrition stations have been transformed into supply stations to launch a child nutrition subsidy campaign. Experts hired by the headquarters guide the branch offices on how to use nutritional materials and how to prepare children's diets. The purpose of the Executive Headquarters is, on the one hand, to remedy the damage to children's health, and on the other hand, to let these poor parents know what the minimum standard for children's diets is (milk and cod liver oil are of course not included), so that they know to strive for what human beings should have. Currently, the Executive Headquarters has a total of 1,872 stations. Adding the number of nutrition stations subsidized by primary schools, the total is more than 20,000 stations, supplying more than 2 million children. When the Executive Headquarters ends, we hope that the government and social organizations that promote nutrition will cooperate to continue to develop this work, so that poor children can enjoy their due rights.

(3) Running Daycare Centers for Working Women

In order to coordinate work, each branch office entrusted local relevant organizations to run daycare centers for poor working women, especially in disaster areas, using these centers to settle children, while invisibly stabilizing countless families, so as to avoid them running in groups to the area under the jurisdiction of another branch office, which would cause some administrative difficulties for the Executive Headquarters. Young and strong parents were able to work on work-relief projects, while their children were raised for free. The number of daycare centers set up in An Dun was the largest, with 433 centers, caring for 28,145 children. The other branch offices had a total of only 15 centers, with thousands of children.

(4) Establishing Child Welfare Stations

Nutrition stations and daycare centers naturally developed into child welfare stations. To the extent possible, the branch offices divided a city into many districts. In each district, they entrusted the organization that co-organized the daycare center or nutrition station with the Executive Headquarters to take care of the poor children in the district and become a child welfare station, handling material distribution, medical and health care, education, entertainment, and family life guidance. This work was done best in Beiping. The branch offices have a total of 173 stations, with approximately 110,000 children. However, this system is still in its infancy. It is hoped that in the future, the government will divide all cities and villages in the country into child welfare districts, with a central station in each district to handle all child welfare matters in the district, so that this method can become a permanent system.

(5) Agency Subsidies and Improvements

The agencies subsidized by the Executive Headquarters can be divided into public and private relief homes, orphanages, nursing homes, disabled rehabilitation homes, and other social welfare organizations. The purpose is to restore the original relief agencies for the elderly, young, and disabled in the recovered areas and to increase the number of people accommodated in conjunction with the work of the Executive Headquarters. The method of subsidies can be divided into the supply of clothing and food, assistance with repairs, cash subsidies, and talent training. The subsidies of materials and cash are adopted with a decreasing method, so that they can gradually find ways to be self-sufficient. The branch offices have subsidized a total of 2,178 units, of which 531 are children's agencies, with 60,000 children. This work was done the most by the Shanghai branch office, which subsidized a total of 137 units. The remaining branch offices subsidized between 15 and 60 units. The Executive Headquarters also stipulated standards for the administration and operation of the subsidized agencies to help them gradually improve and raise the standards of China's relief and welfare undertakings. Because the life of the Executive Headquarters was too short, this work, which requires a long time to be effective, did not achieve many results, but the establishment of this standard was an unprecedented move in China.

Regarding the work of caring for the elderly and disabled, in addition to subsidizing agencies for the elderly and disabled, the Executive Headquarters has begun two experimental projects, both of which are aimed at enabling the disabled to be self-reliant and gain physical and psychological treatment, restore physical and mental health, and provide vocational training, so that they can return to a normal psychological and social life. The difference between these two experiments lies in the method. One is to use new scientific equipment and foreign experts to assist the Ministry of Social Affairs in running a disabled rehabilitation institute. The Executive Headquarters has spent a total of US$441,100 on purchasing equipment in the United States and providing necessary equipment from the materials already shipped to China by the Executive Headquarters. The other method is to cooperate with the Chinese Vocational Education Society, using existing hospitals, ordinary shops, and small industries in the city as places for training and employment for the disabled. This method can be implemented in any city in China without a lot of expenses. The Executive Headquarters is only using its short life to create a permanent job.

After eight years of hard fighting, the Executive Headquarters invested the above-mentioned relief and welfare work against the background of such a large disaster in our country, which is indeed disproportionate to the background. One of the reasons is that both UNRRA and the Executive Headquarters lack experience in this unprecedented international and national relief work, but the other reason is the continued outbreak of civil war, the obstruction of transportation, the complexity of the political situation, and the instability of the economy. In this environment, no organization can perfectly complete the task of post-war relief. Experience tells us that social welfare work cannot solve social problems single-handedly. If you only focus on welfare work and forget the entire political and economic system, it is easy for welfare work to become a tool behind undemocratic politics and bureaucratic capitalism. The eyes of those who compile and publish works should be widened, and always remember that your work must go hand in hand with political and economic improvements.

### Shanghai Reporter Delegation's Trip to Hangzhou: A Special Report

— By Our Reporter Tu Peilin

The two railway bureaus jointly invited reporters from various Shanghai newspapers to visit Hangzhou. A group of twenty-two people departed on the morning of the 20th. After arriving in Hangzhou, in addition to visiting Zhijiang University, the Qiantang River, and touring various scenic spots, they also visited local leaders such as Chairman Shen and Mayor Zhou. Because Chairman Shen had to go to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Secretary-General Lei received them in his stead. On the 22nd, they were treated with a banquet, during which Secretary-General Lei provided detailed information about the administrative facilities and economic conditions of Zhejiang Province.

Secretary-General Lei Discusses Administrative Facilities

Secretary-General Lei stated: Zhejiang Province currently faces many difficulties, the biggest being finance. The budget for this year is over 500 million, but there is a shortfall of about 100 million. The largest source of income is the land tax. The province retains 20% of the land tax, while the remaining 80% is divided equally between the central government and the local governments. The main administrative project this year is the seawall construction. Last year, it cost , of which 4 billion was allocated by the central government, and 2 billion was materials and flour from the United Relief Services. This year, another 110 million is needed. The central government has sent personnel to survey the area several times, as it is considered a burden beyond the capacity of the local government. Because the Qiantang River originates in Anhui and flows mostly through Zhejiang Province, and benefits Songjiang and other counties in Jiangsu, a request has been made for the central government to allocate funds. The central government is currently considering this. Once the project is completed, cargo can be shipped from Nanxing Bridge in Hangzhou out to sea, which will greatly benefit the commercial prosperity of Zhejiang Province.

Land Transportation Actively Promoted

In terms of land transportation, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been open to Yiwu since March 1st. It is expected to reach Jinhua soon, and by the end of June, it may be extended westward from Jiangshan into Jiangxi Province. Regarding highways, the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway has been opened to Yixing. The Shanghai-Hangzhou and Hangzhou-Huizhou roads are also expected to be open to military use soon. In addition, the coastal line from Ningbo to Wenzhou is under active construction. There are also plans to enter Fujian via Quzhou and other places. If completed, this will be very convenient. The repair costs for this highway are stipulated to be the responsibility of the central government, but progress has been slow due to insufficient funding last year. The central government is scheduled to allocate 10 billion this year, and 1 billion has been received so far. For farmland irrigation projects, over 100 locations are planned to be completed this year, with over 500 more in the planning stages. If completed, food production will double, which will compensate for the chronic food shortages in Zhejiang Province.

Emphasis on Specialty Products: Silk, Tea, and Fisheries

The main specialty products of Zhejiang Province are silk, tea, and fisheries. Currently, they have only recovered to 20-30% of pre-war levels. Last year, a loan of 20 billion was requested for silk production, but only 11 billion was allocated. This year, it is hoped to borrow 15 billion to actively restore mulberry orchards and improve silkworm breeds. Last year, a loan of 7.5 billion was requested for tea production. Due to domestic transportation obstacles and the tea farmers' financial difficulties, exports were poor. The goal for this year is to produce 150,000 to 160,000 dan, with a cost of 550,000 to 600,000 per dan. An application for a loan is being made to actively restore the market. Director Pi is currently negotiating with the United Relief Services. Regarding fisheries, it is hoped to obtain fishing boats and wood for building wooden boats after the victory. As a result of negotiations, it has been agreed to allocate 1,000 tons of wood. All preparations are now complete, awaiting the arrival of the goods for use. However, the boats can only be borrowed and not owned. An application for a fishery loan of 6 billion has been made this year, and the central government has agreed to consider it.

Public Educators are Striving to Fulfill Their Duties

In the past, the price index in Hangzhou exceeded that of Nanjing. However, the central government stipulated that the salaries of public educators in Beijing and Shanghai would be in the first tier, while Hangzhou was placed in the second tier. Fortunately, everyone is able to endure and strive to fulfill their duties for the sake of the country. Because of the small local population, there are many opportunities for interaction among party, government, military, and prominent figures in society. Therefore, it is easy to reach consensus, and they cooperate closely with one heart and one mind. As a result, problems such as the past rice shortages were resolved in a short period of time. The People's Assembly, a civil organization, is also able to cooperate with the administrative organs, working together for the public good, getting along harmoniously, and promoting work easily.

Mayor Zhou Discusses the Current Situation in Hangzhou

Mayor Zhou of Hangzhou recently met with the Shanghai reporter delegation and discussed the general situation in Hangzhou, answering questions and stating: The population of Hangzhou was estimated to be 610,000 in 1937, but is now only about 500,000. During the war, the city suffered heavy damage, with 30% of the houses destroyed. The enemy and puppet regime collected all steel and metal materials for military use, even seizing the sewer covers, causing slag to accumulate and drainage to be poor. After the victory, it was very difficult to carry out this dredging work. The enemy and puppet regime left behind 23 tons of garbage. Four hundred cleaners have been working until now, and it is almost completely cleared. The electric lamp railings of West Lake were also damaged, and silt accumulated in the inner West Lake. After the restoration, repairs have been carried out successively until now, and the appearance has been mostly restored. Before the war, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had personally issued an order that it must be whitewashed every other year and painted every two years. The first step after the victory was to restore it.

The Municipal Government Budget is 15 Billion

Thirty percent of the municipal government's total budget is allocated to the Bureau of Public Works for construction and road repairs. The total budget for this year is 15 billion. Last year, the central government stipulated that Hangzhou had 685 military service quotas, which were all filled. It has not yet been processed this year, and the quota is unknown. The general situation of industry and commerce is not good. Shanghai's market conditions can be transmitted to Hangzhou in ten minutes using long-distance telephones, so it is greatly affected. The calculation of workers' wages is different from Shanghai, mostly stipulated in terms of rice or money, and not calculated according to the cost of living index. The issue of banning dance halls is difficult to discuss. Since the People's Assembly has decided to ban them, then they will be banned. Mayor Zhou stated, "Fortunately, Hangzhou does not rely on dancing to prosper, so banning it doesn't matter."

Spring and Autumn

### The Trend of Traditional Chinese Painting is Improving

— Zhu Yingpeng

Brother Jinshan asked me to write a short article for the Spring and Autumn "Art Festival Special Issue," hoping to review the past and encourage the future. Although I have not neglected research recently, I deeply feel the inadequacy of my skills. I really lack the courage to express my opinions.

Let me briefly express my views on the changes in the trend of traditional Chinese painting in the thirty-odd years since the beginning of the Republic of China.

The painting style at the beginning of the Republic of China was just the tail end of the late Qing Dynasty (Ren Bonian, etc.). It was difficult to change ingrained habits. No matter how accomplished the artists were, they could not escape the "vulgar atmosphere." Perhaps because the painters mostly lived in commercial ports and were constrained by the vulgar eyes of the common people, they had no choice but to apply red and silk, and perfunctorily deal with things in a "vulgar" way. Especially in Shanghai, under the conditions of semi-colonial comprador culture, it is not surprising that lofty and great ideas and productions could not be produced.

Having said that, the development of the printing industry in modern times has greatly contributed to the progress of traditional Chinese painting. Many people who were devoted to promoting art used printing to reproduce ancient masterpieces and promote their circulation. As the trend opened up, those who studied traditional Chinese painting gradually gained access to the standards of their predecessors, and their horizons were corrected.

After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Palace Museum in Beijing was opened, and the treasures it contained were also reproduced and circulated, and exhibitions were held several times. As a result, the perceptions of those who studied traditional Chinese painting were gradually improved.

The trend of traditional Chinese painting gradually turned towards purity at this time. However, at first, their vision was still shallow, and they could only recognize the unconstrained style of the Eight Great Masters and Shi Tao from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. On the other hand, most painters abandoned the common practice of painting flowers and birds and pursued landscapes, which formed a special development of landscape painting.

During the Anti-Japanese War, although there was fighting everywhere, traditional Chinese painting made significant progress. This is a very good phenomenon. In addition, the study of landscape painting has gradually expanded from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the Tang, Five Dynasties, and Northern Song dynasties. The patterns tend to be rigorous, the brushwork tends to be meticulous, and the coloring tends to be bright and clean, and gradually the rules and regulations can be seen. It shows that the current stage of traditional Chinese painting has at least a revitalizing atmosphere and is no longer decadent.

From now on, we should strive for perfection, carry forward and expand, move from the scope of imitation to creation, from landscape to other departments, and from the study of domestic art to world art, then the future is limitless.

Culture influences national fortune, this is an unbreakable truth. Therefore, judging from the improvement of the trend of traditional Chinese painting, the future of the country is full of hope. I celebrate this Art Festival with this meaning.

### Unity, Effort, and Striving for Glory

— Liu Shi

On this day last year, when the Shanghai Art Association was formally established at the Kangle Restaurant, I said in my declaration, "I hope that artists across the country will unite and work together!" Now it has been a full year, and not only has the covenant not been fully practiced and achievements demonstrated; on the contrary, there are still a few people who, in order to satisfy their personal selfish desires, resort to any means and use all kinds of conspiracies to peddle art as a commodity, causing ridicule from all walks of life and being despised, and even causing the council to think that art is an "unnecessary educational scene." The fact that "art teachers" were first revoked and then merged may not be unrelated!

During the difficult Anti-Japanese War, the majority of loyal and virtuous art workers in the rear and on the front lines were still able to work together with one heart and one mind. That kind of vigorous spirit is still inspiring to think about! Unexpectedly, after the victory, there is such a bad trend, which is really painful!

"Art" is definitely not a decoration of life, nor is it a tool to entertain and relieve sorrow in times of joy and sorrow. It is an indispensable spiritual food for mankind. Whether it is a civilized or barbaric nation, each has its own artistic expression. Especially in our country, it has a glorious history of thousands of years, which is already known to the world. History tells us that the giant wheel of the times is constantly moving forward. We are currently facing a great era, and everything should unfold a new situation to keep pace with the times. However, only art seems to be particularly desolate in China today. Those engaged in art work are as rare as morning stars, and they still cannot cooperate with each other for their own sake. As a result, the power of art is always weak, and it is still not noticed by the society. If this phenomenon continues, not only will it be impossible to maintain the glory of history, but it will be in danger of disappearing.

On this day when everyone is excited, we should express a determination - to immediately abandon sectarian views, hold hands tightly, and move forward together!

Furthermore, today's Chinese art, although more backward than in the past, has many places that cannot be fully satisfied. But we have a great hope, hoping to cultivate more young authors, hoping that they will take on the heavy responsibility of building a new art cause in the new China! No matter what kind of construction and development of a certain cause, there will be different trends due to different social systems, only art is an exception, and its importance is absolutely general under any social system. Just like cells in the human body, in any class and in the physique of any race, there is no possibility of leaving or disappearing for a moment.

Some people say that art is only something that people with assets can enjoy. In other words, as the current phenomenon in China, it seems impossible. However, when the Soviet Union had the Great Revolution, the promotion of art movement was even more enthusiastic than usual! To put it closer, during the war in Japan, art workers and newspaper reporters could not only be exempted from military service, but also be intensively trained in batches and sent to various battlefields to create, and were treated like princes. What is the reason for this?

In short, I believe that any movement and any cause, on the one hand, needs the country to promote and guide, and on the other hand, workers must unite and work hard! "Internal strife" and "civil war" are self-destructive.

### Thoughts on the Art Festival

— Lu Danlin

Art is the expression of mankind's desire to feel beauty, the manifestation of life force, and the epitome of social life. Artists are the guides of the world's light. They study art in order to seek a proper life, and create in order to express individuality and thought. However, because we are in a world full of incidents and a difficult living environment, coupled with material civilization, which dazzles people's eyes, people seem to be falling day by day in terms of spiritual cultivation. Life is mechanical, and utilitarianism is the guide. If this continues without seeking remedy, it will not only be a fatal injury to our country's art, but also a knife axe that cuts through human civilization.

Speaking of our country's art, since there has been history, there have only been three large-scale national exhibitions held by the public in the most recent twenty years. However, the locations of these three meetings are also limited to a corner of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chongqing. Although it was a great success for a while, the number of people who appreciated it was small. And the exhibitions of ancient art are also few and far between. Or it is thought that there are often public and private exhibitions of various departments of ancient and modern art in various provinces and cities, which can also be satisfactory and better than nothing. However, these exhibits are mostly commercial displays, and even some of them are a mixture of genuine and fake, and full of ugliness, which are different from the nature of systematic research and observation, and different from pure art for art's sake. In addition, the existing art in various places has not been properly explored, preserved, treasured, and toured for exhibitions. On the contrary, some have been replaced, privately hidden, and stolen due to plagiarism and possession. There are even not a few who sell (give) public and private treasures to foreign countries for personal entertainment or to make a small profit. As for those who do not cherish them and allow them to be destroyed and ravaged, they are too numerous to mention.

It has been more than a year and a half since Japan surrendered, and the period cannot be said to be short, and the publication of books and periodicals has mostly returned to normal. However, looking around the country, there is still no purely art publication published on a regular basis, which cannot but be said to be a regret for the Chinese art world.

Although there have been several publications of art books in the past, strictly speaking, the quality and quantity are not very substantial, not to mention that some of them are translated from foreign works, and are not their own works. If you want to study the art in the history of your own country, but you want to carry over the superficial works of foreigners and treat them as accurate, detailed, and precious materials, in terms of culture and academics, others may not despise or despise us, but we are also pitiful and ashamed enough. In recent decades, our greatest gains in art are probably the study of inscriptions on bronzes and oracle bone inscriptions, Zhao Ban bamboo slips, and the discovery of the Dunhuang Stone Room. However, let's look at Japan. They have made countless efforts in art and research books. Most of the materials belong to our country's public and private property. And we do not collect, select, organize, analyze and study to compile and print, but let others conduct extensive research and gather to complete it. Are we really adhering to the teachings of "gentlemen achieve the beauty of others" and "success does not have to be self-made"?

In the national education, the number of art (art) specialty schools, including public and private ones, is probably less than ten. And among these few art schools, may I ask how many of them are substantively rich, well-equipped, and able to meet the actual needs of teaching and learning? The insufficiency of funds and the lack of equipment have become a common phenomenon. In addition, the travel, advancement, and retreat of faculty members are often more persuasive, and those who preside over school affairs often run around for funds and personnel, wasting most of their energy and time. All these kinds of shabby and simplified losses are irreplaceable.

Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the common needs of human daily life. However, the inspiration of the soul, the sustenance of life, and the great expression of the nation and country require art, but many people (including the government) have ignored it. Therefore, Cai Jiemin (Yuanpei) advocated "aesthetic education instead of religion," and the importance of aesthetic education is evident. If people only rely on food and clothing, it can be regarded as a happy life, I am afraid it is not so simple. The culture of Greece and Rome has been left to this day for thousands of years, and it is still a torch that illuminates the world. It has its own life force. Looking back at our country now: art schools are rare and incomplete; there is not a single art museum; large-scale art exhibitions are equal to the appearance of the "divine dragon"; the art buildings in various places are not properly preserved and organized, and they are allowed to be destroyed and abandoned; the country and society have no extensive practical support and encouragement for artistic creation; the publication of art books and periodicals is extremely desolate and poor; the promotion of international art exhibitions is rarely seen, and there are one or two, and the quality is not substantial; art criticism has not been established, and although some are published occasionally, there are relatively few that are strict, upright, and fair; museums and art galleries are lacking, and artists have no way to research and refer to them; the lives of artists are mostly difficult; some only study art for a year and a half, and then hold art exhibitions to earn a few liters; at the same time, there are also those who have been engaged in art for decades, but their works have no way out, and they are impoverished and unable to make ends meet; the work of art groups cannot be fully developed, especially there is no close contact with international art groups. Speaking of these phenomena at today's Art Festival, it is all the more regrettable and sighed.

How to correct social trends, how to build new art, this requires the power of the country and society to truly work hard, it is not something that one or two people can do. Occasionally, I have some thoughts and specially talk about them in a disorderly way, hoping to address the facts to remedy the shortcomings of the past and the present. There will be a new atmosphere in next year's Art Festival, which is not just what I personally expect.

### A Record of the Art of Painting of Revolutionary Party Members

— Liang Lieya

When it comes to the art of painting in our country, I am afraid that it cannot be described in detail in one article or one chapter. Therefore, I will not talk about the old saying, but will specifically narrow the scope and record the art of painting of the revolutionary comrades who founded the Republic of China to inform the people of the country, and express our permanent remembrance together, and learn from their spirit of "innovation," "creation," "freedom," and "independence"; at the same time, it will be used to commemorate the Art Festival.

Only those with passion, wisdom, cultivation, and compassion are willing to sacrifice themselves to save the country and join the revolutionary alliance to eliminate evil forces. Therefore, the brushstrokes of those revolutionary party members who are good at painting are either lofty and unrestrained or full of heroic spirit. There are absolutely no works that steal false names or imitate and copy. Everyone can freely and smoothly use their own brush and ink to reveal their respective wisdom and reveal the law. I will briefly describe what I know as follows:

The flowers, plants, landscapes, and waters of Shi Jianru and Lu Haodong are bold and vigorous, come from nature, and have no astringency or heaviness. The Founding Father once said: "Jianru is intelligent and eager to learn, and is sincere and earnest. His talent and appearance are similar to Lu Haodong, and both of them can write poetry and paint."

Chen Shaobai and Pan Dawei have lofty brush and ink sentiments. The pine wind, moon, and water are not enough to compare with their Qinghua. The composition is skillful and can turn flat waves into strange surprises and transform saliva into jewels, so they can be different from the ordinary.

Su Shiguzi all sketches from life. The lines are clear and vigorous, and the air is ethereal. The paintings are all to express his "crazy, chivalrous, and gentle" spirituality, reaching the fairyland and not being stained by dust. The height of his talent is no longer available today. Li Shutong was unrestrained at first, but later became simple and pale. The artistic conception is serene, like a virgin's autumn frost. It is a pity that he did not make many works.

Tan Yan, and Zhang Jing occasionally use calligraphy to write orchids, bamboos, and Buddha images, which are also vigorous and divine.

Gao Geng sketches from life, writing lions, tigers, horses, monkeys, orioles, wild geese, etc., and even small animals, small flowers, and leaves, all in order to transmit their spirituality. The landscape is free and unrestrained. Without outlining, it can also write out the true scenery of the sounds of nature in the wind, rain, sunshine, and clear sky, so it is the most touching. In the last season of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, he and his brother Lun first founded the "True Picture News" in Qipan Street, Shanghai, not only to promote the revolution, but also to pioneer the trend of publishing picture news in our country. When he died, Comrade Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, inscribed on his tombstone "The Tomb of Gao Qifeng, the Saint of Painting."

Lin Wen painted bamboo when he was young, which was graceful and elegant, and his spiritual mood was revealed in it. He was unwilling to rely on others.

Jing Yiyuan also likes to paint bamboo. The section is few and clear, and it has reached a lofty and unrestrained realm, like his person.

Zhang Zeshan painted horses, and Yunhao painted portraits for the mountain king. He has the reputation of being able to "paint the skin and the spirit," but the characters he paints are also very expressive. I once saw him painting a portrait of Xu Yian in Huangshan, and painting a Buddha image for Lu Danlin's 30th birthday, which can be called a fine work.

Cai Shou's works are simple in spirit, but he does not imitate Nantian, nor does he paint Ni Yun, and he scribbles at will, with keen feelings; the high and elegant interest of his temperament jumps out on the paper. He wanted Zhang Qingcheng to worship Su Ziguzi and the monk as female disciples, but he did not learn from his teacher, but liked to paint flowers and small landscapes for his own enjoyment.

Lu Shachen wrote as soon as he was interested, with a vast artistic conception, unaware of the past and unaware of the present.

In addition, those who are still alive and known to me are Zhang Renjie, Gao Lun, He Xiangning, Li Qiuyun, Li Tiefu, Tian Heng, He Sui, and Chen Shuren, all of whom can write works with life and form their own style, which is different from the others.

The Tao comes from enthusiasm and wisdom, so it can be free from the constraints of others' painting methods, and each can find its own world. For the world and life, it is a new , from an independent artistic realm.

### Thoughts on the Art Festival

— He Tianjian

I am a Chinese painting artist, which means I am one of the art creators. Let me speak about Chinese painting:

Someone asked me, "Someone said Chinese painting is dead." I asked in return, "Can that person do Chinese calligraphy?" They said, "Yes." In that case, Chinese painting is not dead!

Someone asked me, "Someone said Chinese painting should be improved, and it must absorb the strengths of Western painting. What do you think?" I smiled and said, "That's also acceptable, but don't forget the strengths of Chinese painting. Moreover, don't confuse the strengths and weaknesses of Chinese and Western painting."

Someone asked me, "Actually, Chinese painting is very prosperous today! According to news articles, there are countless famous painters. Why do some still say it's declining?" I said, "Yes, there are indeed 'must-be' painters, and every 'jia' (family, school) is 'da' (grand, large). Don't you see 'chestnut kings' and 'squid kings' everywhere? Since anything can be called 'king,' how can every family not be grand and large? Taking a step back, it's always good for people to strive upwards! There's no need to look down on them!"

Twenty years ago, I had a crazy idea: I hoped that all the artists in the world would emulate the painting methods and spirit of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties. I boldly shouted a slogan—to revive the landscape painting methods and spirit of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties, and to view this revival as a path of re-creation as valuable as being reborn. After this slogan was shouted, someone asked me, "Since you want to create, why take such a big detour, using the methods and spirit of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties as your path?" I said, "Methods are the external form, and spirit is the content. The artists of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties possessed the spirit of learning from nature and creating with their own ingenuity. I believe that 'du' (degree, measure) is the unchanging law of the universe, and 'fa' (method) is the result of human thought. Using method to apply degree is what the landscape painters of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties succeeded at. We should study how they obtained degree and how they generated method; even more, how they became the methods and standards of the Five Dynasties and Song landscape painters. You must know that the landscape paintings of that time still possessed the true original form and energy."

The Yuan, Ming, and early Qing dynasties added increasing complexity, although their methods had reached their peak. Later scholars, with their shallow understanding and superficial exploration, could not easily grasp the profound secrets, resulting in fleeting impressions and only a superficial understanding. Therefore, to seek the creative path of our predecessors, one must start from the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties.

I will further explain my views on Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Huang Quan, Wang Wei, Ni Zan, Wu Zhen, and from Dong Yuan to the Four Wangs: I believe Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Huang Quan, Wang Wei, Wu Zhen, and the Four Wangs' Wang Shimin (Yan Ke), Wang Jian (Xiang Bi), Wang Hui (Lu Tai) are all one person. I have never seen them as several people from several eras. Jing Hao and Guan Tong, to Jiang Can, and Wang Yuanqi (Shi Gu) among the Four Wangs, are one main branch. Jing Hao and Guan Tong, to Ni Yunlin and Cha Shihbiao (Mei He) of the Xin'an School, are another separate branch. However, these two branches can also be combined into one person, without needing to separate them by time or person. Although the landscape painting in our Chinese painting has a history of over a thousand years from its beginning to its completion, upon investigating its overall trajectory, there has been no new discovery in any particular era; it has simply been a lineage of application and gradual improvement.

When everything reaches its peak, if it can further transcend its level, then it hangs suspended without support and can only fall. The four or five branches after the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty declined in one fell swoop for this reason. Thirty-five years ago, Lian Nanhu and others from my hometown were determined to find another path, so they advocated the "xieyi" (sketching ideas) style of Shi Tao, Shi Xi, Bada Shanren (Zhu Da), and Jin Nong (Dong Xin). The Civilization Book Company published many picture albums of these people, seeking to change the prevailing atmosphere. Wu Guandai from my hometown and Yu Yu from Shanghai did their best to imitate Shi Tao. Wu was better than Yu, sometimes even able to create forgeries. More than thirty years ago, I also liked the style of Shi Tao. Later, because this path could only be a form of "ink play," I resolved to study the theories and techniques of landscape painting from the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties.

People often say that the life of a calligraphy and painting artist must be pure and noble, and their reputation is very high; this comes from the integrity and self-respect of the ancients. Even when fame and fortune were clearly within reach, they refused to passively accept undeserved recognition. For example, Wu Zhen (Zhong Gui) vowed to "wait for five hundred years for people to judge." His dedication to moral character and hard work was like this. All those who succeeded in the past were like this. Look at the present! Alas! Furthermore, the ancients treated friends with utmost loyalty and trust, such as Wang Yuanqi (Shi Gu) and Yun Shouping (Nan Tian). When we read Yun Shouping's poetry collection, we often spontaneously feel a longing for the past. How can today be so inferior to the past? Today, at the Art Festival, I especially express this earnestly, hoping that my fellow artists will cherish each other even more!

### Universal Love and Aestheticism

— Xu Shiqi

Love is a drop of sweet dew in the soul, a cell in the nerve center, a ray of dawn in the darkness. It makes no distinction between the wise and the foolish, humans and animals. It comes with life, and only disappears when the body is destroyed; to gain it is to live, to lose it is to die. Religious people worship God because He created the entire universe and all things; in modern times, the mystical subjective thought has lost its scientific basis, and the power of love, perhaps, belongs to the realm of universal love. Sages, heroes, and righteous people love all things, love humanity, love the world, love truth; only with the spirit of universal love can they make great contributions and creations. Why are the great people of ancient and modern times so "foolishly" devoted? In a word, they belong to the nerve reaction of loving truth.

The definition of beauty is the perfection of form, the harmony of sound and rhythm, the pleasure of the senses. The creation of beauty is to take human imperfections, spiritual emptiness, and emotional agitation and depression, and expand, promote, and enrich them, arousing sympathy or admiration. Qu Yuan's "Li Sao," Li Bai's and Du Fu's poetry, the Wang brothers' calligraphy, the paintings of the elder and younger Li Generals, Phidias' sculptures, Beethoven's symphonies, the realm expressed by beauty belongs to the entire universe and life. Therefore, the fruits created by beauty grant favors to humanity, are not restricted by time and space, do not distinguish between race and country, and are eternally new, possessing eternal value.

The opposite of love is disgust, hatred, animosity; the opposite of beauty is ugliness, baseness, imperfection. Humans are the most intelligent of all things, and the highest virtues are truth, goodness, and beauty. Due to the extreme expansion of utilitarianism, human nature has deteriorated, creating world turmoil and human mutual killing, which continues to be staged on the stage of life, constituting the evil consequences of "going against the grain."

The spirit of universal love and the creation of aestheticism contain universality, impartiality, and selflessness. Beethoven's music is not limited to being received and appreciated only by the Germanic people; Michelangelo's sculptures are not exclusively for Italians to touch and admire; Li Bai's, Du Fu's, and Homer's poetry are not confined to being appreciated and savored only by the Chinese and Greek people. In November 1936, a Chinese art exhibition was held in London, which was extended to five months, shaking the world; the solemnity and splendor, magnificent and exquisite craftsmanship of Eastern art were deeply imprinted in the minds of Western people, because the appreciation and creation of art are not limited to race and country, its contribution belongs to all of humanity.

### Air Hostess

— Jue Ren

"Air hostess," this beautiful noun, has been resounding recently. Unfortunately, they are merely "servants" serving the rich and powerful. China National Aviation Corporation strives for perfection in the facilities inside the aircraft, and does not want those who take the plane to be too lonely in the air, so it wants to recruit beautiful air hostesses to serve them.

The conditions are, firstly, to have a university degree; secondly, to be fluent in English and able to talk directly with British and Americans; thirdly, to be able to speak Cantonese; fourthly, to be able to speak Mandarin. And most importantly, one must be healthy, and not only healthy, but most importantly, one must have healthy beauty. This makes it difficult to be an "air hostess."

Being a female servant to the superior race and the upper-class Chinese is indeed so difficult. In addition, there is one more point to be stated: China's airplanes are not fixed and accidents happen at any time. Air hostesses must have the determination of "wanting money but not life," and be prepared to sacrifice themselves, so that those taking the plane will not be lonely even in case of emergency. Only then can the mission of the air hostess be considered complete.

Some are concerned that it may be difficult to find such an air hostess in China. Even if they can be found, they should use those prepared conditions to do something more meaningful. In fact, these are secondary problems. The biggest problem, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on the 20th, is that China's largest Shanghai airport will lose its Far East aviation status due to lack of equipment.

If it becomes a reality, then even if I have many Chinese air hostesses, I can only send them abroad. Do "air hostesses" really want to go to foreign countries to be foreign maids? Alas!

### A Serious Joke

— Er Bi

Time: March 20, 1947, Republic of China.

Location: Shanghai.

The price of a Shen Bao newspaper: 600 National Currency (postage extra for other locations).

A news item on the local Shanghai edition of the Shen Bao that day: The Lao Zha Police Station cracked down on a gambling den and arrested a large number of gamblers, including silk merchant Zhang Yinxian and 14 others. After investigation, the facts were confirmed, and each was fined 1,500 yuan before being released.

Let's do the math: 1,500 yuan is equal to the price of two and a half Shen Bao newspapers, which can buy three large steamed buns, or a bowl of Yangchun noodles, or seven and a half large pancakes, or a pack of not-so-good cigarettes.

Therefore, one of my friends wants to suggest to these fifteen silk merchants: If you want to gamble in the future, why not first pre-deposit a fine of 1,500 yuan per person at the Lao Zha Police Station?

Or: 1,500 yuan is indeed not a big deal now, but before the war, it could buy a small house. Therefore, the Lao Zha Police Station's move evokes a sense of nostalgia.

### Big Bills and Others

— Lu Chen

After the issuance of the 5,000-yuan big bill, which was "neither denied nor acknowledged," it turned out to be a "printing oversight," and even the "numbers" were "greatly discrepant." One can represent the "continuous improvement of China's printing industry," and one can also see the "value of banknotes." If both of these "one in ten thousand" events are "rejected," I want to see what "appropriate punishment" the responsible party will receive?

With the discussion of currency system reform at the Third Plenary Session, Shanghai, which has the most thorough Jewish style, is speculating and discussing. But let me start with myself, these issues are all "armchair strategy." First, I myself am poor. Second, I borrow money to deal with daily necessities, and after three days, I am "poor" again. Third, I cannot produce myself, so of course the result is still "poor." With three "poor" words strung together, even if I "reform" and "reform" right in front of my eyes, it is not a way to save "poor."

Those who suffer from the "misfortune from the sky," even though they have issued a "list" with every detail, according to our "official business done officially" "official style," I can guarantee that it "must" go through the following: "review," "investigation," "seeking superior guidance," "granting approval," "approving for filing and record," "approving for implementation," and "due to" "based on this" "according to this" ... etc. Those who waste paper and ink "procedures" can receive "separate numbers" of 5,000-yuan big bill "compensation," that would be strange!

### To Greatly Shelter the Poor Scholars and Make Them All Happy —A Record of Zeng Wenzheng's Love for Talent (II)

— Ai Ju

When Wenzheng conquered Nanjing, he was immediately appointed governor-general of Liangjiang. After the military affairs were roughly settled, he combined the printing bureaus of four provinces to jointly imitate and engrave the Seventeen Histories from the Jigu Pavilion, with the history of the two Han dynasties and the Three Kingdoms as the prerequisite. At that time, materials were needed for proofreading. My cousin also obtained a proofreading position by correctly guessing a riddle. My late father once recounted the story of Ge, a respected elder from Haining, which further showed that Wenzheng's love for talent was unwavering, even for humble individuals. Mr. Ge was an old student of my grandfather and had a reputation in the local school. His literary name was famous for a time. However, he suffered during the Taiping Rebellion, and his years were already advanced. He was good at humor, and his poems and essays were all written in a playful style, quite similar to Mr. Miao Lianxian of Renhe. He still set up a teaching account at home, but the fees were not generous, and his livelihood was very difficult. Because my late father was in the general's office, he mailed a newly printed collection of poems and asked someone in Hangzhou to seek a place to live, intending to present the poetry collection to Wenzheng as a recommendation. My late father, considering that each poem in the collection was interspersed with colloquial and vulgar language, and presenting it to his teacher might seem frivolous and lacking in solemnity, but because Wenzheng also liked such humor and usually regarded humor and wit as the highest level in discussing poetry, saying that it could not only relieve boredom and bring laughter but also develop intelligence and cultivate the mind, he placed the poetry collection on his desk and added a postscript on the cover. One day, Wenzheng visited my late father for business, and then took it away in his sleeve. The next day, he said to my late father, "How is Ge's energy? Can he come and work for me?" It turned out that he greatly appreciated two poems in the collection, "Monguan" (Schoolhouse) and "Xinhun" (Newlyweds), which he had secretly circled, and especially circled the last couplet of the "Xinhun" poem in red.

The "Monguan" poem says: "A gust of 　 cries out in the evening breeze, all the students show off their good voices, Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow, Universe, Flood, after finishing the Thousand Character Classic, they turn to the Mirror of History, after finishing the Hundred Family Surnames, they manage the prodigy, among them is a outstanding one, reading the Great Collection three lines a day."

The "Xinhun" poem says: "Willing to be mandarin ducks, not envious of immortals, high burning red candles illuminate the splendid feast, indeed it is a previous connection, no need to be polite, so and so why so soon, so and so openly, tomorrow we will look at each other and laugh, we all know what's in our hearts!" Both poems are wonderful, and the last couplet of the "Xinhun" poem is truly worthy of 　Adu. The three hairs on the cheek, no wonder the Duke especially appreciated it. My late father replied that Mr. Ge was very energetic and could come and work. The Duke immediately approved and appointed him as the chief proofreader of the printing bureau. The bureau's salary was divided into three grades, the lowest being sixty gold, the middle being ten gold, and the highest being one hundred gold. Mr. Ge was fortunate to receive the highest salary, which can be said to be a lucky man. There are many scholars who are at the end of their road nowadays. Can there also be someone like Duke Wenzheng, who greatly shelters the poor scholars and makes them all happy?

### Art and Literary World

— Feng Qian

Lei Shijian is the deputy editor of the Guoji Daily supplement in Kaohsiung, publishing many Chinese and Japanese poems. He recently published "Eight Years of Poetry Collection" and reprinted two Japanese poetry collections.

Ouyang Yuqian is in Taiwan, in addition to working as a director for the New China Theater Company, he is also devoted to the improvement of Min opera. However, since the "February 28th" incident, the Taiwan Provincial Chief Executive's Office Propaganda Committee was 　　disbanded. The New China Theater Company, which belongs to the Propaganda Committee, may break away from official relations and seek development in Taiwan. Ouyang may return to Shanghai once.

After the Taiwan Provincial Propaganda Committee was dismantled, the Taiwan Film Studio, which originally belonged to it, may become independent and make feature films to maintain expenses.

Taiwan is not short of talents in singing, dancing, and music trained by Japanese experts, most of whom were sent back to the province from Japan after the victory. However, after returning to the province, they immediately encountered unemployment. Dancers and musicians who were active on the Tokyo dance stage are now reduced to singing and dancing troupes that sell eroticism and abandon art, showing off low-level tastes to maintain their lives. The author once met such a woman in a coffee shop. According to her, she received six years of "baolei" training at the "Takarazuka" in Tokyo, but now she has become a female receptionist and cabaret girl in a coffee shop, and said very calmly: "China has no eastern guests, and no dance."

Film Talk

### "A Certain Madam"

— Wei Han

The wife of a retired warlord, by chance, met her former lover from her days as an opera singer. On the surface, he is now a wealthy businessman returning from abroad, but in reality, he is engaged in the illegal manufacture and sale of counterfeit money. He seized on their past relationship and repeatedly blackmailed her. Finally, when the counterfeit money case was cracked, he forced her to flee with him, which led to the warlord discovering everything. As a result, the rogue was arrested by the police, and the madam, after publishing a "realization" manifesto, left her family. This is the story of "A Certain Madam."

Of course, we do not deny that a simple story can produce an excellent work with a good screenplay and a talented director. However, the film "A Certain Madam" that we can see is terribly disappointing. The emptiness and forced nature of the script forms an innate weakness, and the incompetence of the director creates a later disharmony. The entire story begins with an extremely sudden coincidence, followed by a patchwork of many forced and illogical fragments, and finally ends with a forcibly added "bright tail." On what basis is Hu Die's transformation, resistance, and epiphany based? Where will she go after she walks out of Yu's house? The screen does not tell us at all. I am afraid that even the screenwriter and the director himself have no words to explain. Also, how could Hong, the deputy officer, who has been a follower of commander Yu for twenty years, be like an impulsive young student, foolishly and clumsily professing his love to the commander's wife? We are really surprised by the screenwriter's and director's lack of observation and ignorance of social affairs in real life.

It is difficult to list all of this heap of forced, absurd, and illogical things in detail. The screenwriter created them with "closed doors," and the director moved them to the screen in the form of "comic strips." In addition, some annoying "gags" were forcibly added, such as "walking head-on into the wall."

Although Hu Die's acting skills are still promising, and the two actors who played the commander and the rogue are also promising talents, they were all ruined in this film. The sound recording skills were equally sloppy.

Regarding the production of "A Certain Madam," we cannot think of any better reason except that the company's producer thought of using this "old brand film queen" to speculate and make a fortune.

### The Children of Tojo and Konoe

— 𣏌 Ren

Recently, American news agencies issued two news items. On the surface, these news items seemed unimportant, so many editors in newspaper offices who were busy dealing with news from the Moscow conference threw these two items lightly into the wastebasket.

These two news items are related to Japan. The first news item said that when the Japanese police were dispatched to arrest the gangsters across the country, they caught Tojo Hideki's younger brother in a corner of a train. After the war failed and Tojo was arrested, this younger brother of the unbridled prime minister had also been reduced to a gangster.

The second news item is: Konoe Fumimaro's son has gone to Moscow and is undergoing strict communist training!

The Japanese are a mentally abnormal nation. Their emotions fluctuate. They regard being able to commit suicide as brave, and they regard not hesitating to endure hardships until revenge is taken as the highest achievement in morality. In the shogunate era, it was very common for vassals to avenge their masters. After succeeding, they would generously commit harakiri. Moreover, when the stories were spread, countless heroic colors were added. In 1701 (Genroku 14), Oishi Kuranosuke and 46 other Ako retainers avenged their lord Asano Naganori by attacking and killing Asano's enemy, Kira Yoshinaka. All 47 committed suicide by disembowelment, and the Japanese still regard them as the models of samurai. I am not praising this "samurai spirit," I only want to call everyone's attention: a nation that has undergone such education for hundreds of years is bound to have a rather profound impact on the nation's psychology.

Therefore, we still cannot but be strictly prepared and closely watch the defeated Japan. Tojo's brother is reduced to a gangster, and the Japanese "gangster" is the "ronin" that we have long experienced. The Japanese ronin are organized. Their strength is much stronger than our country's gangs. The "Black Dragon Society" is an example. Don't forget that we have suffered a lot from the ronin before—wasn't the September 18th Incident launched by the ronin first?

Konoe's son went to be a communist, which has a more political "exile" air. Once this excuse is needed, it can be used at any time to take action. The more tense the diplomatic relations between the US and the Soviet Union seem to be, the more sinister his move is! Many Japanese still have more forgiving words for Konoe in their post-war writings, so in terms of appealing, this Konoe brand is really not worthless!

These two people symbolize the downfall of the rulers of Japan in the past, and also hide the hidden worries that we may encounter in the future. The Japanese are good at deceiving, and good at flattering with a forced smile—but, let me repeat one more sentence: The Japanese are a nation that regards being able to avenge their hatreds as the highest honor!

### "The Song of Bernadette"

As one of the greatest productions of 20th Century Fox last year, it won five Golden Award statues from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after its premiere. The heroine, Jennifer Jones, is a newcomer and was named "Best Actress of the Year." This film is her masterpiece. "The Song of Bernadette" is originally a best-selling novel by French modern writer Franz Werfel, and its story is already well-known in the United States. The film has now arrived in Shanghai and will soon be shown at the Cathay Theatre. Manhattan

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"Do you think she's good-looking?" Old Xu understood the intentions of this playboy.

"Extremely beautiful!" Little Shen was mesmerized, his eyes shining. "It's just that she seems too arrogant..."

His words were not finished when a familiar whistle came from the courtyard, blowing a familiar tune.

"5111, 5271, 5144, 321712..."

"It's Old Zhu," the fat man put down his wine glass and shouted. He and 　the deputy manager turned around at the same time, looking at the door of the corridor.

Little Shen was displeased.

"Damn it, that monster! He's been singing the Wedding March for more than ten years, and he's still a bachelor!"

When Old Zhu's slender figure was gradually projected onto the wall of the corridor by the light in the room, Fat Xu opened his throat and shouted, "Come and have a glass of four-year-old UB! Old Zhu!"

But Old Zhu did not have time to answer. His body had just approached the door frame when a piercing long whistle of a steam whistle came from the sky, followed by a second and a third...

"Air raid! Air raid!" The people in the room shouted in unison, but their expressions were not nervous.

Zhu Zhaonian's left leg had stepped into the door frame, and he smiled at everyone. Suddenly, a rush of footsteps came from behind him, mixed with the sharp voice of a woman.

"... First, we have to find Fei Fei. She doesn't know where she went, and the air raid is coming again..." 　　Lost her usual calmness, so anxious that her voice changed.

Jin Aili helplessly held Rong'er, following behind. She had lived in Guilin for a long time, so she was not afraid of air raids. This was because she had been greatly affected by Lan's 　　in the past few days, and had regarded her mother and her two children as her own. She was so anxious, she also became anxious, but she had never been assertive in her life. Although she wanted to help Lan, she didn't know what to do. Therefore, she could only 　　be in a group just like 　　herself.

Zhu Zhaonian did not hear clearly what they said.

"Don't panic! Air raids are nothing in Guilin. There are caves everywhere here. It's just a few steps out of the gate!" He wanted to comfort Lan.

"No, it's that Fei Fei is gone...!" 　said in a sad voice, her face pale with anxiety.

"What?" Zhu Zhaonian couldn't help but be taken aback, and quickly turned around. "Did she go out alone?" (II) (IV)

### Idle Chatter

— Wang Cong

Recently I had the opportunity to reread "Sun Tzu's Thirteen Chapters". This general, whom I once regarded as a martial figure, seems to be gradually revealing his true face in my understanding – a prudent, benevolent old man standing firmly in my impression.

The opening sentence says: "Warfare is of vital importance to the State; the province of life or death; the road to survival or ruin. It is mandatory that it be thoroughly studied." This is Sun Tzu's grand premise for discussing military strategy. He is earnestly admonishing us, his descendants, that the art of warfare is not a trivial pursuit for individuals to show off and compete for territory.

In the "Attack by Stratagem" chapter, Sun Tzu specifically proposes: "The best policy is to attack their plans; next is to disrupt their alliances; next is to attack their army; and the worst is to besiege walled cities." Attacking the army is already an unwise move, and besieging cities is the worst strategy. As for the key to victory, it lies in the upper and lower levels having the same desires. Translating this into modern language, it means that the government and the people must have the same needs.

We cannot flatten a floating face with a palm or iron ruler, and Parisian perfume need not necessarily be used in a funeral parlor.

The roar of wild beasts cannot cure people's headaches.

These are all common sense! Perhaps this thin textbook is printed too little, and many great people, except for elementary school students, have never read it.

An old man from the countryside came to Shanghai. I accompanied him on a stroll along the road. He nervously watched the cars and managed to cross the road with difficulty. He frowned and said:

"What? Are there so many people in Shanghai? Piles and piles of them, more than the flies on cow dung in the countryside!"

The country folk do not understand Bernard Shaw's satire; however, this is a wonderful metaphor, an intuitive metaphor, and I couldn't help but laugh.

We also walked past an art supply company. In the glass display window was a plaster statue of Venus (the goddess of love and beauty) completely nude. The old man from the countryside shook his head:

"What? Isn't this woman wearing any pants? She's not ashamed."

If you were to talk to him about art and the beauty of curves, it would seem to be a waste of effort.

People in different positions can discover each other's absurdities.

Have you not seen that during the reign of Emperor Hui of Jin, many places suffered from famine? Emperor Hui smugly thought of a brilliant solution.

"If there is no rice to eat, eat pork."

I think that for those in Shanghai who don't have a house to live in, if they are afraid of being uncomfortable living in the Park Hotel, they might as well go to New York to live for a few years.

Merciful Lord! Do you want us to eat pork? Unfortunately, we don't have a good appetite, what do you say we should do? Amen!

### Japanese Meal – Moral Character – Fine Arts

— Xu Shennian

Doing Good at the Art Festival.

"The writer is not a perfect person", therefore every time I sleep I dream, even when awake I am dreaming. Zhuang Zhou dreamed of transforming into a butterfly, fluttering and carefree, not knowing whether Zhuang Zhou had transformed into a butterfly or the butterfly had transformed into Zhuang Zhou? Xiao Erzi dreamed of becoming the president of the Central Bank, joyful, not knowing whether to buy US dollars or sell gold? Cui Zhen, the blonde girl next door, once told me in person: Butcher Kong made a fortune, three-wheeled vehicles in, three-wheeled vehicles out, his third concubine is even more fortunate, not caring about meals, playing mahjong, if Shanghai did not have electric lights, early in the morning when Butcher Kong slaughtered pigs, half-asleep, it would be difficult to avoid accidentally killing the third concubine, because her status and the pig's are equivalent; — I thought: Cui Zhen is dreaming, anyway, the blonde girls change at eighteen, she still has time to change! Xiao Ququ is good at dreaming, declaring in advance; especially the books I read often affect my dreams, for example: I read "Water Margin" during the day, and at night I dream of fighting tigers (live tigers); during the day I read a book by a certain doctor: "Flies are the great enemy of mankind", in my dream I clap and especially clap flies; in the evening I read "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio", in my dream I even traveled with the black and white impermanence!

At this moment, at this time, in this place, I had a rather elegant dream, which must be recorded.

In my dream, I was browsing the newspaper and accidentally discovered a huge advertisement: "Tea Party for the Art World", this is the main headline; the sub-headlines have two lines: "Regardless of faction, treat everyone equally", "Free participation, no invitation required". This is really tempting! I strolled over, — still in my dream, — as if I had arrived in that corner of Hongkou. Just as one of my feet was stepping into the venue, the master of ceremonies happened to shout: "Speech by the Minister of Art!" I thought to myself: Art with a Ministry, China has made great progress! The appearance of that Minister was very familiar, but I couldn't say who it was for a moment. The "speech" he gave was very humble, even saying that he was there to receive training, not to give a speech. Following this was the representative of the artists giving a reply. That reply was truly unexpected, — at least beyond "my" expectations. The person giving the reply first thanked the government for its care for the literary and artistic circles: not only did it ensure that they had no worries about food and clothing, but it also gave them great spiritual comfort, such as raising their status at the meeting, etc. Then he represented all the attendees in unanimously requesting the government to withdraw its subsidy policy, because in this prosperous age, — I continue to talk about my dream, — material subsidies are not needed. The presentation of this request was met with enthusiastic applause from the entire venue. The Minister of Art stood up with a smile and gave a long reply, which also won thunderous applause. His reply to the reply, in summary, has about three points: (1) In the past, everyone misunderstood that fine art was a luxury, but now it is clear that it is a spiritual key vitamin; (2) The country has a responsibility to protect all citizens, let alone literary and artistic people who are excellent citizens? (3) The literary and artistic people are willing to work hard and win glory for the country, the government is very grateful, all the subsidies are insignificant, truly what is called: "repaying one ten-thousandth," absolutely must not be mentioned again, mentioning it instead makes me feel ashamed! Then several other people gave speeches, all of which were very humble.

Finally, there was entertainment.

Among the various entertainment programs, the "Dragon and Phoenix Playing" performed by two masters was the most wonderful. Master A played the "Dragon", and Master B played the "Phoenix". Master B had Li Linfu's fat, but played Li Fengjie, the first county of this waitress, performing twisted and pinched, really killing people with laughter! Master A played the emperor, frowning, a little sour — but the most hilarious thing is that these two masters were originally mortal enemies, who had argued and even fought each other; today, on the stage, they shook hands and made peace, teasing each other!

Just as I was enjoying myself, a gust of wind moved, my eyelashes, startled me awake: it turned out that someone was testing an atomic bomb ten thousand and eight thousand miles away.

I look forward to the realization of this good dream; — the most important mission in life is "expectation" (36, 3, 19).
