(2) Regarding the acceptance of Dalian, it involves international issues that the Headquarters cannot independently resolve, so he came to Nanjing for instructions. The rumors that the National Army had advanced to Dalian and was awaiting orders to move forward were inaccurate.

According to sources from the official personnel department in Beiping, the abolition of the Military Mediation Department has been decided, only the time of announcement has not yet arrived. Personnel from the Communist Party also hinted today that the Military Mediation Department may be terminated within four weeks.

An Overview of the War Situation Along the Yellow River By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi The reporter inspected Henan, Shaanxi, western Shandong, and other places along the Longhai Railway for four months. The military situation is reported as follows: The completion of the closure at Huayuankou has significantly impacted the military situation in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu. The closure project encountered serious difficulties in the final stage, and stone materials could not be supplied quickly and in large quantities. The Communist army twice violently destroyed the Lu Wang Tomb—the only supply source of stone materials—which was not entirely due to misunderstanding. The Closure Project Bureau demonstrated perseverance in overcoming this difficulty. The Yellow River turns southeast from Huayuankou, creating a tragic Yellow River flood area. On the other hand, north of the Longhai Railway, the Yellow River is completely exhausted, which is conducive to military maneuvers, especially the Communist army's rapid concentration and dispersal tactics. The Liu Bocheng area (Jinji-Yu-Lu area), including the Taihang Mountains, has about 200,000 troops, of which 100,000 are main forces and 100,000 are militia. In terms of 　　上, the 　　遠所指揮　　　區　兵力為高. Next is the Northeast Communist Army commanded by Lin Biao. After the Yellow River returned to its old course, it clearly drew a diagonal line in the rectangular area formed by the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Longhai Railways, dividing the area of the Liu Bocheng military mobile corps into two halves. The Huayuankou project could have been completed before the large-scale flooding last year, but it failed. As a result, Liu Bocheng's group quickly launched an attack on the Longhai Railway. Subsequently, under the pressure of the National Army, they completely retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River by last November. Over the past few months, Liu Bocheng has adopted a defensive offensive to achieve his goal of continuing to control this area, and it cannot be said that he has not succeeded. The base areas established by the Communist army in the Yellow River flood area have 20,000 well-trained troops. In the Central Plains battle this summer, almost all of them were 清 by the National Army, leaving only two or three hundred people. In this 　　十七, Liu Bocheng launched a fierce sabotage battle on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway to save the situation. They quickly concentrated their forces to attack and then quickly retreated. In the process, two 　　只對的兵力 was replenished to the Yellow River flood area. As of now, it has returned to the troop configuration status of the summer. The Yellow River flood area after the Yellow River returned to its original course is undoubtedly very conducive to the Communist army to carry out struggles. Because the National Army quickly entered Jiaozuo, the coking coal was not completely destroyed, and the Communist army is still concerned about this. According to reliable sources, there is a Communist army specifically targeting the mine, constantly attempting to attack it nearby. On the north bank of Shan County, the Communist army controlled a large number of wooden boats to connect the two banks of the Yellow River, once hoping to cut off the railway east of Hekouguan, so that the Li Xiannian and Liu Bocheng forces in the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi border area could have interconnected arteries. After the National Army entered Yuanqu, the Communist army's entry and exit in the southern part of the Zhongtiao Mountains was cut off, and the safety of this railway line was gradually guaranteed. Three weeks ago, hundreds of Communist troops were repelled by the National Army dozens of miles south of Shan County. For the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Yellow River north and east of Tongguan has never frozen. These eight consecutive years were a miracle, which helped China's defense in the Anti-Japanese War. This year, however, it "unexpectedly" began to freeze, and it will soon be passable for vehicles and horses. The Communist army in the Lvliang Mountain Military Region conducted a military mobilization to stop the Yan Xishan forces from going south in western Shanxi. They concentrated all their forces to attack Zhongyang and Fenyang, which were in a state of siege, so that the通道 between northern Shaanxi and the Taihang Mountains to Daming would not be cut off. From Yanchang in northern Shaanxi to Daming and even Shandong, the Communist army has a fairly long highway transportation line. This line runs across Shanxi, building semi-permanent bridges over rivers in many places. Daming has become an important logistics base in the rear. The Yellow River's return to its original course will cut off Shandong, and the entry and exit of southern Shandong to northwestern Shandong will be greatly restricted. Chen Yi has to make a limited change to his concept of military movement. So far, the Communist army, except for the Northeast, does not have a truly productive rear base. This long transportation line not only plays a huge role in the current military scale but also has political significance. It creates the impression that "the Communist army has controlled North China." The base area is a Go-like arrangement. In the past, the Communist army tried to connect them to make them "alive," while the National Army tried to cut them off. The Zhangjiakou battle was a serious test. If this long line loses its function, the Communist army will eventually only leave a part of its armed forces at various Go points to engage in development, attracting the National Army, and will move its main force closer to the northwest, closer to Outer Mongolia, to establish a truly productive base to compete with the Northeast and engage in long-term warfare. The Communist army must not wait until the arrival of the two seasons. Losing favorable conditions in North China, the severe cold and glaciers have already increased the Communist army's activity in North China, launching offensives, and arranging to deal with the battles this spring. These two things are interrelated. The Communist army believes that the offensive defense is still the best principle. (Continued on page 2)

It is heard that the remaining Communist troops in Lianshui, Siyang, Guanyun, and Ganyu are gathering in the territory of Suqian and Pixian, attempting to make a final struggle in the two counties of Xu and Hai. According to well-informed sources, if the Communist army is defeated in the south, the National Army will take advantage of the victory to attack from both the north and south, and the overall situation in northern Jiangsu can be settled in one fell swoop, which may not be beyond the Spring Festival.

After a vigorous attack by the advancing National Army, Woyang was recaptured on the 10th. The remaining Communist troops fled to Xiumenji and are being pursued. [Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th] (1) The battle situation in southern Shandong is becoming more and more fierce.

Daheifa in the east was occupied, and the Pingjin Highway has been closed since the 7th. Related parties said that the purpose of the Communist Army's action was not to occupy locations but to打击地方武力. [Associated Press, Beiping, 11th] After the Communist Army captured Anping, the National Army launched a counterattack and finally recaptured this highway station today. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are still fighting fiercely in the Matou area.

It is said that Zhang Xueshi holds a very high position in the Communist Army, and the war in the Beiping area is only a cut above guerrilla warfare. The Railway Lines in North China Have Been Repeatedly Sabotaged by the Communist Army Landmines Exploded Three Times in One Day [Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 10th] The Communist Army's sabotage of transportation has intensified in recent days. Landmines exploded three times on the northern section of Jinpu on the 9th. At 1:00 AM on the 10th, another 49 telegraph poles were destroyed between Jinghai and Tangguantun.

The Closure of the Yellow River is Imminent It is Absolutely Impossible to Close the Diversion Channel Otherwise, Once the Ice Run Arrives, All Previous Efforts Will be Wasted A Conversation with the Director of the Henan Repair and Defense Office [Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th] After the Huayuankou Diversion Channel was released, the Chinese Communist Party protested, demanding that the closure be stopped and the Diversion Channel be closed. According to Director Su Guanche, who has been governing the Yellow River for decades in the Henan Repair and Defense Office, closing the Diversion Channel is extremely difficult. The Diversion Channel is on the sand滩, and there are no坝头at both ends of the口门 to serve as a foundation. If柳梱is thrown at both ends and the口门 is reduced, the water flowing into the口门 will inevitably split into two parts. Subsequently, the sand will inevitably be washed away, and the water will flood without obstruction. Even if木椿 is driven and a便橋 is built to close it, the Huayuankou口門 bridge will be threatened due to the increased impact force, and the closure project will inevitably stop. Once the ice run period arrives, the ice blocks will come like a landslide, and all the projects will be washed away. Therefore, the closure must be completed before the ice run period. This is because once the泛区 experiences the ice run, it will inevitably cause endless disasters. Since the Huayuankou closure failed at the end of June last year, the泛区 has not suffered a major disaster. This is because the Yellow River and Shahe River water涨時期 deviate again, which is a blessing from heaven that cannot be repeated. Currently, the north and south embankments on the east bank of Kaifeng are only 150 meters apart, and the river channel is extremely narrow. Once the flow increases, there is a risk of westward breach, leading to a major disaster. According to historical examples, the引河 cannot be closed. (A Manuscript on the Deputy Director of the Yellow River Closure and Embankment Restoration Bureau, etc., Inspecting the Hebei-Shandong Embankment Restoration Project and Being Intercepted by the Communist Army, is Moved to Page 3) The Siamese Government Violates the Agreement Overseas Chinese Rice Stores are Squeezed Out Ambassador Li Attaches Great Importance and Has Made a Suggestion [Central News Agency, Bangkok, 10th] The issue of wholesale rice stores for Chinese and Siamese merchants in the Bangkok area was resolved some time ago. However, because the Siamese government violated the agreement two weeks ago, the number of stores allocated to overseas Chinese out of the 46 stores was changed to 11. The issue has arisen again. The overseas Chinese merchants complied with the original agreement and refused to accept the new number. The Siamese authorities used the excuse that the overseas Chinese had abandoned their rights and handed over all 42 stores to the Siamese to handle. According to the Siamese rice, due to recent smuggling exports and exports to the United Nations, there is a shortage. The Siamese government plans to establish wholesale stores to cope with the food panic in Bangkok. The Siamese authorities initially planned to establish 35 wholesale stores, which would be controlled by the Siamese Chamber of Commerce, and allocate five of them to be operated by overseas Chinese. However, because there are more than 100 large Chinese stores in Bangkok, the overseas Chinese felt that the ratio was unfair. Later, the two parties agreed to increase the number of stores to 46, with 22 to be operated by overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese here believe that the recent actions of the Siamese government are a plan to exclude overseas Chinese from the rice industry and monopolize it by the Siamese. Ambassador Li Tiezheng attaches great importance to this matter and has made a construction proposal to the Siamese authorities. The Dutch East Indies Authorities Announce a Ban on Chinese from Entering Surabaya [Central News Agency, Batavia, 10th] The Dutch authorities announced that the city of Surabaya is now experiencing a housing shortage and prohibits immigration.

Vietnamese Overseas Chinese are in Dire Straits Nearly 200 Million Vietnamese Dollars Lost in French-Vietnamese Conflicts The Executive Yuan Telegraphed the Bank of China to Allocate 2 Million for Emergency Relief [Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 11th] Representatives of overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam received reporters in the afternoon of the 11th to report that more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam are in dire straits due to the war in Vietnam. They hope that people in the motherland can provide assistance. It is said that as of the middle of December last year, the property loss of overseas Chinese was 265.7 million Vietnamese dollars, 544 overseas Chinese were missing, 237 were arrested, 57 were injured, and 66 were killed. If the recent losses are added, it would be even more alarming. The war in Hanoi is still continuing. The overseas Chinese area is occupied by the Vietnamese army and surrounded by the French army. Communication with the outside world is cut off, food is scarce, garbage is piled up, and famine and disease follow one after another. It has been surrounded for nearly a month, and the tragic situation can be imagined. After arriving in Nanjing, the representatives visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of National Defense, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and other agencies to request: (1) Relief, (2) Sending senior officials to comfort, (3) Instructing both parties to compensate for losses, (4) Ordering the Vietnamese to release detained overseas Chinese, (5) Sending airplanes to transport rice and medicine to help stranded overseas Chinese. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to allocate 200 million yuan for relief, and the matter of sending personnel to express condolences is under consideration. When talking about the neutral zone plan, they believe that this matter is necessary, but the overseas Chinese and local people are difficult to get along with, and the effect of the neutral zone is not very great. The more effective method is to evacuate women and children from some areas. They denied that the overseas Chinese had requested the dispatch of troops to protect overseas Chinese. It is said that we are in a neutral position, and what we ask for is only security, and we have no other demands in diplomacy. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Diplomatic circles News: Our government is extremely concerned about the refugees residing in French Vietnam. It is understood that the Executive Yuan recently telegraphed the Bank of China to instruct the Vietnamese branch to pay 2 million Vietnamese dollars to Hu Zijian, the chief clerk stationed in Hanoi, for emergency relief expenses. Those refugees in Hanoi, Haiphong, and various parts of northern Vietnam who are in difficult situations and urgently need relief will receive the relief funds first.

The CCP's "Flying Squad" Attacks the Suburbs of Beiping [Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 11th] The CCP's "Flying Squad" frequently appears near Beiping, attacking , with the main target being in Beiping. The purpose seems to be to "annihilate" the security team that was recently formed there, which the Communist army hates even more than the regular Central Army. It is heard that there are currently about 20,000 security team members in Hebei Province, mostly composed of local people who are familiar with the local situation and can easily detect the military situation of the Communist army. The reason why the Communist army wants to annihilate them is precisely for this reason. The Northeast Communist Army Increases Troops to Invade The National Army Counter-Encircles Jiutai [Our Correspondent in Changchun, 11th] The Communist Army invading Yongji and Jiutai continues to increase its troops and attack the surrounding strongholds of the National Army.

A Major Brawl Between Two Gangs of Workers at the Xujiapeng Wharf in Wuchang Mobilizing a Thousand People, Killing Four, Injuring Seven, and Three Missing [Our Correspondent in Hankou, 11th] The long-pending dispute between the two gangs of wharf workers in Xujiapeng, Wuchang, broke out into a major brawl again at 8:00 AM yesterday. The two sides mobilized a thousand people, and the mixed fight lasted for about two hours. A total of four workers, including Yi Shuihe, were killed, seven were seriously injured, and three others fell into the water and went missing, their lives unknown. After the military police arrived, they immediately arrested two murderers and圍彈壓急. Later, because the support branch troops prevented the punishment of the murderers, the military police almost clashed. Fortunately, the military police maintained calm and were able to temporarily resolve the crisis. It is said that there are two gangs of workers at that place, under the jurisdiction of Wang and Huang, who have fought each other five times for wharf rights.

This Year’s City Budget Expenditure: An Average Burden of 60,000 Per Person, Ten Times Greater Than Nanjing, Three Times Greater Than All of Jiangsu Province. The Municipal Council Feels Caught in a Dilemma During Review.

[Our Report] The Municipal Council held its first budget review conference yesterday morning during the second session of the assembly. Wang Naixu, the convener of the Budget Committee, first reported on the committee's review opinions from the previous evening, stating: To build an ideal city, the municipal government’s expenses cannot be reduced annually, but on the other hand, the burden on citizens must be considered. Therefore, a definitive number cannot be reported yet, and only a few principles have been decided: (1) Personnel expenses will be reviewed based on the personnel expenses paid in December of last year; (2) Overlapping agencies should be merged or abolished; (3) Tax collection should be thoroughly reorganized; (4) Unnecessary expenditures should be reduced as much as possible. It is hoped that this year's budget will not have any wasteful spending. Subsequently, Councilor Xu Yongzu supplemented, explaining: This year's budget expenditure is 230 billion yuan, with an average burden of 60,000 yuan per citizen. This budget is ten times larger than that of Nanjing and three times larger than that of Jiangsu Province. Among these, regular expenditures account for 7%, temporary expenditures account for 36.6%, and operating expenses account for 0.7%, while the largest portion is living subsidies, accounting for 55.7%, which is personnel expenses. Strictly speaking, it is even more than this amount. Therefore, it is generally believed that there are too many people. When detailed inquiries were made with various bureaus of the municipal government, they all stated that "the existing personnel are not enough to manage, and people must be added." This makes reviewing the budget very difficult. However, the municipal government currently has 43,959 employees, which should not be increased. In the future, the establishment of new institutions must first be approved by this council.

Revenue Aspect

Regarding revenue, labor substitute fees in the temporary category lack a legal basis, and wartime laws are now unsuitable. The constitution has a military service obligation, but there is no labor substitute. Intuitively, it seems to be a poll tax, so it is unanimously advocated that it should not be included. Furthermore, after the implementation of the municipal construction donation, citizens are overwhelmed, and on the other hand, the municipal finances are difficult. This case must be decided after being approved by the general assembly. Other taxes, such as rental, business license tax, feast tax, entertainment tax, and slaughter tax, have all been revised by the central government and can only be followed. The result is that revenue should be reduced, but business license tax may be increased. Hotel and inn donations should also be greatly reduced according to special tax regulations. Other taxes may be increased appropriately.

The Budget Review Committee is Like a Sandwich

Councilor Li Wenjie continued to supplement the report, saying: The Budget Committee is caught in a dilemma when reviewing this year's budget, like a "sandwich," but it finds a way out of no way, which is "living within its means." As a result of the committee's initial review, it is temporarily proposed to add a net of 41.3 billion yuan, but if the labor substitute fee is removed, it can only increase by 1.3 billion. Which agencies to abolish has not yet been discussed. It is hoped that a specialized committee will be organized to adopt scientific methods and propose concrete facts for research. In short, although the Budget Committee has worked hard, it is like a long-term fatigue flight. There is no goal, and the climate is bad. This case still awaits instructions from the general assembly.

"Streamlining Administration" and "Requesting Funds": Tao Baichuan Reviews the Budget

When the general assembly began to discuss, the opinions raised by the councilors were also based on the same principles. Councilor Fu Rulin stated: (1) The municipal government's establishment should be determined; (2) The work to be done in the 36th year must be decided first. Councilor Tao Baichuan said: To review the budget and increase revenue and reduce expenditure means "simplifying administration and requesting funds." In terms of simplifying administration, there are some businesses that do not need to be entirely handled by the municipal government. It may be possible to encourage society to promote private management, such as education, public transportation, charitable undertakings, etc. The government can provide subsidies. In terms of institutions, there are too many bureaus, which can be reduced and changed to divisions. If the income is insufficient, the "deficit" can be handed over to the central government to bear, requesting government subsidies. This is what is called "simplifying administration and requesting funds."

The review conference still had no concrete results. The Budget Committee conducted another review last night so that it could be submitted to the general assembly for continued discussion.

Budget Review Still Inconclusive: Six Principles Proposed to Be Sent to the Municipal Government as Reference for Recompiling the Budget.

[Our Report] The municipal government's submission of the city's general budget proposal for the 36th year of the Republic of China for revenue and expenditure is the biggest challenge for this session of the Municipal Council. The Budget and Final Accounts Committee held a meeting last night and discussed it for several hours. Although there was no conclusion, several principles have been agreed upon. (1) On the revenue side, due to various difficulties, it is impossible to approve the number. It is proposed to ask the general assembly to extend the meeting for a considerable period, during which a detailed investigation and discussion should be conducted to find a way to approve it. (2) On the expenditure side, the central government is waiting to approve the municipal organization law. During the extension of the general assembly, each subgroup will conduct on-site investigations of the subordinate institutions of various bureaus, and review them after the investigation is clear. Six principles are also proposed to be sent to the municipal government for reference when recompiling the budget.

(1) How much is the amount receivable but not received for the revenue of the second half of the 35th year? How much is the actual expenditure that must be paid for the nature of accounts payable but not paid? After deducting the revenue and expenditure, is there any surplus? The municipal government should be asked to clearly report the estimated number to this council in a list. (2) In the future, if various bureaus of the municipal government need to add new institutions due to business needs, they must submit them to this council for review and decision before they can be established. (3) Abolish overlapping institutions under various units and reduce redundant personnel. Public service personnel shall not exceed the ratio of one public service personnel for every four staff members. Each committee of this council shall be responsible for first conducting a detailed review of the current situation of the bureau in charge, and listen to the opinions of the heads of various bureaus, and propose an abolition plan for discussion. (4) The number of personnel in each unit shall not exceed the number of people who actually received expenses in December of last year, but the number of people who must be hired according to the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government and the number of people who should be hired according to the plans approved by this council are not subject to this restriction. (5) Expenditures of the nature of operating expenses listed in the temporary expenditure shall be coordinated with the central work plan, and each competent bureau shall separately prepare a plan and calculation sheet, and be reviewed by the newly established policy report central work plan review committee of this council before being incorporated into the budget. (6) Expenditures listed in the temporary expenditure that are of a regular nature should be recompiled into the regular expenditure to distinguish the boundaries between the regular and temporary categories.

Finance Proposal Passed: Request the Central Government to Simplify Tax Collection

[Our Report] Yesterday, the general assembly passed a finance proposal, namely, "Request the central government to simplify tax collection items, reduce tax rates, eliminate usury, protect domestic goods, and recover rights." It was resolved to retain it for review by the Finance Committee.

Three Proposals Reviewed by the Finance Committee

[Our Report] The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council held a review meeting last night to continue discussing the proposals: (1) The Financial Bureau's handling of grain household registration is not helpful to the facts and only causes disputes, and should be stopped. Review opinion: It is found that most of the grain registers and transfer registers are lost and incomplete, and it is impossible to verify the facts. Moreover, the grain household work handled by the Finance Bureau has completed two-thirds, and it seems that it should continue to be completed. It is proposed that the general assembly temporarily retain the original proposal. (2) Since the municipal ferry is run by a business, it should be taxed according to regulations to enrich the municipal treasury. Review opinion: It is proposed that the general assembly pass it. (3) The people in the suburbs are poor, and it is proposed to exempt small houses, vendors and other taxes. Review opinion: It is proposed that the general assembly send the proposal to the municipal government by letter, and deal with it in consideration of the economic situation of the people in the suburbs and the municipal government's tax revenue.

Today's Agenda

[Our Report] Today's agenda: At 9:00 am, review the municipal government's central work plan report for the 36th year, and the general assembly will publicly invite the speaker to assign the Budget Committee to be responsible. At the same time, Fu Rulin, Tao Baichuan, Wang Jian'e and other 19 councilors were appointed to review the municipal government's policy report for the second half of the 35th year. Both meetings will be held at the Municipal Council in Fuming Village.

The Sixth Meeting will be held in the afternoon at Zhengshi Middle School to discuss proposals and the municipal government's central work plan.

Continued Collection of Construction Donation Arouses Heated Discussion with Conflicting Opinions. To Be Discussed After the Budget is Finalized

[Our Report] In addition to continuing to discuss the budget, the sixth meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon also raised the municipal government's official letter regarding the issue of municipal construction donations and submitted it to the assembly for discussion. This case was discussed in two points: (1) The municipal construction donation in the winter of the 35th year of this city will no longer be doubled, and will be reduced according to the autumn. (2) In order to balance the budget for the 36th year, the municipal construction donation will still be compiled according to the reduced standard.

Regarding the first point, whether the winter should be levied according to the autumn reduction, it was passed after discussion by the general assembly. The second point, whether to continue to levy in the 36th year, aroused heated discussion in the general assembly. Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, who supported continuing, believed that the citizens had complaints about the collection of municipal construction donations because they wanted to double it in the winter. Now the municipal government has changed the original method, reducing the total amount of 9 billion to 6 billion. The councilors should discuss calmly and take both into account. In order to revive the construction of Shanghai, reasonable taxation should be levied, and unreasonable ones should never be agreed to. Therefore, he advocated continuing to levy municipal construction donations. Councilors Shao Yongsheng, Lu Yinchu, etc. also expressed the need to continue to levy.

However, Councilors Lu Shidao, Xu Ze, Zhou Lianze, Jiang Hao and others believed that the last general assembly had passed the municipal construction donation until the end of the 35th year, and it would not be continued this year. If it is still levied, it will not only overturn the resolution of the general assembly, but also lose credibility with the citizens. At the same time, the people bear too much burden, so they do not advocate re-levying.

Some councilors also stated that the name of the municipal construction donation is inappropriate, and other names may be adopted for levy. Councilor Tao Baichuan suggested submitting it to the Budget and Finance Review Committee for review first, and then discussing it. If other income can be balanced, it can be completely cancelled, otherwise it will be decided again.

Mayor Wu agreed with Councilor Tao's opinion and explained: (1) Reducing personnel and simplifying administration. The municipal government currently has more than 40,000 people, and plans to add more than 10,000 people this year. If the general assembly believes that it must be reduced, it can discuss and instruct. (2) If the municipal construction donation is absolutely not levied, it may be compensated by disguised methods, because the municipal government's basic work must be maintained. All parties criticize it, and the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government will also be jointly responsible. Finally, it is recommended that this case be submitted to the committee for review, and the municipal government's budget should be reduced as much as possible. If it is still not balanced, please discuss it and use a method similar to construction donations to compensate. The general assembly could not conclude on this case yesterday afternoon. The Finance Committee reviewed it last night. Although the discussion was long, it was difficult to decide. As a result, the review opinion was passed: "The Budget and Final Accounts Group has difficulty reviewing the budget for the 36th year. Whether the municipal construction donation item for this year should continue to be levied seems to wait until the budget revenue and expenditure are determined, and then discuss it again when necessary."

Sobbing and Kneeling with Incense: Yangzhou Road Vendors Petition, Mayor Wu Personally Received and Temporarily Allowed to Set Up Until the End of the Lunar Year

[Our Report] Since the Municipal Council opened, citizen groups, especially hawker groups, have traveled far every day to petition the general assembly, often three or four times a day. At 2:30 pm yesterday, fifty or sixty men, women, old and young vegetable vendors from the Yangzhou Road area lined up to petition the Municipal Council, and sent representatives Wang Jinyun, Zhou Jun, Hua Shan Jin, Shi Xianlong and other four people to hold official documents to state the reasons. Speaker Pan assigned Councilors Yan E'sheng and Zhao Junhao to receive them. According to the representatives, they have been setting up vegetable stalls on the roadside in the Yangzhou Road area, barely making a living. There have been no problems since July of last year, and each person has registered with the Yulin Road Police Station and been given a registration certificate, and has obtained legal status. Unexpectedly, on the 19th of last month, a large number of police officers came to drive them away and refused to allow them to set up again, and firmly ordered them to move to set up stalls on remote roadsides. The vegetable vendors are small businesses, and all the capital is borrowed from high-interest loans. It is now the end of the year, and they urgently need to continue to do business to maintain their livelihoods. If they are not allowed to, they will not be able to survive the year. After saying this, they looked sad and pitiful. Councilors Yan and Zhao comforted them, and after negotiation, it was agreed that from today (the 12th) until the end of the lunar New Year's Eve, the council will send a letter to the police station to allow the vegetable vendors to operate in their original places on Yangzhou Road, and the police officers shall not ban them. After the expiration date, they must follow the police station's designated area to set up stalls. The representatives expressed their satisfaction and withdrew, but the other dozens of vegetable vendors still felt apprehensive and continued to wait outside. At 5:30 pm, the general assembly adjourned, and the vegetable vendors all held flags in one hand and incense in the other, kneeling in a line on the parking road outside, blocking the councilors' vehicles. Some of the elderly and children cried bitterly and looked very miserable, and shouted: "Save us, otherwise we will set up stalls tomorrow! We will be arrested by the police again, save us! Save us!" Mayor Wu personally received them and promised to allow them to set up stalls until the end of the lunar New Year. However, the vegetable vendors were still afraid that even though the mayor had agreed, the management authorities would still not give them leniency, so they insisted on not withdrawing and knelt down for a long time, blocking all the vehicles that were preparing to leave. After the councilors repeatedly persuaded them and guaranteed that they could work smoothly, they withdrew.

Shanghai Miss Marries: Wu Zhihui Officiates, More Than a Thousand Guests Attend

[Our Report] The wedding of Miss Xie Jiahua of Shanghai and Rong Meishen was held at 4:30 pm yesterday on the 11th floor of the Cathay Hotel on Pushi Road. More than 1,500 men and women guests and spectators attended, and Pushi Road was extremely crowded. The wedding hall was decorated extremely luxuriously. Amidst the melodious music, the newlyweds slowly moved forward, and the bride looked back frequently with a smile on her face. Wu Zhihui, a veteran of the Party-state, who was the officiant, was humorous and witty. He spoke and laughed in front of the loudspeaker. He hoped that the newlyweds would have a happy marriage for a hundred years and have five sons pass the imperial examination. The "five subjects" refer to three boys and two girls in the fields of law, science, engineering, literature, and medicine in universities, not the "five subjects passing the imperial examination" during the Anti-Japanese War and the takeover. Introducers Wang Xiaoquan and Wang Xianqing delivered speeches successively. At yesterday's wedding, Deng Zhonghe, Xie Jiahua's foster father, represented the host. (The picture shows the newlyweds taken by our newspaper.)

Telegram to the Chairman in Support of the Constitution

Yesterday, the Municipal Council passed a resolution at the general assembly to send a telegram to the whole country in support of the Constitution, and also sent a telegram to the National Government Chairman Chiang to express their support. The original telegram is recorded as follows:

To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: At the fourth meeting of the second general assembly of this council, Councilor Zhou Lianze, Councilor Gao Shu'an, and twenty-two others proposed an urgent motion to send a telegram to the whole country in support of the Constitution. After deliberation, it was unanimously passed and recorded in the minutes. The Constitution is the fundamental law of the country. This National Assembly gathered opinions from all parties and factions in the country and social elites, lasted for forty-one days, and finally produced a democratic constitution that had never been seen before and was unanimously sought by the country. It was promulgated on New Year's Day this year. Looking at its content, it is not only closely suited to the national conditions, but also conforms to the world trend. The masterpiece is magnificent and shines brightly. From then on, the foundation of our country's democratic constitutional government has been laid for generations to come. All citizens are celebrating with joy. This council represents the five million people of the city and respectfully expresses its sincerity and fervent support. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we hereby submit this case by telegram and respectfully ask for your consideration. Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing respectfully kowtow (seal).

Two More Petitions

The Chinese and Western wine and food and coffee industry again petitioned the general assembly yesterday regarding the feast donation. They still insisted on three points: (1) The starting point for taxation should be set at 10,000 yuan; (2) They opposed tiered collection; (3) The music equipment in the restaurants is not for commercial purposes and opposed collecting a 25% entertainment tax.

In addition, the Municipal Experimental Public School and one hundred other municipal public schools also sent representatives to the meeting yesterday to request that the current status of the Experimental Public School be maintained.

Municipal Financial Revenue and Expenditure Last Month

The city's financial revenue and expenditure for December has been completed by the Finance Bureau and was announced yesterday. The revenue, including tax revenue and other parts, totaled 20,556,752,821.61 yuan, and the expenditure totaled 17,713,552,937.50 yuan. Among them, municipal construction donations and entertainment tax accounted for the largest proportion of the revenue, followed by the feast tax. Economic construction, education, culture and health accounted for the largest proportion of the expenditure, and administrative expenses accounted for only 3.36%.

Business Tax in Principle Lowered, Land Tax May Increase

[Our Report] The income from the business tax in this city this year was originally listed as 28 billion in the budget submitted by the municipal government to the council. A few days ago, the Budget and Final Accounts Committee of the council initially reviewed it. In order to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure, it was believed that the business tax could still be doubled to a total of 56 billion. When the Budget and Final Accounts Committee continued to review it last night, Xu Jiqing, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was also present. It was believed that at this time of industrial and commercial decline, such an amount might not be affordable. As a result, it was proposed to increase it by 50%, which is 14 billion. In this way, the budgeted revenue from the business tax in this city this year could be 42 billion. However, this is only a principle and has not been finalized.

In addition, the Budget and Final Accounts Committee could not add more to the revenue side, and it was difficult to reduce the expenditure side, so it felt very difficult to review the general revenue and expenditure budget for this year. The budgeted revenue from land tax this year is 7.2 billion, which can still be increased. Therefore, it was proposed last night to add 25%, which is 1.8 billion. In this way, the total land tax revenue in the budget for this year should be 9 billion.

Many Thieves During the Lunar New Year: Huangpu Bureau Intensifies Winter Defense

[Our Report] Since the new Huangpu Branch Director Zhang Renyou took over the Huangpu Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, he has actively assigned officers to take turns to supervise the deployment of police force and consolidate winter defense, so that thieves will not dare to appear. In view of the fact that the lunar New Year is approaching and the collection and delivery of various industries are frequent, in order to awaken the financial industry and citizens to pay close attention, he has sent separate letters to the Silver Coin Industry Association to cooperate in prevention and hopes that the police and the people can cooperate to jointly protect public security.

Special Treatment for Civil Servants in This City Will Be Issued According to New Standards

[Our Report] The central government's order to adjust the treatment of civil servants has not yet arrived at the municipal government. Since the lunar New Year is approaching, Mayor Wu has decided that the special treatment of civil servants in this city will be issued in accordance with the new standards from this month. The funds for January for the various organs under the municipal government have been fully raised by the Finance Bureau and will be collected from the Municipal Treasury Section of the Finance Bureau by the various organs after the 15th of this month. The half-month of January's funds that were borrowed by the various organs at the end of December will not be deducted this time, and will be deducted from the supplementary issuance of the increased funds for adjusting the treatment in December.

Supply of Materials: Jiang Reports and Answers Questions: If There Is Any Corruption, He Says He Can Be Shot, Expressing That He Will Never Hang a Sheep's Head and Sell Dog Meat

[Our Report] Director Jiang of the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan attended the meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday morning at the request of the council to report on the establishment and tasks of the Supply Bureau and to answer questions from the councilors. Director Jiang stated specifically before the report: He is reporting to the representatives of the elders, brothers and sisters of this city as a Shanghai person.

The Materials Supply Bureau is directly under the Materials Supply Committee of the Executive Yuan. Its main task is to clear and handle matters under foreign loans, including: (1) The allocation and distribution of various US loans in the country. (2) The management of Canadian loans. (3) The handling of unfinished British loans. (4) The handling of surplus materials from the US military's concession escape case. This work is the most arduous, including (1) materials that have been cleared before the armistice, (2) materials that have been shipped after the armistice, and (3) materials that are being manufactured in factories after the armistice and must be moved to our country. The most valuable is the surplus material.

The main purposes of supplying surplus materials are: (1) to absorb legal currency, and (2) to control materials with materials. The principle is not to cause any loss to the people, but also not to allow government agencies to be accused of "profiteering." Deciding to give merchants the opportunity to work for the government, not to be in an antagonistic position with merchants. Director Jiang stated that he also holds a national defense post. The Supply Bureau is a new agency without past experience in handling affairs, but he is determined to handle nationwide business based on the principle of "making money for the government and not harming anyone." The accounts and finances are absolutely open, and the councilors are welcome to supervise the resident, and it is absolutely not allowed for civil servants to "hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat."

Answering Questions: Jeep - First Time Saying Shot

Then the councilors raised questions: Lu Yinchu asked: (1) The Supply Bureau has distributed more than 300 Jeeps. It is understandable to distribute them to agencies and groups, but how are the more than 20 distributed to merchants? What qualifications do you need to get one? (2) Why was the sale of Dodge cars stopped? Chen Boliang asked: Why are the prices of the vehicles sold more expensive than new cars on the market?

Xia asked: Why can Jeeps be sold to Xiang Sheng Company?

Director Jiang answered: (1) The order of distribution of Jeeps is to prioritize government restoration agencies, followed by state-owned enterprises in this city, and then doctors and cultural circles. No private individuals have been allocated any, and the director solemnly stated: "If any of my relatives and friends get a car, the council can shoot me." As for the vehicles of Xiang Sheng Company, they were sold by the National Congress Preparatory Office, and the bureau had nothing to do with it. (Director Jiang also showed the official document for the sale of vehicles to the Preparatory Office as proof). (2) There are several reasons for stopping the sale of Dodge trucks: First, they are not assembled. Second, there are very few vehicles. Once the government needs vehicles, there will be nothing to supply. Third, there are many difficulties in setting prices. It was originally stipulated that they could not be resold. Lowering the price would easily create a black market, so we tried to raise the price so that buyers could not profit from it.

Shao Yongsheng asked: Why can't the consumer cooperatives in this city get the materials from the Supply Bureau? Answer: Consumer cooperatives are not unable to get materials. Municipal consumer cooperatives, etc., have all been allocated materials, but it is not possible for some cooperatives to want materials but not pay for them. If you buy with cash, you can definitely get special treatment.

Every Penny Belongs to the National Treasury: The Director Has No Appetite

Wang Yansong asked: What is the Supply Bureau's operating policy? Gao Shu'an asked: What is the exact number of materials received so far?

Answer: (1) Every penny of the Supply Bureau's revenue belongs to the national treasury. "My director has no appetite at all." For example, the cost of a Jeep is US$300, the repair cost is US$300, and the selling price is US$1,600, so you can earn US$1,000. The bureau's profit is for the government on the one hand and to protect merchants on the other. In fact, it is also making money for the councilors and for the four million citizens of the city, reducing the burden. The operating principle is "not to dump and not to harm merchants." (2) The received materials come from the US military's surplus materials clearing committee, and the work of receiving the surplus materials of the US military in more than ten places, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Kunming, Chongqing, and Shenyang, has been completed as of October 1 last year. The total quantity, including the materials from Okinawa, is worth US$100 million.

Talking About Contractors - Asking to Be Shot Again

Gao Shu'an also asked: How much material has been allocated to various agencies and groups? Why entrust a business to sell it, which not only fails to suppress prices but also creates a black market?

Answer: The Supply Bureau entrusted a business to sell it after detailed and strict review, and the management is also trying its best to be good. Previously, a business was about to be approved, but the owner came to "lobby" first, saying that he was willing to supply 30% of the profits. I immediately cancelled the approval of this business. "If you find out that any family is related to Jiang, you can also shoot me." The bureau hopes to receive 300 billion to 500 billion yuan this year, but we still need everyone's help. "Civil servants are always scolded. Whether they raise or lower the price of things, they will be scolded. Moderation is an abstract term. Anyway, they will be scolded the same way. I would rather raise the price and be scolded, because I can make money and be worthy of the country, and I can be worthy of the councilors."

Why Is the Time Too Short - The Director Gets Through the Difficulties

Chen Boliang asked again: (1) Why aren't the materials from the Supply Bureau shipped here as soon as possible? (2) Maybe there are difficulties for those that haven't arrived, but why are those that have been shipped from Okinawa and other places left in the warehouse to rot without being sold? (3) It costs rent to put them in the warehouse, which fundamentally violates the principle of increasing income for the government. Yang Fusheng asked: On the one hand, the government is setting up a Temporary Import Management Committee, and on the other hand, it is shipping in a large number of useless surplus materials and dumping them to the people. What is the policy? What benefits do more than a foot-long leather shoes and large clothes from the United States have for the people?

Xia asked: (1) How are the landing craft allocated? (2) Very few public and teaching staff receive military blankets, and the municipal government and the Supply Bureau are shirking responsibility. What does this mean?

Unfortunately, because the time of the general assembly was limited, Director Jiang could not answer all of them orally. The Secretariat of the General Assembly has also received many written questions, which will be sent to Director Jiang for written answers.

Egyptian Envoy to China, Esmail, Arrives in Shanghai

The first Egyptian envoy to China, Esmail, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm on the Dutch ship Zhizha.

He has served as the Egyptian envoy to various European countries.

Motor Vehicle Changing Photos: Public Works Bureau Specifies Dates

[Our Report] The Public Works Bureau has set the date for changing photos of motor vehicles in this city this year, starting yesterday. There are 20,120 motor vehicles in this city, of which privately owned cars account for the largest number, with a total of 7,498 vehicles. Privately owned freight trucks, military trucks, and commercial freight trucks are the next largest, each accounting for more than 2,000 vehicles.

The Public Works Bureau has now stipulated the following dates for changing photos of various vehicles: privately owned cars from the 11th to the 21st of this month, and bicycles from the 22nd to the 28th. Privately owned freight trucks from the 29th to February 4th, rental cars from February 5th to 7th, and commercial freight trucks from February 8th to 24th. The photo changing location is at the Fourth Division of the Public Works Bureau, 139 Hankou Road. In addition to the license fee remaining the same, a photo changing fee of 4,500 yuan and a handling fee of 500 yuan must be paid. All vehicles that are changed after the deadline will be fined, and the amount of the fine will be in accordance with the regulations of the Finance Bureau. For every ten days overdue, the total amount must be increased by one-tenth. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau hopes that car owners will go to change photos on time to avoid being fined.

Black Hat Fraud Singles: Re-examination of Old Cases During the Enemy and Puppet Period

At 6:00 am on May 21, 1945, a single transporter, Li Shoufu, and a friend carried many bottles of beer and wanted to go to Hangzhou for sale. At the entrance of the railway station, Xu Shunfu, a "black hat," used an excuse to keep him, defrauding him of 2,000 yuan of puppet coupons. When he arrived at the ticket office, Liu Hujun defrauded him of 4,500 yuan. At 9:00 am on the same day, Xu Shunfu finished work and walked to the Tianmu Road intersection outside the station. Li Shoufu saw him and stepped forward to argue. The police chief Yao Quanlin, who was on duty, stepped forward to intervene and was injured by the "black hat" accomplices Chen Zhenxi, Yan Bohu, Lu Changmiao, Chen Kuikui, Dai Wenlu, Jiang Yingqi, Qiu Huiyun, etc., who came to help. They were all detained and sent to the puppet prosecutor's office for prosecution and have not yet been executed. After the victory, the court took over and re-investigated the defendant's offenses. The prosecutor Yang Shoucheng has completed the investigation and prosecuted the defendants Xu Shunfu and Liu Hujun for the crime of violating Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and Yan Bohu, Chen Zhenxi, Lu Changmiao, etc. for the crime of Article 277, Paragraph 1 and 354 of the same law. The court heard the case in the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Zhao. Only five defendants, including Yan Bohu, surrendered, and the other four were hiding. They also hired lawyer Fang Gang to defend them and said that the other defendants had left Shanghai due to an incident and requested another adjournment for interrogation. The court approved the adjournment and ordered the defendants to appear in court in person for the next hearing.

Zhangjiakou Gathering: Han and Mongols as One Family Reporter Yu Zhen of This Newspaper
Cold Unites People; Hardship Brings People Together

December 29th was a night most worthy of remembrance in Zhangjiakou.

That day, Zhangjiakou was quite cold, with the temperature at twelve or thirteen degrees below zero. Even in the Zhongshan Hall, which was equipped with heating, it was three or four degrees below zero. However, the two to three thousand people who attended the welcoming of the Mongol Banner representatives were all warmed by a kind of "brotherly love" and felt no cold at all. There is a Western saying: "Cold unites people; hardship brings people together!" After many internal and external tests, the Mongol and Han brothers have once again stood together. The brothers who have been separated for a long time are holding hands tightly, and between them, there is only one common belief and one shared will: Unite and work hard to create a new China!

Those who avidly read history should remember that the Mongols and Hans were originally one family. Sima Qian's "Historical Records" once stated that these two ethnic groups are two branches that split from the same old branch. In the Yellow Emperor era, the residences of our brothers were only separated by a mountain. In recent decades, due to the malicious instigation of some people, some conflicts have occurred between siblings. But now, everything has been dispelled. The 22 Mongol Banner representatives who came to Zhangjiakou this time came to Zhangjiakou under the inspiration of this fraternal affection.

First of all, the reporter would like to give readers a brief introduction to the situation of the Mongol compatriots in Chahar Province. Chahar Province can be mainly divided into two parts: the Silingol League, which is adjacent to Outer Mongolia in the north, including the Right and Left Wings of the East Ujumqin Banner, the Right and Left Wings of the Khalkha Banner, the Right and Left Wings of the Abaga Banner, the Right and Left Wings of the Abahana Banner, and the Right and Left Wings of the Sonid Banner. Among these ten banners, there are about 50,000 Mongol compatriots and 5,000 Han compatriots.

The southern part of Chahar Province is the Chahar Department, which is composed of the Shangdu Pasture Group, the Cattle and Sheep Group, the Left Wing Collection Group, the Right Wing Pasture Group, the Zhenglan, Xiangbai, Zhengbai, and Xianghuang four banners of the Left Wing of Chahar, the Zhenghuang, Zhengong, Xianghong, and Xianglan four banners of the Right Wing of Chahar, and the Lama Affairs Bureau. Among them, there are about 20,000 Mongol compatriots and about 620,000 Han compatriots.

There is a big difference in the population ratio between Mongol and Han compatriots, but after thousands of years of coexistence, the two ethnic groups have actually formed a mixed living state. The mutual assistance and interdependence in economic aspects make it even more difficult to separate.

Returning to the Embrace of Family

The 22 Mongol Banner representatives who arrived in Zhangjiakou this time represent one banner in the Silingol League and seven banners in the Chahar Department. After passing through places like Baochang, they arrived on December 22nd, becoming the first group of Mongol Banner representatives to arrive in the provincial capital after the liberation of Chahar Province.

Leading them is Selengnamjil, the Deputy League Leader of the Chahar League. This old man in his sixties was originally under house arrest in the Xiangbai Banner of the Silingol League, and he rode out on horseback on the evening of November 8th of the old lunar calendar. He first went to Baochang, and later sent someone to invite the representatives and general managers of the nine banners to Baochang for a meeting. Except for the representatives of two banners who did not come due to strict control, the representatives and general managers of the remaining seven banners all came together.

In the symposium on Mongol Banner issues and the interview with Selengnamjil, the Mongol Banner representatives gave a very detailed report on the situation under the rule of the Japanese invaders and afterwards. They solemnly pointed out that the Mongol compatriots never forgot their motherland under the rule of the enemy. They also reported that the Chahar League was occupied early during the Anti-Japanese War, so the suffering was the deepest. During the Japanese occupation, companies such as Dairen, Zhongfang, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi were organized to monopolize the Mongol Banner economy and control imported materials. The Mongol compatriots were quite aware of this economic exploitation and organized Mongol Industrial Cooperative (meaning cooperative) to resist, which had some effect. The land policy of the Japanese in Chahar was to divide the banner boundaries, and all unowned cultivated land was designated as pasture to create disputes between Mongols and Hans.

In terms of culture, the Japanese also tried their best to undermine the relationship between Mongols and Hans. All elementary schools had language classes, and Mongol Banner students were selected to study in Japan, but the result was only to make the youth gain a deeper understanding of the truth about the Japanese invaders. At the same time, under the firm resistance of the Mongols, the elementary schools set up by each banner did not teach Japanese.

In August of the year before last, when the news of victory came, the Mongol compatriots were all overjoyed, hoping that the national army could liberate Chahar Province as soon as possible. But what came was the Soviet army and the Outer Mongolian army. The vanguard of these troops once reached Zhangjiakou. League Leader Choitbazarab of the Chahar League was taken to Kulun, Outer Mongolia by the Soviet army by plane at this time. Afterwards, the communist army followed, and all hopes were shattered. Life was still as difficult as before. It was not until the national army recovered Zhangjiakou that this group of representatives ventured to Zhangjiakou.

At the welcome dinner for the Mongol Banner representatives from all walks of life in Zhangjiakou, Damilinzabu, the head of the Right Wing Pasture of Taibus Banner, enthusiastically expressed the thoughts in the hearts of the Mongol Banner representatives. He said: "Thank you for not abandoning us and coming here to welcome your Mongol compatriots in such cold weather, which makes us extremely grateful. Our 22 Mongol Banner representatives came to Zhangjiakou from beyond the Great Wall after a long journey. We have experienced cold and danger along the way, but we finally came here, which is enough to comfort you all. The reason why we did this is to gather with you and shake hands with you tightly. There will be many places where we will need your help in the future, and we hope you will not hesitate to give us your advice!"

Reaching Out a Warm Hand

The entire Zhangjiakou expressed their condolences to this group of returning brothers. The condolence letter earnestly stated: "Our Mongol Banner representatives have come from afar to inquire and painfully recount their separation, cherishing the lesson of a single arrow being easily broken and vowing to unite in resisting aggression, joining hands in solidarity, helping each other, so that our nation can be forever stable and our descendants can be forever blessed." At another press conference, Chuan also stated: "The central government adheres to its policy of protecting and supporting ethnic minorities and is willing to use the most appropriate methods to ensure that everyone shares the benefits equally."

At the welcome dinner that day, Hu Ziheng, the director of education of Chahar Province, represented the people of Zhangjiakou and all Han compatriots to express his greatest condolences to the arrival of Selengnamjil and others. This director, who had lived with Mongol compatriots since childhood, said in a very sincere tone: "During the nine years of the Anti-Japanese War, our contact was severed. Since the victory, those who were outside have returned one after another, but we have not seen our Mongol brothers. Everyone was eagerly looking forward to it. Today, we can reunite here, which is truly an infinite comfort."

Hu especially pointed out the close relationship between the Mongol and Han ethnic groups. He said: "For two or three hundred years, the Mongol and Han people in Chahar Province have lived together harmoniously. Pastures have become farmland, and farmland has also become pastures. We get along very well with each other, whether in the Silingol League in the north or the Chahar Department in the south, just like one family. At the same time, in life, the two ethnic groups have also built an inseparable interdependent relationship. In addition to animal husbandry, Mongol compatriots also engage in farming, and Han compatriots also engage in animal husbandry. Mongol compatriots supply animal husbandry products to Han compatriots, and Han compatriots also provide various agricultural products to Mongol compatriots. We exchange what we have and what we don't have, and the relationship is very close."

Hu, on behalf of the provincial government, expressed condolences to the Mongol compatriots for the suffering they suffered during the Japanese occupation and for the fact that the local order has not yet been fully restored, so the Mongol compatriots continue to suffer. Finally, Hu put forward several hopes, pointing out that since Outer Mongolia separated from the motherland, Inner Mongolia has been standing on the front line of national defense. In order to consolidate national defense, education, politics, and economy must be built up. He hoped that everyone could unite sincerely and not be alienated by others.

Opening Up a Broad Avenue of Cooperation

After Hu finished speaking, Selengnamjil, the Deputy League Leader of the Chahar League, responded. Selengnamjil is about sixty years old, wearing a long gown and a mandarin jacket. From the outside, it is difficult to see any difference from Han compatriots. Before he even opened his mouth, the entire venue burst into warm applause.

Selengnamjil first expressed his deep pleasure in being able to gather with Han compatriots. Afterwards, he put forward four demands from the Mongol compatriots: (1) The Mongol Banners have experienced war and disaster, and the state of hardship is unprecedented. He hoped that the government would provide relief as soon as possible. (2) He hoped that the government would assist the League Banners in establishing local self-defense forces and expand and supplement the original self-defense forces and institutions. (3) He hoped that the national army would quickly clear out the remaining bandits and stabilize the local area. (4) The League Banners were flooded with "Mongolian Frontier Currency" and "Puppet Currency," which had a great impact on finance. He hoped that the government would quickly allocate legal tender for circulation and provide a considerable amount of loans. When Selengnamjil and others met with Chief Chuan, they raised these four points in person. Chief Chuan generously agreed, and Selengnamjil believed that this was: "The beginning of everyone's common happiness." And it opened up a bright road for the Mongol compatriots.

The next speaker was Damilinzabu, the head of the Right Wing Pasture of Taibus Banner. The four words "pasture head" translated into plain language mean "leader of the cattle and sheep herds." Looking at this title, it is not difficult to imagine him riding a steed across the desert. On this day, he was wearing Mongolian clothing, with his sleeves rolled up, a belt tied around his waist, and short boots on his feet, giving people an impression of boldness. And his skill in using words also won a lot of applause.

He began by saying, "Your Mongol compatriots are able to gather with you all today, and we have infinite feelings and infinite joy in our hearts." Then he gave a detailed report on the various sufferings that the Mongol compatriots had suffered in the past, and now they are on the verge of death. What is comforting is that all these hardships have not affected the Mongol compatriots' love for their motherland in the slightest. On the contrary, everything in reality has strengthened the Mongol compatriots' respect and love for their motherland. He said: "Today's Inner Mongolia is standing on the front line of China's northern border. The Mongol compatriots will definitely be able to fulfill the expectations of Director Hu and all Han compatriots. We hope that the Mongol and Han ethnic groups can work together to strive for future undertakings!"

Every word and every sentence he spoke represented the voice of the 600,000 Mongol compatriots in Chahar Province, so it is no wonder that he won so much applause. This call from beyond the Great Wall has already aroused widespread resonance inside and outside the Great Wall. Under this appeal, the Mongol and Han ethnic groups will unite more closely in the future and jointly build a psychological defense line in the northern border.

Relief and Rehabilitation Work

Relief work is as urgent as education. After the war in Zhangjiakou, the people are even more impoverished. Some villagers in the suburbs have only one cotton quilt for the whole family or four or five people sharing one pair of pants. The need for relief is even greater after entering winter.

The relief work in Zhangjiakou is being carried out in coordination by the government and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). On the government side, the Ministry of Social Affairs has allocated 1 billion yuan for disaster relief, and part of it has been received. The Pacification Area Emergency Relief Task Force has also sent personnel to inspect and guide. The Provincial Social Affairs Office convened a winter relief meeting on December 29th, which decided: (1) The elderly, widowed, orphaned, and disabled people who need relief in the negative aspect will continue to be taken in by the original relief agencies. (3) Small factories will be established to enable refugees to participate in practical production work. In addition, the authorities have also formulated many loan methods to assist spring plowing.

The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's relief work in Zhangjiakou: less than a week after the recovery, the staff took the opportunity to allocate 40 million yuan to Zhangjiakou for distribution, and the amount of money distributed to the refugees exceeded 10 million yuan. On November 1st, the UNRRA office was officially established in Zhangjiakou, and the Fourth Working Team also moved in in early December. Its work can be divided into emergency relief and work relief. In terms of emergency relief, the targets are displaced victims, unemployed workers, and impoverished elementary school teachers. The materials distributed in Chahar Province included 3,700 packages of old clothes and 1,200 tons of flour. After entering winter, relief factories were set up in Zhangjiakou and other places. In terms of work relief, there are four major plans. In addition, social welfare work is also being carried out, and the center is also located in Zhangjiakou.

When the reporters were in Zhangjiakou, they took the time to visit the UNRRA working team. Although it was Sunday, some staff were still working in the office. According to the deputy captain of the team, Zhu, "Life is hard, and our work here is quite hard. There is no talk of entertainment at all!" When he saw us off, Deputy Captain Zhu, who had lived in Beijing and Tianjin before, was very reluctant to part. Now he is living a dull life, and it can almost be said that he has completely dedicated his personal pleasure to the victims. The relief work and even the rehabilitation work in Zhangjiakou are entirely supported by these ascetics with the "martyr" spirit. The reporter would like to express his greatest respect to all the friends who are suffering in the frontier for the sake of the people in the warm Jiangnan! (Postscript on January 5th in the capital) Construction of the Yong'an Dam in Jiangxi (Photo by Liu Zao, reporter of this newspaper) The Restoration of Various Leagues and Banners in Inner Mongolia Before and After Ma Hetian

The vast majority of China's northern border was divided into Inner and Outer Mongolia during the late Qing Dynasty. Since the Republic of China, the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia have been successively incorporated into various provinces, but due to many accidents in the central government, the provinces in charge failed to pay special attention, making it impossible to achieve average development and active improvement. As a result, everything mostly remained the same. Moreover, because Japanese imperialism wanted to annex the entire China by annexing "Manchuria and Mongolia," the Inner Mongolia issue became an important issue on the border. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese invaders used the beautiful names of "Mongols ruling Mongols" and "Mongolian autonomy" to collude with our Mongol compatriots and spare no effort to entice and divide them. However, the people of our Inner Mongolia ultimately did not fall for their divisive tricks and returned to the embrace of the central government with victory. However, since the independence of Outer Mongolia, the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy has become increasingly urgent in the past year and has recently become a major issue of concern to the Chinese people. The following describes Inner Mongolia in the past year for the reference of those who care about the border.

"Mongols Ruling Mongols"

The Mongol banners in the northeastern provinces and Rehe include the Jirem League, Zosutu League, Zao Uda League, and Hulunbuir Department. With the fall of the four northeastern provinces, they were incorporated into the puppet Manchuria. The Japanese invaders, using the beautiful name of "Mongols ruling Mongols," established the puppet Hing'an Province and divided the Mongol banners into the four Hing'an East, West, South, and North provinces and the Rehe Mongolian region. In fact, it was entirely for the convenience of the Japanese to rule. The original leagues and jasaks of each banner were abolished and replaced with the banner chief system. Each provincial government had a Japanese participating official, and each banner government had a Japanese counselor who took charge of everything. The name was "Mongols ruling Mongols," but in reality, it was Japanese rule.

The Mongol banners in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan include the Silingol League, Ulanqab League, Yekhejuu League, and Chahar Department. After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese invaders established the puppet Mongolian Autonomous Government under the beautiful name of Mongolian autonomy and later changed it to the puppet Mongolian Autonomous State. It was divided into the Silingol, Chahar, Ulanqab, Yekhejuu, and Bayantala (the four banners in eastern Suiyuan and the Tümed Banner) leagues. In name it was autonomy, but in fact the autonomous government had a Japanese supreme advisor, each league government had a Japanese participating official, each banner government had a Japanese counselor, and each department had a Japanese vice minister. Large and small agencies were controlled by the Japanese, with only the heads of each agency being Mongols, and they were all puppets.

A part of the Ulanqab League and the entire Yekhejuu League in Suiyuan never fell into enemy hands. Regarding autonomy, there was the Suiyuan Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee. All members were completely Mongol banner leaders, and other staff were also mostly Mongol banner people. The banner governments also remained completely as before, with Mongol princes and officials in charge.

Before and After Recovery

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the surrender of the Japanese, the puppet Manchuria and the puppet Mongolian Autonomous State were destroyed accordingly. At that time, the Soviet army and the Outer Mongolian army had arrived in Northeast China and Zhangjiakou. In Wangye Temple in Northeast China and Silingol League in Chahar, there were once organizations such as the East Mongolian Autonomous Republic, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Republic, and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government. Although there was a lot of noise and brewing, they were not formally formed.

After the communist army occupied Northeast China, Rehe, and Chahar, it became the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Committee. The right-wing subcommittees of each league were completely presided over by the Communist Party, but in fact their power only extended to Chahar and a part of Northeast China.

Therefore, although the Anti-Japanese War was won in 1945, the recovery of the Mongol banners in Northeast China, Rehe, and eastern Suiyuan was entirely in 1946, and even later, only recently was it reported that they had been recovered, or they have not yet been officially recovered.

Mongol Banners in Various Provinces

Regarding Inner Mongolia in the past year, in terms of the Mongol banners in Northeast China and Rehe: they have now been recovered one after another. The Northeast Headquarters has established the Northeast Mongol Banner Restoration Committee to handle restoration matters. However, it is not easy to fully restore the situation at once after the ten-year rule and destruction of the enemy. Moreover, the communist army has not yet fully withdrawn.

Regarding the Mongol banners in Chahar: after the communist army withdrew from Zhangjiakou, Yun led a part of the Mongol banner youth. In Beizi Temple in Silingol League, a small number of Communist Party-related Mongolian troops are still based in various banners of Silingol League and Chahar Department. They are currently being restored one after another.

Regarding the Mongol banners in Suiyuan: except for a part that never fell into enemy hands, the banners of the Ulanqab League were recovered long ago, and the four banners in eastern Suiyuan were also recovered two months ago. As for the Mongol banners in Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, there have been no changes since the Anti-Japanese War, so I will not repeat them here.

As mentioned above, in terms of restoration, most of the leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia have been restored in 1946. However, the Inner Mongolia issue has not been resolved, and in this year, the autonomy issue has become even more noisy. Inner Mongolian autonomy is indeed the demand of the general public in the Mongol banners and is also the established policy of the central government, which should be realized as soon as possible. However, how to achieve true autonomy, not the false autonomy during the puppet Manchuria and Mongolia periods, and how to achieve united autonomy, not the divisive autonomy during the puppet Manchuria and Mongolia periods, should be carefully studied in terms of system and methods to ensure that Mongolian autonomy and national unification can achieve satisfactory progress together.

The Wuning South Gate Pontoon Bridge Assisted by the Eighth Working Team (Photo by Liu Zao, reporter of this newspaper) A Record of the Blocking of the Huayuankou Breach Quick Dispatch from Wei Li in Huayuankou on January 1st

The blocking of the Huayuankou breach is related to the fate of the country and is attracting attention at home and abroad. Since the beginning of this project, the author has been fortunate enough to participate in it. Now, I will briefly describe the entire construction process to inform readers.

Current Situation of the Breach

Huayuankou is located on the south bank of the Yellow River in Zheng County. It breached in June 1938. The river water, with the momentum of a waterfall, diverted the Huai River and connected the Grand Canal, flooding thousands of miles. The eastern Henan and western Anhui and Jiangsu provinces suffered unprecedented disasters. In addition, after eight years, the old course was silted up, and the entire river diverted. The water system in the Central Plains was completely disrupted, and the topography of North China changed accordingly. According to the actual measurement results in February of this year, the net width of the breach is 1,478 meters, and the flow direction has changed from east to south. Due to the centrifugal force, a silt beach has formed near the west bank, and the water depth near the east bank reaches 10 meters. The highest flood level before the breach was 94 meters (calculated from the Dagukou sea level), and the highest flood level after the breach was 91.7 meters.

Blocking Plan

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Yellow River flooded area was actually the front line of national defense. The enemy and we confronted each other near the breach, and the blocking project was difficult to start. However, this project has long been in the minds of our government. In 1943, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission repeatedly received telegram orders from the National Water Conservancy Commission to compile a blocking construction plan and list it as the primary project in the postwar water conservancy plan. Pan Yifen, a senior engineer of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, prepared a blocking project implementation plan and submitted it to the National Water Conservancy Commission for approval and record. In 1946, the enemy surrendered. In the autumn of that year, Pan was again summoned by telegram from the National Water Conservancy Commission to Chongqing to participate in the blocking project model test at the Hydraulic Engineering Experiment Institute. The blocking method was thus determined. The principles of the plan are as follows:

The old blocking methods all used the transverse blocking method, that is, straw or willow branches were used to advance from the two banks of the breach towards each other, making the breach narrower and narrower. When the straw stacks on the two banks were connected to each other, the closure was completed. This method was quite dangerous because the narrower the breach, the greater the flow rate and the deeper the scouring. Before the closure, the water levels above and below the breach differed greatly. The flow was turbulent, like a waterfall, and the scouring depth was often more than 20 meters, or even more than 30 meters. Failures were common. This plan adopts the flat blocking method, that is, maintaining an appropriate width of the breach and evenly throwing stones between the two banks so that the water flows over the stones, preventing the bottom from being scoured. As the stones are thrown higher and the water level rises gradually, when the top of the stones exceeds the height of the old riverbed, the water will flow downward and return to the old course. The blocking project at Gongjiaba, Shandong, twenty years ago adopted this method. At that time, Pan Yifen was the chief of the Engineering Section of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau and cooperated with Tad, an American engineer from the China International Famine Relief Commission. This was the beginning of the use of the flat blocking method in the blocking project.

This blocking plan is to extend the levee eastward from the west bank of the breach, passing through the silt beach, for 800 meters, and then connect to the shallow water works to narrow the breach to 400 meters. A wooden bridge will be erected to reach the east bank. Light rails will be laid on the bridge, and boulders will be thrown into the breach along the bridge. At the same time, a diversion channel will be dug in the old river channel to plan the water outlet. When the stone throwing raises the water to a considerable height, the diversion channel will be opened to bring the main flow into the old course.

Construction Process

In late January 1946, the Blocking Project Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission was established. Chairman Zhao Shouyu concurrently served as the director, and Pan Yifen, a senior engineer of the commission, concurrently served as the deputy director and was actually responsible. Pan Yifen has served in river engineering for nearly 30 years and has written the book "Research on Blocking Projects." The blocking plan in the rehabilitation plan of the National Water Conservancy Commission was also prepared by Pan. Twenty years ago, he cooperated with American engineer Tad in blocking the breach at Gongjiaba. This time, Tad returned to Huayuankou as an engineer of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and a consultant to the National Water Conservancy Commission to be responsible for the supply of foreign equipment and the assistance of engineering technology. He can cooperate closely with Pan and complement each other. The construction process is briefly described as follows:

Preparation: Deputy Director Pan was ordered to come to Zhengzhou in late January to actively prepare. He immediately launched surveying and design work and began to build railways and highways near the breach and build office buildings. At that time, there were very few employees, and the work was tense. Even during the Lunar New Year, they had to work until midnight every day.

Rushing Progress: On March 1st, the blocking project officially started. In mid-March, the Blocking and Rehabilitation Dam Engineering Bureau was established, with Zhao Shouyu serving as the director and Pan Yifen and Li Wuzhong as the deputy directors. Under it are four sections: General Affairs, Engineering, Materials, and Transportation. Pan also concurrently served as the director of the Blocking Project Office, and Cheng Yun served as the deputy director. The blocking work was actively rushed forward. In addition to the refugees and voluntary workers from Henan Province who volunteered their services, the county governments of the First Administrative Region of Henan Province hired civilian workers on behalf of the government, and the provincial government and the commissioner's office agreed on the prices of various materials, which were purchased locally by the Blocking and Rehabilitation Bureau in cash. By mid-April, the construction of the new dam on the east bank was completed, and the extension of the new dam on the west bank to 800 meters, the shallow water works, and the diversion channel were started and dug respectively. The highways from Huayuankou to Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, and the railway from Huayuankou to Guangwu were completed one after another. The progress was very satisfactory.

Suspension of Work: In mid-April, when various projects were in full swing, the Blocking Project Office was ordered to suspend operations suddenly due to difficulties in solving the issues of domestic and foreign equipment, the relocation of residents in the old course of the Yellow River in the communist area, and other difficulties. This suspension lasted for more than 20 days, delaying the opportunity and having a great impact.

Continued Rushing Work

On May 1st, Xue Dubi, the chairman of the National Water Conservancy Commission, visited the construction site. After several meetings, it was decided to continue the work and that the completion of the wooden bridge and the throwing of stones to a height of about 2 meters before the summer flood in 1947 should be the principle.

Resumption of Work: In mid-May, the Blocking Project Office was reorganized into the Blocking Project General Section, with Cheng Lianbi serving as the chief of the General Section, and Pan Yifen stationed at the construction site in the name of the deputy director of the Blocking and Rehabilitation Bureau to supervise and guide. By May 21st, the protection works of the new dam on the west bank (seven protective dams) and the shallow water works were completed one after another. At this point, only 500 meters of the 3,400-meter breach remained, so the construction of the wooden bridge project was started, rushing forward day and night. By June 21st, the bridge project was completed, with a total of 124 spans. At the same time, the railway from Guangwu to Huayuankou was also completed, and stone materials mined from Luwangfen could be transported to the construction site by train via Guangwu.

Flood Season: After the bridge was completed, boulders should be thrown to protect the bridge foundation as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the communist side protested, refusing to allow the throwing of stones. The negotiations were not completed, and the flood had arrived. According to the annual flood, it is in early July. This year, the flood season was advanced by half a month. On June 23rd, the water level suddenly rose, and the flow rate increased several times. The main flow was turbulent and would cause the bridge to collapse. Later, it continued to be destroyed, with a total length of 180 meters. It was immediately ordered to stabilize the intact part of the bridge by throwing boulders. At this time, the foundation of the new dam and the shallow water works on the west bank was solid. The sudden flood was dangerous. After day and night defense, thanks to the employees' dedication, all dams stood firm despite a flow of 16,000 cubic meters per second. On August 10th, Director Zhao Shouyu resigned and Zhu Guangcai succeeded him; Deputy Director Li Wuzhong resigned and Qi Shouan succeeded him.

New Line Started

After the flood season, in late September, the diversion channel was started to be dug, and preparations were made to repair the wooden bridge to throw stones and cut off the flow. However, the flow rate has not been reduced to the minimum limit, and the main flow is directly hitting the east bank, with the deepest point reaching 18 meters. Some people thought that it was impossible to repair the bridge piers, so the idea of changing the plan was heard repeatedly.

In mid-October, Cheng Lianbi, the chief of the General Section, left his post, and the vacancy was concurrently filled by Deputy Director Qi. Soon, Qi resigned from his concurrent post due to physical exhaustion, and Tao Shuzeng, the chief engineer, concurrently served as the chief of the Blocking Project General Section. In mid-October, Shen Baixian, the vice chairman of the National Water Conservancy Commission, and Supervisor Xu Kai visited the construction site. They decided at a meeting with senior personnel at the construction site to extend the new dam on the west bank southward to 300 meters below the breach, where the river was wide and the water was shallow, and build a new bridge to facilitate the throwing of stones. As a result, the construction of the new line was immediately started. By late November, the water level had dropped and the river was shallow. The water depth on the wooden bridge line was only 8 meters, so the repair of the old bridge piers was still actively carried out. In mid-December, the old bridge was rebuilt, and the diversion channel was also completed. At present, the width of the breach is only 180 meters, and the flow rate has been reduced to 1,200 cubic meters per second. Willows and stones are being thrown along the bridge, which is only about 2 meters away from the water outlet. The water level difference above and below the breach reaches 1 meter. When the water level is slightly raised, the diversion channel can be opened to restore the main flow to the old course. The expected date of realization is around the Lunar New Year's Eve. General of the People Sun Lianzhong Reporter Yu Zhenji of This Newspaper

General Sun Lianzhong, who rose from the rank of private, has repeatedly performed miraculous feats and defeated strong enemies during the Northern Expedition and the Anti-Japanese War. Foreigners have praised him as one of the famous generals in the country. However, the recent interview with the Beijing-Shanghai reporter group in Pingjin, a "family routine chat" from a Suzhou point of view, gave the reporter the impression that he was full of the local flavor of the northern people. And his amiable attitude and his thick speech made people forget that the person sitting opposite him was the commander of the Eleventh War Zone in charge of the security of North China and the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government.

Planning for the People

Because he comes from the people and knows the suffering of the people, he can always plan for the people. When he met with the reporter group, he repeatedly talked about the situation in his hometown. He said: "I was born on the land in the north, and I have infinite enthusiasm for the people who grow on this land." When answering an inquiry on how to solve the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he said with regret: "The Chinese people are too bitter. We hope that the other party can think more about the country and the nation. During the Anti-Japanese War, everyone fought the Japanese to the death, but in the domestic war, everyone is a compatriot, and I will be even more sad if you die!" He earnestly hoped that the domestic political situation could be resolved through consultation and other methods in 1947. The constitution has been formulated, and the country can gradually embark on the road of unification. Everyone should be tolerant for the sake of the country and must not easily abandon the "results of the Anti-Japanese War."

General Sun pointed out that resolving problems with military force is not what the government wants. The current key is not military, but political issues. He said in a compassionate tone: "Think about it, what will happen if we continue to fight! There will always be a day when the people of Shandong and Hebei will all die!" After all, everyone is a compatriot! "The sooner military action stops, the better!"

The people of Hebei are too bitter. The refugees have nothing to wear and nothing to eat. General Sun's policies in Hebei Province are all based on stabilizing people's livelihood. On the negative side, all taxes and land taxes in the recovered areas will be completely exempted by the end of the year to give the people a chance to breathe. The conscription of 43,500 people in Hebei and Pingjin has recently been stopped. Regarding the land issue, the recovered areas have been handled according to the pacification area plan, implementing a 25% rent reduction to achieve the goal of "the tillers own their land" of the People's Livelihood Principle. On the positive side, the Hebei Provincial Government focuses on water conservancy construction. In terms of engineering, it has reached an agreement with the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to provide work relief and guide the Yongding River and Daqing River into the sea.

Competing Politically

Between General Sun's words, we can easily hear that he is very confident in the military and believes that the Jinpu Railway is not difficult to open, but he would rather compete politically. He repeatedly mentioned "We should win over the people." The communist army is engaged in destruction, and we should engage in construction. The communist army wants to make the situation chaotic, and we should stabilize everything. The more conscription and grain requisition are carried out in the "liberated areas," the more we should make the people live in peace.

Regarding the activities of the communist army in Hebei Province, General Sun gave the reporters a detailed analysis. He pointed out that since the national army recovered Zhangjiakou, the main force of the communist army, in addition to a part that was transferred to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, has concentrated in the Jizhong Taihang Mountains area of the Eleventh War Zone. Its strength is about four columns and eleven brigades, with less than 100,000 people including militia. The commander is Nie Rongzhen. The reason why the communist army concentrated in the Eleventh War Zone is related to the bold personality of the Hebei people. During the Anti-Japanese War, the communist army used Wutai Mountain in northeastern Shanxi as its base, but because the people there were too kind, it moved to Hebei. The people of Hebei are bold and can be aroused after one or two propaganda sessions, so the communist army took root in Hebei. In addition, the situation

### Sun, Zhang, Lei, and Others Return to Nanjing to Report; Re-Discussing Ways to Resume Peace Talks

[Our Newspaper Report] Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen are scheduled to return to Nanjing by overnight train today to report and consult with the central authorities on resuming peace talks. When a reporter visited Lei Zhen at his residence yesterday, Lei stated that the government has decided to first resume peace talks and then reorganize the government because governmental reorganization is part of the peace negotiations. He expressed that he could not be optimistic about the resumption of peace talks. Although he has traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai twice, everything is still only beginning, and establishing mutual trust between the two sides will not happen overnight. Even if both sides reach an agreement again, difficulties will inevitably arise during the implementation phase. However, if both sides can demonstrate a spirit of self-restraint, the problem can ultimately be resolved. Regarding the method of resuming peace talks, it is still difficult to determine, but direct negotiations are not entirely impossible. The formation of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolutions a year ago was entirely the result of concessions from both sides, as was the Double Tenth Agreement. Regarding the new basis for resuming peace talks, Lei stated that, as of this moment, the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have not formally exchanged views on this matter.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] At a press conference on the afternoon of the 11th, Zhang Zhizhong stated: After the United Nations conference, the foundation for world peace has been laid. China needs peace even more, but it is still unstable, for which I feel deeply ashamed. As a citizen of the country, if needed, I am willing to contribute to peace as part of my duty as a citizen. He encouraged the reporters and others with the phrase "Let us all continue to work together." He also stated: After returning to Nanjing, because he was too disconnected from the situation over the past nine months, he consulted a large amount of material to study the military positions of both sides, but this was only "general knowledge research." When Dong Biwu visited, they discussed the main points insisted upon by the Communist Party during a private conversation. Zhang asked if there were any new opinions regarding the military positions as of January 13th. The two did not discuss the first point. Zhang believes that "talks must be held, and talks can always have results. As long as the country is unified, everyone makes concessions, and we can always get closer." When a reporter asked about his opinion on President Sun's suggestion, Zhang stated: He has been busy with social engagements in recent days, has only glanced at it, and has not studied it in detail. He denied the rumors that he was being transferred to work in the central government. He stated that it was not yet certain when he would return.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Shao Lizi expressed his support for Sun Ke's suggestion to hold a round-table conference. He believes that this is a good way to solve the problem and believes that it will be supported by all parties. The issue of reorganizing the government may also be discussed at the new round-table conference.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The CCP Nanjing Office stated its attitude towards Sun Ke's proposal in Shanghai regarding the method of peace talks on the morning of the 11th: Recently, the government has only lingered on superficial issues and has not touched on any concrete content. The CCP's two demands will never be abandoned, and their position is very clear. As for the government's counter-proposal, it has not yet been clarified. Therefore, sending someone to Yan'an or holding a round-table conference is not enough to solve the problem.

### Marshall Stays in Hawaii; Awaits News of China Peace Talks; U.S. Ambassador Meets with Zhou Qianchong to Exchange Views

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Zhou Qianchong, a Standing Committee member of the China Youth Party, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 11th. He immediately informed U.S. Ambassador Stuart, who invited him to meet and exchange views on peace talks. The meeting lasted for an hour and a half. Ambassador Stuart stated that General Marshall is still staying in Honolulu due to a cold and is continuing to await news of peace talks in China to report to Washington. Zhou visited Shao Lizi of the People's Political Council in the afternoon for a meeting.

Civil Socialist and Youth Parties Discuss Current Situation Plans

[Our Newspaper Report] The meeting scheduled to be held by the Civil Socialist Party and the Youth Party yesterday in Fan Yuan was canceled due to Zhang Junmai's sudden eye ailment. His trip to Nanjing has also been postponed as a result. However, all the attendees from both parties have brought plans to resolve the current situation and are exchanging views. It is heard that the views of the two sides are not far apart. Regarding the reorganization of the government, people believe that it must also include local governments, and it must be done at the same time as the central government's reorganization. They attach great importance to the personnel of the Premier of the Executive Yuan in the reorganized government. In addition, the Civil Socialist Party is not very satisfied with the method of increasing the number of seats in the Legislative Yuan. They believe that if the government has sufficient sincerity, it should eliminate a portion of the Legislative Yuan and supplement it with personnel from various parties and factions. Increasing the number of seats while retaining control is not enough to show the government's sincerity.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Civil Socialist Party and the Youth Party will continue to hold meetings today. Lei Zhen will also participate. It is not yet known whether a common plan can be given to Lei Zhen to take to Nanjing today. It may be more likely to wait for Zhang Junmai to recover and take it to Nanjing himself.

Minister of Communications Yu Dawei Discusses Railway Development Plan

[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Minister of Communications Yu Dawei recently announced that the Ministry of Communications has drafted a continuous railway line plan connecting Northwest and Southwest China for freight transportation. It is scheduled to be completed within two to three years, with a total length of 1,800 miles. The Northwest starts from Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, and goes to Guangzhou at the southern end of Guangdong in the Southwest, passing through Tianshui in Gansu, Guangyuan in Sichuan, and Liuzhou in Guangxi. The existing Liuzhou-Guiyang section of the railway will be renovated. The railway line between Tianshui and Guangzhou has already started construction. At the same time, the Yichang-Jiujiang railway, which was destroyed during the war, is under repair and will be open to traffic in mid-June. The Chengdu-Chongqing section of the Yu-Yi Railway has been completed, leaving only the track laying work unfinished. The entire line is scheduled to be completed within two years.

Commuter Train Service between Hankou and Xinxiang to Resume Soon

[Central News Agency, Hankou Dispatch, 11th] The sections of the Pinghan Railway between Hankou and Liuhegou will gradually resume traffic. In addition to the Hankou-Xiaogan commuter train, which resumed service on the 5th of this month, the Hankou-Zhumadian, Zhumadian-Zhengzhou, Anyang-Liuhegou, and Lihe-Xinxiang commuter trains will also resume service in the short term.

### Wang Xiaolai's Remarks

Marshall Has Indeed Recognized that Our Country's Peace and Order Must Be Restored

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] All parties have paid close attention to Marshall's statement. According to Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Associations, yesterday: "I believe that Marshall's life is extremely fair, and I believe that Marshall has indeed recognized the crux of our country's current illness. If national peace and order cannot be restored, it will be impossible to maintain industry and commerce, and there will be no way to talk about democratic nation-building. The future of the country is unimaginable. Therefore, people in industry and commerce are very willing to make their greatest efforts to restore peace and only need to return. They also warmly hope that General Marshall, a great friend of China, will continue to support the realization of peace and democracy in China after returning to his country."

### Resolve the Xinjiang Autonomy Issue with Policies to Support Ethnic Minorities; Zhang Zhizhong Discusses the "New Xinjiang" September Guidelines

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] At a press conference at 5:00 PM on the 11th, Zhang Zhizhong stated: Xinjiang is the territory of the Republic of China, and the people of Xinjiang are compatriots of the Republic of China. If we can seek to treat each ethnic group equally, help them improve their lives, raise their culture, and enable them to obtain what they deserve and enjoy the rights they should enjoy, and if everything can be done in accordance with the spirit of nationalism of the Three Principles of the People, we can awaken their national consciousness and achieve results. Some facts over the past nine months have proven that this approach will not fail, and Xinjiang Province will never be lost. Zhang expressed regret over the various practices of past government colleagues in Xinjiang and expressed dissatisfaction with the past "generous outflow, meager inflow" style. He also painfully pointed out that the sins committed by Sheng Shicai and others in Xinjiang in the past are now being repaid with blood debts by us.

Sheng Shicai's Brutality and Tyranny Were Rare in a Century

He also said that such cruelty and tyranny as Sheng's are rare in centuries. We should sympathize with the tragic lessons learned by our compatriots in Xinjiang. Almost none of the representatives who came to Nanjing to participate in the National Assembly had not been imprisoned, their property had been confiscated by the past rulers, and many of their families had been killed. In this situation, even if I (Zhang referring to himself) were a Xinjiang person, I would definitely express resistance because they have never seen any benefits from the motherland, and at the same time, they believe that such Han people are not enough to represent the country. The actions of such national criminals in Xinjiang can only be compensated by the method of "seeking it in ourselves" and working hard.

Rumors of an Unstable Situation Are No Longer a Problem

Zhang stated that there are no major problems in Xinjiang now. His trip to Nanjing was not due to the unstable situation there. The new situation is not as the representatives from the interior have rumored. Indeed, some people in the province hold the idea of independence, and most of the rest advocate ethnic autonomy. We are trying to make those who have ideas of breaking away from the motherland embrace the motherland and support the Chinese nation. I went to Yining to inspect last September and stayed there for a week. It was rumored that the locals did not treat me as the chairman, but only as a distinguished guest, and welcomed me with their "Moon and Star Flag." This report is only half true. When I arrived at the airport, there were two flags on the field, one was the national flag, and the other was the Moon and Star Flag. The residence and other places were the same. When I was in Dihua, I agreed with them that the national flag must be hung. The national flag in Yining was the one they bought in Dihua, and it was not true that we sent it. At this National Assembly meeting, the representatives from Xinjiang originally intended to propose that the "ethnic flag" should be stipulated in the constitution, but then they withdrew it. Since the peace agreement was agreed upon, the provincial government and the reorganized army have been reorganized in accordance with the agreement. The provincial government has already completed the reorganization, and the other party has verbally and in writing agreed to the reorganization of the army, but it has not yet been counted and reorganized. The reason they held is that after the peace, the veterans retire and the new recruits have not yet been filled, so they need to wait for some time. The ethnic troops will be reorganized into six regiments, three security regiments, and three over-army regiments, stationed in the three areas of Yili, Tasha, and Ashan. The number and location are their responsibility, and the national defense is the responsibility of the national army.

All Ethnic Groups Have Representatives; Forming a United Provincial Government

After the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, all ethnic groups have representatives participating, which is a united provincial government. For the past six months, the feelings between each other have been very harmonious. I respect the opinions of the Yili people very much, and everything is discussed in a democratic way. The administration is also carried out in accordance with the administrative program, and it is mutually agreed that the principles of foreign affairs must not be violated. The high degree of autonomy requested by the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang is that national defense and diplomacy belong to the central government, and other transportation, education, and autonomy are managed by themselves. And a national autonomous government must be formed, and they are allowed to hang their ethnic flag. Currently, the postal service in Xinjiang is handled by Han compatriots, and all use shouts, which is very inconvenient for them. Telegrams are also in Chinese, and code words are also mostly inconvenient. If their language can be added to the postmark, or if they can identify it themselves, it will be much more convenient. In addition, such as judicial judges, are all Han people, which will be difficult to satisfy them. In the future, the High Court plans to add a vice president, and other judges also plan to be elected from various ethnic groups. Some knowledge in Xinjiang recognizes that the words "Xinjiang" contain the meaning of aggression, and advocate changing it to "Turkestan" or "Turkic" Province. The central government believes that the provincial name can be changed, but words such as Turkic are not in accordance with Chinese customs, but recently they have lost interest.

Xinjiang's Finances Are Extremely Difficult; Four Hundred Million New Currency Has Been Issued

The current financial situation in Xinjiang is quite difficult. If the financial problem cannot be solved, nothing can be done. One of the reasons for this trip is to discuss financial issues with the central government. The central government subsidy required for this year is about 20 billion in new currency. Due to currency system and other reasons in Xinjiang, the level of living is the highest in the country. The issuance of new currency has been going on for many years and continues to be issued, but the total is 400 million because the printing press has broken down and the printing paper has also run out. When Zhang answered questions, a reporter asked what were the reasons for the mutiny in Xinjiang: more external causes or internal causes? Zhang said that there are three views on this point: some say that it is entirely external causes, some believe that it is entirely internal causes, and some believe that the two are combined, but the main one is still "seeking it in ourselves."

No Allied Aircraft Have Been Discovered; There Are No Red Army Soldiers in the Territory Now

Another reporter asked if the Yining incident was related to the Soviet Union? Zhang replied, "I don't think so." Later, he denied the rumor that allied aircraft had been discovered in Xinjiang. Zhang also said about the rumor that the Soviet Union had trained 40,000 underground workers to infiltrate Xinjiang, "There are none now." He also said, "There are no Red Army soldiers in Xinjiang now." A reporter asked, "There are none now, does that mean there used to be?" Zhang avoided answering amidst laughter from the audience. Regarding the negotiations on economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in Xinjiang, Zhang said that this is not a new issue. In January of the 34th year [1945], President Song [Ziwen] sent a proposal to the Soviet side in his capacity as Foreign Minister, but did not receive a reply. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, we have sent a revised version to the Soviet side, and we are now awaiting the Soviet side's reply.

The Authorities Will Provide Appropriate Equipment for Border Defense According to the National Defense Plan

A reporter asked how the authorities plan to consolidate Xinjiang's border defense. Zhang said: The authorities have provided appropriate equipment in accordance with the national defense plan to protect territorial sovereignty. Finally, Zhang expressed his feelings after making his claims for several days: The Xinjiang ethnic groups are not ordinary ethnic groups. They have their own religions, languages, and writings. The policies of the past three thousand years are not in line with today's trend of ethnic self-government. There are four million Xinjiang people in Xinjiang, accounting for seventy percent of the total population, and Han people account for only one-twentieth. We should give them the opportunity to participate in politics based on the policy of supporting ethnic minorities. After the constitution is implemented in the future, the province will have an autonomy law, and the provincial governor will also be elected by the people. The problem of ethnic autonomy in Xinjiang should not be difficult to solve naturally.

### Military Reclamation Bureau Established in Xinjiang

[Central News Agency, Dihua Dispatch, 10th] Xinjiang recently established a Military Reclamation Bureau, planning to use soldiers to cultivate wasteland in the north and south of Xinjiang, engage in production, and increase food for the people. Wang Xinwen, the former Chief of Staff of the New Xinjiang Supply Bureau, is the Director of the Bureau.

### Gold Smuggling Case

The Beiping District Procuratorate Filed a Public Prosecution; Three Drivers Fled and Have Not Been Arrested

[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 11th] Regarding the case of Yang Baofan, a technician from the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), Guo Ditang, the head of the radio station, and the drivers Yang Donghuan, Xue Bingkun, etc., who used their positions to collude with merchants from Beiping and Tianjin, Zhang Pei, Zhang Shichang, etc., to transport gold by air, the Beiping District Court Supervisory Office has completed its investigation and filed a public prosecution in accordance with special criminal corruption cases. The case was transferred to the criminal court for handling today. The drivers Yang Donghuan, Xue Bingkun, and Xu Yangchao are on the run and are still wanted.
