### National Army Advances North of Shuangmiaozipu, Communist Main Force in Siping Flees in All Directions, Southern Advance Troops Capture Gongzhuling Last Night

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, Our Newspaper, 27th] The National Army's northern and southern routes between Shenyang and Changchun have made progress. The southern route reached Shuangmiaozipu station on the 27th and is continuing north. The northern route is still on the outskirts of Gongzhuling, with part of it having bypassed to the north bank of the Dongliao River.

[Dispatch from Changchun, Our Newspaper, 27th] The communist army in Gongzhuling is putting up fierce resistance. The National Army's Changchun-Nanao advancing troops have secured the areas on both sides of Gongzhuling. As of 4:00 PM on the 27th, they had not yet entered the city.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] The National Army's Changchun-Nanao advancing troops completely recaptured Gongzhuling at 7:00 PM on the 27th and are continuing to advance south.

[Dispatch from Changchun, Our Newspaper, 27th] The National Army's Northern advancing troops, under the command of Zheng Dongguo, are making rapid progress. Yesterday afternoon, they eliminated the communist resistance at Shuangmiaozipu. On the 27th at noon, they advanced to a line 15 kilometers from Siping. They can meet with the Siping defenders tonight. The communist front lines are collapsing on both sides of the railway. Siping has been besieged for three weeks, and Daoxi has been reduced to ruins.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] A phone call from Siping at 4:00 PM stated that the National Army's reinforcements advancing north had captured Quantou, 30 kilometers from Siping, at noon on the 27th. They may arrive in the suburbs of Siping tonight or on the 28th. Furthermore, a phone call from Kaiyuan at 1:00 PM stated that Deputy Commander Zheng, along with Army Commander Liao Yaoxiang and Deputy Army Commander Shu Shicun, arrived here on a special military train at noon on the 27th. After a short rest, they went to inspect the forward defense positions. According to Deputy Commander Zheng, Quantou was a communist stronghold, and the National Army's swift capture of it was a major victory. There should be no further resistance between Quantou and Siping. The siege of Siping will not only be lifted easily, but the stubbornly attacking communists will be annihilated on the spot. Kaiyuan has suffered a terrible catastrophe and is extremely desolate.

[Dispatch from Changchun, Our Newspaper, 27th] The battle on the outskirts of Siping is fierce. Most of the communist forces are concentrated southeast of Siping.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] The main force of the communist army in Siping retreated in pain to the Bamiancheng area west of Siping on the night of the 26th. Their artillery regiment, Jianbo, had already fled the outskirts of Siping three days prior. The dream of overwhelming the National Army in Siping with numerical superiority has become a bubble after paying the price of tens of thousands of militia lives.

[Dispatch from Shenyang, Our Newspaper, 27th] The fierce battle of Siping, the focus of the Northeast war situation, is still continuing. The National Army's Catholic Church stronghold in Tiedong was occupied by the communist army on the night of the 26th, but other locations are safe. Local reports state that the National Army paratrooper unit was airlifted from Nanjing to Shenyang, personally led by Commander Ma Shigong. A batch of them parachuted into the suburbs of Siping on the 26th to help the National Army, which has been defending for a long time. Note: The battle in the Siping urban area has been ongoing for sixteen days and nights.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 27th] The National Army's various sweeping units on the outskirts of Jilin City are expanding their battlefield gains. Communist forces are fleeing in droves, especially in Jidong. After the National Army in Jinan recovered Shuanghezhen, they continued to attack south. The communist forces at Yantongshan are showing signs of wavering. In the Daxiao Sanjiazi area of Jidong, the National Army surrounded and severely attacked the main force of the communist army's Jixiao Brigade, approximately 1,000 men, yesterday afternoon. The majority were annihilated, except for those captured alive.

### Bishop Yu Bin Discusses the Current Situation, Urges U.S. Economic Aid to China, and Avoids Repeating the Pearl Harbor Incident

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] Bishop Yu Bin called here on the 27th to prevent the outbreak of a third world war in order to avoid another catastrophe for human civilization. The solution is for the United States to provide large-scale aid to China as soon as possible to overcome the current difficulties. In analyzing our country's current so-called "civil war," he pointed out: The prelude to the third world war has already begun within our country. It is still possible to stop it at this moment, otherwise it will be uncontrollable. Bishop Yu made the comments during a luncheon on the 27th, inviting several reporters in Nanjing to comment on the current situation. He stated: People call the Chinese Communist rebellion a "civil strife" and oppose the term "civil war" against the Chinese Communist Party. In reality, there is little difference between a civil war and a civil strife. Due to the facts that the Chinese Communist Party in the Northeast has declared the participation of Korean communists, Japanese prisoners, and Soviet advisors, and that Outer Mongolian troops have invaded Xinjiang, it has been demonstrated that the Chinese Communist rebellion is not a "domestic" strife but an "international war." He advocated "rectifying the name," saying, "If the name is not correct, words will not be proper, and if words are not proper, things will not succeed." Friends of China believe that since it is a "domestic" war, they should wait until the turmoil passes before providing assistance. Therefore, the U.S. loan is slow in coming. Yu believes that the current situation is similar to the September 18th Incident era. He recalled that he had told American friends before the Pearl Harbor incident: The Japanese will attack Pearl Harbor, but the Americans do not realize it. The result happened, and it was too late to prevent it. Currently, it seems that we should no longer make the same mistake. Yu pointed out: U.S. aid to China is not enough to cause a world war, but it can eliminate a world war before it breaks out. Even without material aid, spiritual support is also very necessary. Yu believes that the current material trade assistance is not for military supplies because our country's biggest difficulty at present is the economic problem. Therefore, we urgently hope for U.S. economic assistance. In addition to the $500 million loan, there should be currency system loans or material loans, and the U.S. has the power to provide large-scale aid to China. After supporting Sun Ke's remarks, Yu said: We should clearly tell the United States that we are fighting today not for ourselves but for culture and for the United States. The tragedy of World War II should not be repeated today.

### Fu Sinian Discusses the Current Situation

Says the Soviet Union has a Strange Temperament

[Local News] Senator (Director of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica) Fu Sinian has recently been assigned to go to the United States to investigate the status of Chinese studies in American universities and take the opportunity to seek medical treatment. Fu arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and is scheduled to take his family on the General Gordon steamer to the United States tomorrow. Yesterday, at the request of reporters, he expressed his views on the current situation. He said: "China and the Soviet Union must cooperate based on geographical and world peace reasons, but cooperation is very difficult due to the Soviet Union's strange character and temperament. It seems that the more polite you are to him, the worse it goes." Regarding Vice President Sun's remarks, he said: "His motive comes from patriotism. Many people feel stifled and need to vent." Fu also believes that "the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is no longer a true civil war due to external forces infiltrating. Although the current situation is serious, the general public is too pessimistic, which is as wrong as being too optimistic in the past." He said: "Financial and economic problems urgently need to be resolved. The government should immediately investigate the deposits of Chinese people in the United States and bring them all back. U.S. dollar bonds can also be assigned to wealthy households. In short, Chinese finance should seek money from the rich, and the government must make a firm determination." It is reported that Fu's stay in the United States will be approximately six months to a year.

### The Chinese Communists, From Top to Bottom, Are All Superstitious About Force

[Our Newspaper] When reporters asked Fu Sinian about his views on the current situation, Fu replied: "Regarding internal problems, some people in the government advocate fighting, while the Chinese Communists, from top to bottom, all believe in force. Just listen to the Chinese Communist broadcasts, and you can know the Chinese Communists' views on the current situation. Today, if anyone wants peace, they should ask the Chinese Communists. China's civil war has become internationalized and has become a Spanish-style civil war, but to a slightly lesser extent."

### Fierce Battles in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway, Cavalry from Chahar Province Rushes to Support

[Special Dispatch from Baoding, Our Newspaper, 27th] The defense of Baoding, which is under siege, has begun fiercely.

Military officers and civilians throughout the city held an emergency meeting yesterday to plan a general mobilization to defend the provincial capital. According to Song Kentang, Deputy Director of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, the Chahar cavalry division is now marching south to provide support.

[Dispatch from Beiping, Our Newspaper, 27th] Sun Lianzhong convened a meeting of senior generals from the Baoding Pacification Headquarters in Beiping on the morning of the 27th.

### Communist Military Transportation is Frequent, a Major Battle is Expected in Central Shandong

[Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 27th] Communist military transportation in Shandong is frequent. Night and day, they are transported south from the north bank of the Yellow River, passing through Qingcheng, Huantai, and Zibo, Bo, Yidu, and Yishui. There are more than 500 trucks full of grain and ammunition. It is generally judged that a new major battle in central Shandong is imminent.

[Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 27th] Lucun, more than 30 kilometers east of Laiwu, is reportedly gathering three communist columns again. The National Army is closely monitoring them. Furthermore, on the 14th and 17th of this month, two transport ships of 2,000 and 3,000 tons each arrived from Zhifu Island in Jiaodong. After unloading the ammunition and weapons they carried, they were reloaded with wheat, peanuts, etc., and sailed towards Dalian and Lushun.

[Dispatch from Xuzhou, Our Newspaper, 27th] The National Army in Mengyin, central Shandong, cleared the landmines laid by the communist army along the way on the 27th and is now advancing towards Donglidian (north of Yishui) and Nanma, where the headquarters of the Chinese Communist East China Field Army is located. Furthermore, on the 26th, the National Army annihilated more than 300 communist troops and captured more than 30 in the area north of Dongwangdu and Qingshishan in the northeast of Mengyin.

### The Legislative Yuan Had a Fierce Debate All Day Yesterday and Passed the Law on Punishing Crimes Against Military Service and Other Cases, and the Election Fraud Case Was Sent for Review

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] The Legislative Yuan held its 329th regular meeting all day on the 27th, chaired by Sun Ke. The newly appointed Vice President Wu Tiecheng attended the meeting for the first time. More than 100 legislators attended the meeting, and ministers such as Yu Dawei and Chen Qitian were also present to answer questions related to their respective ministries. The meeting first discussed the postal and telecommunications price increase case, and after passing it, continued to discuss the "Revised Regulations on Eliminating Price Collusion and Setting Price Ceilings," which was explained in detail by Chen Qitian. Later, as the government was discussing a new economic plan, it was resolved to retain the case.

In the afternoon, the discussion of the "Revised Lawyers Law" caused an interesting debate, as the case was related to whether legislators could serve as lawyers. When each legislator spoke, they repeatedly stated their reasons in detail. Later, as it was inappropriate for legislators to serve as lawyers, the case was resolved to be sent back for review.

The "Land Administration Department Organization Law" was also one of the important cases at the meeting. The full text of 28 articles was passed smoothly after brief discussion. However, when discussing the "Revised Organization Law of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission," there were many debatable points regarding the deputy commissioner and the term of office. Although the original case was passed, it caused a small storm. Another fiercely debated case was the "Revised Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Councils." Xia Shengsheng and others strongly argued about the provincial councils' right to review provincial expenditure, and Lu Fu also supported them. Finally, the case was sent back for review. Subsequently, the "Revised Civil Procedure Fee Law" and the "Law on Punishing Crimes Against Military Service" and other cases were discussed and passed smoothly. The highlight of the meeting was the "Draft Law on Punishing Election Fraud." The committee members spoke in a relaxed tone. Wei Tingsheng and others heavily criticized the original draft, and Liu Butong also satirized it in a humorous tone. The most vocal attacker of the case was Wei Tingsheng, who had recently returned from his constituency. Based on his practical experience, he pointed out that under the current circumstances, it is almost impossible to run for election without holding banquets. Even saints born in this world would probably have to use banquets. Wei pointed out the "major fraud" situations in various places. He claimed that most Chinese people could not only not write the names of the candidates they were voting for, but also could not write their own names. Therefore, whoever can control the county magistrate can be elected. It is said that in a certain province recently, there was a case of replacing the county magistrate and commissioner due to bribery. It is better to prevent "major fraud" than to focus on preventing certain amounts of currency leakage.

Liu Butong used a humorous tone to ridicule the military case of the punishment regulations. He claimed that if it is handled according to the draft, one cannot invite guests or provide transportation. The voters would be starving and unable to move. Zhou Yizhi also said that people say that in addition to floods and droughts this year, there is also a so-called "election disaster." The passage of the draft is tantamount to adding "election disaster."

Chen Guyuan disagreed with Liu Butong's statement, explaining that the purpose of the case is to prevent powerful people from manipulating elections. Some people call it a "pauper election law." The main purpose is to give poor people a chance to be elected. The original proposer, Jian Guansan, cited the laws of democratic and advanced countries such as Britain and the United States as examples, explaining that European and American countries have explicit regulations to prevent banquets and other things. The purpose of our proposal is to make the rich aware of the need to be vigilant so that the poor also have a voice in politics. Otherwise, the rich will be happy, and the poor will be in a dark and helpless state. It is necessary for the Legislative Yuan to formulate a separate law. Some people use 500 million yuan as election capital. They have long-term rooms in international hotels. Those who support them are provided with food and drink by the candidates. This kind of thing and the major fraud mentioned by Wei Tingsheng should be prevented by formulating laws. Tan Tiwu, Chen Haicheng, and others also assisted Jian Guansan in speaking, explaining that the purpose of the draft is to protect the politically and economically weak. Chen Guyuan further pointed out that this election is the first step for us to promote constitutional government. We should set a new trend for future generations at the beginning of the event.

The case was discussed for about half an hour. The only thing the two sides argued about was the trivial issues stipulated in the draft. Finally, it was put to a vote, and it was resolved to send it back to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee for review. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 PM and was scheduled to hold the 330th regular meeting again on the 28th. Due to the large number of accumulated cases, another meeting will be held on July 3.

[Another Dispatch] According to a legislator who participated in the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, there will be 450 representatives of the National Congress, including 49 people in the liberal professions, of which 12 are journalists (one of whom is female).

### Legislators to Hold a Public Banquet Tonight for the Newly Appointed Vice President Wu Tiecheng

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] The new Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Wu Tiecheng, attended the regular meeting of the Yuan for the first time on the morning of the 27th. During the meeting, Zhou Yizhi suggested that all legislators hold a public banquet on the evening of the 28th to express their welcome. This suggestion was approved by all with warm applause.

### Postal and Telecommunications Prices to be Increased Fivefold, to be Implemented on July 1, Newspaper Postage Increased Threefold, News Telegraph Increased Twofold

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 27th] The postal and telecommunications price increase case was finally passed after two hours of fierce debate at the Legislative Yuan regular meeting on the 27th and will be implemented on July 1. Postal and telecommunications are generally increased fivefold, while newspaper postage is increased threefold and news telegraph fees are increased twofold. Taking ordinary letters as an example, the price per item will increase from 100 yuan to 500 yuan. Taking ordinary telegrams as an example, the price per word will increase from 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan.

After the case was submitted to the Yuan today, Lou Tongsun, the concurrent director of the Economic and Financial Committee, first explained the review process, stating that the case came from the Executive Yuan's "Revised Measures for Subsidizing State-Owned and Public Utilities." The government has previously adopted a subsidy policy for various state-owned enterprises, but due to rising prices, the amount of subsidies has been increasing. Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures, in order to balance the budget and considering that all expenditures cannot completely rely on issuance, the government considered abolishing subsidies. In the past, the government's subsidies for transportation businesses were over 100 billion. If they were all stopped, the price of ordinary letters would have to rise from 100 yuan to 1,000 yuan to make up for it. The current increase proposed by the Ministry of Communications from 100 yuan to 500 yuan still relies on government subsidies. Otherwise, the adjustment number would not be the case.

Then, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei was invited to explain, accompanied by Tao Fengshan, Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department, and others. Yu held a table full of numbers, explaining that since the last price adjustment, due to two salary adjustments, the monthly losses were huge. If this is not adjusted, the losses of the postal and telecommunications departments in July will reach 61.4 billion. Therefore, the price will be raised from 100 yuan to 500 yuan, and the remaining amount will still be subsidized by the government. In this way, the losses of postal and telecommunications in July will still reach 20 billion (16.1 billion for postal and 4 billion for telecommunications). On the expenditure side, salaries account for the largest share, accounting for 65%. As a result of layoffs, the telecommunications department laid off 5,000 people, and the postal department laid off 4,000 people, saving a lot of money.

After Yu's report, the legislators raised questions one after another, hoping that the Ministry of Communications would continue to work hard on conservation to save waste. Cheng Yuanzhen cited facts, saying that the Ministry of Communications is too wasteful. Senior officials' residences are paid for by the public, with deposits of tens of millions. There are also various malpractices during the Dragon Boat Festival, which are all unnecessary. Wang Peiren also believes that some measures of the Ministry of Communications are too elaborate and the procedures are too troublesome. They all hope that the entire revenue and expenditure situation can be reported for legislative reference. Chen Guyuan hopes that preferential treatment can be given to soldiers sending letters.

Yu said in his reply that this adjustment is not only to make up for losses, but also to slightly restrict it. If not, the number of letters will be too large to be delivered.

At this point, Dean Sun made a supplementary explanation, clarifying that the price increase of state-owned enterprises will not lead to rising prices. Regarding the abolition of subsidies, the State Council has discussed it twice. If we look at the cost of sending letters, each ordinary letter costs 1,000 yuan. If it is still calculated at 100 yuan in the past, the national treasury will have to pay 900 yuan for each letter. Part of the money paid by the national treasury is obtained from taxation, but most of it relies on inflation. It is the general public who bears the tax burden and suffers from inflation. After the subsidies are cancelled, the national treasury can spend 778.2 billion yuan less (in the past six months), which is an effective measure to stabilize prices. We should not be afraid of the price increase of state-owned enterprises stimulating general prices. We should support this measure, which is sufficient to reduce the issuance, balance the budget, and reduce the burden on the general public.

Yu and others withdrew around 11:00 AM, and the Yuan continued to discuss. Most of the committee members expressed strong dissatisfaction with the various wastes of the Ministry of Communications and even advocated sending people to investigate. Cheng Yuanzhen cited two things to draw attention to. (1) There are many unreasonable places in the expenses of the Ministry of Communications. It seems that the Ministry of Communications should also try to economize on its own expenditures. (2) After the adjustment, the express mail fee is 1,800 yuan per letter, which is not a problem in Nanjing and Shanghai, but in the inland, it is enough to "scare many people to death." Fu Yan also cited an example, saying that many ordinary employees of the Ministry of Communications hire a servant and live in Western-style houses with sofas. The monthly expenses of public funds reach tens of millions. Such enjoyment makes it difficult for people not to be outraged.

Qi Zhihou, Tan Tiwu, and others spoke for the Ministry of Communications, pointing out that Yu has been a good minister since he took charge of the Ministry of Communications and has been working hard to govern. We should encourage him to do good things and not be picky about everything. Chen Guyuan also said that 500 yuan is only enough to eat a steamed bun and is not enough to buy an evening newspaper. It seems inappropriate to be stingy.

Finally, it was put to a vote and passed the case with the largest majority.

### A Large Number of Japanese Spindles are Preserved, China's Textile Industry Can Hardly be Safe, Experts Issue a Warning in Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Several Chinese textile experts issued a warning when they met with Central News Agency reporters this morning, saying that China's domestic textile industry will not be able to obtain temporary security because of the large number of spindles that Japan is allowed to preserve after the war. They solemnly stated that the domestic people have probably neglected a fact, that is, Japanese spindles can rotate 10,000 times per minute, while Chinese spindles can only rotate 6,000 to 7,000 times per minute. Therefore, Japan's output is also higher than China's. The work of the Japanese textile industry is also more intensive. Its textile industry usually works 24 hours a day. Japan's current 2.5 million cotton yarn spindles work 16 hours a day and 300 days a year. Some people think that Japan is allowed to preserve 4 million spindles after the war, which is "completely reasonable." They estimate that each person in Japan consumes about 13 square yards of cotton cloth per year. Therefore, 2 million spindles must be used to produce cloth for domestic consumption, and another 2 million spindles must be used to produce textile export cloth. Japan had 16.5 million spindles before the war, of which 14.5 million were cotton yarn spindles. The country's textile industry progressed rapidly after World War I and replaced Britain in 1933 to become the world's leading textile industry country until the outbreak of the Pacific War.

### Taiwan Bank to Handle Foreign Sales Exchange Settlements Starting Next Month

In the past, the most exported goods from Taiwan Province were tea, sugar, and camphor. Most of them were transported to Hong Kong. Because there are no branch institutions of the four banks, none of them were settled.

### Owed Japanese Reparations in Kind - Total Amount Still Not Determined - Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee Disagrees

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] A responsible person from the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee, in response to reporters' questions regarding "Why has China only received 780,000 tons of Japanese priority reparations in kind, considering China was the main country in the war against Japan? Why is it only enjoying such a meager allocation? What will the government say about this? Will it propose a re-allocation?" stated: (1) The total amount of Japanese reparations in kind was stipulated in the Far Eastern Commission to reduce Japan's war-making capability. Except for production needed to maintain a specified standard of living for the Japanese people, all other industrial equipment should be used for reparations. The amount of production that Japan should retain is still under discussion, and no formal conclusion has been reached, so the total amount of reparations has not been specifically defined. (2) The percentage of reparations in kind allocated to each country has been discussed several times at meetings of the Far Eastern Commission, but no agreement has been reached. However, so far, all countries have proposed that China should get the highest percentage, with figures ranging from 23% to 29%. China has consistently demanded 40%, and discussions are still ongoing. (3) Regarding the early dismantling of materials, the United States, considering the unresolved dispute over the allocation to each country, and that the reparations in kind would rust and deteriorate over time, issued an emergency directive based on the authorization of the Far Eastern Commission. The directive stipulated that 30% should be allocated for early dismantling and reparations within the temporary dismantling scope, of which China would receive 15%. In fact, China has already taken half of the early dismantling materials, more than any other country. The specified percentages were originally calculated based on value, but because valuation was not possible at the time, it was stated that the calculations would initially be based on "quantity" or "production capacity," with implementation to follow. However, in reality, the relationship between "quantity" and "production capacity" varies greatly depending on the type of machinery. For example, modern high-speed steam turbines are very light but have extremely high power generation capacity, while old-fashioned low-speed steam engines are very heavy but have very low power generation capacity, and their values ​​also differ greatly. Therefore, China's early dismantling reparations in kind should account for 15% of the materials listed in the temporary reparations plan, calculated by price. However, to facilitate immediate execution, applications for dismantling can be made based on production capacity or tonnage first.

In summary, the total amount of reparations in kind that China should receive has not yet been determined. However, China has resisted the longest and suffered the greatest damage. According to fair standards, it should receive the largest share of Japan's total reparations. The actual amount China receives in early dismantling reparations in kind may differ from the 15% based on value. The generally reported figure of 780,000 tons of materials seems to be based on assuming that the total reparations in kind are 5.2 million tons, and then calculating 15% of that amount.

### Government Officials Hold Meetings - Discuss Policy Decisions on the Current Situation - Wang Shijie Reports on Foreign Affairs at the Meeting

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang, attending a meeting of the Political Participation Council's Standing Committee, responded to questions about the Macau issue, stating: Since the Political Participation Council passed a resolution requesting the government to recover Macau, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun negotiations with the Portuguese Envoy Ye. He verbally requested the return of Macau and pointed out to the Portuguese Envoy that Portugal's reputation during the war was not good. The Portuguese Envoy replied that although Portugal was under pressure from the Axis powers and forced to take some inappropriate actions, it made every effort to strictly adhere to neutrality. The Portuguese Envoy also stated that the Portuguese government protected the Chinese people during the war. Foreign Minister Wang stated that the conversation with the Portuguese Envoy was recorded, and that so far, he has not given an affirmative reply to this matter. According to the Portuguese Envoy ten days ago, the Portuguese government's main consideration regarding the Macau issue is not Macau itself, but its future impact on other Portuguese colonies in India. Foreign Minister Wang finally stated that the government will continue to negotiate.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] In order to recover Macau, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been continuously negotiating and contacting the Portuguese government for a year and a half. Recently, it also consulted with the Portuguese Envoy to China and raised the following questions, requesting a reply: (1) Does the Portuguese government acknowledge the principle of changes in the Macau situation? (2) Does the Portuguese government acknowledge the principle of reasonable national ideology? It is hoped that the Portuguese government can abandon its privileges and return Macau to China, but the Portuguese Envoy only said: "I cannot sign a reply now."

### Preparations for the Imminent Flood Control Project Proceeding Rapidly - Yellow River Dike Repairing Day and Night - All Sections in Shandong Province Can Be Completed Next Month

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] After the completion of the Yellow River's Huayuankou closure, the dike repair project is very arduous. Considering the upcoming flood season, the Ministry of Water Resources is now directing the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to supervise the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Three-Province Repair Offices, mobilizing workers and collecting materials to repair the dikes day and night. Currently, the dike repair work in Shandong involves approximately 80 kilometers, which can be divided into several sections: (1) The upper section from Zhukou to Zhuang has already completed 80% of the dike work and 90% of the dangerous works, and the entire section will be completed before the end of this month. (2) The middle section Daqi, from Zhuang to Ergaimin, and Kou to Zuoying have all been surveyed, and work is being actively carried out. The area below Shili is mostly mountainous, so the problem is smaller. It is now a shared vehicle area. In Hebei, the work involves approximately 70 kilometers, including: (1) Vigorously repairing the reinforcement work on two dangerous works from Gao Village to Liu Village. There is a collapse at Liu Village, which is being continuously repaired. Currently, there are 800,000 catties of shared materials, 750,000 blue bricks, 400,000 catties of willow branches, and 5,000 roots of wood. (2) The Mao Dian Xin Lian works and ditch dikes are scheduled to be completed before the big flood. (3) Strengthening the construction of the Fortress Old Juntang dam string project. In Henan, the work involves approximately 140 kilometers downstream from Huayuankou. The south bank repair work is progressing rapidly. The breaches at the Wuchekou and Donghongqiao sections of the main river channel have already been repaired. Regarding the allocation of funds for the entire restoration dike project: (1) Shandong has 29.3 billion, of which 18.67 billion has been allocated, (2) Henan has 19.4 billion, of which 13.26 billion has been allocated, (3) Hebei has 8 billion, of which 7.8 billion has been allocated. In addition, regarding the flood report, the telegraph and telephone lines have been connected from Huayuankou to Nanbeidian, and in two months, they can be connected from Nanbeidian to Linongji.

### UNRRA's Emergency Recommendations - Providing Special Steps for Consideration

[This city news] A few days ago, UNRRA announced an emergency measures plan for preventing the Yellow River flood in July this year, calling on relevant authorities to pay attention to this serious issue and take active steps to accelerate the process. (See this newspaper on the 26th)

In the recommendation, UNRRA detailed the background of the disaster, analyzed the current crisis, suggested active cooperation work plans, and, from UNRRA's perspective, provided special steps for the government and the Communist Party to consider, which are described as follows:

(A) Background

In 1938, the Yellow River dike in Henan Province collapsed, and the flood flooded 2 million acres of fertile land, and the homes of millions of farmers were destroyed. Later, the war continued for years, and the dike could not be repaired. Every summer, the flood repeated, so that the rural areas of the flood area in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces could not be restored. When UNRRA studied the China Relief Plan, it planned to guide the Yellow River water into its pre-war old channel to restore the flood area, so that millions of farmers could return to their homeland and find ways to increase food production. The dikes were repaired every year before the war, but during the enemy's occupation, the dikes were gradually eroded and collapsed. Therefore, the Yellow River management plan must be divided into two parts: (A) Huayuankou dam closure project, (B) Dike restoration project on both sides of the Yellow River. The dangerous part is the section from Huayuankou to the sea, which is 400 miles long.

The initial plan was to carry out the dam closure and dike restoration projects simultaneously. After the Japanese surrendered, it was realized that another project needed to be carried out urgently, that is, 1.24 million farmers had moved to the riverbed since 1938 and built villages, hindering the dike restoration and dam closure projects. Therefore, it was necessary to relocate and relieve these refugees. The complicated and difficult point is that the dam closure project is in the government-controlled area, and most of the dike restoration project is in the Communist-occupied area. When the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations were about to break down and the war zone expanded, the situation was unclear, making it difficult to transport workers and materials. Subsequently, the Executive Headquarters, the Water Conservancy Commission, and representatives of the Communist Party consulted several times, and UNRRA personnel were invited to participate in the discussions. Most of the meetings were held between July and November 1946, and January, February, and March 1947. The agreement was as follows: (A) The Water Conservancy Commission is responsible for assigning sufficient technical supervision, materials, and funding for the dike restoration project in the Kuomintang and Communist areas; (B) The Executive Headquarters is responsible for the relocation and relief of residents in the riverbed in the Kuomintang and Communist areas; (C) UNRRA's China Office will provide equipment and allocate personnel to assist in the dike restoration and relief work; (D) The Communist Party is responsible for mobilizing workers. In February and March 1947, the dam closure project entered the final stage. Unfortunately, the war zone in Shandong expanded, and without special measures, the dike restoration project would be difficult to achieve. The former Director of UNRRA's China Office, Egerton, specially suggested to the government that the entire Yellow River riverbed be declared a truce area, so that the dike restoration project could be completed smoothly, and requested the Communist Party representative in Shanghai to inquire with the Communist Party leaders about their opinions on this suggestion. However, the Communist Party did not reply. On the government side, Chief of Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense issued orders to the local Kuomintang commanders, instructing them not to interfere with the workers in the Yellow River area and to protect them. However, the people in the Communist area trusted the propaganda and believed that the government's dam closure and river diversion had ulterior motives, and failed to cooperate. The situation has worsened recently, so UNRRA believes that without effective steps, it will not be possible to prevent the disaster of the flood season.

(B) The Restrictions of the Civil War on the Dike Restoration Project

Due to the failure to fully comply with various understandings, relief supplies and Executive Headquarters and UNRRA personnel were attacked by the Communist army in the border area between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In the Communist area, UNRRA personnel were kidnapped by the Communist army, severely questioned, and often threatened with death. The Communist army also made unreasonable demands to UNRRA personnel to control the materials for special purposes. Due to the obstruction of the war, the travel and inspection of workers and the transportation of materials were greatly affected. The Yellow River riverbed and adjacent areas must be completely in a truce for six weeks, and urgently needed materials must be imported, otherwise the project cannot be completed, and the peach flood cannot be stopped. According to UNRRA engineer and Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission consultant Todd, according to the pre-determined agreement on payment of construction funds, it is necessary to transport 5,000 tons of flour and 20 billion national currency to complete the project in the Communist area.

(C) UNRRA's Recommendations

In order to save the Yellow River from flooding, the current steps that should be taken are: (1) Since the government and the Communist Party cannot directly negotiate at present, UNRRA should negotiate separately and ask both parties to immediately issue orders to stop military operations within five miles along the entire Yellow River from Huayuankou downstream from mid-June to late July; (2) The Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense should issue an order to the local military authorities, instructing them to protect the safety and passage of UNRRA materials and personnel; (3) An emergency supply plan should be drafted and approved for implementation immediately; (4) Relevant agencies should resolutely complete the various dike construction works that should be carried out in their respective districts; (5) Explain the importance and significance of this emergency plan to the local residents, and persuade the residents of the Yellow River Delta to relocate as soon as possible to avoid repeating the water disasters they suffered before the war; (6) In order to promote and implement the above measures, the Executive Headquarters Water Conservancy Commission and UNRRA should each send several senior representatives to form a delegation to inspect the Communist area in western Shandong, to show that the government and UNRRA have decided to devote their full efforts to prevent the Yellow River flood, and to obtain the cooperation of the Communist army's responsible authorities; if all parties can cooperate effectively, UNRRA's China Office is prepared to fully support this work, in addition to providing materials, technical personnel, and relief workers, and will assist in mediation at any time to promote the work, supervise the project, and save the disaster.

### Three Japanese War Criminals Who Massacred Overseas Chinese Executed by Hanging in Singapore

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 26th] Three Japanese war criminals here, who were responsible for the massacre of thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots in Singapore, were hanged at 9 a.m. today. The criminals were Lieutenant General Saburo Kawamura, Lieutenant Colonel Masayuki Onishi, and Captain Kosuke Ushiroji. The former two were originally sentenced to death in April this year. Although the latter was equally responsible for the massacre, he was sentenced to death in Kuala Lumpur last November for hanging an overseas Chinese without reason in Sangfu (Johor Bahru) before Japan surrendered. When the criminals were on the gallows, they showed some signs of mental disorder and shouted "Long live the Emperor" when they were hanged. Six relatives of the murdered overseas Chinese here attended the redress committee to complain. At the same time, two women represented the families of the murdered and said to each other, "Heaven will punish you."

### Executive Headquarters Allocates 500 Million Yuan to Urgently Remit to Guangdong to Relieve Disaster Victims and Orders the Branch to Distribute All Stored Sugar

[This newspaper news] In order to relieve the flood in Guangdong Province, the Executive Headquarters authorities specially allocated 500 million yuan yesterday and urgently remitted it to the Guangdong Branch for emergency relief. The branch was also ordered to immediately distribute all stored grain to relieve the disaster victims.

The branch and UNRRA and Guangdong Provincial Government personnel inspected the disaster area from the air by special plane on the 24th of this month and found that the flooding in the Han, Bei, Dong, and Xi Rivers was severe, affecting more than 30 counties. Among them, the Sanshui area near the West River is the most serious.

The Executive Headquarters authorities have also held an emergency meeting with UNRRA experts to discuss further relief measures.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th] A nine-member disaster relief investigation team from the Hong Kong Gold and Silver Trade Market, led by Chairman He Shanhang, came to Guangzhou to investigate the disaster situation in various places and brought HK$110,000, equivalent to approximately 700 million national currency, which will be used to purchase rice worth 500 million yuan and 200 million yuan in cash, which will be handed over to the Guangdong Flood Relief Association for distribution.

Disaster Situation Statistics

[United Press, Guangzhou, 26th] The Guangdong Provincial Flood Relief Committee officially announced today: The number of refugees in the disaster area reached 1,203,000, the flooded rice fields were 1,367,200 mu, and 90 local embankments were destroyed, with 18 breaches totaling 14,700 meters in length. The disaster area reached 33 counties and cities.

Causes of the Flood

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] According to relevant sources, the cause of the flood in South China this time is due to the abundant rainfall in each month of this year, which has increased the groundwater level. By early June, the rainfall in eastern Guangxi reached more than 200 millimeters, and the rainfall in a large area of Guangdong Province reached more than 250 millimeters. By mid-June, it increased to a total of more than 400 millimeters, coupled with thunderstorms, which eventually led to an unprecedented flood. According to the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, on the morning of June 1, the water level of Shilong in the northeast reached 11.03 meters, breaking the highest flood record in previous years. The foundations of the rivers collapsed, and the situation was very tragic. There were more than ten places such as Yanxiwei, Taipingwei, and Shilong Shitan on the East River, and many places such as Huayuan, Baitun, Huilong on the West River and many places such as Chenghai Changqiaocun front dike on the Han River, so the situation was extremely serious.

### Taiwan War Crimes Tribunal Trial: Xu Bing and Others' Conspiracy Case - Attempted Autonomy During Japan's Surrender

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] The Taiwan Provincial War Crimes Tribunal convened at 9 AM today to try the case of Xu Bing, Gu Zhenfu, Jian Langshan, Lin Xiongxiang, and Xu Kunquan of Taipei City, who were accused of plotting rebellion in August of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. According to the prosecutor's indictment, after Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15th of the previous year, the defendants Gu Zhenfu and others were incited by Major Nakamiya Goro and Yoshio Uezawa of the Japanese Army's Taiwan Garrison Headquarters on the 16th to form the "Taiwan Autonomy Committee." They drafted a plan for the organization and a list of committee members. On the 22nd, they met with the former Governor-General of Taiwan, Ando Rikichi, hoping to gain his support. However, when Ando met with them, he earnestly advised them not to act rashly, and especially not to create independence or autonomy movements. After hearing this, the defendants convened a meeting on the 24th of the same month, but besides reading Ando's statement twice, they did not discuss other matters, and the so-called autonomy proposal was also canceled. The case lasted only nine days from beginning to end. On the day when Zhenfu and others went to see Ando, the current Taiwan Provincial Government Committee member Du Congming and Senator Luo Wanbei also accompanied them. Furthermore, when the current Provincial Committee member Lin Xiantang led a delegation to pay respects to the motherland on August 31st of the previous year, Gu Zhenfu, Lin Xiongxiang, and Xu Bing, who are now defendants, were also members of the delegation. By February 21st of last year, when the five defendants, including Zhenfu, were charged, Japanese Army Majors Nakamiya Goro and Makizawa Yoshiten had already fled upon hearing the news, and their whereabouts remain unknown. During today's trial, Gu Zhenfu testified that Nakamiya did indeed discuss the matter of autonomy with him, but he immediately refused and did not participate in it. He also stated that he did not know what Nakamiya's intentions were. The other four defendants all denied ever being involved in the autonomy movement. When the judge asked them why they went to see Ando Rikichi, all five defendants stated, "A week after the Japanese announcement of surrender, the Governor-General had not yet issued a statement, and rumors were spreading in society. We went to see the Governor-General only to discuss how to maintain public order." The judge further asked, "If you had not been plotting autonomy beforehand, how would Ando have mentioned independence or autonomy?" The defendants all replied, "Ando's words may have been intended as a warning to Japanese soldiers like Nakamiya. There were also several Japanese officers and councilors present that day." Today was an investigative hearing, and no debate was held. The court adjourned at 1 PM. It is noted that Xu Bing and Jian Langshan once served as members of the Japanese House of Peers. Lin Xiantang was another Taiwanese who held such a position. Gu Zhenfu and Lin Xiongxiang had served as councilors of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. Xu Kunquan was a businessman who had served as a translator for the Japanese army for two months.

Editorial

### How Should We Cope with the New Stirrings of Prices?

Recently, prices have once again shown signs of stirring, with rice, flour, grains, yarn, cotton, cloth, oil, sugar, silk, rayon, daily necessities, and other items all gradually rising; occasional small dips are followed by large increases. This trend was anticipated by most people before the festival. The reasons, in addition to the end of the festival season and the revival of commercial activity, include many stimuli: (1) the cancellation of subsidies for public utilities, leading to increases in water, electricity, and transportation fares; (2) the unfreezing of the cost of living index, resulting in increased wages in general; (3) the expansion of war zones and increased traffic congestion; (4) a large influx of idle funds from the north to Shanghai; (5) the formal cancellation of the Supervisory Group and the reorganization of the Shipping Control Committee, suggesting a gradual loosening of economic controls; (6) despite occasional tightening or loosening of credit, the trend of increasing issuance of currency shows no sign of stopping; and (7) rumors of new taxes and increased commodity taxes. At the same time, the measures to suppress prices are limited to the local rationing of rice in this city, the continued rationing of sugar, and the continued provision of in-kind benefits to public employees and teachers, with no other new measures in sight.

The economic reform plan proposed by the Executive Yuan on the 20th of this month, although broad in content, places stabilization of prices as the first item in the first annex. However, the proposed methods are mostly focused on fundamental and principled aspects, and are far less severe in terms of symptom management and emergency measures than the emergency economic measures of February 17th. It is not mentioned in the new plan whether various price stabilization measures stipulated in the emergency plan, such as price negotiation, price limits, and crackdown on hoarding, will continue to be implemented in the future, suggesting a complete shift to laissez-faire. Furthermore, considering the permission to raise prices for public utilities, the conditional unfreezing of the cost of living index, and the trend towards explicit recognition of import-export linkage systems, it is clear that future price controls will adopt more moderate measures.

Although suppressing prices is a common desire, what is the effect of rigid, high-pressure methods? The world already knows. Therefore, even though prices are fluctuating and the authorities are claiming to resolutely stop them, little attention seems to be paid to the revival or tightening of past price stabilization measures. The factors contributing to rising prices are extremely complex, but the most important is the lack of supplies. With more supply than demand, prices will naturally stabilize. This law of supply and demand must not be violated. Therefore, although the various measures to increase production proposed in the new plan are inevitably protracted and difficult to achieve in the near future, there is still much material available for us to re-examine in this time of rising prices.

First of all, it is worth mentioning the various measures to directly assist production, such as: improving the industrial environment, guaranteeing industrial profits, supplying raw materials to manufacturers, and striving for reasonable wages. Indeed, the people's pursuit of profit is like water flowing downwards. As long as there is profit to be made, even if it means violating prohibitions and breaking the law, someone will risk danger and overcome difficulties to pursue it. How much more so in legitimate production activities? The reason why production is shrinking day by day and why entrepreneurs are hesitant to move forward is known to everyone, and everyone can talk about it. Therefore, how should the industrial environment be improved? How should industrial profits be guaranteed? And how should raw materials be supplied? How should wages be rationalized? We sincerely hope that the government will act immediately, come up with practical and concrete measures, and have the courage to implement them. Directly promoting production is indirectly suppressing prices. Otherwise, the original plan's call to stabilize employment, prevent unemployment, and provide maximum protection to existing production industries will remain empty promises and will not have any practical effect!

Secondly, there are measures to facilitate production activities, such as: promoting production through various loans or order placement methods; encouraging trade by maximizing the convenience of water, land, and air transportation; developing import and export business by adopting import-export permit linkage methods; organizing a Reconstruction Finance Corporation to invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects; and adjusting various taxes and simplifying tax collection procedures to suit the current economic environment. Although these measures do not directly promote production, they indirectly contribute to the development of production activities. In other words, the reason why production activities have not been able to develop is that the above measures have not been implemented, or conversely, they have encountered various negative obstacles. For example, regarding loans, the new plan explicitly acknowledges the existence of unreasonable methods such as pre-deducting interest and arbitrarily collecting handling fees. The hidden losses in export foreign exchange settlement and the difficulty in obtaining import foreign exchange have caused overseas remittances to be evaded and smuggling to be rampant, bringing legitimate import and export trade to a standstill. Furthermore, the difficulty of long-term financing, the deep-rooted malpractices of taxation, and the use of political power to facilitate private enterprises, resulting in the destruction of legitimate private industry and commerce, are all frankly admitted in the new plan. If these long-standing malpractices are not addressed with swift and effective action, production activities will be difficult to develop, and prices may not fall.

Thirdly, there are measures that directly contribute to stabilizing prices, such as: supplying cities with surplus materials; selling surplus materials; implementing rationing systems; absorbing idle funds with high interest rates; and, as mentioned earlier, supplying raw materials to manufacturers and adopting order placement methods. If the above methods can be implemented separately, the supply will be sufficient, and the channels for sales will be open, and the trend of speculation and hoarding can be gradually suppressed. Among the new plan, only the above items are considered to have relatively immediate effects. They are considered appropriate measures for stabilizing prices, and may even be far superior to rigid controls.

Now that this plan has been drafted and proposed by the Executive Yuan and has been submitted for review, at this time of price stirrings, we hope that it will be decided upon soon, and that the parts related to production and prices will be quickly translated into reality, so as to stabilize life and order. We feel that the government's response to this emergency situation seems a bit too calm. In peacetime, this might be appropriate, but at present, it should have the courage, perseverance, and decisiveness to make quick decisions. We also clearly know that this problem is too complex to be solved by a single method or even a single plan. However, having a method is better than having no method, and having a plan is better than having no plan. Since past control methods have been proven ineffective by the facts, and the authorities are determined to change, then we cannot help but expect this new plan to achieve a late success. The General Assembly of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss a joint proposal requesting the speedy implementation of this plan to rescue the economic crisis, which is also a reflection of public opinion.

### Foreign Ministers Meeting at French Foreign Ministry - Reviewing the Marshall Plan - Europe's Potential Division Faces Test

[United Press, Paris, 27th] The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and France began discussing the outline of the European Recovery Program meeting at the French Foreign Ministry at 4 PM on the 27th. Although the Secretary of State will not attend this "Marshall Plan Meeting," it is generally believed that it is the final consideration of whether Europe will be divided into a Western European group and a Soviet group.

[United Press, London, 27th] British and American authorities stated today that after negotiations this week between British officials and US Undersecretary of State Clayton, a "broad conclusion of the nature" has been reached, believing that the Marshall European Recovery Plan should be carried out outside of the United Nations framework. British Foreign Minister Bevin will propose at today's Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers Meeting that a separate agency be established outside the United Nations framework to handle the matter. This method is considered the best, because Germany has not participated in the United Nations organization, but its industrial capacity is a major cornerstone of any European recovery plan. It is heard that the Soviet side advocates that the US European Recovery Plan should be handled through the United Nations organization.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French Foreign Ministry officially announced that the meeting of the foreign ministers of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the Marshall European Aid Plan is scheduled to officially open on Friday evening at the French Foreign Ministry. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Paris this morning and continued his visit to Mr. Bidault this afternoon. Mr. Bidault personally went to the  Stone Airport to greet Mr. Molotov this morning. When Mr. Bevin arrives in Paris tomorrow morning, Mr. Bidault will also personally go to the airport to welcome him. Since US Treasury Secretary Snyder stated yesterday that the Marshall Plan has not promised to provide loan assistance to any European recovery plan, the success of the Paris talks seems to have very little certainty. An official from the French Foreign Ministry expressed extreme surprise at Mr. Snyder's remarks, stating that the French government must study his remarks in detail before expressing its opinion. The Paris talks are being held in an extremely urgent state. The rapid invitation of Bevin and Bidault and the acceptance by Molotov without waiting for the agenda to be decided proves that the foreign ministers of the three countries all hope to quickly reach an agreement to adapt to the US aid plan and enable the US Congress to take action before the recess or the start of the presidential election. At the beginning of the Paris talks, US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton will also be in Paris, ready to hold meetings with any of the foreign ministers if necessary. At the same time, Secretary Mitter of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe is also in Paris, ready to implement the Marshall Plan using the United Nations organization if the three foreign ministers decide.

[France Press Agency, Paris, 26th] Responsible persons here stated that the Soviet Union is now trusting the words and plans of the United States, and is earnestly studying the European Recovery Plan with Great Britain and France, so as to submit it to Washington. Although Soviet newspapers have many suspicious words about the Marshall Plan, Foreign Minister Molotov has led a delegation of 89 people to Paris. The primary task of the tripartite foreign ministers meeting to be held at the French Foreign Ministry is to draft this recovery plan. The future of the meeting is naturally full of difficulties, because every economic problem in Europe has political relations. This political problem was raised and discussed at the Moscow conference, which lasted seven weeks and could not be resolved. Therefore, in this Paris meeting, which will only last a few days, there is little hope of resolution. It should be known that various problems are interrelated. It is impossible to discuss the European problem without involving Germany, and it is impossible to discuss German industry without involving European security issues. The elimination of the Nazis cannot be separated from the economic system. The complexity of the situation can be imagined from this.

### Dubious Remarks by Snyder Spark Concerns: Truman Clarifies Position, Dispelling Discord Between Marshall and Snyder

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] President Truman declared at a press conference on the 26th that Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder were not at odds regarding the European Recovery Program. He stated that he and Marshall were in complete agreement, and that he, Marshall, and Snyder were also in complete accord. Truman's statement aimed to dispel rumors of discord between Marshall and Snyder. Snyder had stated on the morning of the 25th that Marshall's plan did not mean the United States was asking countries to submit their aid requests. Snyder had already retracted his statement by the afternoon of the 25th and corrected his remarks made earlier in the day at a press conference that same afternoon. Regarding whether the United States would implement the Marshall Plan with money or goods, Truman replied to reporters that the Secretary of State had already clearly

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Snyder's remarks, stating that the Marshall Plan did not obligate the United States to provide financial assistance, have raised two questions: (1) Does the entire U.S. government fully support Marshall's plan as presented at Harvard, and have European countries enthusiastically responded to it? (2) Is the government embarrassed by the excessive expectations of other countries regarding the Marshall Plan? The most reliable opinions affirm the first question, but the second is more difficult to answer.

When Marshall met with reporters yesterday, one asked, "Is the Marshall Plan understood to be a government plan?" Marshall replied in the affirmative. However, today's New York "Wall Street Journal" seems to disagree with Marshall. The newspaper stated that senior government officials are divided on whether to implement the massive Marshall Plan. They disagree on the urgency of providing aid, the amount of aid needed, the methods for requesting loans, and whether it is politically appropriate to pursue any expensive plan to achieve progress. The newspaper believes that the final decision on approving the Marshall Plan rests with Congress.

### French Cabinet Supports Bidault in Discussing Marshall Plan

[Special Dispatch] London, 27th (Broadcast): The French Cabinet unanimously approved on Friday the policy to be advanced by Foreign Minister Bidault at the Three Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Soviet Union's Bumper Harvest This Year May Influence World Politics

[United Press International, Moscow, 27th] This year marks the first bumper harvest in the Soviet Union since the Nazi invasion, which will significantly impact Molotov's discussions on the European Recovery Program in Paris. Reports of bumper harvests are coming from all regions of the Soviet Union, with yields in the "breadbasket" of Ukraine and Belarus exceeding expectations. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's bumper harvest will affect the development of the world economy and politics: (1) If the Soviet Union can supply grain to European countries, the latter will not need to seek assistance from other countries. (2) As a result of the first point, Eastern European countries can maintain an independent stance and adopt a unified and strong attitude when discussing the European Recovery Program. (3) The Soviet Union may export surplus grain to Western and Northern European countries, reducing their dependence on the United States, which may also include Britain (note: a British trade delegation is currently in Moscow negotiating the purchase of large quantities of Soviet grain). (4) The development of the Soviet grain trade further strengthens the Soviet Union's economic position in the world market.

### Yugoslavia Prepares to Participate in Discussions on U.S. Aid to Europe Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Yugoslav Capital, 26th] The Yugoslav News Agency has announced that the Yugoslav government has notified the governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France that Yugoslavia is prepared to participate in preliminary discussions regarding the Marshall Plan for the recovery of Europe.

### Large Quantities of U.S. Gasoline to be Shipped to South Korea

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] According to an announcement from Seoul today, the United States plans to import large quantities of gasoline and fuel into Korea in 1948. According to the plan, the U.S. intends to import 5,460,000 tons of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil, and 1,178,000 pounds of fats and oils into the southern part of the peninsula next year. The import of these materials will enable 10,000 Korean trucks to operate and provide light to 2.6 million Korean households. Kerosene will be used to supply the small number of Korean fishing boats.

### MacArthur on the Japanese Peace Treaty: Insists it Must be Concluded Within 18 Months; Predicts Japan Will be Able to Obtain Foreign Loans After Signing

[United Press International, Tokyo, 27th] MacArthur, meeting with a group of 16 American journalists traveling around the world on the afternoon of the 27th, stated that the Japanese peace treaty must be concluded within 18 months, regardless of the circumstances. He added that if there were no obstacles from the Soviet Union, the treaty could be completed within a year, and he would return to the United States immediately after the treaty was signed. MacArthur stated that the failure to conclude the Japanese peace treaty sooner was costing the United States one million dollars a day. After the withdrawal of the U.S. occupation forces from Japan, the United Nations must have the ability to control Japan; otherwise, the United Nations would be powerless to handle any world events. If the United Nations cannot assume responsibility for guiding Japan, then it can only ask the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission or some of its member nations to assume it.

He stated that after the withdrawal of the occupation forces, Japan must be subject to non-military supervision for at least a generation, and that Japan would not be a threat to world peace again for a hundred years. The important problems currently facing the United States and the world are how to revive the Japanese economy and help it boost its export trade. He also predicted that Japan would be able to borrow foreign loans after the peace treaty was signed.

China-Japan Relations

When asked what impact the situation in China would have on Japan, MacArthur replied that it was unfortunate for Japan, as the two countries should have normal and strong economic ties. Reviewing the situation in Japan, MacArthur stated that militaristic thinking was deeply rooted, and that before the war, 70 million people were controlled by 10 million, with the lives of the former being little different from those of slaves. He also pointed out that Japan urgently needed to solve problems related to food and fertilizer.

The Fate of East Asia

MacArthur concluded that Japan is the center of the world stage, and that the fate of one billion people in East Asia for centuries to come will depend on efforts to democratize Japan. If there is no outside interference, the United States will succeed in Japan. The progress of democratization in Japan has been very successful and continues to progress. Japan may be the most recent democracy, but it will undoubtedly be a good democratic system.

### Soviet Participation in Three Foreign Ministers Conference: U.S. Ambassador to Britain Expresses Optimism, Saying All Countries Should Eliminate Feelings of Animosity

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, addressing the American Chamber of Commerce here this afternoon, expressed optimism regarding the Soviet Union's participation in the conference of the Foreign Ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. He stated: "The Soviet Union has decided to participate in the Paris conference of the three Foreign Ministers and to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe in a spirit of full cooperation. This will simplify our work and give us greater confidence in the success of the conference. There is no reason why all countries cannot work together to promote the recovery of all countries affected by the devastation of the world war. However, the recovery of Europe cannot be achieved if countries incite fear and animosity among their peoples. I cannot help but hope that all countries will cooperate to solve various problems. As for Britain and the United States, we are cooperating in international finance and should move forward together, cooperating with countries that share the same lofty ideals. This has been the case in the past, and it will continue to be so in the future."

### Guam Requests Compensation for Wartime Losses

Expected to Receive $10 Million

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Commander Maud of the Judge Advocate General's Corps told reporters today that the people of Guam are seeking approximately $14 million in compensation for wartime damages. The U.S. Navy estimates that $10 million will be paid as compensation. The damages include personal injuries and property losses inflicted by Japanese and U.S. forces during the battle for Guam, as well as damages resulting from Japanese atrocities.

### Acheson, MacArthur's Advisor, Declares Japan Will Receive Economic Assistance; U.S. Journalist Says Japanese Still Have Totalitarian Ideas

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] Acheson, Chairman of the Allied Council for Japan and advisor to MacArthur, gave a speech at the American School here today, expressing his belief that Japan will become a cooperative member of the international community. He stated: "We have lived, studied, and worked under the leadership and inspiration of MacArthur. MacArthur is a soldier and a statesman, one of the great figures in American history. MacArthur's decisions address chaos with order, and another wise and far-sighted policy adopted by MacArthur is to prohibit interference in ordinary administrative measures, except where necessary. Some foreign newspapers believe that this move is tantamount to supporting conservative forces, which is a misconception. The United States will continue to exert a favorable influence, and Japan will receive financial and economic assistance to become self-sufficient. I am optimistic about Japan's future."

[United Press, Kyoto, 26th] A United Press journalist recently accompanied Major General Wooten L. Lasche, commander of the U.S. First Corps, on an extensive tour of the occupied areas. U.S. military officials unanimously believe that reforms are minimal in the densely populated areas of southwestern Japan and that they must be supervised by the Allied forces for several years or even 30 years to be effective. It is said that the people have undergone considerable changes since the U.S. military entered Japan, but they have not fundamentally severed ties with their past totalitarianism. If the U.S. military withdraws, Japan will return to the rule of its former masters. The control mechanisms in Tokyo are insufficient to provide a guarantee for continued democratization. The northern and southern halves of the peninsula are mainly agricultural and industrial, respectively. Some wartime factories are allegedly being used to produce agricultural implements to avoid paying reparations. Equality and constitutional government are alien concepts to the Japanese people and are expected to develop only slowly. Although they are eager to learn new American ideas, they still adhere to old customs and obey the feudal class.

### Japan Again Attempts to Covet the Yaeyama Islands; The Islands Are Actually Chinese Territory

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Since Foreign Minister Ashida made a statement expressing his hope to reclaim territories such as the Ryukyu and Kuril Islands, it has aroused strong reactions from various countries. Newspapers here have also published reports of a temporary motion by the Shanghai Municipal Council, transmitted by China's Central News Agency, expressing absolute opposition to the Japanese administration of the Ryukyu Islands to the government. However, the Japanese government and public do not relax their efforts, and opinions are frequently published in newspapers. The "Sekai Nippo" here recently published a special article entitled "Today's Problem," discussing the matter and quoting the entire report on the occupation of the Ryukyu Islands published by MacArthur's chief of staff, Weaver, on the 11th of this month, intending to falsely attribute Ashida's delusional attempt to MacArthur's headquarters. The article cited Instruction No. 156 issued by the Naval Military Government (referring to the Ryukyu Islands) on April 22, 1946, establishing the Okinawa Central Government and organizing an advisory council composed of Okinawan natives as directors. Ashida and the general Japanese public used this to believe that the United States intended to return administrative power over Okinawa to the Japanese. In the Yaeyama Islands, the governor of the islands is also encouraging local residents to demand that the islands be incorporated into the Okinawa Central Government. In fact, the Yaeyama Islands and the Ryukyu Islands should not be confused. The Yaeyama Islands are actually an integral part of China's inherent territory. Among Japanese historians, there are not a few who acknowledge this fact. As for the Ryukyu issue, it was discussed at the Cairo Conference, and it is expected that there will be a debate on the issue at the future peace conference with Japan. Ashida's raising of this issue at this time is likely due to excessive nervousness after reading the report of MacArthur's headquarters. Our government and the general public should also prepare early before this issue arises to avoid being taken advantage of by the Japanese.

### Australia to Protest Japanese Mining on Palau Island

Japanese Antarctic Whaling Fleet to Depart Soon

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] The Australian government is about to lodge a most serious protest against MacArthur's headquarters' permission for the Japanese government to take over the mining of phosphate on Angaur Island in the Palau Islands of the South Pacific. The island is the closest to Australia among the Japanese mandated islands. A senior Australian official here stated that MacArthur's action was the most unbelievable action. The official pointed out that Angaur Island was a mandated island of the League of Nations and was not within the scope of MacArthur's headquarters' authority. The Allied Council for Japan was not informed of this decision by MacArthur's headquarters. Angaur Island was one of the bases for the U.S. military's counterattack against the Philippines.

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] A whaling fleet of 15 ships, led by the 11,000-ton mother ship " Nisshin Maru No. 1," will soon sail to the Antarctic Ocean. " Nisshin Maru No. 1" participated in the first Antarctic whaling operation last year.

### Soviet Union Mobilizes Youth for Industrial Training

[United Press International, Moscow, 26th] An official gazette published here today stated that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has ordered the mobilization of a large number of young people. All men aged 19 must be part of the labor reserve force for coal mines and heavy industry. Previously, the maximum age stipulated was 17; now it has been raised to 19. The minimum age will likely be set at 15. In addition, boys aged 14 to 17 and girls aged 15 to 16 will be trained in commercial and railway schools. It is estimated that after implementing this measure, 425,000 more boys and girls will receive this training this year.

### Perilous Situation in the Dutch East Indies: Sjahrir Forced to Resign; Overseas Chinese in Indonesian Areas Ordered to Relocate

[Reuters, Yogyakarta, 27th] After Sjahrir's resignation, Indonesian Republic President Sukarno has assumed full presidential powers to deal with the government crisis. Sukarno personally signed the response to the recent supplementary memorandum proposed by the Dutch today. Although the contents are unknown, reliable sources believe that he will reject Sjahrir's recent recognition of Dutch East Indies Governor General Van Mook's legal status in the interim federal government and suggest that while Van Mook should be a member of the government, he should not have the right to vote.

[United Press, Indonesian Capital, 27th] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno took over the government today after accepting Prime Minister Sjahrir's resignation. Sjahrir resigned due to political disagreements during an all-night cabinet meeting, which was accepted. The President instructed the old cabinet members to remain temporarily until a new cabinet is formed. On the day of Sjahrir's resignation, various Indonesian political parties were united in opposing his policy of making concessions to the Netherlands to avoid armed conflict. Sukarno is scheduled to respond to the final Dutch note today, opposing further concessions. According to those around the President, Sjahrir will remain as acting Foreign Minister until a new cabinet is formed. Neutral observers believe that the downfall of the Sjahrir cabinet symbolizes the failure of the Indonesian moderates and foreshadows a breakdown in negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands, which may lead to military action. Dutch officials here today did not comment on Sjahrir's resignation, while an Indonesian spokesman said, "Only a miracle can save the Indonesian military from armed conflict with the Dutch military."

[United Press, Amsterdam, 26th] The pro-Communist Central Trade Union Federation of the Netherlands announced today that it has invited the Socialist Trade Union Federation to immediately discuss a general strike to be implemented if the reactionary Dutch troops attempt to resolve the Indonesian issue by force.

[Reuters, Batavia, 26th] The Chinese Consulate General in Batavia officially announced today that due to the tense situation between the Netherlands and Indonesia, Chinese residents in Indonesian villages have been ordered to relocate to Dutch-controlled areas.

### Greece Suddenly Accuses Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania Before the Security Council

[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] As the Security Council reached a final decision on the Balkan issue, Greece suddenly made a surprising motion on the 26th, accusing Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of international aggression. This accusation by Greece, based on the Charter, may be the most serious situation. Western countries may take measures against Greece's three northern neighbors that are more far-reaching than previously expected. Britain and the United States may have been notified in advance of Greece's action and endorsed it as the procedure for the Security Council's debate. If the Greek accusation is passed by a majority of countries and the Soviet Union does not use its veto, it could defeat the arguments of the three Balkan countries in the Security Council. However, the Soviet Union may use its veto to strike down this severe motion.

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 27th (Broadcast): The U.S. representative to the United Nations accused Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria of aiding guerrillas in northern Greece, which "violates several basic principles of the United Nations Charter."

[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] Albania submitted a note to the Security Council today, stating that it cannot allow the United Nations investigation team to enter its territory arbitrarily. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have also submitted similar notes.

### Austrian Foreign Minister Issues Statement: Determined to Fight for Independence and Freedom; Large Quantities of U.S. Food to be Shipped to Austria for Relief

[United Press International, Vienna, 26th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber recently declared at a meeting of the People's Party Executive Committee: "Unless there are international guarantees that Austria will not become a vassal of communist-controlled neighboring countries and their governments, Austria will refuse to continue cooperating with these countries. The movement promoted by the Communist Party in the Balkans to establish close economic ties is meaningless, as these countries, after intensifying their industrialization, will lose their original function as food-exporting countries. If the government adopts a moderate policy toward the Austrian Communist Party, our political freedom will completely collapse. In short, the government will never sign treaties that endanger Austria's interests, but hopes to sign a peace treaty as soon as possible, as Austria's failure to achieve freedom will hinder its cooperation with major powers."

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] A State Department spokesman announced today that the United States will ship eight vessels of grain to Austria from this week to the end of July. The Warwick Victory is scheduled to leave the United States this week loaded with flour for Austria. The remaining seven shipments of grain, including wheat, flour, and sorghum, will also be shipped to Austria successively in July. The Austrian government has expressed its deep gratitude to Secretary of State Marshall for the $350 million worth of relief supplies awaiting shipment under the U.S. account after the end of the Allied Control Council.

### British Aid to China Fund to Continue Activities

### U.S. Labor Law Bill: Truman Guarantees Implementation

The new labor law bill was enacted after Congress overturned President Truman's veto. President Truman had called it "impracticable," and in the past few days, several groups, in view of the bill's passage, have demanded that President Truman not obstruct its implementation because of his opposition to the bill.

General Strike Avoided

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] After emergency consultations with the Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor, President Green has decided not to accept the requests from local unions for a general strike to protest the new labor law bill, but will instead fight the bill through legal channels. Green also said that the American Federation of Labor will engage in political organizing to defeat members of Congress who supported the bill.

[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, Washington, 26th] President Truman today vetoed another important bill passed by Congress (namely the Wool Bill), marking the third time this month that Truman has overturned a Congressional bill. The Wool Bill stipulates that restrictions should be further imposed on the import of wool. After refusing to approve the bill and returning it to Congress, Truman submitted a message stating that enacting this bill at a time when the United States and seventeen countries are negotiating in Geneva to eliminate trade barriers is a "deplorable mistake." If passed rashly, foreign countries will inevitably believe that the United States is tending towards a return to "economic isolationism." After the U.S. Senate accepted Truman's veto, it immediately returned the original proposal to the Agriculture Committee. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives today submitted another similar bill, without import restrictions, to the Senate for consideration. This bill, passed by the House of Representatives, authorizes the President to regulate the import volume of wool and impose import taxes to raise domestic wool prices to near the government-supported prices.

### Relieving the Housing Panic of Tens of Thousands of Households; Right to Lease Allotted Housing; Senate Firmly Advocates Extension; Principles for Handling Decided, Letter Sent to Municipal Government and District Court Yesterday

[Reported by This Newspaper] Due to the severe housing shortage in the city, the Municipal Senate resolved to find a solution during its First Session of the Second Congress. The Land Administration Committee of the Senate reviewed the results and decided on five principles for handling the issue. Yesterday, the Senate sent separate letters to the Municipal Government and the District Court, requesting that the lease rights of residents in allotted housing be extended in accordance with the Senate's resolution to avoid causing civil disturbance *. The reasons and measures stated in the Municipal Senate's official letter to the District Court are extracted as follows:

A. Reasons: In the First Session of the Second Congress of this Senate, it was noted that the housing shortage in the city is severe. Once the unified leasing method originally stipulated by the Executive Yuan expires, landlords will inevitably use this as an excuse to reclaim the properties. The original organizations, groups, military personnel, government employees, and teachers living in allotted housing will certainly be unable to relocate, thereby causing social unrest. Therefore, it was passed to extend the unified leasing period, which was sent to the government for investigation and handling. Among the landlords in the city, there are certainly not a few who can comply with the Senate's resolution, but there are also many who attempt to lease the properties to others after the expiration of the unified leasing period. There are even those who refuse to sign leases despite legal allocation by the government. As a result, disputes have arisen repeatedly, which is not a blessing for the city. Furthermore, after the victory, the government agencies in Shanghai responsible for receiving and allocating enemy and puppet-owned leased housing included the Japanese Residents Management Office, the Three-Service Military, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, the Shanghai Municipal Government Materials Takeover Office, and the Executive Yuan Housing Allocation Committee for Various Agencies in Shanghai. At that time, the number of organizations, groups, military personnel, government employees, and teachers who were legally allocated housing and moved in was in the tens of thousands of households. If they were forced to relocate, how would these people find a place to live in the midst of this severe housing shortage? The government's takeover of enemy and puppet-owned leased housing was originally a result of the eight-year victory of the War of Resistance. What was taken over was the enemy and puppet's right to lease and sell, which does not conflict with the landlord's rights. This Senate, as a local public opinion organization, should urgently make a decision on a solution to this serious problem to uphold the prestige of the previous congress's resolution.

B. Measures: (1) This Senate should declare again that for all legally allocated housing by government agencies, landlords should sign contracts with the allottees who hold official allocation certificates; otherwise, they will be deemed to have forfeited the right to the rental income, and no litigation will be allowed. (2) Although the unified leasing period has expired, if the allotted tenants have no rent arrears or other illegal conduct, the landlords should continue to lease to the allottees, and others should not be allowed to compete for the properties. (3) The lease rights (claims) of all enemy and puppet-owned original leased housing should not be confused with the landlord's property rights (real rights), and they should not be discussed together as a basis for claims. Since the occupants have been legally allocated the housing by the government, the right to lease the housing for their residence and use has clearly been granted to the current occupants by the government. Having acquired the claim, the landlords may not lease to others. (4) This Senate requests the judicial authorities to pay attention to lawsuits related to housing legally allocated by government agencies and to make careful judgments to avoid increasing disputes by using the courts. If the regular occupants have no rent arrears or illegal conduct and are sued for eviction by the landlords on the grounds of having another lease, please consider Articles 71 and 72 of the Civil Code and, based on the previous resolutions of this Senate, presume that the contract is invalid and dismiss the lawsuit. In particular, please pay attention to applications for provisional execution. If the current occupants are unable to fulfill their obligation to pay rent due to the landlord's refusal to sign a lease, the current occupants should be allowed to deposit the rent with the court. (5) For all legally allocated housing where the landlords have sued for eviction and the initial trial has ruled for eviction, the judicial authorities should provide appropriate relief in the appellate trial.

### Public Utility Prices to Rise Again by 100%

All public utilities in the city, including electricity, tap water, streetcars, buses, and gas, will undergo a second price adjustment. The adjusted prices have been calculated by the Public Utilities Bureau and are being taken to Nanjing by the mayor for discussion by the Price Commission. It is reported that the electricity price of the Shanghai Electric Power Company will increase to around 1,201 yuan per kilowatt-hour. The selling prices of other French and Chinese companies will all be above 1,000 yuan per kilowatt-hour. The selling price of tap water from Anglo-French water and electricity companies will increase to around 800 yuan per word. Other companies in Zhabei and inland areas will also be around 800 yuan per word. The prices of streetcars, buses, and telephones will all increase by about 100%.

### Mayor Goes to Nanjing to Seek Instructions on Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices; Municipal Meeting Decides to Form Economic Inspection Reporting Committee

[Another Report] Since the economic investigation work has been handled by the municipal government, the municipal government, in view of the recent fluctuations in prices in the city and in order to crack down on speculation and stabilize prices, held a detailed and concrete discussion on this issue at yesterday's municipal meeting. It is reported that the meeting has decided in principle to organize an "Economic Inspection Reporting Committee," which will be chaired by Shen Zonglian, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and will include representatives from the Police Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant agencies.

### High Court Sends Letter to Shanghai Municipal Government Yesterday to Investigate the Crimes of Arrested Students; News of Scheduled Interrogation is Inaccurate

[Our Dispatch] Since the families of the arrested students in this city applied to the High Court for interrogation in accordance with the Interrogation Law, the society has paid great attention to this. According to a senior official of the High Court, the High Court is extremely cautious about this. After several considerations, it is difficult to decide whether to apply the Interrogation Law and interrogate within 24 hours because the case is quite complicated. Therefore, a compromise was adopted, and the Shanghai Municipal Government was sent a letter yesterday, asking it to investigate the case and whether the crimes committed by the arrested students meet the conditions for interrogation. Only after the Municipal Government replies can a decision be made on the application of the students' families. It is also heard that if it is a crime of internal strife, it must be investigated by the High Procuratorate; if it is an ordinary criminal case, it must be investigated by the District Procuratorate. The news of the scheduled interrogation published in a certain newspaper in this city is not true.

### Star Island Kicks Star Union in Third Battle: 5-3 Victory

[Special Dispatch from Our Singapore Correspondent] Star Island's second leg of their European tour was a challenge in Singapore as scheduled. After arriving in Singapore, the team first drew 3-3 with the Singapore Chinese team in their first match. In the second match, they fought bravely and won 5-1 against the Military Union team. In the third encounter, they met the All-Star Union team. With the entire team fighting hard, the Tiger team once again reported victory with a score of 5-3. In fact, the Star Union team was quite valiant. The three forwards were particularly skilled. Xie Wenliang and He Yayi on the left side performed even better. Unfortunately, the whole team was not calm enough. Although they maintained a 1-1 draw in the first half, they could not hold on in the second half and eventually lost.

Feng Jingxiang and Zhu Yongqiang played the best for Star Island's forwards, while defenders Xu Jingcheng and Hou Rongsheng also showed their skills. The Tiger team played with a newly arranged lineup in this battle. Let's see how both sides deployed their troops:

Star Island

Liu Tianshen, Yu Yaode, Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Song Lingsheng, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Zhu Yongqiang, Feng Jingxiang, Gao Shanlong

Singapore Union Team

Tong Bo, Lu Te, La Shou, Xia Nvfu, Wa Si, Li Simo, He Yayi, Xie Wenliang, Zhuo Zhenyu, Kang Shansai, Sha Madang

Union Takes the Lead First

After the whistle blew, the Union team launched a fierce attack. Tianshen repelled the enemy, and Sha Madang's shot went wide. Three minutes later, Jingxiang led a counterattack. Zhaorong's low shot was caught, and Gao Shanlong's fierce kick missed, just adding to the excitement. The Union team launched another urgent attack. Wenliang advanced alone, tricked Rongsheng, and passed the ball out. Zhenyu took the opportunity to shoot. Yu Yaode couldn't reach the ball and had to let the Union team score the first victory.

Equalizer

Wenliang came again, and Yayi shot wide, startling Yaode. Then the Tiger team counterattacked. Yongqiang dribbled along the sideline. Seeing the enemy defender chasing closely, he crossed the ball. Jingxiang reacted quickly, ran forward to meet it, and swept a shot from the ten-yard mark. The ball went crisply into the net. 1-1. Before the break, both sides fought hard to maintain the equal score.

Ending with 5-3

Changing formations and fighting again, Star Island's attack was very strong. Yongqiang and Songsheng scored one after another, leading 3-1. After nine minutes, "Divine Leg" flew in alone, tricked the goalkeeper, and pushed the ball into the net, making it 4-1, earning cheers from the entire stadium. After this setback, the Union team launched a full-scale advance. After fifteen minutes, the left wing took advantage of a misunderstanding between Rongsheng and Tianshen to score a goal, bringing it back to 4-2. In the last ten minutes, Yongqiang scored again for Star Island, while Wenliang turned around and shot the ball into the net in the chaos. Each side added one goal, and the game ended 5-3, with the Union team losing.

If he wins, he will meet Australian second-ranked player Pierce in the semi-final week. This battle is Falk's most important test.

[Reuters, Wimbledon, 26th] There were no major upsets at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships today, but under the heat wave, some matches were quite intense, with players "sweating like rain." All seeded players have entered the final sixteen. The men's singles is gradually becoming a competition between the United States and Australia, like the Davis Cup consolation round. France still has three representatives led by the defending champion Dela. There is not a single Englishman among the final sixteen, indicating the low level of British tennis. Seven of the eight seeded players won in straight sets. Only Tom Brown defeated former British junior champion Baxter in four sets, 6-2, 6-2, 10-12, 6-4. Kramer defeated Italian Coselli 6-0, 6-2, 6-0. Australian Bromwich, Kramer's main rival, demonstrated the most perfect technique, defeating French Testra 6-1, 6-1, 6-1.

### Table Tennis League Finals First Battle: Shanghai Star Defeats Hualianhua in Tense Match Ending 5-2

The first battle of the second Shanghai Table Tennis League finals kicked off at 8:00 PM the night before at the Yokohama Bridge Central Auditorium. There were more than 600 table tennis fans in attendance, creating a lively atmosphere. Referees Shen Bohong and Chen Linsheng gave the order to start the match. The teams competing were Group A champion Shanghai Star against Group B runner-up Hualianhua. Hualianhua fought with the mentality of facing certain defeat but put up a surprisingly tense performance. Li Fei narrowly defeated Shanghai Star's new player Huang Zisong after a dramatic five-game battle. Veteran Zhou Weixin's short shots were divinely transformed, making the opponent's left-handed hard hitter Cheng Aixin almost flustered and unable to counterattack for a while. The former lightly defeated Cheng Aixin in straight sets, showing that the old general is still formidable. Shanghai Star's veteran Li Zongpei was absent, and Wang Changhou, who's known for his draws, was also not in top form. The impact on strength was significant. Ultimately, relying on the victories of veterans Chuan Qifang, Xue Xuchu, and Yu Cheng, as well as the contributions of Huang Gaoyuan and Huang Zhijun, they finally defeated Lianhua 5-2. Judging from this record, it was not outstanding. There are many strong opponents ahead. If Shanghai Star does not work hard, it may face the danger of an upset. There are no matches today. Tomorrow night (the 29th), Group C champion Hualian will meet Group C runner-up Postal B again. The results of the first final are recorded below:

(Shanghai Star) (Hualianhua) (Score)

Yu Cheng Gu Jinxiang 3-1

Fu Qifang Xu Zhifu 3-0

Xue Xuchu Liu Baotai 3-1

Cheng Aixin Zhou Weixin 0-3

Huang Gaoyuan Lu Yunzhang 3-0

Huang Zhijun Qin Yuheng 3-1

### Government Formulates New Method for Purchasing Export Materials

The government's purchase of export materials has been carried out by the Export Promotion Committee, the Central Bank, the China Trust Bureau and other relevant agencies to jointly organize the agency purchase committee to carry out the purchase. It is learned that the government will formulate a new method for purchasing, and the three ministries of finance, economics, agriculture and forestry are jointly studying. Before the new method is established, the purchase business will continue as usual. Regarding the opinions of tung oil and pig bristle exporters, who recently hoped that the price would not be lowered and that the purchase would be made at the export port, the government will also give special consideration to the new method.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Early Rice Reaches New High, China Planting Factory Sells Large Quantities of Edible Oil

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice market continued to rise yesterday due to the intermittent sunny and rainy weather, rice boats were delayed, and the source was relatively scarce. And because other prices are rising, people are optimistic, and special goods are unwilling to sell lightly, waiting for a good price to sell. The price of thin glutinous rice reached a new high of 495,000 yuan, and regular white glutinous rice was 500,000 yuan.

The number of goods registered in the market was 3089 shi and 5 dou in Nanshi and 3992 shi in Beishi. White glutinous rice was 495,000 yuan in Beishi, and 10,000 yuan less in Nanshi. Thin glutinous rice was 495,000 yuan in Beishi, and 5,000 yuan less in Nanshi. Early rice was 485,000 yuan in Beishi, and 10,000 yuan less in Nanshi. Western glutinous rice was 445,000 yuan in Beishi, and 30,000 yuan less in Nanshi. Milled indica was 400,000 yuan in Beishi, and 15,000 yuan less in Nanshi. White yuan was not available in Nanshi, and was 460,000 yuan in Beishi. Yin yuan was 420,000 yuan in Nanshi.

Due to the rise in the interior, people's minds were excited, and the price of flour rose sharply by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Bran turned from slack to smooth, and rose by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were traded but not prosperous, and rose slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yingkou cakes remained mediocre. The actual sales of soybeans were still weak, and slightly tight by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Green beans were continuously purchased from Nanyang and rose by 10,000 yuan again. Red beans were continuously purchased from Guangdong, rising step by step, and increased by more than 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were tired in the morning and stable in the afternoon, with no glory or disgrace. Red sorghum was tight and corn was firm.

Under the heavy absorption in South China, raw peanuts formed a rare commodity, and the price was rising crazily, continuing to gallop by more than 20,000 yuan. Sesame was scarce and profitable, high and more solid, continuing to rise by 10,000 yuan.

The oil market was booming with the acceptance from Guangdong, and the buying atmosphere was strong. Raw oil soared by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, soybean oil also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and clear oil rose by another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Tea sesame oil continued to rise by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and the future situation still depends on the digestion in other ports.

Another message: In order to curb the rising tide of edible oil and crack down on speculators hoarding, the Social Affairs Bureau specially instructed the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association yesterday, instructing its members to urge all customers to withdraw all goods previously sold on the stock certificate within ten days, otherwise they will be severely punished. After receiving the instructions, the association held an emergency meeting of members at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and decided to comply with it from today.

It is also learned that yesterday's oil price rose by 40,000 yuan from the previous day due to the heavy absorption of raw oil from Guangdong. The prices of soybean oil rose by 10,000 yuan, and the prices of clear oil and sesame oil rose by 20,000 yuan each. In addition to the routine rotation of selling edible oil to 600 oil shops, the China Planting Oil Factory has also been selling a large amount of oil to the market in recent days, and the price is reduced by tens of thousands of yuan compared to the market price. Yesterday, it sold 1.145 dan of raw oil and 800 dan of soybean oil. A total of more than 20,000 dan has been sold this week, with Su oil accounting for the largest quantity. In view of the current fertilizer application season in rural areas, the factory also sold a large number of planting bean cakes yesterday, and each piece was also reduced by more than 4,000 yuan compared with the market price, reducing the burden on farmers.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Lennox Simoes Co., managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver yesterday, carrying 45,000 bags of calcium powder purchased by the China Trust Bureau, and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading.

### Artificial Silk Trading is Sluggish; Factory-Processed Silk Goods are Priced Higher Than the Previous Day

Yesterday, artificial silk prices declined again due to sluggish trading and a dispirited market sentiment. In the morning, lot 120 of Kosan Yuko (高山有光) was offered for sale at a minimum price of 2,378,000 yuan, but the noon closing price was 2,400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the downward trend slightly reversed, with the highest price reaching 4,500,000 yuan, but the final asking price was 4,300,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Lot 75 of Golden Rooster semi-luster silk also declined in price accordingly, with an asking price of 3,300,000 yuan, but there were few inquiries.

Although the market conditions for factory-processed silk goods were quiet yesterday, asking prices were about 2,000,000 yuan higher than the previous day. High-quality "Uniform Grade Five Ancestor Head" silks had no transactions. The previous day, there were transactions for 20 bales of foreign goods, at 560-thread count, priced at 3,500,000 yuan with a one-week forward contract. Yesterday, only odd-lot transactions occurred, with medium-grade goods priced between 3,100,000 and 3,200,000 yuan. Higher-grade odd-lot "C" grade split bales were priced at 3,350,000 yuan, and "D" grade split bales were priced at 3,200,000 yuan. The outlet for dry-processed silk was severely lacking, and market prices showed no improvement. Yesterday, there was an odd-lot transaction at 2,100,000 yuan.

Yesterday, silk goods, real silk bedding, and plaid "Bi" (璧) fabrics continued to rise in price. American Asiatic (美亞) bedding had very few orders, with asking prices reaching as high as 13,000,000 yuan. Dachen (大誠) bedding was not sold at 2,350,000 yuan. Huaqiang (華强) bedding was initially offered at 2,000,000 yuan, then the asking price was raised to 2,100,000 yuan. Dachen (大誠) plaid crepe opened at 43,000 yuan, but because there were more sellers than buyers, the price weakened and fell from 2,800-2,900 yuan to 2,600 yuan. After much support in the middle of the day, prices gradually rose, reaching 3,000 yuan, then closing at 3,700 yuan, with a forward price of 4,000 yuan, ultimately 400 yuan higher than the previous day. Huajin (華錦) crepe prices decreased by 1,000 yuan due to the lower price of artificial silk. Rayon (羅紡) prices were reported to be rising in the producing areas, and the Shanghai market increased by another 500 yuan yesterday, with a selling price of 16,000 yuan per tael.

### Multi-Party Incapacity to Support; Chinese Stocks Trend Weak

Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced a high opening followed by a decline in Yong Yarn (永紗), as hopes for Sino-American loans diminished, and the forward delivery association (遞交會) set a new high price of 10,150 yuan. However, due to continued tight credit conditions and a discount rate of 4.5%, and because the forward delivery association's (遞交體金) cash deposit requires a 50% cash payment, scheduled to be implemented in the next session and announced within days, multiple parties were unable to provide further support. Trading was sparse, and the market showed weakness under the conditions of excessive supply, closing at a low price. However, small-cap stocks such as New Light (新光), China Silk (中絲), and American Asiatic (美亞) remained quite firm.

At the opening, stocks opened high due to reports that hopes for Sino-American loans were dwindling. After Yong Yarn (永紗) opened, lots 142, 76, 112, 129, and 22 all rose, reaching a new high of 10,150 yuan. Lots 85, 185, 224, 14, and 171 were liquidated at high prices, causing the price to fall to 9,700 yuan. Lots 173, 235, 32, and 76 were bought at the lower price of 9,850 yuan. Buying interest in lots 224, 117, 152, 142, and 180 returned, pushing the price down to 9,580 yuan. Lots 224, 197, 219, 157, and 216 were bought at the lower price of 9,750 yuan, and lots 152, 97, 213, 154, 155, and 112 were sold again at 9,570 yuan. Buying appetite for lots 169, 85, 235, 89, and 103 remained healthy, while lots 152, 231, 228, and 157 were sold, fluctuating between 9,550 yuan and 9,700 yuan. Lots 153, 218, 154, 36, 32, 235, and 76 entered the market, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraph reached 10 yuan, rising to 9,880 yuan. Lots 231, 224, 85, and 234 were still liquidated at high prices, falling back to 9,650 yuan. Lots 117, 104, 190, 232, and 213 entered the market, and at 11:40, the price rose again to around 9,900 yuan. Lots 94, 76, 157, 224, 76, 155, 199, 231, 112, 217, and 36 were all liquidated, and news that a public announcement of a 50% cash guarantee would be issued within days and implemented from the next rollover date caused a severe decline at midday. Before closing, the price fell to a low of 9,240 yuan, supported by lots 105 and 91, ending at 9,310 yuan. After the close, asking prices decreased slightly, but American Asiatic (美亞), New Light (新光), and China Silk (中絲) remained stable. The results compared to the previous closing price showed slight increases for New Light (新光) and Jingfu (景福), a half-percent increase for American Asiatic (美亞) and New China (新華), slight decreases for Yong Yarn (永紗), Xinyi (信和), Qinxing (勤興), Sino-French (中法), and Yonggong (永公), a half-percent decrease for Huafeng (華豐), and flat prices for Commercial Press (商務), National Goods (國貨), Jinglun (景綸), Cement (水泥), and New Asia (新亞). Lian (麗安) fell 20%, Match (火柴), Tongyi (統益), and China Textile (中紡) fell half a percent, Rongfeng (榮豐), China Textile Five Harmony (中紡五和) slightly decreased, Datong (大通) increased half a percent slightly, and Innerwear (內衣) increased slightly. Forward delivery stocks showed flat prices for Jingfu (景福) and Qinyu (勤與), slight increases for New Light (新光) and American Asiatic (美亞), and about a half-percent decrease for Yong Yarn (永紗), Xinyi (信和), Huafeng (華豐), and Yonggong (永公). In the over-the-counter market, except for Nanyang (南洋), which increased half a percent, the remaining old stocks showed slight increases and decreases.

### Unified Bonds Sluggish; Foreign Stocks Decline

Public bonds were even more sluggish. Unified Class C opened at 8,400 yuan. Rooms 503 and foreign banks slightly bought, pushing the high price to 8,500 yuan. Room 230 and others liquidated their positions, causing the price to close near the 8,000 yuan mark. The transaction volume was only 2,000,000 yuan, a slight decrease of 100 yuan compared to the previous closing price for Classes A and B, a 200 yuan decrease for Unified Class C, and flat prices for Classes D and E.

Foreign stocks began to decline yesterday. Securities firms and the Northern clique sold off, while foreign merchants and Chen (陳) made purchases. However, with a large amount of Great Kangcheng's (大康成) inventory being released, and a substantial amount of Jardine Silk (怡紗) being offered, the environment returned to normal. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraph rose from 11 yuan to 10.02 yuan. Jardine Silk (怡紗) opened at 93,000 yuan and gradually declined to close at 88,000 yuan. The results compared to the previous closing price showed a one-tenth decline for Conder (會德), Ye Guang (業廣), Paper Industry (紙業), and Jardine (怡), slight decreases for Steel Industry (鋼業) and Telephone (電話), and a half-percent decrease for Jardine Silk (怡紗), British American Tobacco (英聯), Shipping Industry (航業), and Seed Industry (製種).

### Tea Market Steady

Yesterday, the domestic tea market saw purchases of various grades by local shops and Suzhou merchants. For export tea, Wuchang Tea Company (午昌茶葉公司) and foreign firms like Wing On & Co. (永興) and Tung Foong (同孚) showed interest in last year's old tea, resulting in active trading and a generally stable market sentiment. However, the exchange between buying and selling ultimately felt weak, continuing a fluctuating trend. With the year-end settlement approaching for money houses and tight credit conditions, the selling side had difficulty raising prices, resulting in a very stable base price.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise by 10,000 to 340,000 yuan, with purchases remaining strong. The Public Association set prices for Peruvian sand sugar at 680,000 yuan, Number 20 medium sand white at 610,000 yuan, Taiwanese red sugar at 550,000 yuan, and Number 3.5 refined white sugar at 670,000 yuan. Few local sugar offerings made for a very tight market. Xinghua (興化) white sugar in bags was priced at 580,000 yuan for high-quality sugar and 540,000 yuan for sugar in baskets. Xinghua (興化) red sugar was priced at 440,000 to 450,000 yuan, totaling about 400 pieces. Shantou (汕提) green sugar initially went for 420,000 yuan, then rose to 426,000 yuan and 430,000 yuan. Cotton red sugar was priced at 500,000 yuan, totaling about one hundred bales. Diaozhi (刁靑) sugar was priced at 385,000 to 390,000 yuan, totaling about one hundred bales.

### Resources Commission Revises Purchase Prices for Tungsten and Antimony

The Resources Commission has revised the prices for specific minerals as follows: (1) The purchase price for tungsten sand is 5,000,000 yuan per metric ton. (2) The purchase price for raw antimony is calculated at 70% of pure antimony, which is 3,500,000 yuan per metric ton.

### China Trust Bureau and Kailuan Coal Mines Negotiate Coal Exchange Method; 80,000 Tons of Flour for 100,000 Tons of Coal

To address the coal shortage in Shanghai, the Central Trust Bureau is not only ordering foreign coal from areas such as Bianluo (邊羅) to be transported to Shanghai for sale, but also plans to negotiate with domestic coal mines to purchase coal for transport to Shanghai. Among domestic coal mines, Kailuan (開灤) coal mine has the highest output this year. However, given the high price of grain, the miners at the Kailuan (開灤) mine have a substantial need for grain. Therefore, the mine is seeking to exchange grain for coal from the Central Trust Bureau. After negotiations between the two parties, the Central Trust Bureau has decided to exchange flour for coal from the mine. The Central Trust Bureau will soon transport 80,000 tons of flour to Kailuan (開灤), and Kailuan (開灤) will transport 100,000 tons of coal to Shanghai, which is expected to resolve the coal shortage in the city.

Fuel Management Committee to Increase Coal Allocation Prices on July 1

The Fuel Management Committee, due to increased transportation costs and mine prices, which have increased costs, will adjust allocation prices again starting July 1. The allocation price for coal to factories and transportation companies, originally adjusted to 457,000 yuan per ton, will now be increased to 540,000 yuan per ton. The central government continues to subsidize coal allocation for public utilities this month, so the coal allocation for public utilities this month will remain at 125,000 yuan per ton. Starting in July, the central government subsidy will be canceled, and the allocation price will be adjusted.

### Cigarettes Surge Then Slightly Retreat

At the opening of the cigarette market yesterday, the market sentiment was still bullish due to strong demand from all parties. In the afternoon, tight credit conditions caused some selling, leading to a slight decline in market sentiment. By the end of the day, the price of ten-pack "Great Britain" cigarettes fell by 30,000 yuan from the previous day to 7,620,000 yuan, and "Haddow" cigarettes also fell by 100,000 yuan. The "Old Blade" (老刀) and "Five Flowers" (五華) brands were relatively stable, rising by 10,000 to 70,000 yuan. The market sentiment for other fast-selling brands of Chinese-made cigarettes remained solid, but brands that were being distributed experienced a decline.

### Cloth Market's Rising Trend Slightly Halted

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a slightly subdued buying trend due to the authorities' plans to take strict measures, and all parties were wary. As the end of the month approached and credit conditions tightened, industry participants unanimously sold off at high prices, causing market sentiment to decline. By the end of the day, the prices of all grades of 12-pound fine cloth fell sharply by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. The markets for bleached cloth, coarse cloth, grey cloth, twill drill, and straight tribute cloth also experienced declines of 5,000 to 20,000 yuan. However, blue cloth, "Shilin" cloth, and "Yuanfu" silk saw price increases of 13,000 to 40,000 yuan.

Spinning Construction Sells Yarn

### New People, New Policies

— Taiwan's Solutions to Unemployment
 Taipei, 23rd (Airmail) Special Correspondent Jiang Yun (江雲) of This Newspaper

The February 28 Incident (二二八) provided Taiwan's rulers with new factual lessons: to seek stability from afar, and to pursue progress and prosperity in stability. The biggest focus in stability is on unemployment relief.

Taiwanese compatriots often cite the Japanese occupation as a source of dissatisfaction, and the employment problem is a common point of attack used by those from other provinces. However, it is difficult to obtain an accurate number of unemployed people on the island of Taiwan. Those who are disappointed are used to being intimidated during the Japanese rule, and they avoid cooperation or deliberately evade surveys, fearing disclosure of their employment status, resulting in inaction. The provincial assembly has proposals to solve unemployment, but lacks statistical reports. The figures provided by local governments at all levels are also not entirely accurate, forcing the Department of Civil Affairs (民政廳) to conduct a re-survey. In fact, of the 120,000 Taiwanese who have returned to the province from overseas and other parts of China, most had no previous occupation. At least half of them need employment, plus the true number of unemployed skilled workers in various sectors, it is estimated that there are about 60,000 to 80,000 unemployed people. Most of these are young people who could not find a foothold outside the province and returned full of enthusiasm in the year after the peace.

These unemployed people cannot withstand the high pressure of prices. Although they have requested the government to provide employment as soon as possible, the government cannot easily arrange jobs for them, resulting in disruptions to public order and social unrest. Currently, the authorities are following a path to resolve the issue. This is a new beginning with new policies, and people have high hopes.

Public Land Leasing Can Accommodate 140,000 People

Zhu Foding (朱佛定), Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, has provided a concrete and practical plan that will be submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The main aspect is the leasing of public land (limited to farmland), including: (1) 20,000 chia (甲) (equivalent to 280,000 mu 畝) of self-operated farmland allocated by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, with one chia per household and six people per household, can accommodate 20,000 households, 120,000 people. (2) Nineteen airfields requisitioned by the Japanese have been designated for civilian use and can accommodate 7,000 people. (3) Other lands owned by companies and agencies such as pineapple farms and the Hekoto (合拓) company may be allocated for leasing and resettlement of farm laborers, which can accommodate 2,331 households, or 13,986 people. The total number of people accommodated is 140,000.

The budget that the government has decided to provide is 800 million yuan for equipment and operating expenses (including housing, farm tools, and living expenses of 314,284 yuan per household). This budget does not affect the provincial budget but is drawn from the rental income from the consolidation of public lands.

Immigration and Land Reclamation Require 120,000 People

Land reclamation is a difficult task. While solving the unemployment problem, it also increases production and disperses the excess population in the cities. Taiwan Province has 130,000 chia (甲) (equivalent to 2,600,000 mu 畝) of reclaimable land, including grasslands, barren mountains, sandy lands, and saline-alkali lands. According to surveys, 24,000 chia (甲) can be leased this year, and surveys are planned to be completed within four years, which can accommodate over 200,000 households, or 122,500 people.

Land reclamation is not about "grabbing sandy fields." It requires planning, encouragement, and protection, and must be seen as a key aspect of governance. For this reason, the government needs a large budget to build public dormitories, supply farm tools, provide production equipment, and cover operating expenses, estimated to cost NT$2,177,223,000.

The source of funding is the rental income from public lands in the 35th year of the Republic, income from the suppression of illegal cultivation, income increased after consolidating land titles, allocations from cooperative farms and the sale of Japanese assets, and loans from the Land Bank.

The land reclamation period is set at three years, with a five-year exemption from land taxes. There will be a specialized management agency, and a land reclamation office will be established under the county government to be responsible for guidance and supervision.

Even now, the Japanese have not forgotten their "special" right to "immigrate" to Taiwan. We must make good use of and operate the former Japanese immigrant villages.

Large Engineering Team is a First in China

When Chen Yi (陳儀) left Taiwan, he left Chairman Wei (魏) with an unfinished task: to resettle unemployed workers and form an engineering team of tens of thousands of people to engage in large-scale construction. This unemployment relief plan is based on the "Splending Policy" that people criticized Roosevelt for, which is to launch large-scale public works projects to relieve a large number of unemployed skilled workers. This plan was proposed by Fei 費, the former director of the Public Works Bureau. Director Chen Yi was prepared to implement it, but the reorganization of the provincial government caused him to hand it over to his successor.

Yang Jiayu (楊家瑜), the director of the Department of Construction, is also deeply concerned about this employment problem. He hopes that General Manager Wu Wenxi (吳文喜) of the Engineering Company can provide a concrete implementation plan. General Manager Wu firmly opposes the management of a large-scale engineering team by the military. He advocates adopting a contracting system at centralized construction sites and a subcontracting system in some construction areas. He hopes to implement this groundbreaking relief plan without wasting money and does not want there to be more workers than engineers or for the government to pay more than the workers benefit.

Currently, the Engineering Company is launching a warehouse project to store 400,000 tons of sugarcane production this year. This warehouse project is widespread throughout the province, urgently needed, and of great quantity, scheduled for completion by the end of the year. The direct workers required are approximately 1,625,000 people, of which technical workers account for approximately 70%, or 9,500 people, and ordinary workers account for approximately 30%, or 4,000 people. The indirect workers required are approximately 148,000 people, of which technical workers account for only 1,500 people, and ordinary workers account for 8,600 people. In total, the project requires approximately 11,000 technical workers and 12,060 ordinary workers. For the scattered warehouse projects throughout the province, a subcontracting system will still be used to ensure the progress of the project itself and to relieve unemployed workers. The Warehouse Project Committee will coordinate the number of unemployed workers and their skills in each county and city and allocate them to contractors for employment, reasonably assessing their wages. Capable unemployed workers will be recruited by contractors as basic workers, so that they do not lose their jobs again after the work is completed.

The formation of a large engineering team is a first in China, and the centralized management and funding of these unemployed workers in Taiwan are issues that deserve consideration.

The Unemployed Have the Power to Stabilize Society

Being a Taiwanese compatriot is a blessing, a blessing bestowed by the eight-year War of Resistance. In the interior of China, where there are fires everywhere and insecurity everywhere, it is difficult to survive, let alone build. However, here, we are actively engaged in reconstruction. The people have requests, and the government always tries to solve them. The government always hopes that the people will understand things that it cannot do.

Solving the unemployment problem is a trial that the Taiwanese unemployed are giving to the new provincial government. We should not regard it as merely a theoretical matter but as a giant task requiring strong perseverance. The authorities need to take the matter seriously, and the people must participate enthusiastically. In particular, the unemployed themselves need to understand that they have the decisive power to stabilize social order.

The realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood is not just a resounding slogan but a pragmatic countermeasure aimed at reality and put into practice.

### Today's Postal Service

— Tang Xichun (湯錫椿)

China's postal service has always adopted a "self-supporting" policy, meaning that postal revenue covers postal expenses. Before the war, prices were stable, and the postal service was able to be self-sufficient. Since the War of Resistance, prices have soared, and transportation costs and operating expenses have increased sharply along with prices. However, postal rates have not kept pace with inflation, leading to increasing financial losses for the postal service. It is estimated that the losses were 45 million yuan in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), 145 million yuan in the 31st year (1942), 72 million yuan in the 32nd year (1943), 715 million yuan in the 33rd year (1944), 74.88 billion yuan in the 34th year (1945), and 862.9 billion yuan in the 35th year (1946). The estimated losses from January to May of this year are approximately 90 billion yuan. Although the government provides some subsidies, the monthly losses are still alarming. The causes of the losses can be analyzed as follows:

(1) Soaring Prices and Rapidly Increasing Expenses: Postal revenue is restricted by postal rates, which cannot be increased in a timely manner. However, postal expenses increase at any time along with the surging prices, such as postal transportation costs, business equipment costs, and all administrative expenses. For example, the current postal rate for a regular letter is 100 yuan, while the printing cost of each stamp is already 38 yuan. If a regular letter requires two stamps, the cost of the stamps alone is 76 yuan. If the letter is mailed at a postal agency, the agency fee must also be deducted. The remaining amount is definitely not enough to cover the transportation and delivery costs of a letter. Another example is the mailing of newspapers, where only 10 yuan is charged per bundle. The printing cost of one stamp is 38 yuan. If newspapers are delivered free of charge without stamps, the cost would be 28 yuan less. It is estimated that the post office loses more than 4 billion yuan per month on the delivery of newspapers alone. The losses are even greater for the delivery of other printed matter and books.

(2) Postal Rates Too Low and Rate Increases Too Late: Currently, general prices have increased more than 20,000 times compared to before the war. Postal rates, calculated by comparing a regular letter for 5 fen (cents) before the war with 100 yuan for a regular letter today, have only increased 2,000 times. The increase is not proportional to the increase in prices, and the timing of rate increases lags far behind inflation. For example, the rate for a regular letter increased from 2 yuan to 20 yuan on October 1 of the 34th year (1945), and then increased to 100 yuan on November 1 of last year, remaining unchanged until today. However, prices are changing rapidly. With a revenue of 2,000 times the previous amount, bearing expenses of more than 20,000 times, losses are inevitable.

(3) Decline in Parcel Business and Increase in Letter Volume: Before the war, transportation was smooth, and commerce was developed. The postal service received and delivered more than 9 million parcels per year. Therefore, parcel revenue was a major source of postal income. Now, however, domestic warfare continues, and transportation is disrupted. The parcel business cannot be developed. In the 35th year (1946), only 740,000 parcels were received and delivered, which is one-thirteenth of the pre-war volume. The business has plummeted. However, letter volume is increasing day by day due to low postal rates, especially registered and express letters. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the average monthly volume of letters received and delivered was 73,473,000. In March of this year, it has increased to 94,046,000. Because postal rates are low and do not cover costs, the more letters are received and delivered, the greater the losses.

The reasons why the postal service's finances cannot be sustained are roughly as described above. How to compensate for the losses is a matter of urgent importance. If the government operates the postal service for the purpose of facilitating the people, it should not calculate costs. All postal losses should be subsidized by the government to achieve the goals of "stability," "speed," and "comfort." If the postal service is operated according to the "self-supporting" policy, then the setting of postal rates should at least barely cover costs, so that this public service agency can continue to maintain and improve its operations. Which path to choose should be a clear decision for the authorities, and they should not waver between the two. If subsidies are not sufficient and rate increases are not enough, it will create the current situation of being neither dead nor alive.

In the past, postal rights were in the hands of foreigners. Personnel administration and financial control were completely independent. After the Northern Expedition, although the postal service was formally incorporated into the transportation administrative system, the authorities have consistently adopted the "self-supporting" policy for the postal service. The postal service is entirely responsible for solving its own revenue and expenditure issues. When there is a surplus, the excess funds are used to improve operations. When there is a loss, the passive solution is to strive to tighten finances, reduce staff, and cut expenses to reduce expenditures. The active solution is to increase postal rates to compensate for the losses. Or both passive and active solutions are used. In short, one's own difficulties are solved by oneself, without relying on the government. Personnel administration is also a separate system, not allowing anyone who has not passed the examination to enter the service, and not allowing anyone who has violated the law or committed fraud to remain in the service. The glorious history of the postal service in the past was entirely built on the policy of economic independence and independent personnel administration. However, since the War of Resistance, due to the drastic changes in prices and the various restrictions on postal rate increases, the postal service's finances cannot be controlled independently, leading to a difficult and desperate situation. Under these circumstances, the postal service is still striving to improve. Recently, there have been demonstration post offices, all-night post offices, and mobile post offices in Nanjing and Shanghai. At the same time, ordinary mail is being transported by air as much as possible, and mobile post offices are being added to trains. Local mail is delivered on the same day. All of these are providing great convenience to the people, whether they are improving service or expediting delivery.

Since China's victory, the political issues have not been resolved reasonably, and everything is in disarray. Among the state-owned enterprises today, the postal service is probably the only one that can be praised. However, the postal service is now struggling in a very difficult economic situation. Although it relies on the continuous promotion of the excellent personnel system and spirit, it can barely manage to improve. However, even a skilled woman cannot cook without rice, and labor cannot be sustained for long. The postal service is an essential institution for serving the people. We cannot do without the postal service for even one day. We cannot sit idly by in the face of the current economic crisis facing the postal service. We hope that the government will quickly devise effective remedies to maintain its service functions and enable this business with 50 years of glorious history to continue to create a more brilliant future.

### Singing for the Fresh Troops of the Air Force - A Record of the Anniversary Celebration of the Re-establishment of Jianqiao Military Academy

— Hangzhou, 25th (Fast News) - Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this Newspaper

The cradle of the Chinese Air Force - Jianqiao Air Force Officer School, held its anniversary celebration of its re-establishment, together with the graduation ceremony of the 24th class students. It was a solemn and lively scene, leaving everyone with unparalleled joy.

The 24th class students joined the most heroic and glorious aerial combat against the enemy during the most difficult stage of our War of Resistance. They responded to the call for educated youths to join the army and enlisted in Kunming successively in December of the 33rd year of the Republic of China. The examinations were particularly strict, and it was not until January of the 34th year of the Republic of China that they completed the work that new recruits should be responsible for before entering the school for rigorous training. Among them, there was also an examination to go to India. At that time, nearly 400 people participated in the examination, including those from Chengdu West China University and Wangjianglou Sichuan University, etc., and their number exceeded one-half. On April 14th, they completed the will that every air force officer must make in advance. In May, they flew over the Hump to Tingjiang, Bengal, India, and then took a train westward to Lahore, Punjab, the cultural center of India. In the lower sentence of this month, they began flight and ground education. After two full months of the first stage of preliminary training, except for a part that was eliminated due to physical changes or lagging in flight progress, each student of the 24th class was able to independently drive a "Stearman" training aircraft, soaring in the sky of a foreign country, freely circling up and down.

Returning Home After Completing Studies

After completing the first stage of study, they began to be sent to the United States in batches to receive joint training for the replenishment of Allied Air Force personnel. Nearly 300 people went to the United States. At this time, because Japan surrendered unconditionally after August, 25 students of the 24th class who were going to the United States were stopped.

The 24th class students who went to the United States took a boat from Lahore to Calcutta, through the Suez Canal, out of the Strait of Gibraltar, and landed in New York, the most prosperous city in the United States. They first enlisted at Genter Field, then studied elementary flying at Good Fellow Field, intermediate flying at Landorlff Field, and advanced flying at William Field. They had already completed their studies in June of this year and began to return to China one after another, totaling more than 200 people.

First Batch of Self-Trained

The 25 students of the 24th class who stayed in Lahore followed the school headquarters back to Hangzhou. During the year of the school's re-establishment, they completed their studies through intermediate and advanced training. This was the first batch of graduates in China to resume self-training after the victory. Among the 25 of them, 21 completed their studies, confirming that China has the ability to establish its own national defense cadres. General Mao Bangchu, Deputy Commander of the Chinese Air Force, who was in charge of supervising the education of students sent to the United States, said: "The 24th class students in the school and the 24th class students who went to the United States completed their studies at the same time. Although there is a distinction between domestic and foreign in terms of region, the supervisors and instructors at all levels who are in charge of elementary and advanced flight education in this school are mostly those who have returned to China after studying or training in the United States, so the education methods, techniques, and other aspects of attainments are completely the same, and there is no difference."

Elimination Rate

Among the nearly 400 people who entered the school, the total number of students who have graduated inside and outside the group is now more than 200, and the elimination rate accounts for more than 35%.

Among the 21 graduates in China, the first place was Liang Yansheng, with a total score of 87 points, and he also won the first place in flying. Nearly 100 of them were eliminated, and most of these 100 people were due to the reduction in physical fitness and flight energy. However, in the 24th class, such an elimination rate is already very low. Currently, there are still the 25th and 26th classes receiving training in the school, and the 27th class has also begun to enroll.

The graduates of the 24th class will be assigned to the troops for probation. At present, the air transport work is also urgently needed, and a part will be selected to serve in the Air Force transport unit. After a short period of probation, they will take on the task of air transport in the long sky of the motherland. As for serving as instructors in the school, that will be a very small number, and they will also need to receive specialized training as instructors.

Fresh Troops

Hu Weike, the director of education at the Air Force Officer School, was extremely excited to see that so many fresh troops had been added to the current Air Force. After the grand graduation ceremony, he personally drove a plane to perform spectacular stunts to show his joy. General Liu Muqun, commander of the Air Force Training Command, also happily told reporters: "The quality of the 24th class students is excellent. These many fresh troops participating in the Chinese Air Force will be a huge force."

On this day of the first anniversary of the re-establishment of the school and the 24th class graduation ceremony, all officers and students of the school and guests participated in the grand and solemn ceremony, followed by watching a friendly basketball game between the air forces of Shanghai and Hangzhou, and then the 24th class graduates performed an aerial review. It was a huge group of planes, forming a strong aerial great wall, proudly flying in the vast space. They are giant eagles capable of self-defense, spreading their iron wings and relentlessly monitoring the rampant foxes and rabbits. The people on the ground were fascinated by this soaring and heroic aerial procession, and everyone looked up and watched with joy.

On that day, the Air Force School had three banquets: lunch was a potluck, the afternoon was a cocktail party, and the evening was another potluck. At 8:00 p.m., a solo concert by Ms. Jiang Ying was held. Her melodious voice unfolded, just to sing praises for the addition of fresh troops to the motherland's air force.

Primary School Students Care About Construction

Wujin Yutang Town is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Historically, the government's promotion of government orders and all construction has been lagging behind. The opinions that I want to disclose are as follows: This town is not developed in terms of commerce because of the inconvenience of water and land transportation. The waterway (Zao Port River) is unsuitable for navigation due to years of disrepair and siltation. According to the elders of this town, it was dredged once in the 19th year of the Republic of China, and has not been dredged since. In August last year, the Construction Department sent personnel to survey the river. The town office immediately sent a letter requesting assistance from the Relief Administration to dredge the river, but it has not been realized. The land route (Longxu) highway was forcibly built by the people during the enemy's occupation and was completed hastily. Public buses used to run on it last year, but they were stopped due to frequent dangers on the road surface and bridges. Therefore, when this town has important matters to contact the county government or the district office, it can only send people on foot. I hope that the government will improve the Yongli transportation in this town, quickly dredge the river and restore the highway to traffic, and at the same time set up rural telephones. (Sheng Xing, a primary school student in Yutang)

The Xinjiang Incident Ignites Anger

The Foreign Mongolian army illegally invaded my Xinjiang Baitashan. In addition to the government authorities having issued a solemn statement, the people of the whole country are indignant. This column, according to letters from readers Sun Deliang, Li Xiyang, and other gentlemen, is limited in scope and excerpts its main points as follows:

Foreign Mongolia originally belonged to my country's territory. After the victory, the government, in order to follow the Prime Minister's last wishes to support ethnic autonomy, allowed it to be independent, but instead repaid kindness with hatred and invaded my territory. This is intolerable. All of our people should urge the government to take effective measures based on the position of territorial integrity, and never make any concessions. On the one hand, we appeal to the armed communists to abandon party disputes, unite sincerely, as in the period of resistance against Japan, and concentrate their efforts to resist foreign aggression. On the other hand, everyone should stick to their posts, bury their heads in construction, and consolidate national defense. When it comes to the survival of the nation, everyone should raise their vigilance, etc.

### An Unprecedented Catastrophe in Thirty Years - Flooding in the Four Rivers of Guangdong

— Guangzhou, 20th (Air News) - Special Correspondent Liang Feng of this Newspaper

Since the beginning of summer, torrential rains have been pouring down day and night in various parts of Guangdong Province, without a single sunny day from late May to late June. As a result of such continuous rain for more than a month, the East, West, North, and Han rivers in the province have experienced flash floods, like thousands of horses galloping, pouring out and causing flooding and widespread suffering. In addition to the thirty counties in the four river basins, even the counties in southern Guangdong and Qiongya have recently suffered serious flooding, so the scope of the current flood disaster has actually spread throughout Guangdong Province. This is the only situation seen since the so-called "Yimao Flood" in the 4th year of the Republic of China, and it can be said to be an unprecedented catastrophe in Guangdong in the past thirty years!

Irresistible Natural Disaster

Guangdong is a coastal province with low-lying terrain. The four rivers of East, West, North, and Han all pass through the province and out to sea. Every summer, due to the large amount of rainfall, the river water level will inevitably rise, so the residents along the river have built dikes to prevent flooding. This is like building fortifications. From the upper reaches of the river, dikes are built one after another as defense lines to resist the enemy of floods. However, sometimes there is too much rain. The flood cannot be discharged in time, the water level rises, and the water flow becomes faster, so the defense lines on both sides are easily broken by the flood, causing flooding. The "Yimao Flood" in Guangdong in the 4th year of the Republic of China was because the dikes along the northwest rivers were all destroyed at that time, and even the most solid defense line guarding Guangzhou - the Shijiao Garden between Qingyuan and Sanshui - was breached, causing two-thirds of the area in Guangzhou City to become a swamp, with water reaching the doorposts. The number of displaced victims throughout the province reached millions, and the severity of the disaster can be imagined. Although this reporter has never personally witnessed the situation at that time, I once heard my family members mention it when I was a child, and the terrifying impression is still very deep. Who would have thought that today, thirty years later, just after the end of the restoration period and the beginning of reconstruction, when the people are still struggling, this irresistible natural disaster has descended, causing an unprecedented tragedy in thirty years, how can people not sigh to the sky!

The East River Flood Area is the Widest

The disaster area in the province is now the widest in the area flooded by the East River, while the intensity of the water and the depth of the flooding are the greatest in the Northwest River. Let's talk about the East River first: the flooded area includes Longchuan, Heyuan, Zijin, Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, Dongguan, Huaxian and other counties. The famous dikes along the river, such as Yanwo, Fulong, Xihu, Taiping, Hanxi Sluice, Guanghe, Zhizhou, Puwei, Wuxiang, Liyuzhou, and the newly built Ma'anwei, were all destroyed one after another, causing Heyuan, Zijin, Huiyang, etc. to be generally flooded throughout the counties. Among them, the disaster in Huiyang is particularly serious, and the water level is three feet higher than Ma'anwei, so the fields and houses are all covered by water, and the families and livestock are naturally gone. The number of victims gathering on the mountains to avoid the disaster reached more than 200,000. The houses in Heyuan County were also completely submerged, and 300 to 400 houses were washed away, and more than 100 people drowned. In the Shilong area of Dongguan, there is a vast expanse of water for hundreds of miles. The entire city of Boluo is in the water, and the villages near Guangjiu Road in Zengcheng have been completely submerged, with more than a thousand houses collapsing, and the number of villagers who drowned is even impossible to investigate. In the Han River basin, which is also in eastern Guangdong, the affected areas include Chenghai, Chaoan, Chaoyang, Raoping, and even Wuhua, Meixian, and Xingning counties, among which the disasters in Jianan and Chenghai are relatively serious.

The Tragedy of the West and North Rivers

As for the West and North Rivers, the disaster situation may not be as tragic as that of the East River, but the losses and serious situations may be even greater; because the floods in Guangdong in previous years have been the most violent in the west. The West River enters the country from Wuzhou in Guangxi, and the water flows down from high to low at the fastest speed. Moreover, it merges with the North River in the southwest town of Sanshui, and then flows out to sea through the Pearl River Delta in Nanhai, Xinhui and other counties; therefore, the area below Sanshui is commonly known as the Northwest River. There, because the two rivers compete for flow, the water势 is even more fierce. The Pearl River Delta area is all a rich area, the land is fertile, and the crops are very abundant, so the losses from the flood are also very large. Now, the county seat of Qingyuan in the North River basin has been completely submerged, and the water depth is more than ten feet in the lower-lying areas; SiHui, Conghua and other counties also have many floods, and the situation in the West River is even more serious; Yunan, Deqing, Ducheng, Yuecheng and other places are at the forefront of the West River's entry into the country, and the dikes along the coast have been breached; the county towns have been submerged for a long time, and thousands of houses have been submerged, and the victims have been displaced, and they have no food or shelter, and the situation is unbearable to witness. Further down the West River, the Bu Dayuan, Liantang, Gongxin, Yong'an, Huilong, and Fengle Gardens in Gao Yao have also collapsed one after another; the Xinjiang Dayuan, which has not yet been completed, has been broken again, and the nearby 30 villages and tens of thousands of acres of good farmland have been completely submerged. The Yaoming Thirteen Gardens, which are known as the Guangdong demonstration country, are now in danger. Among them, the Dasha Garden has been breached, and 20,000 acres of farmland have been submerged. If the breach collapses again, Gaoyao and Gaoming counties may be completely submerged. Zhaoqing, an important town in the upper reaches of the West River, has long been sailing on the road, and the water is over the knees even in the highest areas of the city; business has almost completely stopped, and the power plant has been unable to start due to flooding, and the entire city has become a dark world!

Guangzhou is Fortunate Not to Have Suffered a Major Disaster

As for the situation in Guangzhou, because the water level has not reached the "Yimao" record after all, it has not caused a major disaster; however, the low-lying areas in the city have long been invaded by floods; now the streets on the Xiguan Dongdi Henan Yibang have been completely flooded, and the water depth ranges from one foot to five feet; and the areas of Zhutang, Nan'an, Fangcun, Huangsha, etc. have become a vast expanse of water, completely becoming swamps. Residents have been taking small boats to temporarily take refuge in higher places, and many more are carrying their sons and daughters because their houses have been flooded, and they are sleeping on the streets, and the situation is very embarrassing. Especially on the 18th and 19th, because it was rumored that Shijiao Dike had collapsed, everyone was anticipating the tragedy of the "Yimao" flood, and they were even more panicked, thinking that a great disaster was about to come, and they really could not eat or sleep; the security authorities also regularly sent police to patrol all night, reporting the changes in the water situation at any time, so that citizens could prepare to escape. Although it was confirmed on the 20th that Shijiao Dike had not collapsed, the water level in the city still rose without receding, and the citizens' anxiety had not diminished. Moreover, due to the floods in various places, the transportation outside the city was almost completely cut off. The Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, Guangwu, Guangsan and other lines could not be opened due to the road surface being submerged; the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was also suspended for a time, but it has now been restored. The bridges and culverts on the highway have been mostly washed away, and the losses are more than 3 billion yuan, so the highway vehicles in the province have almost completely stopped; the river ferries have also been afraid to sail due to the tight water flow; as a result, all commercial sectors have been greatly affected; and various daily necessities have been in short supply, further triggering vicious price increases; the price of rice has risen by more than 100,000 yuan in one day, with a record of up to 330,000 yuan per dan, and other prices have also doubled in a few days; so although citizens have not directly suffered the harm of the flood, the threat of rising prices is enough to make citizens cry out in pain!

Relief Efforts are Urgently Needed

Amidst the cries of the victims in the border areas, relief is of course the most urgent task at present. Therefore, the party, government, and military authorities, as well as people from all walks of life, have been extremely busy planning and running around for flood relief efforts. The organs have allocated considerable amounts of rice and funds for relief: the Relief Administration has allocated 1,200 tons of rice, and the Siamese Overseas Chinese Donation Rice Committee has allocated 350 tons; the provincial government has also allocated 100 million yuan in relief funds allocated to the counties in May for flood relief, and has also allocated 2,000 dan of rented grain from the Huiji Yicang, and overseas Chinese donations from New York have entrusted the purchase of 254 bags of Siamese rice, and have launched a campaign for all provincial and municipal civil servants to donate one day's salary. At the same time, the "Guangdong Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Committee" organized by the Xingyuan, provincial and municipal governments, provincial and municipal councils, the Grain Relief Association, the Reporters Association, and other agencies and organizations was formally established on the 16th. The committee has telegraphed the Executive Yuan for emergency relief funds of 10 billion yuan, and has consulted with the Four Joint Branches to advance a loan of 5 billion yuan for emergency relief, and has launched a campaign for donations from all walks of life. This relief movement is indeed developing vigorously, but as of the time of this reporter's dispatch, the water situation is still rising without receding, proving that the disaster situation is really unknown, and the current strength of this province may have been exhausted. According to the Relief Administration, it is said that there is no grain left, so we still need to make an urgent appeal for help and relief from all parts of the country!

### "Rousseau" Fan (Crosstalk Play)

— Jiang Song

Written for the Rousseau Birthday Commemoration

[Mr. B sits upright on a chair, flipping through a biography of Rousseau, lost in thought; Mr. A enters, holding a stalk of sweet sorghum]

A: Look, I bought a stalk of sorghum today.

B: Yes! Today is Rousseau's birthday, Jean Jacques Rousseau. A: What "how many votes"?

B: Rousseau is a great man, a great French educator of the 18th century, today is his birthday.

A: I thought it was the birthday of some tycoon, what's the big deal about an educator, how much is he worth a pound, it cost me two thousand yuan to buy this stalk of sorghum.

B: I don't allow you to say that, he is the person I admire the most, the greatest person in the world, you can't insult him!

A: Look at how serious you are, I don't want to argue with you, I'm going to call Lao Wang...one seven one two zero.

B: One seven one two is the year Rousseau was born, he was born in Geneva, Switzerland. A: Oh, no, I remembered wrong, it's one seven six two zero.

B: One seven six two is the year Rousseau published "Emile".

A: I want to invite him to see a movie.

B: There were no movies back then, movies were invented in 1893.

A: What are you talking about? I'm talking about inviting Lao Wang to see a movie, Lao Wang is my good friend.

B: Rousseau had a good friend - Mrs. Warens, this person gave him a lot of help when he was down and out. A: You're crazy, how can you bring up Rousseau no matter what, I'm talking about inviting my friend Lao Wang to see a movie, and then go to the jazz bar for a cup of coffee, there are waitresses there, hey: waitress!

B: That's right, Rousseau had a lover, a waitress named Tcersele.

A: Really? This guy is quite lucky, the French waitresses must be very flirtatious.

B: Some people translate Rousseau's name as Lu Sao, which is really not elegant.

A: My God! You're always talking about sorghum, sorghum, I'm so tired of you.

B: Rousseau was not long or short, five feet seven and a half inches tall, one hundred and thirty-eight pounds, brown hair, fair face, nose slightly crooked.

A: There's really no way, okay, I admit you're ruthless, can we talk about something else serious?

B: Okay! Let me ask you, "After the progress of science and art, is it beneficial or harmful to human morality?"

A: I don't know, probably, probably harmful?

B: Right! You agree with Rousseau.

A: What?

B: This was the topic of the essay contest of the French Mao Rong Society in 1749, Rousseau's article was selected first, and he became famous in Paris, a great success!

A: Then why haven't I become famous? Alas. Humans are really unequal

B: Then have you studied "The Causes of Inequality Among Men"?

A: Forget it! You've already confused me, why are you still asking?

B: This was the second essay topic of the Mao Rong Society, but this time Rousseau failed to be selected.

A: Whether you're selected or not, you've made me forget to eat sorghum.

B: What, you want to eat Rousseau?

A: Nonsense! I'm referring to sorghum, not your Rousseau. ...Alas, to be honest, what will people like me who have no education do after graduation? Sometimes I get scared when I think about it.

B: Who told you not to study hard on weekdays, just watch plays, dance, and mess around, I advise you to repent quickly, and write a "Confessions" like Rousseau.

A: Someone introduced me to be a tutor, do you think I can do it?

B: Very good, Rousseau also worked as a tutor for a year.

A: I'm not very willing to do it, it's not bad for Lao Wang to study politics and get an official position after graduation.

B: Since he studies politics, he must have read Rousseau's "Social Contract", ask him what he thinks of this book.

A: But he has now transferred to the Conservatory of Music, and he will still be unemployed after graduation.

B: Then he can be a musician, this is very glorious, a profession that Rousseau did

A: What profession do you think best suits your ideals?

B: Sculptor, secretary, lawyer, surveyor. ...

A: These are all professions that Rousseau did?

B: Yes!

A: Get out of here! Rousseau fan, it's getting late, I don't know if we'll make it to the 5:30 movie, yo! My iron is broken.

B: That's good, I still want to tell you that Rousseau's father was a craftsman.

A: Spare me! Good person, I'm leaving!

B: Oh! What good weather today, a beautiful Rousseau birthday commemoration. Let's go! I'll treat you to a bowl of noodles.

A: Bookworm! Fool! Who is he to you, why do you always remember his birthday? - When is your wife's birthday?

B: I don't know, but I do know that Mrs. Rousseau's birthday is June 23rd.

A: I'll take the blame today, goodbye! Rousseau fan.

B: Friend, if you understand Rousseau, you will know that Rousseau is worth our infatuation!

Today is the birthday commemoration of the great French thinker and writer Rousseau (A1712-1778). This publication specially publishes this manuscript to briefly introduce the life of this master of the generation. (Editor)

### Arrow

— Zhongzhi

With a "hiss" sound, a golden arrow flew towards me, and I couldn't avoid it, and it shot into my heart.

With a wounded heart, I went to find someone to heal me. I searched all the magicians and found all the doctors, but no one could heal my wounded heart.

With a wounded heart, I searched through ancient books and searched through literature, but I couldn't find a plan to heal my wounded heart.

So, I went to find the archer, she said: "It's too late."

"Too late"? Is it so understated?

Enduring the infinite pain and suffering, I resolutely pulled out the golden arrow and simply dragged it aside.

It's really too late!

Only volume after volume of classics can repair this heart that has been shot by an arrow.

The arrow of time has taken away the launching ability of the arrow of love!

Now it's really too late.

### Three Chapters on Flower Street

— Li Baifeng

Flower Street

Walking through the small street filled with potted flowers, I can't help but stop the car every time, examining each and every one of them in front of the stalls.

So many ordinary flowers and vulgar willows! They deliberately put on a graceful posture, sometimes even blooming with ugly-colored flowers; they also pride themselves on being unique, boasting about their vulgar colors among their peers.

Orchids have long withered, and plum blossoms have aged beyond winter; and the pine trees? They are also placed among the weeds, their sturdy bodies bent "as if bowing" due to the passage of time—I know that although flowers and plants are minor pursuits, they must strive to please the common and serve the world in order to survive.

What is most disgusting is the peony, which solemnly takes the posture of a 'court official,' proudly standing among the flowers; in fact, the peony does not excel in color, fragrance, or demeanor; it is valued only because of its large flowers and fat leaves—seeing it, I can't help but think of what is said in physiognomy books: a wealthy appearance with a fat head and big ears.

The seasons for chrysanthemums and cassia branches are still far away, and what about the lotus flower, which emerges from the mud without being stained? Presumably, in this 'world of universal turbidity,' it dwells alone in purity, distinguishing itself in the wilderness? Otherwise, how come not even a single pot of lotus flowers can be seen on this flower street? —Is it 'only after having a Bole that there is a Qianli horse'? Then, in this world without Zhou Maoshu, it is only appropriate that there are no lotus flowers.

Even if it is 'indulging in playthings and losing one's ambition'? Now, there is not even a chance to think about losing one's ambition; this street, filled with ordinary flowers and vulgar willows, merely displays a lot of flowers and plants, but instead makes one feel that a solitary pine tree on a cliff and a clump of chrysanthemums by a bamboo fence are more precious.

Good flowers are not non-existent, but they are not in the noisy urban areas. I think of Yu Zishan's "Small Garden Rhapsody": "The swallow resides to avoid the wind, fundamentally without sentiment for comparison." Perhaps there are still too many Zhan Qins in the world, thinking of counting cranes with luxurious carriages!

People who release cranes are rarely seen once in a hundred generations, and those who cook cranes and burn zithers may have become many dog butchers. This world has no place for good flowers and grasses to live; if there are any, they will be like smelly cabbages and rotten bean sprouts, considering themselves pure and deceiving themselves with high standards?

Star Clusters

Star clusters twinkle in the night sky, boasting to the earth with rare wisdom.

The star clusters gaze at the earth, they see high mountains, they see the sea, but they do not see the human crowds—

Not that they cannot see, but that they disdain to look at this base and filthy humanity. Although humans reside on Earth, just as the star clusters reside in the sky, the stars are messengers of peace, and they get along peacefully, while human interactions involve wars and conflicts.

Although the sky also has unpredictable winds and clouds, these are unrelated to the peace-loving star clusters, and no matter how treacherous the winds and clouds are, they will eventually dissipate and reappear as the sky. In the end, the peaceful night sky will still belong to the tranquil star clusters.

The star clusters are a symbol of the sky's wisdom. During the day, the scorching sun obscures the sky with its mighty flame, but at night? It uses the star clusters to show the existence of its wisdom…

Instead of setting their sights on high mountains and flowing waters, humans should set their sights on the star clusters in the night sky; because the stars love peace, they teach humans to ponder and imagine deeply—

### English - A Verse by Byron Made to Fit a Musical Score

— Sincerely Translated by Zhenqin

None of the daughters of "Beauty" can be as magical as you are;

And your sweet voice is to me like music floating on the water;

At this moment, that voice seems to be able to calm the enchanted ocean, so the sea lies dazzlingly still, and the hypnotized winds are like dreaming. And the midnight moon is weaving

Her crystalline gauze to cover the sea, the sea's chest gently rising and falling,

Like a sleeping infant: So the soul bows to you, to listen to you, to worship you; with an abundant and tender emotion, like the overflowing of the summer sea.

[This poem is a lyrical masterpiece by Byron, written in 1815 and published in his "Collected Poems" in 1816. In various poetry selections compiled by later generations, this poem is often included, but most lack a title. The translator has specifically checked its title from the complete works and translated it as above. —Translator]

### Love's Philosophy

— By Shelley, Translated by Fengli

The fountains mingle with the river

And the rivers with the ocean,

The winds of heaven mix for ever

With a sweet emotion;

Nothing in the world is single,

All things by a law divine

In one spirit meet and mingle—

Why not I with thine?

See the mountains kiss high heaven

And the waves clasp one another;

No sister-flower would be forgiven

If it disdained its brother;

And the sunlight clasps the earth,

And the moonbeams kiss the sea—

What are all these kissings worth

If thou kiss not me?

### Song

— By E. Allan Poe, Translated by Peiyin

I saw thee on thy bridal day—

When a burning blush came o'er thee,

Though happiness around thee lay,

The world all love before thee.

And in thine eyes

A kindling light

(Which was not least)

Was yet the more beloved, more dear

Than all things else to me.

That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame—

As such it was the best to see—

Though it had raised a purer flame

In love's own bower for thee!

I saw thee on thy bridal day—

When a burning blush came o'er thee,

Though happiness around thee lay,

The world all love before thee.

Postscript: Edgar Allan Poe, a great American poet of the 19th century, is also a leader of modern short stories. His poems are rich in mysterious colors and are actually precursors to symbolism.

### Dreams Outside the Tower Poetry

— Xu Chengyu

Listening to the Zither Song

The husband's ambition is majestic across the four seas, yet he gathers the four seas into one heart. Burn incense, sweep the floor, and sit with closed eyes. Suddenly, I hear the rustling of pine trees, writing the intention in my heart, due to the zither on your fingers. The strings on your fingers turn and turn, the white sun is late in the clear autumn of Wuxia; the cries of the black apes on the mountain peaks are lower, and the sound in the lonely clouds gradually fades away; the flying and flowing springs worry about being endless, the clear business of the green water turns gently; the spring is ten thousand years, the autumn leaves are outside the heart and soul, and the aftersound lingers in dreams; shifting emotions three thousand miles across the sea, peeping at the moon twelve times on the trestle; at this time, the river moon and river water are clear and boundless, and the clear water and moon wash away the secluded feelings, and the hills and valleys come into life in the strings and fingers. The mournful sound suddenly changes to mournful, the intestines break in the wind and snow of Guanshan; Yi Shui Jing Ke Song Dynasty song, Heqiao Su Wu Li Ling farewell; looking up at the floating clouds at the beginning, Qiankun Wan accounted for the passing of crows. Worldly fame and fortune are not worth mentioning, so don't neglect the taste of the zither.

The Wolf Nature of Dogs

"The Call of the Wild" is indeed a great book, it not only shows the existence of the wolf nature of dogs, but even implies the source of the savage legacy of humans... Similar in tone to this book, it should be the British poet's "Beauty Fox"? On the surface, it writes absurdly and ridiculously about the savagery of a person turning into a fox, but in reality, the fox transformation of the mind is not limited to women.

'Wagging its tail and begging for pity' is the growth of the acquired servility of dogs after being domesticated, but 'a dog jumping over the wall in desperation' is a spark of its natural nature that has not been completely extinguished; isn't it? Although a dog is loyal to its master, it still has its wolf nature.

However, in order to adapt to the conditions of survival, the dog is a weakling. If it wants to survive, it must consider the conditions of survival. It knows deeply the treachery of human beings and the rise of the desire to rule, so it bows its head and submits at the feet of human beings in order to seek shelter under the great topic of "looking at the owner when beating a dog."

However, the dog still has its servile sorrow, because ungrateful human beings often cook the running dog after the cunning rabbit dies. The despicable thing about a dog is not that it barks and shadows the power of others, but that it does not know that the end is coming.

Wolves cannot be eliminated, but what about dogs? With cunning rabbits, they can survive. When the cunning rabbits are all dead, there may only be wolves and dogs with wolfish nature in the world.

### Winter Sunshine (Oil Painting)

— English Churchill

### Picking Bristlegrass

— Sudan

In the green grass outside the city, there grows a kind of grass called bristlegrass. Inside its rolled leaves, there is a soft, cottony white pistil, which has no taste or strong fragrance. It is a kind of wild plant that no one will pay attention to, but it is the food for a group of children.

The children, thin and clumsy, as long as it is a sunny day, they will come out of their dilapidated thatched huts, in twos and threes, inviting each other to run back and forth among the barren tombs.

They squat on the grass, heads lowered, turning a pair of inflexible and lackluster eyes, moving their bodies with their thin legs clamped, like thin crabs, swinging back and forth. As they pick, they peel out the soft, cottony white pistil and stuff it into their mouths to chew. Before they swallow it, they always chew it repeatedly for a while, just like the children in the city chewing gum. However, who knows whether they feel it is delicious or difficult to swallow. Darting from this tomb to that tomb—Sister, come over here to pick—there are so many here, brother!

In the silent atmosphere, the sound of summoning rises from time to time. A tuft of dense bristlegrass, a fat white pistil, will bring an incomparably happy smile to a pale little face.

Gradually, they accumulate a large handful of bristlegrass in their hands. When their hands can't hold it, they tie it into a bundle with long rattan grass and put it aside. They want to accumulate more, in order to take it home and share it with their smaller siblings.

Rotten coffins and broken skulls are exposed in front of them, but they do not make them scream. They squat beside it picking and eating, with no expression on their faces. A skeleton, a piece of coffin, has already decorated their day's life.

They have a beautiful blue sky behind them, with silk-like white clouds floating in the blue sky, and several soaring, exquisite pigeons casting a melodious and clear ringing sound; sometimes, a silver plane flying over with the roar of engines that shocks the fields is rare to make them look up. Everything, everything seems far away from them, except for the bristlegrass in front of them.

Often, men and women from the city drive cars to the suburbs to enjoy the spring. Their colorful and elegant clothes will attract their frequent glances; they stand on the tombs, casting strange eyes at those men and women who are talking and laughing unrestrainedly. When those men and women sit down for a picnic, they flock together to watch. After the picnic is over, the gentle and quiet they start robbing for a piece of leftover bread crumbs, a jam jar, a brandy bottle... After a push, shove, and fight, some lick the jam jars or bread crumbs, some blow the remaining air in the wine bottle, and some cry with wide eyes, while the bored tourists laugh interestingly as they leave.

However, when the car takes away a burst of laughter, the gentle and quiet children gather together again and return to the tomb to squat and pick bristlegrass, to search for their spring rations.

### Longing for Utopia

— Newspaper Boy

After reading Plato's "Republic" and Moore's "Utopia," looking at this vast world, I always feel a little disappointed. Even if I read Kang Youwei's "Book of Great Harmony," we cannot help but admire the broad strides of this present-day scholar in thought. Naturally, since it is named "Republic," written as "Utopia," and called "Book of Great Harmony," they are all utopian lands, with no sense of reality. But it is not necessarily so. This world does not need Mr. Owen to artificially run the kingdom of heaven on the New World. There is indeed a Peach Blossom Spring outside the world. The following is the news report from this newspaper on the 14th:

"Orchid Island is located in Taitung, and the residents are all natives, belonging to the Yami tribe of the mountain tribes. On Orchid Island, the hills are continuous and the temperature is very high. It is a primitive society. There are a total of six tribes on the entire island. Family institutions may or may not exist. There are no chiefs. The residents are extremely simple and have no distinction between classes, wealth, nobility, or inferiority. They love peace and do not like fighting. They live together, work at sunrise, and rest at sunset. After work, they play with their bellies full, sing in the bright moon, without hunger, without thieves, without fraud, and without war. They do not know the happiness bestowed on mankind by civilization, nor do they know the pain brought to mankind by civilization. It is truly the Peach Blossom Spring of the East and the Utopia of the West."

Reading this cable, we seem to be reviewing a hope, or reciting a poem. The reporter seems to be fully moved and longed for it when he wrote it. Naturally, as a reader, the feeling is the same. What we idealize today is a world without hunger, without thieves, without fraud, and without war. What we pursue today is originally a society without classes, wealth, or nobility. Think about it, working at sunrise, resting at sunset, playing with your belly full, and singing in the bright moon. This is the highest state of life. In the history of social development, these were originally the circumstances of primitive society, but history has made human beings take a long road. Civilization has transformed the world, but it has brought pain and happiness. Human beings are about to miss and pursue the lives of their ancestors again.

This reminds me of what a scientist said:

"Our mistake lies in the fact that science has surpassed morality. We know too much about atoms and too little about ourselves. We should call for a pause in science to give humans a chance to relearn the golden rules."

This kind of sigh is not without reason. When morality has not yet been established and human relations have not been corrected, science and civilization often bring a small amount of happiness and a lot of pain. It not only cannot make the world progress, but instead leads to social division. As for the fact that the Nobel Prize has become an accomplice to war and aggression, such as the British research on radio waves and the design of germ bombs, and Professor Leeches' invention of new-style rocket bombs, makes us doubt where the use of scientific civilization lies?

Naturally, civilization is not guilty, and science is not guilty. It is just that human beings' understanding of themselves and their exploration of human relations must also be advanced together. Therefore, if we maintain the communal spirit of our ancestors in scientific civilization, then this vast world will be more worthy of pursuit and longing than the island.

### Remembering Tan Sitong - A Comet in the Intellectual World of the Late Qing Dynasty

— Minzi

Tan Sitong, a native of Liuyang, studied arithmetic in his youth and achieved considerable attainments. He also read the so-called "Investigative Studies" translations, adopted all the scientific knowledge at the time as much as possible, liked to write parallel prose, liked to talk about famous theories, and also used the meanings of "peace" and "great harmony" of present-day scholars as the ultimate standard of "worldly law," and was connected to Buddhism. Although childish and complex theories are inevitable, he was able to leap out of the shackles of old ideas and create a unique style, which can be said to have no second person in the previous Qing Dynasty.

His so-called "scientific" work is only one volume of Renxue (Benevolence). In the book, he expresses his anger and resentment by pretending to be Taiwanese, severely criticizing the Qing court, so it is also called "The Book Written by Taiwanese." This book combines science, philosophy, and religion into one furnace, which can be said to be a bold attempt at the time. His purpose in writing this Renxue was to "break through the net," which is clearly stated in his preface. He wants to break through the net of profit, the net of vulgar learning such as textual research and diction, the net of global collective learning and collective teaching, the net of monarchs, the net of ethics, and the net of heaven, etc.

He tried his best to eliminate the concept of respecting the ancients. He said: "If the ancients are good, why not be the people of today!" Regarding Chinese history, he also made such a criticism: "For more than a thousand years, the government has been the government of Qin, all great thieves; for more than two thousand years, learning has been the learning of Xunzi, all hypocrites. Only great thieves use hypocrites, and only hypocrites are good at flattering great thieves." He said it very thoroughly and happily. And regarding good and evil, he also has a unique view. He said that there is no such thing as good and evil in the world, evil is just a name, not real. He also said that ordinary scholars regard heavenly reason as good and human desire as sad, but they do not know that if there is no human desire, where does heavenly reason come from. He wants to prove the saying that "evil arises from names," and he has the following words:

"The greatest evils are licentiousness and killing... The union of men and women is called licentiousness, this is the name of licentiousness. The name of licentiousness has been practiced for a long time since the beginning of life. If the name is not changed, it is customary to call it evil. If at the beginning of life, people were accustomed to using licentiousness as a grand ceremony for courtships and banquets, held in courts and temples, held in cities, in crowded places, like the kneeling worship of the people of China, and the hugging and kissing of the people of the West, then who would know that it is evil. Harming life is called killing, this is the name of killing. However, if killing is evil, then all killing should be evil. If people should not be killed, then why should tigers, wolves, cattle, horses, chickens, and pigs be killed? Why not have the same evil name? Or it is said that people are of the same kind, then tigers and wolves are not of the same kind as people. If tigers and wolves kill people, then tigers and wolves are named evil, why not name people evil for killing tigers and wolves?..."

Although this is close to sophistry, his spirit of doubt and courage to liberate his thoughts are worthy of admiration.

Regarding famous teachings, he openly slanders them. He said:

"Vulgar scholars and humble actions often speak of famous teachings... If names are taken as teachings, then their teachings have become the guests of reality, and are definitely not reality. Moreover, names are created by people, and superiors use them to control their subordinates, and subordinates cannot but follow them, then the tragic disasters of the three cardinal guides and five constant virtues for thousands of years have come from this... For example, if it is called "benevolence", then it is a common name; monarchs and fathers use it to blame ministers and sons, and ministers and sons can also turn it back on monarchs and fathers. It is inconvenient in the art of restriction, so there must be the names of "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and fidelity" and all other distinctions and levels,... Since loyalty and filial piety are the exclusive names of ministers and sons, they can never be used to reverse it. Although there may be other grounds for wanting to question and sue, it will never be a match for the name of loyalty and filial piety as the most esteemed of famous teachings... Wherever names are, they not only close their mouths so that they dare not speak out, but also imprison their hearts so that they dare not even think about it...."

The second volume of Renxue is mostly political commentary. From his thoughts, it can be seen that he is a worshiper of cosmopolitanism. He said, "According to the meaning of unification in the Spring and Autumn Period, there should be no country between heaven and earth." He also said, "Not only should we vow to save our own country, but also the most prosperous Western countries and all living beings, everything should be saved... We should not say that we are citizens of a certain country, but we should treat all countries equally, all as our countries and all as our people." As for "those who vow to save their own country," he advocated the anti-Manchu revolution with a spirit of martyrdom, and his words were sharp and unstoppable. He said this:

"The world is the private property of monarchs, not starting today... However, are there those who know the crimes of Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing, floating above the monarchs before this? Their soil is filthy, their people are barbaric, their hearts are bestial, their customs are debauched. They indulge in their ferocity and cruelty, plundering the daughters and sons of the Central Plains and their jade and silk... still thinking that it is not enough, imprisoning their eyes and ears, shackling their hands and feet, suppressing their thoughts, and frustrating their integrity... commanding and saying that this is the duty of eating their food and treading their soil. Who is eating whose food and who is treading whose soil?"

He always wanted to promote the spirit of the people and advocate the spirit of bravery, so he set up the Shiwu Academy in Changsha with Huang Zunxian and Neng Xiling. At that time, Liang Qichao was hired as the chief lecturer and Tang Caichang as the assistant teacher. The students included Cai E, Li Binghuan, and others, forty in number. They were taught the books of Gongyang and Mencius. Liang Qichao spent four hours in the classroom every day, and corrected students' notes at night, sometimes without sleeping all night. And what he talked about was the theory of civil rights at the time, and also many old stories of the Qing Dynasty, listing the failures of the government and advocating revolution. As for his discussion of scholarship, he criticized the scholars of the Han, Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties completely. After this, he set up the "Southern Society" to gather lectures, and also set up the Xiang Newspaper (daily) and the Xiang Xue Newspaper (ten-day), and the opinions expressed, although not as intense as in the school, were actually responding to each other secretly.

This method and effort of propagating revolution once caused a great commotion among the new and old factions in Hunan. Before the coup of 1898, a certain censor listed dozens of notes and comments, pointing out those who criticized the Qing court and advocated civil rights, and submitted a memorial to reveal it, which eventually led to a major prison case. The result was that the school was disbanded, Tang Caichang and others were expelled, Liang Qichao fled to Japan, and Tan Sitong was martyred. He was only twenty-three years old when he died.

Liang Qichao, in the midst of mourning, once said this:

"... If heaven had given him years, then his learning would be immeasurable. Only this small volume (Renxue) is left, with ten thousand feet of light, fleeting in a glimpse. And the power of sweeping away and purifying is unmatched. Therefore, I compare him to a comet."

### A Story of Deception

— A-bing

Recently, I saw a very humorous and ordinary little story in a children's newspaper. In this "deception" prevailing, I don't know how many such stories are being created among the so-called "ruler and minister, father and son, brothers, husband and wife, and friends." The story is like this:

There was a little boy who always had two tubes of snot running down his nose. His grandfather said to him, "Child, if you wipe away your snot, I will give you five hundred yuan!" The little boy sucked the snot into his nostrils and asked his grandfather for money. His grandfather said, "I was deceiving you." The little boy let the snot run out and said, "I was also deceiving you."

### Random Talks While Alone

— Wang Cong

Shakespeare said:

"The comfort of love is like sunlight after rain." Shakespeare also said in another aspect: "Comfort that comes too late is like a pardon after an execution."

There is a type of girl who is indecisive about her own love, seemingly affectionate to everyone. A pure and honest nature is valuable, but misleading oneself and others only leads to tragedy. Because if you compassionately lend your bed to a beggar, he will surely repay you with lice.

Playing with love is like playing with fire; a moment of carelessness can lead to self-immolation. Therefore, I often advise many friends who are deeply in love not to try to transform into three thousand and universally save all beings.

Because the most persistent love is the most valuable love.

Because love is not a reward, let alone a commodity.

Geo. Moore said: "Choice is the most difficult thing in life." (The difficulty in life is the choice)

Before love arises, there should be a choice, and this choice is even more difficult than choosing a job. My reason is: a "tide of desire" like a raging wave obscures reason between the sexes. Therefore, careful selection is not allowed. This "tide of desire" is often mistaken for "love." This is almost a universally absurd phenomenon among us so-called spiritual beings.

Therefore, a union under this absurd misconception is like a pagoda built on sand. It cannot withstand the test of time.

Many marriages break down in a short period because of this.

My friend Mr. Guan told me that after each sexual desire is satisfied with his wife, a kind of indescribable aversion arises between them. Even a casual touch of skin immediately ignites anger. However, before the issue of desire is resolved, they both feel a strong interest in each other. Because of this, both parties feel contradictory and painful.

This is truly a good example. I believe many people would feel the same way, but they just haven't said it.

What is love? Based on the above views, I say: "It is the infinitely beautiful mutual affection that remains after the tide of desire has subsided. Even, the willingness to sacrifice one's life to bring a smile to the other's face."

### Strange Fire and Spontaneous Combustion

— Wang Qian De

With the arrival of victory, a new term has also emerged – strange fire. Especially in Shanghai, almost everyone knows this term.

Although some "strange fires" are indeed mysterious, unpredictable by humans or ghosts, emptying warehouses of materials, stored goods, and setting fire to warehouses and houses, turning them to ashes, using the "fire" that cannot speak or accuse to conceal sins and act as a scapegoat, we don't need to study this type of strange fire in detail.

However, another kind of strange fire is actually a phenomenon caused by chemical changes. In natural science books, this phenomenon is called "spontaneous combustion" (Spontaneous Combustion). The occurrence of spontaneous combustion must have the following three prerequisites: (1) The substance itself is flammable.

(2) There are no heat conductors around.

(3) The storage place has poor air circulation.

The substance itself is flammable, meaning that its nature makes it easy to burn, such as matches, coal, alcohol, phosphorus, sulfur, etc.

The absence of heat conductors around means that the building materials of the warehouse are not good conductors of heat, such as warehouses built with wood, causing the stored materials to undergo a slow oxidation reaction with oxygen in the air, and the heat generated has no transmitter to send it out, causing the temperature inside the warehouse to gradually rise. If the temperature continues to rise to the ignition point (Kindling Tem perturemperture) of this substance, a fire will easily occur.

The last reason is to close the doors and windows of the warehouse tightly, so that the hot air inside cannot exchange and circulate with the cooler air outside, thus maintaining the permanent hot air inside.

Now that we clearly know the above three reasons, avoiding them will certainly not be difficult. Just change the building materials of the warehouse to heat conductors, do not stack the materials tightly, and keep the doors and windows of the warehouse open to allow air exchange. In this way, we can be safe and sound.

### Miscellany from America

— Xu Shut

The Democratization of the Automobile Class

Things are valued when they are scarce. Shoddy cars from America can be sold for ten or eight "strips" (slang for banknotes) in Shanghai. Those old, worn-out cars are already sold by the ton as scrap metal in America. When I went to America in 1942, I still saw used cars being auctioned for forty dollars each. Five years later, I still saw used cars for two or three hundred dollars. New cars from 1946 that our colleagues bought cost at most one thousand six hundred dollars each. Almost new ones could be had for one thousand two hundred dollars, and ordinary ones that were usable cost around five or six hundred dollars. Buying a car doesn't require paying in full at once. Pay twenty percent of the price upfront, and then pay ten percent monthly. The car becomes entirely your property. Therefore, any American or resident in America can become part of the automobile class if they can scrape together a hundred or so dollars. Newspaper carriers deliver newspapers by car, and barbers drive to the barbershop for work.

When I was stationed at Thunderbird Field, I often rode into town in the barber's car. The maids who came to the dormitory to sweep and change bedsheets also drove their own cars to work. Normally, each family averaged one or two cars.

During wartime, because ships and gasoline were rationed, instead of everyone riding in their own car, four or five people shared one car, with everyone splitting the gasoline costs and taking turns driving. Cars were also rotated. In the military mess hall or club, the public bulletin board was filled with advertisements seeking passengers: Passengers Wanteo or Share Carneeded or I Want a ride to New York, a dazzling array. At major intersections, there were large signs saying "Please give soldiers a ride." Anyone wearing a military uniform waiting by the roadside would have passing cars stop and take them to their destination, or to the tram stop, without having to spend a single copper. Americans believe that there is no loss in giving a few more people a ride in a car. In the eyes of the automobile class in China, giving people a free ride in a car is not only not cost-effective, but also quite embarrassing. (Five)

### Rambling on Street Names

— Shen Ying

Many roads in Shanghai have been renamed to suit reality. When new road names are given, many people still call them by their old names. This is because they are used to it, and they gradually become familiar with the new names.

Because Shanghai is a national metropolis, the newly changed road names often use the names of cities in various regions or the names of famous people. The former is easier to remember, and the latter is intended to commemorate. This is the origin of naming. The "Hu" character in the Huzhou Pass on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is relatively difficult to recognize. Legend has it that when Emperor Qianlong went down the Yangtze River via the Grand Canal, he read the "Hu" character as "Xu" by mistake, and the error was passed on. Even now, many people still pronounce it as "Xu." Therefore, when naming places and roads, it is best to use words that are common and easy to recognize. The names of streets and alleys in Suzhou are quite ancient and interesting, or related to local historical anecdotes. For example, Dongmi Lane (East Rice Lane), Ximi Lane (West Rice Lane), and Cangmi Lane (Granary Rice Lane) in the west of the city were rice trading markets during the Song Dynasty. Nearby, a stream flows windingly, directly connected to the city moat. The bridge is called "Shashi Bridge" (Slaughter Market Bridge). As the name suggests, it should be a grain gathering place, and Cangmi Lane was a granary. Furthermore, Huajie (Flower Street), Liuxiang (Willow Lane), Youlan (Quiet Orchid), and Zilan (Purple Orchid), the names of the lanes are fragrant and seductive. The flowers and plants of the Wu Palace at that time were nestled among them. Even now, thinking of them still evokes reverie. As for Huxiangsi Lane (Mutual Longing Lane) and Sipo Lane (Longing Wife Lane) in the east of the city, both have stories implied, and they are recorded in local chronicles, so I will not repeat them. However, Huxiangsi Lane, in the names of streets and lanes, is named quite humorously. Even the witty and humorous Lin Yutang would have to admit defeat.

Hulong Street is the longest street in the center of Suzhou City, starting from Yinma Bridge in the south and reaching Beisi Pagoda in the north. In Suzhou dialect, it is called Mashi Street. It has recently been renamed "Zhongzheng" Road. Wusa Road (May 30th Road) commemorates the May 30th Massacre. A lane parallel to it has recently been renamed "Zhongren Road" in memory of Mr. Zhang Zhongren (一 ), a local elder. Chu Zhanglin is in the park. These are all names commemorating local people. Looking back on the past, the names of every street and alley have their origins to be examined. As for naming alleys after people, it is not an imitation of foreign countries. There is a Jiusi Lane in Suzhou, which commemorates Zhang Shicheng of the late Yuan Dynasty, because Zhang Shicheng's nickname was Jiusi.
