### Communist Forces in Shandong Province Encircled; Jiaoji Railway Battle Situation Gradually Stabilizes; National Army Advances North from Tengxian, Recaptures Zou County

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] The war situation in Shandong Province has become one of mutual encirclement. After the communist forces, under Chen Yi, broke out of the northern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains, they joined forces with the communist troops in western Shandong and eastern Shandong, posing a threatening posture towards the outskirts of Jinan. However, they themselves have fallen into a large encirclement by the National Army, and the war is developing in a direction favorable to the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th] The battle situation along the Jiaoji Railway is gradually stabilizing. The National Army is concentrating in advantageous areas, ready to deliver a strong blow when the communist forces attack. There were fierce battles in Laiwu, Tuskou, and Boshan on the 24th and 25th. The communist forces in Zhangdian and Zhoucun launched a very intense siege.

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th] The National Army advancing north along the Jinpu Railway from Tengxian, with the momentum of a broken bamboo, recaptured Zou County at 4 PM on the 26th. They have joined hands with the Wu Huawen division of the National Army advancing south from Yanzhou. The communist forces fled towards Qufu. Military sources stated that the National Army in Linyi reached the outskirts of Feixian on the 25th, mopping up the remaining communist forces, but did not garrison the county seat. Liu Bocheng led more than 20,000 of his remaining troops and crossed the Yellow River for days, fleeing to Xinxian and Yangyi to reorganize.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 26th] The new deployment of the National Army was completed on the evening of the 25th. Except for important areas such as Jinan, Tengxian, and Qingdao, the National Army on both sides of the Jiaoji Railway has completed the sequential transfer. The military strength in Jinan has greatly increased, and the dangerous period has passed. There is now confidence in ensuring the safety of the city. Currently, the more than 80,000 communist troops outside Jinan were generally quiet on the night of the 15th. Several thousand communist troops launched a fierce attack on the National Army near Longshan on the Jiaoji Railway. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the communist forces were repelled by the morning of the 26th.

[Report from Jinan, 26th] The morale of the people in Jinan is stable, and businesses are operating as usual. Due to paper shortages, all newspapers will reduce their original size by half starting on the 27th. To strengthen defenses, the Defense Command ordered on the 25th that all members of the previously discharged merchant corps rejoin the army, and there has been a very enthusiastic response from those reporting in the past two days.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 26th] The war on the eastern outskirts of Jinan expanded from the evening of the 25th to Longshan Station, 38 kilometers east of the city. The attacking communist forces numbered approximately three to four thousand. Fighting continued until noon on the 26th. Seventeen stations along the Jiaoji Railway between Longshan and Yidu, as well as five stations on the Zhangbo branch line, have all fallen into the hands of the communist forces.

### National Army Makes Bag-Shaped Advance in Southwestern Shandong and Jinpu Railway; Expected to Join Forces in Yanzhou in Early March

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th] Chen Yi's current strategy in leading over 100,000 troops to attack Laiwu and Bozi is to first attack the rear of the defending forces, cutting off the rear lines of communication in order to isolate the defending forces. The three regiments of the 77th Division of the National Army, and the incomplete 46th Division, 7th Army, and 3rd Army, bravely resisted the invading communist forces in Laiwu, Tuskou, and Boshan, fighting fiercely for four days and nights. After completing their mission, they broke through and transferred separately. The communist forces suffered heavy losses and have become dispirited. Furthermore, the communist forces claimed that the purpose of attacking Jinan was to plunder supplies, but the National Army is absolutely confident in defending Jinan and its surrounding areas. The communist forces attacked the Jiaoji Railway to open up the corridor to eastern Shandong. Military sources also stated that the National Army is rapidly advancing north from southern Shandong, western Shandong, and the Jinpu front in a bag-shaped formation. Chen Yi's remaining troops have fallen into the mouth of the bag-shaped formation. Although they are still jumping around, the communist forces are strategically in a position of inevitable defeat. The National Army in Jinan and Yanzhou can join forces in Tai'an in early March.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 26th] Three thousand communist troops attacking Yancheng, northwest of Jinan City, were repelled by the National Army by 2 PM on the 25th. Fighting continued near Longshan Station, 30 kilometers east of Jinan City. Liu Bocheng's 3rd and 6th columns, totaling approximately 15,000 men, had already fled to the vicinity of Feicheng on the evening of the 25th. At the same time, the communist forces were also setting up telegraph lines between Wenshang, Tai'an, and Feicheng, and building temporary bridges at various crossings of the Yellow River, with the intention of joining forces with Chen Yi's troops and launching a large-scale siege of Jinan.

### Communist Forces in Northeast Expand Raids; Fierce Fighting Near Changchun; Fierce Fighting Outside Dehui; Communist Forces Outside Dehui Advance South by Exploiting Gaps

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The communist forces launched a three-pronged attack on Changchun, with fierce fighting 20-30 miles away. The communist forces on the northern route captured Nong'an on the 25th, and there was also fighting between Jiutai and Jilin along the Jichang Railway.

[Another dispatch] Two brigades of the 60th Division of the communist forces that crossed the Songhua River began to besiege Chengzijie on the 22nd. The National Army bravely resisted, and fierce fighting continues to this day. On the 24th, the 5th, 6th, and 359th Brigades of the communist forces arrived outside Dehui. On the 25th, they exploited gaps to cross Dehui and advance south towards Buhai. After being intercepted by the National Army, they appeared to be fleeing east. More than 5,000 troops from the 2nd Military Region of the communist forces were discovered west of Nong'an. On the 26th, they detoured southwest of Nong'an and raided Wanbaoshan (southeast of Nong'an).

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11 PM on the 26th] As of this moment, the communist forces on all lines outside Changchun are in a state of observation and hesitation. The communist forces have even retreated from the Jiutai to Pipichang area along the Jichang Railway. A certain unit of the National Army, which had just retreated from the western section of that line, has turned from retreat to advance. Judging from this situation, the communist forces may have other deployments or may simply know it is difficult and retreat. In any case, the National Army is fully prepared and will not allow them to come and go at will. Military authorities here are maintaining silence regarding the development of the current battle situation. However, it is understood that the rapid advance of the communist forces on all routes yesterday caused some hidden crises outside Changchun. Now that the communist forces have been delaying their movements all day, all defense plans have been successfully implemented, and reinforcements are arriving continuously. Tonight, a reporter met with a senior official and asked him how confident he was in the city's defense. He replied in a conservative manner: "Nine out of ten."

[This newspaper, Changchun, 26th] The war outside Changchun is intensifying. The communist forces are throwing all their strength into a desperate gamble, appearing to be attacking Changchun. The National Army is deploying its forces in a strict manner. It is generally believed that a major battle will soon break out in the diamond-shaped area between Changchun, Jiutai, Dehui, and Nong'an. Although Jilin is currently isolated, Li Hong's 30th Division of the New First Army and Zeng Zhaoyu's 60th Army are closely guarding Yongji. Liang Huasheng flew from Shenyang to Jilin yesterday and telephoned to say that the Xiaofengman Power Plant in Jilin is strongly defended and can be guaranteed to be safe. Communist forces were discovered west of Kalun, Jiutai last night between Changchun and Jilin. The situation in Jiutai is chaotic, and contact with this area has been lost. There has only been outpost contact in the Nong'an area. Huajiaqiao on the Changnong Line has been destroyed by the communist forces. Dehui is still holding firm. [Another dispatch] City defenses in Changchun are being strengthened daily, but the market is still very peaceful. Prices are rising, and there is a possibility of water and electricity being cut off at any time.

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The communist forces in the Northeast have recently launched offensives in the north and south. Communist forces in the Andong area have also been mobilized. The Shen'an Line was still closed on the 26th. Benxi suddenly reported a tense situation. Communist forces were discovered 50 miles away, advancing towards Benxi.

Communist forces, totaling about 2,000 men, who had previously sneaked across the frozen sea surface south of Pulandian and west of the railway, are now converging in the Jindoufang Hejiagou area, about 30 li northwest of Wafangdian. The National Army is tracking and pursuing them.

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The 11th Brigade of the communist forces, numbering about 3,000 men, which was previously in the area northeast of Yunshanguan in Andong, destroyed the railway bridge at the Xiamatang Station on the Shen'an Line and has now reached Motianling, attempting to eliminate the security forces.

And Prohibition of Communist Party from Enjoying Human Rights

[Associated Press, Beiping, 26th] The Beiping City Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, and Farmers' Association issued a declaration today demanding that the government ban the Democratic League and prohibit the Communist Party from enjoying human rights. This declaration opposes the call for the protection of human rights issued yesterday by 13 professors from Peking University and Tsinghua University, saying that these professors are deliberately opposing the government's security measures, which is quite strange. The declaration by the three groups also stated: "Our associations are uneasy day and night, fearing that the Tongzhou Incident will be repeated in Beiping. The Democratic League is the tail of the Communist Party and should be banned. The Communist Party does not hesitate to destroy the Constitution, endanger peace, burn property, and destroy highways and dams.

### Secretary of State Marshall Declares; US Troops Determined to Withdraw as Soon as Possible; Military Aid to China to Be Drafted Separately

[US Information Service, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall recently made a statement on the China issue at a press conference. He said that the Chinese government is currently working to eliminate the technical difficulties in the transfer of surplus materials and the implementation of the 1946 Ship Donation to China Act. The Act provides for US naval training, service, plans, and technical consultation for China, and its purpose is to relieve US forces of their duties in China and to further ensure or improve the safety of navigation within Chinese territorial waters.

Regarding the withdrawal of US troops from China, Secretary of State Marshall said: "The withdrawal is in progress, but the progress of the withdrawal of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation is unknown. The US Marine Corps is withdrawing as quickly as possible under the circumstances of completing transportation permits and safety obligations."

When asked whether he would submit another request to Congress to allow the stationing of a military advisory group in China, Marshall replied that a bill for an independent military delegation has been under consideration for a long time, but its scope is not limited to China but is of a general nature.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall declared here today that the State Department has abandoned the attempt to request Congress to appoint a military advisory group in China. Any military assistance given to the Chinese government in the future will be based on a general plan. The plan is currently being drafted for general use in South America and other countries and will be submitted to the current Congress for approval. At the opening of the last Congress, the State Department separately submitted a special bill to both the Senate and the House of Representatives requesting approval for aid to China, but it has not yet reached the stage of formal discussion. Secretary Marshall also said that the State Department's main task regarding China is to work to eliminate the technical difficulties in transferring US military surplus materials and to urge Congress to approve the sale of merchant ships to China. However, Secretary Marshall did not explain what steps would be taken to urge Congress to approve the sale of merchant ships to China and other countries under the Ship Sale Act of 1946. Marshall also did not specify what the technical difficulties in transferring surplus materials were. According to the surplus materials agreement signed in Nanjing last year, most of the materials are scattered on islands in the Pacific Ocean, and the main difficulty may be transportation issues.

Q: How is the government reorganization progressing? A: We will first
reorganize four institutions, then proceed with a full reorganization.

A: Most of the Communist personnel are in the process of withdrawing.

Q: According to Communist reports, the National Army has suffered setbacks in central Shandong. What is the actual situation regarding the telegrams received recently?

A: I do not wish to elaborate on the recent military situation, as the matter has already been reported in detail. It is merely Communist propaganda. In fact, the National Army is advancing step by step, recovering many areas, while the Communist forces are retreating step by step.

Q: The government is guiding the people to voluntarily exchange gold and foreign currency at the Central Bank at standard rates. What is the reaction of people at home and abroad? Are there any accurate and reliable reports?

A: There are no accurate reports yet.

Q: In the past, the government formally announced the second phase of troop demobilization, starting in the first month of the lunar year. How is it progressing? Is there a contradiction between demobilization and the implementation of the conscription law?

A: The second phase of troop demobilization and reorganization is currently underway. The promulgation of the conscription law is to establish a permanent conscription system, which has no connection to demobilization. Gentlemen, you should know that before the war, China was a country with a voluntary army system. In the future, China will adopt a conscription system.

Q: Was the agricultural technical team's visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese government? Recently, have any relevant or other important measures been taken in agriculture based on the team's suggestions?

A: The American agricultural technicians who came to China previously were part of Sino-American agricultural technical cooperation, not an independent inspection team. They came to China according to a plan agreed upon by the Chinese and American governments, and after cooperating with our agricultural technicians in investigations, they have already returned to the United States. The suggestions made by the team are being carefully studied by our Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Recently, four more American agricultural professors arrived in Nanjing. Two of them will work at the Central Agricultural Experiment Station. The other two will teach at Central University and Jinling University, respectively, specializing in agricultural engineering.

Q: The Shanghai XMHA radio station is said to be run by Archbishop Yu Bin. Why was it shut down? A: Recently, the government has been cracking down on unregistered radio stations. The Shanghai XMHA radio station was ordered to shut down because the registration procedures were not completed. However, this does not affect the government's trust and appreciation of Archbishop Yu Bin and the work of the Catholic Church.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Youth Party finalized its list of candidates for the four institutions in an internal meeting today. However, it has not yet been submitted as of this evening.

Whether he will go elsewhere in the future will be decided after the meeting concludes. Before leaving today, he paid a visit to the Chairman at 9:30 AM. The Chairman instructed that the recovered areas in North China should follow the policy guidelines set by the Pacification Zone Political Committee, such as mass organizations and local self-defense, and must be intensified to save the people from their misery as soon as possible, so that local order can be quickly restored and the people can live and work in peace and contentment. When reporters asked about the war situation in Shandong and whether he would go to Taiyuan after the closing of the review meeting, Bai Chongxi did not answer.

In his opening remarks, Li Zongren pointed out that the greatest difficulty in the pacification work in North China is the lack of sound cadres, which has resulted in disagreements among various agencies, a lack of concentration of forces, and corruption in many places.

### UNRRA's Work in China Needs to Be Extended by Three Months, Jackson Has Made a Recommendation

[Report from our agency] UNRRA Deputy Director-General General Jackson came to China at the invitation of the Chinese government to inspect and study post-war relief work, so that UNRRA's mission in China can be completed satisfactorily. Jackson held a press conference at the New Asia Hotel at 11:00 AM yesterday, reporting on various issues related to UNRRA's work in China. UNRRA's Resident Director-General in China General Egerton, Chief of the Far East Division of the Vocational Training Council Colonel Harris, and Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Huo Shishu attended. Jackson first denied the recent rumors that the Chinese government had asked UNRRA to revise its established plan and replace it with US$200 million worth of cotton and wheat shipments to China to stabilize the Chinese currency system. He solemnly stated: The Chinese government only requested UNRRA to purchase and ship cotton to China with the remaining funds that have not yet been designated for use. UNRRA recently received a formal request from the Chinese government, the content of which is limited to this. All the rumors outside are misunderstandings. Jackson said: "There is still a balance of 19 to 20 million US dollars in UNRRA's budget for China that has not yet been determined for use. The UNRRA Central Committee will consider the Chinese government's request for this fund. The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee held a temporary meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Representatives from various countries made a preliminary discussion on the Chinese government's request. Four recommendations were resolved and submitted to the Central Committee in Washington for consideration: (1) The Far East Committee agrees to the request to purchase cotton with the remaining funds; (2) The income from the sale of cotton shipped to China by UNRRA in the future should be used by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for post-war relief undertakings; (3) The Chinese government should submit a detailed budget for the expenditure of the funds from the sale of cotton to UNRRA; (4) The Far East Regional Committee will continue to pay attention to the use of UNRRA cotton. The four recommendations established by the meeting have been telegraphed to the Central Committee, and it is expected that the General Office will make a decision soon."

Jackson finally told reporters: "UNRRA's shipments to China may not be completely exhausted by the end of June. It is necessary to extend UNRRA's work in China. I personally have suggested to the General Office to extend it for another 90 days after the end of June. If approved, UNRRA's work in China is expected to be extended."

### Philippine "Anti-Chinese League" Blocks Chinese from Applying for Naturalization, Philippine Supreme Court Rejects Request

[Central News Agency, Manila, 26th] The Philippine Supreme Court decided today to reject the request of the "Philippine Anti-Chinese League" to interfere with and oppose the large number of naturalization requests submitted to the court by Chinese applicants. The "Philippine Anti-Chinese League" is led by Senator Saludo, who has a great reputation and whose grandfather was Chinese. The league became known to the public because of a lawsuit filed on October 3 last year opposing Judge Felix of the Manila First Instance Court's approval of the naturalization of Lin Yongluo (transliteration), a local Chinese person. The league asked the Supreme Court to revoke the order of the lower court, arguing that "the applicant failed to explain that China also has the same laws to give Filipinos the same rights." According to reports, Saludo proposed a bill on August 20 last year, asking to amend the Naturalization Law to restrict foreigners from being naturalized as Philippine citizens. The law stipulates that the required ten years of residence for those requesting naturalization should be changed to twenty years, and the special period should be increased from five years to ten years. However, the case was later .

### Gui Yongqing Returns to Shanghai from Taiwan, Talks About Building a New Navy, Going to Beijing Tonight to Inspect the North

[Report from this city] General Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, returned to Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday morning at 7:00 AM on the "Zhongxing" ship. He is scheduled to inspect the Central Naval Officer School today, and then take a late train to Beijing. Within a few days, he will also inspect naval bases such as Qingdao in the north.

Gui met with reporters from the Central News Agency at the Naval Social Club yesterday afternoon, and discussed various related issues of the Navy. Gui said: Qingdao is our country's ideal naval base. There is currently a Central Naval Training Corps. Recently, it is planned to move the Central Naval Officer School in Shanghai to that location, merge it with the training corps, and establish the "Central Naval School" to train naval officers. This matter will be realized quickly. Although Shanghai is not a good place for training personnel, a mechanical school will also be established. The training of naval soldiers will mainly be based in Zuoying Naval Port in Taiwan and Magong Island in the Penghu Islands. Currently, there are about 20 naval officers and soldiers training abroad in the United States, and 600-700 in the United Kingdom. The batch of officers and soldiers in the United Kingdom will complete their training in the fall of this year and drive back to the country with a cruiser, two submarines, two destroyers, and eight gunboats donated by the United Kingdom.

In order to train a large number of officers and soldiers and study the latest technology, another group of students may be sent abroad for further studies in the second half of the year. Gui's inspection of Taiwan and the southeastern coast lasted for three weeks. He deeply felt that our country's long coastline requires the united attention and efforts of the people of the whole country to build a strong navy. He believes that in addition to Qingdao, there are many good bases between the Penghu Islands and Xiamen that can support each other. It is extremely important for national defense. Our country is currently unable to build warships on its own. It is believed that when there is a solution to the economy, it will be possible to do so. However, the most important point in building a new navy is that everyone must be selfless and strive for improvement. Gui earnestly hopes that outstanding young people from all over the country will actively participate in this arduous work. Gui then talked about his impression of Taiwan, saying: The situation in Taiwan is better than the general situation in the mainland. Except for cloth, there is no shortage of various materials. The people have a sense of right and wrong and can abide by the law. If given enough time, the ideal of the Three Principles of the People can be realized in Taiwan.

### Military and Political Civil Service Examination Work, Review Conference Opens, Dean Dai Delivers Training on Behalf of the Chairman

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The two ministries of National Defense and Civil Service Examination received a handwritten order from Chairman Chiang, to hold a review conference on military and political civil service examination work on the 26th of this month, with a duration of three days, and designated Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, and Minister of Civil Service Examination Jia Jingde to preside over the conference. After receiving the order, the two ministries actively prepared for the conference and held it as scheduled today at the Lizhi Society. The attendees included Dean Dai of the Examination Yuan, Director Wu of the Civil Affairs Department, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food, Chiefs and main staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the National Defense and Civil Service Examination Department, and more than 100 personnel agency heads. Chairman Chiang originally planned to attend the opening ceremony in person, but due to important official duties, he requested Dean Dai to deliver training on his behalf. The main points were: (1) The military and political parties should thoroughly review the advantages and disadvantages of the laws and regulations formulated during the war, decide whether to retain or abolish them, or retain their advantages, or correct their defects, to meet the needs of nation-building; (2) After the success of the Northern Expedition, the country faced frequent disasters. The government followed the teachings of the late leader Sun Yat-sen and established various systems that should have been established, but they were either not established due to resistance, or they were established but not completed. The personnel system was also affected by this and has not yet produced significant results. Today, both the military and civilian parties should thoroughly review and strive for improvement; (3) Civil service examination businesses include employment performance salary reward pension etc. , In fact, It is also nothing more than what Sun Yat-sen calls "education and support have a way", "encourage with strength and make employment legal". We should find ways to accomplish this task; (4) Further this review conference is not only to pick up the advantages and disadvantages and the efficiency of past laws and regulations, but also to require the relevant agencies, especially the two ministries of National Defense and Civil Service Examination, to seek proper solutions for common difficult problems, and strive for effective and tight connections for mutually related problems.

After the completion of the opening ceremony, the meeting proceeded according to the original agenda. Minister Jia of the Civil Service Examination Department served as chairman. Wang Zizhuang, Secretary-General of the Congress, reported on the number of attendees and the preparations. The two departments of National Defense and Civil Service Examination respectively made a work report for the 35th year of the Republic of China, and a report on the implementation of the resolutions of the first review conference. On the 27th, group and joint discussions on military and civilian positions will be held, and on the 28th, a general discussion will be held, and a closing ceremony will be held.

### Famous Hong Kong Financier Ho Tung Jr. Wears Artificial Leg

[United Press, Fanley Qiao, California, 25th] Ho Tung, a famous Hong Kong financier whose legs were blown off in Hong Kong in 1941, recently became famous for his amputation surgery at the naval hospital here and came here to refit his artificial legs. His father, the 83-year-old Sir Ho Tung, met with Dr. Kang Di, director of the amputation department of the hospital, for several hours and learned that the artificial legs fitted for his son were made of metal plates and leather, weighing up to 15 pounds, and are now obsolete.

### County Council to Convene Once Every Three Months; Speaker and Deputy Speaker Responsible for Convening; Ministry of Interior to Draft Measures for Handling Delays

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Interior believes that county councils should convene once every three months, as clearly stipulated in Article 11 of the County Council Organization Regulations. However, some county council speakers have neglected their duties and failed to convene meetings within the legally prescribed period, rendering the county councils virtually useless and betraying the government's intention to establish public opinion organs and foster civil rights. To ensure that county councils can convene meetings as scheduled and deliberate on matters in accordance with regulations, thereby establishing a foundation for constitutional governance, the following measures for handling county council speakers who fail to convene meetings within the legally prescribed period are hereby drafted, submitted for approval, and circulated to all provinces for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) If a county council speaker delays convening a meeting for more than one hundred days without providing a written explanation of the reasons and entrusting the deputy speaker to convene the meeting on their behalf, they shall be deemed to have neglected their duties. The deputy speaker shall immediately convene a meeting and hold another election for speaker. If the deputy speaker is elected as speaker, a supplementary election for deputy speaker shall be held immediately. (2) If the deputy speaker, when convening a meeting in accordance with the circumstances in the first item, still fails to convene a meeting within one hundred and ten days without providing a written explanation of the reasons and requesting the county magistrate to convene the meeting on their behalf, they shall also be deemed to have neglected their duties. The county magistrate shall convene a meeting and simultaneously hold another election for both the speaker and deputy speaker. (3) If the county magistrate delays handling the convening of a meeting for more than one hundred and twenty days in accordance with the circumstances in the second item, the relevant civil affairs department shall order the magistrate to convene a meeting within a specified period, impose disciplinary action, and report to the Ministry of Interior for record.

Editorial

### Concerning the Situation in Korea

On the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the situation in Korea has once again attracted the world's attention. General Hodge, commander of the US military occupation zone in Korea, recently returned to Washington D.C. from his post and told the press that the Soviet military authorities in their occupation zone are recruiting Korean men aged 17 to 25, with the Chinese Communist army as the core, in an attempt to form a massive Korean army. He also stated that the ongoing negotiations between the US and Soviet military authorities on the ground seem to have little hope of success. The Soviet Union has erected a dense iron curtain in its occupation zone, making it difficult for us to learn about the situation inside. At the same time, Syngman Rhee, chairman of the Korean Commission, also told reporters in Washington D.C. that he was requesting the United States to arm the people of South Korea and allow them to conduct military training. According to a United Press dispatch, General Hodge also told reporters that South Korea would establish a separate government on March 1st and that he was requesting the Congressional Budget Committee to allocate sufficient funds to carry out the occupation of Korea. State Department officials stated that the United States' policy toward Korea had not changed and that the United States was now planning to pursue two directions: (1) consolidate the economic development of South Korea; (2) establish so-called agreement legislation. Now that reports about Korea continue to come from the United States, the situation in Korea will undoubtedly attract the general attention of the world.

We are closely monitoring the situation in Korea because of our geographical proximity to Korea and the deep historical and cultural ties between us. This newspaper has previously written editorials calling on the world not to ignore the developing situation in Korea. We believe that forcibly dividing Korea into two worlds along the 38th parallel is not only an artificial obstacle to the survival of the Korean people but also contrary to the noble purpose of this world war. Korea has been subjugated for more than 40 years. When it was subjugated, it was the time of imperialist competition in the Far East. After Russia was defeated, Japan, backed by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, was able to do whatever it wanted. Although Korea declared independence for a time, it was soon annexed by Japan. However, the Korean people have always been very strong in terms of national consciousness. Although the country was subjugated, the national spirit did not decline. Following An Jung-geun's attack on Ito, Korean patriots have made heroic demonstrations in the past thirty years. Today, the prosthetic leg of Japanese war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu and the prosthetic eye of Kichisaburo Nomura are both due to the heroic actions of Korean patriots. During World War I, President Wilson put forward the principle of national self-determination, but it did not extend to Korea. This has already shown how Western countries cannot shoulder the responsibility of rebuilding the world order. We expressed our deep regret for the Korean people at that time. Unexpectedly, the situation in Korea after World War II is a hundredfold worse than it was then. We would like to express our infinite sympathy for the Korean people in suffering.

Who created this situation in Korea? The responsibility lies with both the United States and the Soviet Union. It is to be expected that the Soviet Union wants to foster forces in its occupation zone that are beneficial to it. However, the United States' occupation authorities in Korea have no clear policy, which has made the situation in Korea increasingly worse. The Soviet Union's occupation of Korea is planned, while the United States' occupation of Korea has no clear and firm policy. The suffering of the Korean people today is mainly due to this. We cannot allow this situation to continue. Originally, since the failure of the US-Soviet conference on the situation in Korea held in Seoul at the beginning of last year, based on the Moscow Agreement, the United States' policy on the occupation of Korea should have been reconsidered. However, in the past year, due to the United States' lack of action, the situation in Korea has not only not improved but has also deteriorated. The United States should bear the majority of the responsibility for creating the current situation in Korea.

Today, when talking about the situation in Korea, we must recognize the Soviet Union's intentions in Korea. General Hodge, commander of the US military occupation zone, openly says that the Soviet Union is training a massive Korean army in its occupation zone, with the Chinese Communist army as the core. We want to ask what is the purpose of this? General Hodge's words are certainly not without basis. What is the Soviet Union's purpose in cultivating this armed force in Korea? Korea is adjacent to our territory, and the armed force cultivated by the Soviet Union in Korea has the Chinese Communist army as the core. We cannot remain silent. From the standpoint of the country, this is an unfriendly expression to China. From the standpoint of the people, this is an act that violates the wishes of the Chinese people. But this happened in Korea. In addition to expressing righteous indignation, the Chinese people hope that the US occupation authorities in Korea can devise a good way to resist it. Not acting is not a policy. We must respond to action with action. Otherwise, others' actions will become increasingly intense, and when the time comes to take action, it will be too late. The independent establishment of the government in South Korea is undoubtedly a reasonable step in the right direction. However, action should not be limited to one aspect but should be multifaceted.

We do not know whether the Moscow Conference will discuss the situation in Korea. What is gratifying is that Secretary of State Marshall said in Washington D.C. yesterday that the Korean issue is not on the agenda of the Moscow Conference. At the same time, Korean leaders in the United States firmly oppose the discussion of the Korean issue at the Moscow Conference. Since the situation in Korea cannot be improved, General Hodge has stated that the ongoing negotiations between the US and Soviet military authorities on the ground seem to have little hope of success. Therefore, it seems that it would be superfluous to raise this issue in Moscow, whether inside or outside the conference. The situation in Korea is clear: the main reason why it has reached this point is the United States' inaction. The United States bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining peace in the post-war world, and the situation in Korea is crucial to the maintenance of world peace. It seems that it can no longer adopt inaction as a policy. We hope that the United States can shoulder the responsibility of leading the world, not only in Korea but also in other regions of the world.

### US-Soviet Dispute Tends to Ease Over Control of Atomic Energy, Avoiding a Showdown; Plan to Refer Back to Atomic Energy Commission for Further Consideration

[United Press, Lake Success, 25th] At today's Security Council meeting, the United States praised the Security Council's achievements in the international control of atomic energy and predicted that the United States and the Soviet Union would soon eliminate their differences on this point. US Representative Austin stated that the debate on atomic energy showed that all representatives unanimously accepted the basic principles of the US atomic energy plan. Austin also proposed that the issue be referred back to the Atomic Energy Commission to study the details. Austin pointed out that the serious dispute that remains unresolved is the Soviet Union's unwillingness to waive its veto power when punishing countries that violate the agreement, but this issue is not hopeless. Austin also said: "We are currently engaged in the great undertaking that mankind has never undertaken before. We want to prevent war, and I firmly believe that we will not fail. We will not allow the negotiations to break down." Austin's proposal to refer the atomic energy plan back to the Atomic Energy Commission for discussion is clearly aimed at avoiding an immediate "showdown" in the Security Council, because if the Soviet Union vetoes it in the Security Council, the entire atomic energy issue will immediately be impossible to start. Austin continued: According to "inference," several points in the US atomic energy plan have been accepted by all representatives, because they have not been able to oppose them so far. The above points are as follows:

(1) International search of secret atomic engineering; (2) Signing an agreement to abolish atomic weapons and organize international investigation agencies (more than ten representatives expressed doubts as to whether the Soviet Union had agreed to this point in principle, or still insisted that atomic bombs should be destroyed first before the organization of international investigation agencies); (3) The application of atomic energy in peacetime belongs to the international sphere. Austin also listed the unresolved points as follows:

(1) Abolishing the veto privilege of the five powers when punishing countries that violate the atomic agreement; (2) International organizations should control all atomic activities, including the application of atomic energy in peacetime; (3) Should the destruction of atomic bombs be implemented immediately, or gradually implemented according to several steps in a careful plan.

Soviet Representative Gromyko immediately agreed to refer the case back to the Atomic Energy Commission and said: He hoped that the Commission should first concentrate on various broad principles, because if broad principles can be agreed upon, other details can be easily solved. However, the Security Council adjourned without holding a vote.

Formal Voting Procedure Scheduled for Friday

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] United Nations sources said: The Security Council will definitely adopt the US proposal to hand over the atomic energy report to the Atomic Energy Commission for research, so as to reconcile the differences between the US and the Soviet Union. The case is scheduled to be voted on Friday. Since the Soviet representative has already hinted at accepting the US proposal at yesterday's meeting, there is no problem in passing it. This attitude of the Soviet Union can ease the situation, because if Soviet Representative Gromyko insists on extending the discussion of the Security Council, he will not be able to obtain a satisfactory decision.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 25th] At today's Security Council meeting, Soviet Representative Gromyko declared that the Atomic Energy Commission had exceeded its authority. The Atomic Energy Commission did not draft an international convention in accordance with the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly to prohibit atomic weapons, so it violated the United Nations Charter. Australian Representative Hasluck immediately stood up to refute and said: All representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission agreed to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, but the Soviet representative insisted that atomic weapons should be prohibited first, while other representatives believed that an international control system should be established first. Therefore, opinions differed and could not be reconciled. In fact, the Atomic Energy Commission was acting completely in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

### Former Japanese Mandated Islands; Soviet Union Agrees to US Trusteeship; US Trusteeship Plan Formally Proposed

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall announced today: The Soviet government has agreed to place the former Japanese mandated islands under US trusteeship. He received a note from the Soviet government yesterday, stating that the Soviet government felt that it was fair to hand over the former Japanese mandated islands to the US trusteeship, because the United States assumed a decisive task in the war against Japan, and the sacrifices of its troops were far greater than those of other countries' troops. Marshall also said that the British government has not yet responded to this matter. He also declined to announce the full text of the Soviet note, believing that it should be announced by the Soviet government.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Authoritative sources said: When US Representative Austin asks the Council to pass the US proposal to govern the Pacific mandated islands, he will provide assurances that the United States' governance of these islands will strive to promote international peace and security.

[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 26th] The United States has completed its proposal to unilaterally govern the former Japanese mandated islands today, and it firmly believes that the Soviet Union's sudden change of position will enable the United Nations to accelerate the passage of its trusteeship plan. The US trusteeship plan will be submitted by US Representative Austin at today's Security Council meeting. Austin originally planned to delay it a little, because both the Soviet Union and Britain had requested that the trusteeship plan be established after the completion of the peace treaty with Japan. However, after the State Department learned of the Soviet Union's change of position, Austin also immediately changed his plan.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Regarding the United States' request to place the Pacific former Japanese mandated islands under US strategic trusteeship, the Soviet Union suddenly changed its policy and agreed to the United States' request before submitting it to today's Security Council for debate. The US attitude has therefore become more positive, and it intends to resolve the status of the islands without waiting for the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. US sources believe that Britain and Australia's opposition to immediately accepting the US request will be dispelled due to the Soviet Union's agreement. China and France have already stated that they have no objections unless the Soviet Union firmly opposes it. Observers believe that it is not possible to judge at this moment whether this concession by the Soviet Union is an exchange for the United States to make political concessions in Europe, and it must be decided after the Soviet Union's reply is announced.

The Motive Deserves Consideration

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The Soviet Union's surprising move to agree to the United States' trusteeship of the Pacific islands immediately aroused informal suspicion here today that the Soviet Union is trying to bargain and extend its influence in the Far East. The Soviet Union's statement coincides with the initial official statement of the Soviet Union's resolution to train a Korean army in northern Korea. According to US official estimates, this army currently has nearly 125,000 people. At the same time, US Secretary of Interior Krug, after conducting a wide-ranging inspection in Japan, will return to Washington with a plan to administer the Pacific islands by civilian officials, which are the islands that the United States has requested to be entrusted with. Experts on US-Soviet relations here do not want to express opinions, but wait for the situation to continue to develop, or it may be possible to determine the Soviet Union's motives. Some Japanese believe that the reason why the Soviet Union mentioned the sacrifices of the United States in occupying the islands is to ensure that all industrial equipment formerly owned by Japan is removed from its territory in the Northeast, because the Soviet Union has long publicized its "sacrifices" in the Northeast campaign. During Krug's stay, he did not want to express opinions on the military value of the Pacific islands, but it is undoubtedly certain that he will meet with military officials. These soldiers believe that the United States' defense line must surround the arc of Guam-Saipan-Tinian and be protected by a majority of forward bases, including Ryukyu and Iwo Jima. The speed of modern weapons has made Pearl Harbor geographically a domestic base and no longer an outpost base. To avoid the recurrence of the Pearl Harbor incident, the United States' bases must be deep in the Western Pacific. Australia has announced that it is concerned about the islands within Australia's sphere of influence, including the New Guinea trusteeship and New Caledonia and the Manus Islands.

### Australian Foreign Minister Speaks Freely on Diplomacy

[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt advocated today in the House of Representatives that there should be closer ties and joint action among the countries of the British Commonwealth. He believed that the autonomous territories are now fully grown and should bear more responsibility, cooperate closely, and actively assist the United Nations agencies. Evatt also said that Australia supports the United States' view that an atomic control system should be established first, and then the existing atomic bombs should be destroyed and the manufacture of atomic weapons should be terminated. On this point, Australia disagrees with the Soviet Union. Australia also supports the United States' acquisition of control over the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. Australia also believes that the established European peace is not enough to guarantee lasting peace. Australia also believes that the democratization of Japan is the ultimate goal of the Far East peace treaty negotiations, and the treaty should stipulate the supervision of Japan's foreign trade, domestic industry, and general economy until the United Nations agency believes that Japan can handle its own affairs. Australia also advocates convening a Pacific conference as soon as possible so that countries that actively fought against Japan can participate to resolve most of the outstanding issues related to Japan. Finally, he also advocated the establishment of regional agencies in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region at present to be responsible for the interests of the people in the region.

### Byrnes Said to be Appointed Ambassador to Britain

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] White House Press Secretary Ross refused to confirm or deny the claim that Byrnes will be appointed Ambassador to Britain. According to the Washington Post today, it criticized the delay in appointing an ambassador to Britain, advocating that Byrnes be selected for this important position.

### Moscow Conference Agenda: China Issue Not Included; Dulles Appointed as Advisor to Marshall, Accompanying Him

[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] The State Department spokesman stated today that there are no specific plans to discuss the China issue at the upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. Consideration of the China issue has not been included in the conference agenda. However, the spokesman stated that Secretary of State Marshall may discuss many other issues during the conference, including the China issue, but these issues will not be discussed immediately during the conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] Regarding all the difficult issues between the United States and the Soviet Union, it is reported by well-informed sources here that Secretary of State Marshall must arrive in Moscow and observe the situation of the negotiations before deciding whether to submit these issues to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. As for the difficult issues between the United States and the Soviet Union, they include the following: (1) the Korean issue; (2) the Soviet Union's return of the U.S. Lend-Lease issue; (3) the Turkey/Dardanelles issue; and (4) the issue of disarmament and control of atomic energy. In any case, what is always discussed at the Moscow Conference will not be limited to the German issue. The relationship between Germany and Europe will also be discussed.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] The U.S. State Department today announced the list of U.S. representatives attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The delegation is led by Secretary of State Marshall, with a total of more than eighty people, half of whom are secretaries and translators. The representatives include Murphy, political advisor to the U.S. military in Germany, and Clark, U.S. High Commissioner to Austria. John Foster Dulles, a New York lawyer and foreign policy advisor to former presidential candidate Dewey, has also been appointed as a special advisor. In addition, there are five political advisors, seven economic advisors, four military government advisors, five army and navy advisors, and legal advisors and assistants.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall commented on the Moscow Conference, stating that U.S. policy is still based on the obligations assumed by the U.S. at the Potsdam Conference, and according to the general policies that conform to the Potsdam Agreement. These policies were later fully explained by former Secretary of State Byrnes in his speech in Stuttgart, Germany, last year. When asked about the settlement of Lend-Lease materials, Marshall said there was no new information from the Soviet side. When further pressed on Foreign Minister Molotov's protest against Secretary of State Acheson's slip of the tongue, Marshall said he believed the matter was over.

### Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference: Declared Ended Yesterday

German Peace Treaty Issue Submitted to Foreign Ministers Conference

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference this morning intended to discuss the Austrian peace treaty and immediately passed the report to be submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, declaring the drafting work for the Austrian peace treaty to be completed. The report includes four parts: one is political clauses, one is military clauses, one is economic clauses, and the other is final clauses. All the clauses on which agreement has been reached (such as guarantees to prevent the merger of Germany and Austria, German property in Austria, and the issue of exiled people) will be submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers also passed the proposal of the British representative Hooton, deciding to distribute the report to the governments of the Allied countries for filing. Regarding the request of the Yugoslav representative to attend the Moscow Conference, it was also decided to hand it over to the Foreign Ministers Conference for handling.

[Central News Agency, London, 25th Dispatch] The four will make the final decision. During a long five-hour meeting last night, the opinions of all parties failed to converge. The Soviet representative Gusev resolutely opposed granting other smaller allied nations greater rights when discussing the German peace treaty. Finally, the representatives decided to submit a report to the Four Foreign Ministers, with each of the four representatives submitting individual recommendations.

### Dispute Between Britain and the Soviet Union: Bevin to Propose a Comprehensive Settlement Plan to Stalin

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] According to well-informed sources, when Foreign Secretary Bevin attends the Moscow Conference next month, he will present a comprehensive plan to Stalin for resolving major international disputes, including (1) the conclusion of an alliance between the three countries to ensure that Germany is permanently disarmed; (2) the establishment of a separate agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, stipulating that neither country shall interfere in events within the other's sphere of influence, with Britain's sphere of influence being the Near East and the Middle East; and (3) the Soviet Union shipping timber, flax, cotton, and other goods to Britain, and Britain providing financial assistance to the Soviet Union. This point has never been mentioned before and will likely be discussed in detail in Moscow.

### On the Palestinian Political Situation: Bevin Criticizes U.S. Policy

[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin today accused the United States of adding obstacles to the Palestine issue during the Palestine debate in the House of Commons, undermining the British government's efforts to get the Jewish community to participate in the London Conference, which ultimately led to the failure of the conference. Bevin also said that the current number of Jews immigrating to Palestine has only increased fivefold in the history of Jewish immigration, and the Arabs have tacitly acknowledged that the government can no longer follow the immigration restrictions of the 1939 White Paper. Just as Britain was trying to negotiate an agreement to replace the White Paper, President Truman suddenly issued a statement on Jewish immigration in October, which caused the Jewish representatives to refuse to participate in the negotiations at the London Conference. He had asked U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes not to publish President Truman's statement, but Byrnes replied that if Truman did not publish it, the Republican Dewey would publish it. The British problem has obviously become a topic of the U.S. election. The United States should know that Britain is the trustee state of Palestine and bears all the responsibilities of a trustee state. Bevin also said that he was prepared to accept all the recommendations of the Anglo-American Palestine Committee report, but the United States only accepted the point of allowing 100,000 Jews to immigrate. He felt that based on humanitarian grounds, the Arab community might allow the immigration of 100,000 Jews, but the difficulty lies in the Jewish community's demand to establish a Jewish state. The Arab countries firmly oppose partition, and have stated that if partition is desired, they will sue Britain before the United Nations. Establishing two countries in Palestine is impossible. He felt that the Arabs should not be placed under Jewish rule, and the Jews should not be placed under Arab rule. Britain finally decided that trusteeship was not feasible. The failure was not in the trusteeship administration of Palestine, but in the failure of the international community to handle this entire issue in accordance with moral principles. Currently, if the idea of establishing a Jewish state can be abandoned, he is prepared to temporarily not appeal to the United Nations and continue to try.

U.S. Reaction

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] New York Democratic Congressman Celler and the pro-Jewish newspaper "New York Post" both expressed indignation at British Foreign Secretary Bevin's public accusation against the United States in the House of Commons. There has been no reaction from the White House. Members of Congress were also surprised by Bevin's remarks. The American League for a Free Palestine has sent a telegram to President Truman, asking him to seriously protest to the British government. New York's evening newspapers all published Bevin's critical speech with headline titles.

### Ambassador Cheng Hosts Banquet for British Foreign Secretary Bevin

Bevin Sings Loudly After Drinking

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] The Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Cheng Tien-hsi, and his wife hosted a banquet at the embassy last night for British Foreign Secretary Bevin and his wife. After the meal, Bevin sang "Auld Lang Syne" in the most cheerful mood. Guests also included the Brazilian Ambassador (head of the diplomatic corps), the Soviet Ambassador and his wife, and the Egyptian Ambassador and his wife. (Translator's note: "Auld Lang Syne" is a well-known British song, written by the famous poet Burns. The famous film "Waterloo Bridge" used this as its theme song.)

### Stalemate in British-Egyptian Negotiations: Egypt Refuses Mediation

[Reuters, Cairo, 26th] A senior official closely associated with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy told reporters that Egypt could not accept the suggestion of Syria and Lebanon to mediate the deadlock in the British-Egyptian negotiations. Egypt has decided to appeal to the United Nations.

### Oldest Pyramid Discovered in the Southern Suburbs of Cairo

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 25th] The Egyptian pyramids have always been considered to be the oldest to be the Pyramid of Djoser. However, recently, French archaeologist Lauer and Egyptian archaeologist El-Salam examined and researched the Dahshur Pyramid in the southern suburbs of Cairo and have obtained evidence to prove that the Dahshur Pyramid was built during the reign of Sneferu, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, making it older than the Pyramid of Djoser.

### British Houses of Parliament Debate Policy Towards India: Attlee Clarifies Stance: Responsibility for Defense Will Also Be Borne by the Indian People

[Associated Press, London, 25th] British Prime Minister Attlee reported on India in the House of Commons on the evening of the 25th, stating that when Britain fully transfers power to India by the end of June 1948, the responsibility for India's defense will also be handed over to the Indian people to be responsible for themselves. However, if India requests British assistance in times of emergency, the door to this request can still be reopened. "If India decides to continue as a British dominion, its status will be the same as the relationship between other dominions and the British government. If India decides to leave Britain, we will still be extremely concerned about India's future security. The British government will be prepared to discuss this matter with India. The responsibilities and obligations of both parties will be based on the Charter of the United Nations." At the same time, during the parliamentary debate on the India issue, Viscount Templewood said that the British decision to withdraw from India by a certain date was like a gambler's bet, with no turning back, which would cause the Indian government to suffer irreparable losses. He said that the Labor government's "New Deal" on the India issue seemed to be an unconditional surrender, not a policy of appeasement.

### U.S. Welcomes British Decision on India

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Dean Acheson issued a statement today, morally supporting Britain's announcement to withdraw from India on a regular basis and allowing it to complete its establishment as a free and independent country, and called on all political parties in India to unite. Acheson said: Internal strife in India may become a new source of international tension in a world that has just begun to restore peace. The U.S. government has clearly expressed its concern for the establishment of a fully autonomous government in India during a peaceful transition, and welcomes Britain's sincere efforts to promote Indian unity.

### International Control of Oil: Prevent Monopoly for Rational Distribution

Some have suggested placing all of the world’s oil under United Nations control, but the private oil industry has strongly opposed this suggestion. A proposal from the U.S. State Department’s Petroleum Division to establish a world regulatory body, although modified, is still believed by oil companies to be possible. Most oil companies have decided to express their opposition. The U.S. petroleum industry, which holds 55 percent of the world’s oil resources, might cooperate with a purely advisory international organization. However, oil companies almost unanimously oppose a world agency that could determine U.S. oil policies or alter its oil-extraction rights.

The Anglo-Dutch Shell Oil Company, second in importance to the U.S., would also certainly oppose international control of oil.

Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement

The “Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement,” little more than a potential stepping stone for international oil control proposals, has already sparked debate among U.S. oilmen. The fundamental purpose of this agreement is to guarantee that people of all nations have access to sufficient oil in international trade, based on principles of fair competition, and to safeguard the interests of oil-producing nations. Delegations from both the U.S. and Britain are organizing a three-member committee to study postwar petroleum problems, technical improvements, trends in the oil industry, and the regulation of global supply and demand.

Ultimately, all parties involved in producing or using oil would be invited to join this agreement. The aforementioned committee would be expanded into an international petroleum committee, purely advisory in nature.

The U.S. State Department’s petroleum experts are currently in Britain discussing steps for implementing the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement and also discussing a more comprehensive plan. This plan aims to establish a global oil policy and set up an international oil control agency, perhaps under the jurisdiction of the United Nations.

World Oil Policy

According to the explanation of U.S. State Department petroleum experts, the main goal of a world oil policy is to prevent monopolies in the oil market, allow smaller companies to participate in the international market, and ensure that oil produced worldwide is rationally distributed to all countries based on principles of equality. One of the biggest goals is to ensure that all parties involved in oil-field development, including the people in the regions where the oil fields are located, can share in the benefits.

International Oil Agency

This world oil agency would be composed of experts from several countries, possibly affiliated with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It would consider political and economic issues related to international oil trade, study oil-extraction conditions worldwide, and guide governments and oil companies in taking appropriate measures to achieve mutual benefit and stabilize markets.

Additionally, this agency would have the authority to review and recommend re-examinations of oil-field extraction rights. Countries that have already obtained extraction rights could request that the agency review the consent of the assignees. Countries believing they are not obtaining sufficient supply could appeal to this agency.

U.S. oilmen believe this plan poses several dangers. They feel that an international agency affiliated with the United Nations could impose various restrictions on domestic U.S. oil transactions. The issue of the U.S. oil supply is also a concern for most oil companies. Some experts believe that U.S. exploration efforts are not quickly discovering new oil fields to replace those that are nearing exhaustion. They predict that in ten years, the U.S. will become a major oil-importing nation. They favor importing oil to bolster national strength.

U.S. Oil Company Attitude

However, U.S. oil companies insist that the U.S. has vast amounts of oil that have not yet been extracted, including the vast shale layers from which oil can be extracted. They oppose importing oil, fearing that an international agency with control would force large amounts of oil into the U.S.

Companies exploring oil fields abroad mostly oppose any plan that could call for re-examination of extraction rights. This is because these companies must spend huge sums of money exploring and developing an oil field before obtaining commercially viable quantities of oil. For example, U.S. oil companies in Venezuela spent US$470 million before exporting a single barrel of oil. They fear that international agencies will not adequately consider the costs incurred and risks taken in developing oil fields. They feel that when conflicts arise over extraction rights, it is better to seek protection from the U.S. government than to appeal to an international agency.

However, a few major entrepreneurs feel that establishing an international agency to control oil under the United Nations would be more beneficial than harmful. Assuming the Soviet Union participates in this agency, the Soviet Union would have to disclose facts related to oil transactions, possibly leading to a solution to the oil problems in Eastern Europe.

U.S. State Department View

U.S. State Department experts believe that the power of the international agency would be purely advisory. However, oil companies fear that an advisory agency could overstep its bounds and assume regulatory authority. They are also concerned that a United Nations regulatory agency could provoke opposition to the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement.

The fate of the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement depends on the U.S. Senate. The agreement has been shelved in the Foreign Relations Committee for nearly a year without a meeting to review it, initially because the U.S. Congress had not yet made a decision on the loan to Britain, and subsequently because the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was attending international conferences, making it impossible to convene a review meeting. It is expected that when the agreement is brought up for review in the Foreign Relations Committee, both supporters and opponents will actively mobilize, and when it is finally presented in the Senate, it will spark intense debate.

It is uncertain whether the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement will pass in the Senate. However, if it is rejected, the hopes of those who favor international control of oil will suffer a serious blow. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)

### Truman Issues Order Modifying U.S. Reciprocal Trade Policy: Protects Industry and Commerce, Prevents Dumping of Foreign Goods

[United Press, Washington, 25th] In an effort to dispel Republican lawmakers' criticism of his free trade policy, President Truman issued an executive order today to strengthen the protection of U.S. interests and prevent the dumping of cheap foreign goods into the U.S. This order was issued after consultation with Republican Senators Vandenberg and Millikin, and the reciprocal trade policy promoted by former Secretary of State Hull was greatly modified as a result. However, Truman also stated that the principles established by Hull in 1934 would still be followed. The presidential order stipulates: (1) All imported goods that are sufficient to "harm domestic manufacturers" must be restricted. (2) The President has the right to amend or abolish treaties signed with foreign countries that contain low tax rates that hinder U.S. industry and commerce. This provision was recommended by Vandenberg and Millikin. (3) Any trade agreement must include a "most favored nation" clause to ensure that U.S. exporters enjoy the same opportunities in foreign markets as any other country.

### Soviet Federal Assembly Passes Constitutional Amendments

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] The local radio station announced that the constitutional amendments proposed by Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky have been passed by the Soviet Federal Assembly.

[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] Vyshinsky, Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Supreme Soviet Constitution, announced today at the Supreme Soviet meeting a plan to amend the constitution regarding the distribution of powers of each republic. The two most important points are to allow each Soviet republic to send its own diplomatic representatives and to have its own army. Other powers, such as the power to pass laws related to marriage and family and to issue medals and certificates, are only held by the Soviet Union. The eight-hour workday system implemented since 1940 is also included in the constitution. The Soviet Parliament also has the power to approve or revoke treaties. Men and women over the age of 18 have the right to elect members of the Supreme Soviet, and men and women over the age of 21 have the right to be elected.

### United Nations Observer in Korea Sends Telegram to Stalin with Questions

[Associated Press, New York, 25th] Miss Hua Luyi, the Korean observer to the United Nations, sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin today, asking Stalin to confirm or deny the statement by Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the U.S. military in South Korea, that the Soviet Union is training and arming 500,000 Koreans in North Korea. Miss Hua also told Stalin that in addition to lifting the artificial division at the 38th parallel in the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones, quickly unifying Korea and completing its independence would enhance deeper friendship between the United Nations and Korea. At the same time, Hua Luyi wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting that the United Nations send an investigative committee of the same nature as the Balkan investigation team to conduct an on-site investigation in Korea to verify Lieutenant General Hodge's report.

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] According to reliable sources, General Hodge, commander of the U.S. military district in Korea, said that despite the Soviet Union's various actions in North Korea, the U.S. military in Korea does not need to be increased further. The current level of 55,000 people can be maintained, or may be reduced further. Hodge also reiterated at the end of the Senate Army Committee meeting his previous condemnation at a press conference of the Soviet Union's conscription of troops in North Korea.

### Zhdanov Resigns as Chairman of the Soviet Nationalities Council

Vacancy Succeeded by Parnonov

[United Press, London, 25th] Moscow Radio broadcast today that Marshal Zhdanov, a famous general in the Battle of Leningrad, has applied to resign from his position as Chairman of the Soviet Nationalities Council. Zhdanov's reason for resigning is said to be that he is overwhelmed by the heavy duties of his position. Zhdanov is a secretary of the Communist Party Central Political Bureau and a confidant of Marshal Stalin. European and American newspapers have even called him Stalin's successor.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] After Zhdanov's resignation, the Soviet Nationalities Council unanimously elected Parnonov, representative of the Moscow region, to succeed him.

### Japanese Doctor Invents New Brain Surgery Method

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 26th Radio: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," Masao Kitaoka, director of Kumamoto Municipal Hospital in Japan, has invented a new brain surgery method to cure neurasthenia, dementia, and other mental illnesses. The new surgical technique invented by Kitaoka includes the lobotomy and removal of the prefrontal lobe, which is considered the most difficult and dangerous surgery. Nine out of ten mental patients treated by Kitaoka have been cured.

### Index Problem Has Been Instructed; Specific Measures Can Be Announced Today; Mayor and Social Affairs Bureau Chief Returned to Shanghai Last Night; Number of Rationed Items for Workers Expected to Increase

[Report from This Newspaper] Mayor Wu, after being summoned to Beijing the day before yesterday, returned here at 11 o'clock last night. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Peter, Chief of the Public Relations Section, who accompanied him to Beijing, also returned in the same train. According to Mayor Wu, his trip to Beijing was purely to discuss the issue of the cost of living index with the central authorities, and a proper solution has now been negotiated and can be implemented within days. Mayor Wu took the express train to Beijing the night before last. After arriving in Beijing yesterday morning, he went to see President Song to discuss the issue of the cost of living index. After leaving, he went to the Chairman's residence to visit Chairman Chiang and had lunch with the Chairman.

It is also reported that the specific measures to solve the cost of living index issue are expected to be announced by Director Wu Kaixian today.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Since the promulgation of the emergency measures plan and the freezing of the cost of living index, workers in Shanghai have sent Shui Xiangyun and others from the General Labor Union to Beijing to petition. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, also came to Beijing specifically for this matter to ask for instructions. The reporter visited Huang Bode, Director of the Social Affairs Department, on the morning of the 26th and asked what countermeasures the government would take in this regard. He was told that the government's decision could not be easily changed, but the authorities would try to help solve the workers' difficulties in life. Shanghai workers originally enjoyed three kinds of in-kind supplies: rice, cloth, and coal. Now they are requesting that the number of rationed items be increased to be equal to that of public school teachers (i.e., from the current three to six). They are also requesting that the quantity be increased to the same number. The Bureau is currently considering this, or it may take a discount method to increase the types of rations, but the quantity will likely remain the same. The above refers to Shanghai and other places. As for the wages of workers in other designated cities for price assessment, the Social Affairs Department is drafting "Measures to Stabilize Wages," because if prices are managed to be stabilized, wages cannot be allowed to rise, causing wages to lead prices, creating a cyclical increase. These measures will be drafted within three or four days and submitted to the Executive Yuan and the National Defense Committee.

### Pan Public Exhibition Chairman in Beijing Discusses Emergency Measures Plan: Shanghai Business Community Provides Four Points Hoping the Government Adopts

[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing office on the 26th] This newspaper's reporter recently interviewed Mr. Pan Gongzhan and asked about the situation in the Shanghai business community after the government announced the economic emergency measures plan. He said the following: After the announcement of the plan, it is hoped that it will be thoroughly implemented, and it is especially hoped that the government and the people can cooperate in its implementation. Even if there are difficulties, efforts should be made to remedy them to achieve the goal. As for the general legitimate business community in Shanghai, they offer several suggestions, urgently hoping that the government can adopt and implement them: (1) The plan should proceed simultaneously with production loans and should not be abandoned due to choking for fear of food. Production loans should not be stopped due to the gold and banknote turmoil. If only credit tightening and loan recovery are known, it will actually hinder production. If the goal is to prevent production loans from flowing into speculation, the method of the Nelson Wartime Production Bureau can be adopted, using the government's fixed fee for ordering goods from factories as loans. In this way, the government can obtain materials, and the business community can also obtain loans. Funds can flow into production, and loans can also be exchanged for real goods, without causing inflation. (2) Gold is settled in US dollars, that is, gold is exchanged for US dollars. Anyone holding gold and depositing it in the Central Bank will have a US dollar account recorded. These households will have priority in applying for imported goods, such as machinery and raw materials. The gold exchanged is not legal tender, so there is no inflation. And the imported goods are all necessities, which will not affect the rise in prices. (3) Strengthening the control of financial business has actually become the exclusive management of banks and money houses. This regulation is not entirely applicable to the Shanghai market, because most of the funds in Shanghai are still floating capital, staying in underground banks or bill discounting companies. If banks and money houses are tightened up as much as possible, the funds will flow even more into floating capital. The Central Bank's reserve deposits from various banks in Shanghai are only 40 billion, which shows that each bank can only absorb 200 billion deposits. The amount of funds in Shanghai is only one-tenth of this. Therefore, it is specially recommended to reasonably adjust the interest rate, so that floating capital can flow into banks and be invested in production. (4) Regarding the wage issue, the old method should be followed in January. From February onwards, the cost of living index will still be announced as usual, but wages can be paid with a discount based on the index ratio. The procedures can be simplified, and workers will suffer less. In terms of in-kind distribution, factories only have three types, which will also cause disputes, so it is hoped that the government can pay attention to it.

### The Machine Industry Union of Four Districts Invites the Press to Report

[Report from this newspaper] The Industrial Union of Machine Manufacturing Industry in the Fourth District of Shanghai held a press conference at its association on Pingliang Road yesterday afternoon, hoping that the government would restore the cost of living index for salary payments, or effectively restore the price index to the January level. If a satisfactory reply cannot be obtained before the 5th of next month, they will jointly organize a large-scale petition with trade unions from all industries in Shanghai.

### Bartering: The Northeast Economic Council Sends a Letter to the Municipal Government for Adoption

The Northeast Economic Committee recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating briefly: After the promulgation of the economic emergency measures plan, the prices in various places are determined by the competent authorities themselves. The situations in various places are different, and the prices are inevitably uneven. The Northeast produces soybeans and bean cakes, which are in great demand in the mainland, but the prices are lower than in the mainland, while the prices of other daily necessities, such as cloth, cotton yarn, flour, sugar, and tea, are higher than in the mainland. If there are no appropriate measures, materials will inevitably flow into the hands of hoarders, and citizens and farmers will not be able to obtain their actual benefits. If the above-mentioned goods are transported to the Northeast for barter, the association will handle the pricing at any time. After receiving the letter, the municipal government has sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling.

### The Shanghai Branch of the Industry Association Provides Suggestions for Stabilizing Prices and Promoting Production

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the National Industry Association hosted the press last night. Chairman Hu Boxiang reported first, stating briefly that the government's emergency measures were intended to suppress prices. The industrial community is most concerned about suppressing prices. However, to suppress the prices of manufactured goods, attention should first be paid to raw materials and wages. In terms of raw materials, the industrial community hopes to directly apply for foreign exchange and directly order foreign goods, without going through the hands of importers and their exploitation. In terms of wages, the industrial community believes that before the in-kind distribution method is effectively implemented, the cost of living index method should continue to be maintained, otherwise, labor unrest will inevitably continue to be caused. Secretary-General Tian Heqing reported, briefly stating that the government's emergency measures are intended to suppress prices, and the prohibition of gold and banknote trading is actually a method of abandoning the root and pursuing the tip. Intending to stabilize wages and freeze the cost of living index is even more like burying one's head in the sand. If the government really wants to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, it should pay attention to how to promote production. To promote production, the following points must be resolved: (1) The factory's funds—to make domestic floating capital tend to production businesses, high-interest loans must be banned, and the method is to ban underground money houses. (2) National banks provide low-interest loans to Minfeng Bank, and then private banks lend to factories engaged in production. The total amount should be larger than production loans, and the procedures should be simple. (3) Raw materials—the government should allocate raw materials at fair prices to private factories, and should not be limited to state-owned factories. (4) Wages—the cost of living index was originally not set for wages, but in the current situation, it is still a kind of reference for paying wages, and the in-kind distribution system actually hinders the freedom of salaried people to use their salaries, and the procedures are extremely cumbersome. Therefore, the government should still announce the cost of living index every month, and factories can adopt either the cost of living index system or the in-kind distribution system, allowing them to do as they please. If not, the government can stipulate the minimum wage figure in various places for compliance. (5) Market—now the foreign market is equivalent to being frozen. If there are no appropriate measures, the market outside the customs will be monopolized by Japan. (6) Factory Equipment—At present, the equipment of various factories is outdated, but if the above problems cannot be solved, the factories will not be able to improve the equipment.

The association held a membership meeting on February 19 and passed measures to stabilize prices and promote production, and suggested them to the government, hoping that the government could adopt the opinions of the industrial community to seek the development of the entire production business.

### After the Economic Supervisory Group Was Reorganized, an Economic Investigation Network Was Established, Thoroughly Investigating the Gold Rush: The Results of the Investigation Will Have a Surprising Report

[Report from this newspaper] The second group affairs meeting of the Economic Supervision Group was held at the Garrison Headquarters at 10 am yesterday. The chief of the group, Xuan, and all members, secretaries, and group leaders attended. The following resolutions were made: (1) The investigation report on the causes of the financial market unrest in this city should be completed by the end of this month as much as possible. Any persons suspected of manipulation and speculation will be listed together with the facts and reported to Chairman Jiang for approval. (2) From March 1, it will be reorganized into an "Economic Investigation Network". The work will be based on the economic emergency measures plan passed by the Supreme National Defense Conference, assisting the competent authorities to be responsible for stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. It will focus its efforts on monitoring daily necessities, and may adopt confidential methods externally. If action is necessary, the relevant units will be commanded by the Songhu Preparation Headquarters to execute.

[Another report] The Economic Supervision Group's work of thoroughly investigating the gold rush will be completed in the next few days. Xu Youzuo, the leader of the group's gold and banknote group, told reporters yesterday that the results of this thorough investigation will be completely unexpected when they are announced in the future. As for how it will be unexpected, he firmly refused to reveal it. However, according to another source from a relevant responsible person, there are about ten people suspected of being involved in the gold rush case, including important personnel from economic and financial institutions.

Studying the Causes and Investigating the Central Bank Again

It is also reported that when the Economic Supervision Group was first established, it studied the causes of the gold rush. In addition to the large circulation of year-end bonuses and rewards on the market and the concurrent lending of production loans, the Central Bank's cessation of secret sales was also an important factor in promoting the rise in gold prices. Therefore, whether the Central Bank, which is responsible for stabilizing gold prices, handled it properly in this turmoil is also one of the investigation targets of the Economic Supervision Group. Xu Youzuo, the leader of the gold and banknote group, and He Hanwen, a member of the Supervisory Committee, went to the Central Bank again yesterday to review the account books. In addition, personnel were sent to investigate the safety deposit boxes of various banks.

Zheng Jiemin and Others Returned to Beijing One After Another

### A Citizen Suggests That the Japanese Staying in Shanghai Should Be Sent Back Quickly, and Industrial Institutions Should Not Employ Them

[Report from this newspaper] Citizen Li Hanwen recently suggested to the Municipal Senate that public and private industrial institutions in my country should not employ Japanese and should be sent back quickly. Those who must be retained should also be strictly managed and thoroughly examined, and Japanese technicians who hang up their signs without actually doing anything and the industrial institutions that collude with them should be severely punished, so as not to be ridiculed by the government for being confused and to prevent the hidden dangers for our nation. According to Li Hanwen, most of the Japanese expatriates staying in Shanghai claim to be technicians. In fact, there are countless such personnel among the Chinese, and there are also non-technical personnel mixed in. The reason why they are unwilling to return to their country is nothing more than: (1) In the past, they relied on the power of their country to use unscrupulous elements in China to divide and conquer in order to preserve their property, wait for the opportunity, and try to return fully loaded. (2) Staying in Shanghai is to protect the property of Japanese expatriates who have returned to their country first. (3) The Japanese are mostly cunning. Those with small craft skills go everywhere to solicit Chinese cooperation in business operations, hoping to make huge profits. (4) They hide in the city or suburbs, live with Chinese women, and live comfortably and indulgently, using this to cover up their attempts to engage in illegal activities. The Municipal Senate will forward the above-mentioned opinions to various industrial institutions and organizations for adoption.

### Shen Siliang Tried for the Third Time: The Defense Lawyer Presents Counter-Evidence: The Four Words "Celebrities Outside the Association" Are Beneficial to the Defendant

[Report from this newspaper] Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was tried for the third time yesterday at the High Court on suspicion of being a traitor. Professors and students from the school crowded the second criminal court to listen, and there was no space left. Those who arrived later stood and listened. Shen is fifty-two years old, from Ningbo, his hair is already gray, he is wearing a gray woolen coat and a floral scarf, he puts on glasses when reading documents, and takes off his glasses when answering, and his attitude is quite calm.

Shen Siliang claimed: The evidence provided in the reply from the Military Statistics Bureau was all extracted from the false reports at that time, and there was actually no such thing. However, because he was under Japanese rule at that time, he had no way to defend himself. I never participated in the Anti-British and American Association, how could I be a director? I never gave a speech on stage. The position of chairman of the false Shanghai Sports Association was because I had more than 20 years of history in the sports field and was publicly elected by the sports community. There were both Chinese and foreign teams in the association, and I never solicited donations from outside, and I had nothing to do with Ding Mocun. I never participated in the two invitations from the enemy ambassador Mitsuaki and the traitor Wang Jingwei. I never participated in the false New National Movement Promotion Committee. Chen Gongbo put my name in as a standing director of the false Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Shanghai Branch without asking for my consent. I didn't even know the meaning of the false Shanghai Citizen's Day Movement Committee, let alone participate in the organization. I once served as a consulting committee member of the false Shanghai Municipal Government Consulting Committee, but that was just a public opinion organ representing the people. There was no "Education Committee" in the association, let alone a convener. I was neither a member nor an initiator of the false Shanghai Citizen's Welfare Association. Finally, it was said that the "Shen Bao" yearbook and the New China Handbook during the period of the fall were all presided over by Chen Binhe, and the materials in them were completely unreliable.

Then, the defense lawyer Hong Shihao presented a piece of powerful evidence, which was the "Shen Bao" on January 26, 1943, the content of which was to solicit loans from the Anti-British and American Association and ask "celebrities outside the association" Shen Siliang and others to give speeches. Lawyer Hong emphasized: "Since they are called 'celebrities outside the association', it can be seen that the defendant did not serve as a director of the association, which is actually a powerful piece of counter-evidence." Then, lawyer Mi Xitong stood up to defend and requested bail and permission to see family members.

Judge Xiao ordered: This case still needs to investigate various pieces of evidence from the Shen Bao archives. The hearing will be rescheduled. The request for bail can be submitted in writing and decided by the collegiate panel. The defendant is allowed to see family members and then returned to custody.

A portion of the officers bravely charged in to search, and after half an hour, they finally captured the three robbers one after another. Afterwards, Chief Song jumped onto the bandstand, first offering an apology, and then explaining the profound significance of the anti-theft drill, hoping for cooperation between the citizens and the police.

### Daring Pickpocketing – Squandering Money Like Dirt on Prostitution, Gambling, and Dancing

### Reader Consultation – Legal Questions

(1) Unmarried Pregnancy

Jin San asks: I have several legal questions and would like to request answers: (1) Miss A (19 years old) was seduced by Mr. B (22 years old) after their engagement, resulting in an unmarried pregnancy, and then abandoned by Mr. B. What crimes has Mr. B committed under the law? Can Miss A request alimony? (2) Miss A intends to dissolve the engagement with Mr. B, but Mr. B avoids meeting her. She negotiated with Mr. B's father, who said that he had severed relations with his son. What legal method should she use? (3) If Miss A cohabits with Mr. C before completing the termination of the engagement, does she commit adultery?

[Lawyer Fu Kuangling's Answer] (1) Mr. B's seduction of his fiancée Miss A, depending on the circumstances, may constitute the crime of harming public morals, harming the family, or infringing on freedom under criminal law. If Mr. B now ignores Miss A, and if Miss A has not become a member of Mr. B's family, or there is no special agreement for support, then Mr. B does not commit the crime of abandonment, but Miss A can request compensation for damages, rather than request alimony. (2) Since Mr. B is of age and has independent capacity for action, negotiations with his father cannot be used. When filing a lawsuit, if Mr. B's whereabouts are unknown, you can apply to the court for public service of the summons regarding the request to dissolve the engagement. (3) Miss A has not yet married Mr. B, so she cannot be immediately considered to have a spouse. If she cohabits with Mr. C before the termination of the engagement, it does not constitute the crime of adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and Mr. B has no right to sue. However, Mr. B can dissolve the engagement according to the provisions of Article 976, paragraph 1, item 7 of the Civil Code.

(2) Transferring Affection to Another

Wang Xuejun asks: Mr. A is already married, but is now in love with Ms. B, his classmate, and has already had sexual relations with her. Now Mr. A and Ms. B wish to live together until their hair turns white. What legal conflicts arise from this behavior of Mr. A and Ms. B? (2) Can Ms. B break away from her family to marry Mr. A?

[Lawyer Fu Kuangling's Answer] (1) Mr. A, having a spouse, commits the crime of adultery with Ms. B under Article 239 of the Criminal Code. Only the spouse can sue. If Mr. A and Ms. B formally marry, they commit the crime of bigamy, which is also subject to prosecution upon complaint. (2) If Ms. B is an adult over the age of 20, there is no need to break away from her family, and her parents cannot interfere with her behavior.

### Ambassador Stuart Gives a Speech to Students in Guangzhou – Believes China Needs Students with Various Types of Training

(American News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th) Ambassador Stuart gave a speech here today to university and middle school students as follows: "Guangzhou has been liberated from the clutches of the invaders, and has once again risen as a center of historical, commercial, international contact, and political innovation. I am truly delighted to revisit this old place, and words cannot express my feelings. The past events of the revolutionary movement, especially those related to the founding father of the nation, float in my mind one after another, because we are now gathered in this Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. I am also deeply moved to face the Chinese students, because you all represent great potential.

Victory in the War of Resistance Attributed to Students

I remember that when the May Fourth Student Anti-Japanese Movement occurred in 1919, I began to reside in Beijing. Later, whether I was in Beijing or elsewhere, I worked closely with the students, who were full of patriotic enthusiasm and awakened the people to jointly resist foreign threats. I believe that the Chinese people, regardless of hardship, loss, disaster, and death, embarked on the road of resistance against Japan, mostly due to the national consciousness awakened by these student movements, which realized the teaching of Mencius that "those who know first awaken those who know later, those who are aware first awaken those who are aware later." In order for China to engage in resistance in the initial four years, and finally achieve victory after four years following the Pearl Harbor Incident, the achievement of victory should be largely attributed to Chinese students.

Future Activities Focus on Construction

Therefore, regarding the ways in which I believe that current Chinese students can express the same patriotic enthusiasm in useful activities, I would like to frankly state my views to you, because I firmly believe that today's students' patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of the students who resisted foreign aggression in the past. China's current problem is internal, and I believe that all future activities should focus on constructive rather than destructive work. Previously, revolutionary movements against the Manchu Qing, Japan, or any other crisis, all involved destructive agitation, which was unavoidable. However, I believe that the era of overthrowing, resisting, destroying, or engaging in other kinds of negative agitation has now passed. Having witnessed the destruction of cities and the suffering of the people, I am increasingly aware of the importance of dedicating myself to constructive work.

Future Citizens Need Training

In the near future, China needs students with various types of training (including applied sciences, social or government activities, and other useful public services). Therefore, you must study hard, and you must remember that the training you are currently receiving should be suitable for the special cause that will allow you to maximize your patriotic goals. At the same time, you can always think about national issues. I firmly believe that students should be interested in current politics. You will become citizens of the future. Unless citizens actively participate in the government, there will never be a good democratic government. The new constitution allows you freedom of speech, press, and assembly. You live in a very important era: first, a truly democratic government is being actively planned in your country's long history. From an American standpoint, we naturally feel a deep interest in this promising development in China. To use the words of the American Declaration of Independence, "this is a government derived from the consent of the governed," which is the immortal motto that guided the birth of our country. Behind this idea lies a philosophy that any change in government or society, no matter how necessary and urgent, if it has been obtained with the consent of those concerned, its results will always be very effective, very complete, and less destructive. In other words, changes in society or government are promoted by education rather than by force or dictatorship. As Mencius said, "To subdue men by force is not to subdue their hearts, to subdue men by virtue makes them pleased in their hearts and sincerely submit."

Universal Education and Wise Leadership

A democratic government requires universal education and wise leadership. Most importantly, it needs leaders and citizens who abandon selfish thoughts and serve the people as a prerequisite. When you nurture these noble ideals and generously share these principles with your compatriots, I believe that you will gain a way to express your patriotic enthusiasm, the effect of which will be far greater than that of misguided revolutionary agitation, and will be adapted to the current needs of the people.

(Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th) The Mandarin Promotion Committee of the Provincial Government's Education Department recently launched Mandarin Movement Week to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Mandarin Movement and to celebrate Mr. Wu Zhihui's birthday.

### GuanggHan Dismissal of Teacher Dispute – Reasonable Solution Expected Within Days

(Our Newspaper News) The private Guanghan Primary School in this city held a reception for the press yesterday regarding the dispute over the dismissal of teachers Sha Zhizhen and Li Jie. According to the principal of the school, Gao Zhengxiang: (1) Sha and Li often ordered students to watch the clock during class, which affected students' emotions in class. (2) Class often changed to free activities. (3) There was too little music teaching material. (4) There were many errors in grading. (5) They were often late. The principal also stated: Sha and Li's claim that their dismissal was due to their request for the school's finances to be made public was completely untrue, because teachers' salaries accounted for more than 73% of tuition fees, which exceeded the Education Bureau's regulations of 70%.

Furthermore: The Primary School Teachers' Joint Training Association had conducted mediation for this purpose and proposed a solution, which was not accepted by the principal. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., more than 10 representatives were sent to the Municipal Education Bureau to express their opinions, hoping for impartial handling. The Education Bureau's National Education Division Chief Zhu agreed to make a fair and reasonable solution within days.

### Coordinating with the Implementation of the Constitution, Promoting National Education: Ministry of Education Sets Twenty-Three Research Topics

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] To promote national education and coordinate with the implementation of the Constitution, the Ministry of Education has set twenty-three research questions related to national education, including cultural education issues in the Constitution's basic national policies, how to improve national education, and research questions on improving local education administration. All provincial and municipal education bureaus have been ordered to promptly solicit opinions from their education administrative personnel, compile and organize them, and formulate answers to be submitted to the Ministry by March 20 of this year for selection and implementation. The research questions are listed below:

Universal Enrollment of Children: Planning for Additional Grades and Schools

(A) Research questions related to the articles on national education in Chapter 13, the Basic National Policy Education and Culture Section, of the Constitution: (1) According to the provision that "all citizens shall have equal opportunity to receive education," all citizens, regardless of gender, residence, or family economic status, should have the opportunity to receive basic education. To realize this provision, plans should be made based on the existing schools, grades, the number of children in school, and the number of children not in school, to universally establish schools, add grades, or promote a tutor system, etc., to educate children who are not in school. A compulsory education system should also be implemented, along with free tuition and the provision of books for poor children. Each province, city, and county should plan based on its actual situation, how to establish schools and add grades on a yearly basis, how to raise funds, what difficulties exist, and how to solve them? (2) According to the provision that "children of school age from six to twelve years old shall uniformly receive basic education," all children should receive six years of education in principle. That is, all current national schools should be changed to a six-year system, similar to central national schools, and central national schools should be further strengthened to maintain their leading position. Therefore, teachers and funding must be planned in advance. Each province, city, and county should plan based on its current situation, what number of teachers and how much funding are required, and how to train and raise them on a yearly basis? (3) According to the provision that "children in school shall be exempt from tuition, and poor children shall be provided with books," tuition should be uniformly waived, and additional funding should be raised to purchase books and supply them to poor children.

Establishing More Scholarships, Subsidizing Education in Border Areas

(4) According to the provision that "governments at all levels shall establish more scholarships to support students with excellent academic performance who are unable to continue their education," 15% of elementary school graduates with excellent academic performance should receive scholarships to continue their education. These scholarships should be borne by the county and city governments. How should each county and city strictly select students who should receive scholarships, and what regulations should be stipulated to raise funds? (5) According to the provision that "education and cultural expenses in remote and impoverished areas shall be subsidized by the national treasury," what is the current state of national education development in each remote and impoverished province and region, what are the plans, and how much annual subsidy is needed from the national treasury? (6) According to the provision that "the funding for education, science, and culture shall not be less than 15% of the total budget at the central level, not less than 25% at the provincial level, and not less than 35% at the county level," what percentage of the provincial education funding should be allocated to national education? How should each province effectively promote city and county education funding to reach at least 35%, and how should those that have already reached this minimum proportion increase it on a yearly basis? Also, if the education funding of each county reaches the minimum quota, is it sufficient? (7) According to the provision that "education and cultural foundations and industries established according to law shall be protected," how should specific measures be stipulated to protect existing national school foundations and local education industries? (8) According to the provision that "the state shall guarantee the livelihood of those engaged in education, science, and art, and increase their remuneration from time to time in accordance with the progress of the national economy," how should the livelihood of national school teachers in each province, city, and county be stabilized and guaranteed, and how should their remuneration be increased? What specific measures need to be stipulated to guarantee their livelihood and increase their remuneration, and how should funding be raised? (9) According to the provisions of Article 167 of the Constitution, how should specific measures be stipulated regarding national education to reward elementary school teachers (including overseas Chinese elementary school teachers) who have been in their positions for a long time and have achieved excellent results, and how should specific measures be stipulated to reward private elementary schools?

Supervising Teacher Training, Enriching National Education Facilities

(B) Research questions on improving national education: (1) What specific measures can be used to ensure that all national schools can repair school buildings and enrich their facilities? (2) What specific and effective measures can be used to supervise teachers' further studies, enhance their interest in teaching, and improve their teaching and training methods? (3) What important principles should be paid attention to in the revision of elementary school curriculum standards, the compilation of textbooks, and teaching materials in order to meet the needs of the constitutional implementation period and improve them? (4) What are the shortcomings of the current nationally designated textbooks, and how should they be specifically and effectively improved? (5) Which is more appropriate for elementary school textbooks, a national system or a review system, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each? (6) How should the experimental work of national education be promoted? (7) How to strengthen the guidance and research organizations of national education and exert their power? (8) From the perspective of each locality, what needs to be done by the Ministry of Education and what needs to be done by the provincial and municipal departments and bureaus regarding the work of improving national education?

Promoting Zonal Supervision, Enhancing Political-Educational Liaison

(C) Research questions on improving local education administration: (1) What are the drawbacks of changing county education bureaus to sections? (2) How should the organization and powers of county (city) education bureaus be stipulated? (3) What grassroots organizations should exist below the county education bureau (such as district, township, town, bao, etc.) to make them rigorous and dynamic? (4) How to establish parent guidance and how to promote the zonal supervision system? (5) How to enhance the liaison between political and educational circles? (6) How should the county education association cooperate and liaise with the county education bureau?

### The Municipal Bureau of Education Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Bidding for Desks and Chairs

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education held a discussion meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss the bidding for desks and chairs. Attendees included Li Ximou, Zhou Feicheng, Lin Jianxiang, Zhu Xiying, Huang Zhicheng, Lu Guanliu, Huang Xincun, Su Wanfu, Ge Chengxun, Wang Qichang, Hu Huaitian, etc. Chairman Li Ximou reported the purpose of the meeting and expressed his opinions, stating that Wang Qichang and others had accused the bureau of fraud in the current bidding for the manufacture of desks and chairs to the Municipal Council, and published it in the newspapers. For the sake of prudence, the bureau is asking each representative to express their opinions on whether to re-tender or to proceed with the original plan. However, if the original plan is still followed, whether it violates legal procedures, please representatives carefully consider and express their opinions, and then begin the discussion. The representatives successively expressed their opinions as follows: Zhou Feicheng asked the audit office when opening the bid, whether the lowest price can be considered unqualified, and the second bid can be selected; Lin Jianxiang said that the lowest bid is best selected when opening the bid, but when the lowest bid is considered unqualified, the second bid can be selected, and can be manufactured according to the price of the second bid. Zhu Xiying's opinion is the same as that of Representative Lin, and believes that the opening of the bid is legal. Su Wanfu and others believe that the equipment of Yang Heji's workshop with the lowest bid is too simple, and they are deeply afraid that they will not be able to deliver the goods on time. Judging from the historical credit, it is reliable for Zhuochunji to manufacture it. It was resolved that: (1) It was decided to proceed with the original plan and hand it over to Zhuochunji School Furniture to manufacture it, and no re-bidding will be held; (2) Wang Qichang and others should be asked to state the reasons for the accusation. Then Wang Qichang stated, (1) denied accusing the Municipal Council of fraud, and can directly investigate with the Municipal Council, (2) had prepared a document to the Municipal Council to report the course of opening the bid, because Zhuochunji obstructed it at the time of opening the bid, and Zhuochunji was awarded the bid this time, and it was considered unsatisfactory. After discussion, it was believed that Wang Qichang had denied accusing the Municipal Bureau of Education of fraud, and the Municipal Bureau of Education did not intend to pursue it.

### The Chinese Education Society Recently Organized a Taiwan Provincial Education Delegation; Twelve People Including Chen Heqin Were Elected as Members; Scheduled to Depart in Mid-March for a Month

The delegation is scheduled to depart before mid-March for a month-long inspection.

### Shen Yizhen and Others Proposed to the Municipal Bureau of Education to Strengthen the National Education Demonstration Zone; Four Measures Were Formulated Based on the Experimental Results

Shen Yizhen, director of the Second National Education Demonstration Zone of Shanghai, and Sheng Langxi, deputy director, submitted a report to the Municipal Bureau of Education, proposing four specific measures to strengthen the National Education Demonstration Zone as follows: (1) Increase the authority of the National Education Demonstration Zone Office: The National Education Demonstration Zone Office is an affiliated organization of the Municipal Bureau of Education and has the mission of demonstrating national education in the city. To accomplish this mission, its authority must be increased to facilitate promotion. If it functions in parallel with the Central National School, the promotional power will be weakened invisibly, and how can the work be carried out smoothly? To increase the promotional power, it is possible to stipulate that the "National Education Demonstration Zone Office" has the power to supervise the schools under its jurisdiction and change personnel. It is hoped that through administrative power, the district-school structure can be improved and the demonstration function can be exerted. (2) Clarify the guidance tasks of the Demonstration Zone Office and the Central National School: The focus of the work in the National Education Demonstration Zone is on guidance and research, and its task is to guide the schools under its jurisdiction, which is the same as the Central National School. If the two parties provide guidance in parallel, there will be no specific responsibility, and there will be many conflicts. Those who are being guided will be overwhelmed and exhausted, resulting in futile efforts. To increase the efficiency of guidance, is it possible to stipulate that schools within the district should be directly guided by the office, and schools outside the district should be guided by the Central National School? (3) Improve the qualifications of the principals and teachers of the Central National School and increase their remuneration: The Central National School is a model for national schools throughout the district, and the Central National School in the National Education Demonstration Zone is even more important. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the qualifications of the principals and teachers of the Central National School, otherwise, how can they lead the schools in the district and fulfill their duties of guidance and research? To enrich the content of the Central National School, is it possible to stipulate that the principal of the Central National School must have a qualification from a normal college or a university education department, and the teachers of the Central National School must have graduated from a senior high school normal course or a normal college and have served as elementary school teachers for more than two years with achievements? The base salary should be increased according to their qualifications, equivalent to the treatment of secondary school teachers, in order to attract talents. (4) The regular operating expenses of the National Education Demonstration Zone should be directly distributed by the Education Bureau: The procedures for receiving education funds in the city are very complicated, without a fixed time and time-consuming, and the operating expenses must be collected directly from the city bank by a third party after use, which is especially troublesome, and the impact on the progress of the cause is huge. It is found that the determination of this method may have considerable reasons, but the general method may not be applicable to education. To facilitate the progress of education, the regular operating expenses of the National Education Demonstration Zone can be directly distributed by the Municipal Education Bureau to simplify the procedures for receiving funds and facilitate the progress of the cause. The above four points are the experimental results of the work of the colleagues in the district in the past six months. If they are adopted and implemented, they may be effective in the future. Whether they are appropriate, please review.

### Municipal Middle and Primary Schools Levy Teacher Academic Advancement Fees

[Reported by This Newspaper] This semester, some municipal middle and primary schools have levied teacher academic advancement fees from students, the amount of which is 60,000 yuan for middle schools and 40,000 yuan for primary schools. The Municipal Bureau of Education has agreed to this in principle and has included the entire 7 billion plus advancement fees in this year's budget and submitted it to the upcoming second meeting of the Municipal Council for discussion. If it is passed, all the academic advancement fees already collected by middle and primary schools will be returned to the students, otherwise, it seems that they should still be collected.

### Central Library Rare Books

One Hundred and Seven Boxes Shipped to Shanghai from Japan

[Reported by This Newspaper] One hundred and seven boxes of rare books from the National Central Library that were looted by Japan before the war have recently been recovered through negotiations by the delegation stationed in Japan with General MacArthur's headquarters.

### Principals' Meeting to be Held Regularly in the Seventeenth District National School

### Hengyisheng Protest Case

The Adjudication Committee Judged

The Original Result of the Match Stands

The Adjudication Committee of the Football Committee held its second meeting yesterday to hear the case of Hengyisheng's protest against the Football Committee's judgment on the Hengyisheng vs. Jingwu match on January 19. The discussion and resolution are as follows:

Hengyisheng Team protested against the Football Committee's judgment that "when Hengyisheng played against Jingwu on January 19, Hengyisheng players did not submit photos, and players registered in two teams participated in the match, violating the association rules. The team was penalized for abandoning the game, and Jingwu won 1-0." After reviewing the facts, (1) it was proved that the team had verbally notified the registration that the photos of the players of the previous Piye team should be changed and posted on the registration form. Because the registrar failed to do so, it was discovered in the fifth game that four players registered without photos had been registered. The negligence of the office caused this misunderstanding and should be forgiven. (2) Hengyisheng Team should be responsible for improper management for players registered in two teams participating in the competition. Based on the above reasons, the judgment of the case is as follows: (1) Maintain the original result of the game (1-1). Hengyisheng Football Team was penalized for improper management and given a warning. (2) The Football Committee should notify all Group B and C members that the team manager should be responsible for the photos of the players registered in the future. If it is found that the players have no photos during the verification, the players without photos will be penalized as unregistered.

### Hong Kong Soccer News - Special Silver Shield Replay - Star Island Draws With British Army - The Best Game of the Season

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] This year's Special Silver Shield competition is being held separately for Division A and Division B. After several weeks of fierce elimination matches, the situation is becoming clear.

This year, the strength of foreign teams in Hong Kong is not strong. In Division A, only Golden Crown and 4/5 Battalion have made it to the semi-finals. In Division B, only Navy B has qualified for the semi-finals. Chinese teams Star Island A and B, and South China A and B are also on the list of contenders. Guanghua Association also defeated Navy A to participate in the semi-finals.

According to schedule - Saturday (February 22nd)

Star Island B vs. Navy B; 2:15 PM - South China Stadium

Star Island A vs. 4/5 Battalion; 4:00 PM - South China Stadium

Weekend (February 23rd)

South China B vs. Police; 2:15 PM - Hong Kong Club Stadium

South China A vs. Guanghua; 4:00 PM - Hong Kong Club Stadium

Division B Takes the Stage, No Winner Emerges

Today (Saturday), the Star Island brothers first took the stage at the South China Stadium to face the foreign soldiers. Before 2:00 PM,嘉山道 was crowded with people eager to watch the two Chinese-foreign dramas.

At 2:15 PM, Division B took the stage first. Star Island B faced Navy B. The former is the invincible champion of the league, and the latter is also a strong team in Division B. This meeting is an elimination match, and both sides want to win the final.

After 90 minutes of intense battle, Star Island B won the first half with a score of 2-1, but lost the second half with a score of 1-2. As a result, they were forced to a 3-3 draw by the foreign sailors. After extra time, neither side scored, so they had to schedule another decisive battle. The whole match was tightly contested and no less exciting than any Division A match. It was truly a good game.

Injured Divine Leg Affects Forward

After the Division B match, Division A took the stage. The Golden Army 4/5 Battalion, about to be discharged and return home, really wanted to defeat Star Island for honor before leaving. Therefore, before the war, they worked hard for three weeks. The game was well-organized, making it difficult for Star Island to cope. The entire team performed above its usual standard, and the draw with Star Island was not a fluke.

On the other hand, Star Island, since the injury of the team's soul "Divine Leg" Feng Jingxiang, the forward advancement is not as flexible as before. In today's battle, the defense has done its best to ensure that they did not lose. There is nothing to say, only the performance of the forward line was not ideal, and they could not win.

This match was also played in extra time. The entire match lasted 110 minutes and was full of excitement. It was the best game of the season.

The battle began with the referee Deng Shitu's silver whistle. The two sides lined up as follows:

(Star Island Club)

Yu Yaode Tan Jiangbai Hou Rongsheng Feng Kunsheng Xu Jingcheng Wu Qixiang Cao Qiuting Li Zhaorong Zhang Jinhai Liu Songsheng He Yingfen

(4/5 Battalion)

Taylor

Dia Li G辰 Bun Li Zhi Patton Kan Bu Lu

Wooding Lianlushi Gao Luotuo De Ge Nilu

Upon contact, Star Island launched a lightning attack, but to no avail. The two sides fought in a mixed battle for 20 minutes with mutual attacks and defenses. At 23 minutes, Yingfen finally got the ball and advanced quickly from the right. Seeing a cross, the two gold soldiers mistakenly thought that no one was rushing the goal. Unaware, Zhaorong flashed in and kicked the ball, but unfortunately, the kick was weak.

Then, Jinhai got a wonderful ball from the midfield and dribbled straight in. Although the enemy defense was chasing desperately behind, "Sanlang" stepped on the ball in front of the goal and turned around and put the ball into the net. "Wonderful!" 1-0, Star Island took the lead. The first half ended with this goal deciding the winner.

After a short break, the teams changed sides and continued the battle. The 4/5 Battalion launched a full-scale attack. In less than two minutes, Qixiang was penalized for a foul in the penalty area. Dia took the penalty kick. Although Yaode blocked it, Dia was also alert and rushed forward to add another kick. Yaode could not recover to save it. 1-1, the first tie.

Zhaorong Leads Again with One Kick

The center line was reopened. In the blink of an eye, the three Star Island forwards had already reached the foreign soldiers' goal. Songsheng forced past Dia and shot. Taylor blocked it, but Zhaorong happened to arrive and added another kick. 2-1, taking the lead again.

After that, the two sides engaged in a bitter battle. The foreign soldiers launched a full-scale counterattack. It is estimated that there were also three shots that hit the post. When it came to 42 minutes, seeing that time was running out, the foreign soldiers, in the siege, saw Li G辰 get the ball outside the 25-yard line and make a cold shot. The ball was low and urgent, and Jide could not save it. 2-2, another tie.

The Gloom of Dusk Shakes Hands and Makes Peace

In extra time, both sides did not show any signs of fatigue and continued to attack desperately. Star Island had two shots near the goal that went high. The most dangerous one was in the last second, when Dia's shot hit the post and bounced out. Star Island narrowly escaped defeat.

In the end, neither side achieved anything. In the gloom of dusk, they shook hands and made peace. This means that who gets the final will have to be decided in another battle.

Football Association Advances Replay

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] Last Saturday - the 22nd, the Special Silver Shield semi-final, Star Island A and B were both forced to draws. The Football Association here held a competition committee meeting the day before - the 23rd. Chairman Huang Jiajun, Li Huitang, Shi Kinna, Luo Zha Shi, Ye Jiugao, etc. were present. It was decided to advance the unfinished games:

Star Island A vs. 4/5 Battalion - Wednesday (26th) at 4:00 PM

Star Island B vs. Navy B - Thursday (27th) at 4:00 PM

This arrangement is entirely for the sake of the 4/5 Battalion, because the 4/5 Battalion is about to return home, so no effort is spared to advance the games.

Currently, the Star Island A and B teams had players injured in the previous week's game. They cannot mix the teams to play. They have sent a letter to the Football Association requesting a postponement.

Also, if they fight 4/5 Battalion on the 26th, and prepare for South China on March 1st - to win the league championship, they will have to cope with three important games in one week, which is really impossible to cope with. Therefore, if the Football Association does not postpone the games, it is impossible to determine how many players can be sent to play at that time. This matter remains to be resolved.

### Spokesperson for the Import Control Committee Talks About the Basis for Quota Allocation - Taking into Account Domestic Production and Foreign Exchange Resources

[Report] A spokesperson for the Import Control Committee, in response to external criticism of the committee's allocation of quotas for various imported goods, made the following statement yesterday. He said: "The committee's allocation of various quotas is based primarily on the domestic needs. If the imported item is indeed needed, then we will investigate whether there are similar substitutes domestically. If there are, we will make every effort to use domestic substitutes. If not, we will consider allowing imports. Again, we must consider the foreign exchange resources of the country to the extent possible. If it cannot be avoided, then we must also distinguish the urgency of the nature of the goods before approving foreign exchange. The quotas for the 22 types of imported goods announced not long ago for the period from February to April of this year were mostly determined based on the average import value of each item during the three years before the war. The figures come mostly from accurate statistics from the Customs over the years and are by no means fabricated out of thin air. External parties may consider the quotas for certain imported goods to be too generous. For example, for tobacco, it is believed that it can be reduced by half, or that domestic production is sufficient for consumption. It has been found that these 指　lack factual evidence. As for pharmaceuticals, cement, sugar, and automobiles, the import quotas have been temporarily suspended from February to April of this year. This is because the item either has sufficient inventory or has a substitute available. There should be no supply difficulties within three months, so imports are temporarily suspended."

### Fourth Meeting of the Export Promotion Council - Decision to Establish a Bristle Pig Group - Exported Goods from Wuzhou Should Have Remittance Certificates Audited

[Report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Council held its fourth meeting at the Central Bank at 10:00 AM yesterday. All committee members were present except for Jin Xizhi, who went to Beijing on official business. The meeting was chaired by Bei Zuyi. The important decisions are as follows: (1) To establish a bristle pig group, the list of candidates is as follows: Shen Xirui (convener), Gong Shanbai, Wang Yangxian, Lu Shengtian, Xin Li, Zeng Zehan, An Zijie (also secretary). (2) To determine the remittance export method for goods exported from Wuzhou. This matter has been approved by the Executive Committee and approved by the Executive Yuan. The designated banks managing foreign exchange and the Wuzhou Customs will be notified immediately that all kinds of goods exported through Wuzhou that should be remitted (especially tung oil) will be subject to strict review and must have a certificate of purchase of foreign exchange issued by the designated bank before they can be declared for export.

### Government Agencies Purchasing Foreign Goods - Should Apply for Permits First - No Post-hoc Procedures Allowed

The Executive Yuan has announced and implemented the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. Subsequently, all government agencies that import materials and equipment from abroad must apply for permits in accordance with the provisions of these measures before ordering. No post-purchase procedures are allowed. The relevant agencies have been ordered to comply. It is reported that the municipal government has received this instruction and has ordered the import and export industry associations to comply.

### Unified Bonds Continue to Fall

Government bonds were still sluggish yesterday. Unified C opened at 6900 yuan in the morning. Although 550, 544 were accepted, 360, 552 were sold. The price fell from 7000 yuan to 5750 yuan, and finally hovered outside the 6000 yuan mark. As a result, compared with the previous settlement, A, B, and E each fell by 500 yuan, D fell by 300 yuan, and Unified C fell by 700 yuan. The turnover was more than 4 million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Rise and Fall

Foreign stocks were extremely peaceful yesterday, with stocks rising and falling differently. The process was vague. As a result, compared with the previous settlement, Chartered Yarn English United rose slightly. Shipping Wheelock was flat. The rest fell by up to half a percent.

### Foreign Tea Market Stable and Strong

In the Shanghai Eastern Foreign Market, the most easily sold and stable prices were the Chun Zhen and Zhen Mei teas. The Keemun black tea, which had been stuck for many days, was traded weakly due to a lack of supply and demand. However, it is heard that the British firm Renji Foreign Firm still has 38 boxes of Chen Zhong Keemun from 1934, and is actively negotiating with the cargo owner. The price is also approaching, and there is hope that a transaction will be obtained soon. The jasmine double that is frequently favored by the Suzhou帮 is difficult to see active because the seller's asking price is firm and not loose.

### After Exchange Rate Adjustment - Barter Trade with Japan is Favorable

[Report] According to sources concerned: the competent authority hopes that the total value of barter trade between China and Japan this year can reach 60 million US dollars. There are nearly 30 kinds of goods that China needs from Japan; Japan hopes that China will supply them with similar things. Compared with Japan's barter trade with other countries, the United States is the highest, followed by the United Kingdom. China ranks after the United Kingdom because it cannot export the food that Japan desires most. After the recent exchange rate adjustment, the barter trade is quite favorable. Regarding the supply of Japanese kiln wood, China hopes to have at least 7-8 million pieces, but Japan only allows the supply of 4 million pieces. It is heard that China has recently made new proposals on this matter. As for Japan's request that China supply soybeans, it is heard that the economic authorities believe that soybeans are an important export commodity in China, just like Japan's cotton textiles. They must be used to exchange for foreign exchange and cannot be included in the scope of barter trade.

[Report] The third Tea Evaluation Committee for Export Tea met yesterday and decided on the standard tea samples and the giving points. The committee has now limited tea merchants to submit export tea samples to the Central Bank before next Monday so that they can be collected and scored to determine prices. According to relevant personnel, the evaluation work during the Trust Week is entirely to serve the Central Bank and tea merchants technically. In the past, when tea merchants requested the government to purchase their tea, the Central Bank would lose a lot of money. Now that the exchange rate has been adjusted, there is no need to worry about this. The current world tea market is unfavorable to us. Japanese tea and British tea are competing with us at low prices. Therefore, if the export tea is priced too high, it will put Chinese tea at a disadvantage.

Yesterday, the yarn market was still hovering in a sluggish state. Customer sales were like a stone sinking into the sea, and there was no movement. The Textile Building Company again had a large batch of private yarn supplied at market prices, making it even more difficult for people's hearts to improve. 20-count yarn fell another 3-50,000, and 42-count fell 100,000 to 150,000 yuan.

Also, it is reported that China Textile Building Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee as usual yesterday, selling a total of 463 pieces, including 245 pieces to manufacturers and 218 pieces to yarn numbers.

### Salt 引岸 System Abolished

My international political and business management has always adopted the 引岸 system in the past. The main feature of this system is to make the sales have a certain regional limitation. Within its defined area, a certain sales salt merchant has its own rights and responsibilities to suppress the salt shortage. Going beyond the boundary is private and punished according to苛, and after the number of outbreaks, the salt merchants相逃亡 everywhere, this system was invisibly destroyed by the artillery fire, and the salt administration authorities, when promulgating and implementing the salt monopoly system, also明令explicitly abolished the 引岸system, but the time has been long, been ignored, or played to life for a long time, and the monopoly method has been changed, so recently the Legislative Yuan formally passed it, abolishing the 引岸system, in order to restate the previous order, to promote the development of the free trade system of table salt Yun.

The oil market was tight in the morning and slack in the afternoon, with few honor and dishonor. Soybean cake's actual sales were still light, and it fell frequently, falling another thousand yuan.

Miscellaneous grains unanimously相 　fell, red grain transactions were Qing Yuan懈and continued to fall by a thousand yuan. Corn alcohol moved slightly, and prices were sluggish. Raw peanuts turned sluggish in Nanyang, stopped rising and turned to falling, and returned to a small five to six thousand yuan. Yuan beans were flat, sesame was similar. Soybean outbound sales were not moving, and rumors that the China Trust Bureau would allocate soybeans again made people's hearts weak and soft, and prices fell by two to three thousand yuan.

### Allocation Price for Oil Retail - Still Under Negotiation

[Report] The Shanghai Edible Oil Allocation Office yesterday allocated 897 dan of edible oil to various edible oil retail stores in the Pudong district. Today, it will allocate to the city center area. The allocation price is 250,000 yuan per dan. As for the retail price at the retail stores, it is still necessary to negotiate with the municipal authorities on whether to exempt business tax before making a decision.

### Casing New Price Announced

[Report] The opening price of pig intestines is too high. If they are purchased and exported, the price is similar to the overseas market price, so the buying interest is dull and there are no transactions. The new opening price of casings today is 6 million yuan per barrel (1250 pairs), which is also similar to the overseas market price.

### Foreign Prices for Lace and Embroidery Both Fall

[Report] According to a merchant from a certain Swiss firm in the city, after the foreign exchange rate increased, foreign prices for lace, blankets, embroidery, foreign pillows, buttons, straw hats, etc. have fallen by 20% to 40%. Shanghai market prices have risen sharply and have exceeded the latest foreign market prices, so exports are encountering difficulties.

### Automobile Insurance Premiums to Double Starting Next Month

The automobile insurance industry in this city, in view of the recent surge in the cost of automobile materials and the increased amount of insurance compensation expenses, convened an extraordinary meeting yesterday to discuss adjusting insurance rates. A resolution was passed by all members to raise the lower limit of insurance coverage from 75,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan starting next month, effectively doubling the insurance rates.

### Iron Prices Plunge by 20%

[Report from this Newspaper] The current market price of pig iron is 4.5 million yuan per ton. Due to a significant influx from the mainland, the market is soft and demand is weak, with prices having fallen by 20% from their peak. The prices of wrought iron, sheet iron, and angle iron have also fallen by 10% to 20%.

### Caustic Soda Market Price Drops

[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, a large quantity of caustic soda has been shipped from Guangzhou. A portion of it is from orders arriving at the port, with a continuous stream of deliveries that will not cease for some time. Actual sales in the Shanghai market have weakened. Additionally, locally produced liquid caustic soda, which has no difference in usage, is priced 30% lower than solid caustic soda, leading to widespread adoption of the liquid variety. The market price for caustic soda from the inland areas was 4.5 million yuan per barrel yesterday, while American goods were priced at 4.3 million yuan, with few transactions taking place.

### Allocation of Goods Intermittent, Rayon Continues to Soar, Silk Exports Active but Prices Unlikely to Improve

Rayon prices continued to soar yesterday due to intermittent allocation of goods and strong demand from actual sales customers. For example, No. 120 Kosan Yuko rayon opened at 7.8 million yuan in the morning and immediately saw transactions, later fluctuating upwards to close at 8.1 million yuan. The afternoon was even better, with transactions at 8.3 million yuan, and the final asking price remaining at 8.33 million yuan. No. 75 semi-gloss rayon was bid up to 11.5 million yuan. The scarcity of goods made them valuable, a shocking state of affairs. Yesterday, the factory market remained quiet. Foreign firms with "C" grade had some transactions at 8.15 million yuan, slightly higher than the previous day's asking price. Otherwise, only a few transactions were made by other sellers at prices similar to the previous day. Due to sluggish actual sales, silk fabrics were unable to rise in price. Real silk fabrics were weak, while rayon fabrics, despite the high cost of raw materials, lacked interest and therefore remained unchanged.

Further, in recent days, British and Indian trading firms have shown considerable interest in the raw silk market. However, due to falling raw silk prices in the U.S. market, with grade A priced at $5.50 per pound, asking prices are unlikely to improve. Swedish firm Lianna sold 30 bales of Grade D 20-fen 20-strand raw silk at 7.8 million yuan per bale. Dachang sold 10 bales of Grade C 20-fen 22-strand raw silk at 8 million yuan per bale. Jardine sold 40 bales of Grade D 20-fen 22-strand raw silk at 7.85 million yuan per bale. According to those in the industry, while exports are active, prices are unlikely to improve.

### The Starving World: A Perspective on the International Food Situation

—Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper (Continued)

Although food production in 1946 increased compared to the previous year, global food anxiety has not diminished. Official estimates indicate that for the year from July 1, 1946, to June 30, 1947, total food production increased by 7% compared to the previous year, perhaps reaching the average production level before the war. However, since 1939, the world's population has increased by 7%, meaning that even reaching pre-war production levels is not enough. Calculated by population proportion, the winter food supply in 1946 was approximately 5% less than before the war.

The production of the five grains most needed by famine-stricken countries has not been abundant enough for Europe to end bread rationing. European countries could lift controls on bread consumption if they could import 35 million tons of wheat and other grains. However, based on current supply projections, the likely import volume will not exceed 25 million tons, of which 10 million tons must be supplied by the United States. Given the shortage of railway vehicles and labor strikes in the United States, it seems unlikely that the United States can export the above-mentioned amount.

The supply of fats and oils is far less than the global demand. It is estimated that production is approximately 85% of pre-war levels, but the international trade in fats and oils may not exceed half of pre-war levels. How will countries allocate these significantly reduced fats and oils?

The distribution of these greatly reduced fats and oils will largely depend on the policies adopted by the United States. If the United States lifts import controls, American consumers may find it easier to obtain margarine and soap, but the consumption of some other countries will be 70% less than before 1939, and even fall to one-third in poorer countries.

Although world sugar production has increased by 10%, it still falls short of demand.

Current food consumption in the Americas is 15% higher than before the war, while consumption in vast regions of Asia and Europe is far less than before the war. The difference between the two is like heaven and earth. Severe food shortages are expected in Germany, Austria, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia.

The waves of famine will continue to plague most of the world, and the severity will depend on the United States' policy on export controls.

A comparison of world food production now and in the past is as follows:

### Traces of the Communist Army's Movements in Shandong

—Jinan, 19th (Airmail Report) Special Correspondent Li Tian from This Newspaper

In total, Shandong has experienced twelve years under the successive rule of "Dog Meat General" Zhang Zongchang and "Clear Skies" Han Fuju. This kind of warlord rule, which disregarded right and wrong, confused black and white, imposed harsh taxes and levies, and treated human life like weeds, objectively paved the way for the Communist Party's intrusion. Subsequently, during the eight years of war against the enemy, Shandong was the first to bear the brunt. By the end of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the main lines of communication were entirely in the hands of the enemy forces. Under the Communist Party's basic policy of "70% development, 20% coping, and 10% resisting Japan," their strength in Shandong rapidly developed and grew—growing into the second-largest Communist base in the country, second only to Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and higher than the Northeast.

### Seven Men from Mount Culai, Starting with Six Pens

As early as during Han Fuju's rule of Shandong, the current chairman of the Communist Party of Shandong Province, Li Yu (from Shanxi), served as the secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party, working undercover in Jinan. In July of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), when the enemy forces captured Dezhou, Han Fuju fled westward, and Li Yu also moved his organization to Changqing. On December 24th of the same year, Jinan fell, and Li Yu moved to Shanyang Village at the foot of Mount Culai in Tai'an County, drafting the Shandong military plan. After the enemy's main forces moved south, they moved to Shanyang Village at the foot of Mount Culai in Tai'an. On the third day of the first month of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Li Yu and his key figures Lin Hao (from Laiyang), Hong Tao (from Fengren, Jiangxi), Sun Taolin (from Xuzhou), Ma Futang (from Zhucheng), Cheng Zhaoxuan (from Shanyang Village), and Zhu Yugan (from Wangzhuang Village north of Mount Culai), a total of seven people, met in the Great Buddha Hall on the mountain. They formally adopted the Shandong military plan drafted earlier and decided to make full use of civilian firearms, assigning cadres to form six even-numbered detachments in different areas of the province. At that time, the seven of them had six Parker pens and boasted of "starting with seven men and six pens," which is the "Culai Mountain Seven Men Uprising" repeatedly praised by the Communist Party today.

Because Li Yu and others fully grasped and utilized the patriotic sentiments of exiled students from Beiping, Tianjin, and various parts of Shandong, arranging them in the six detachments and making them their most outstanding core cadres, and because of the announcement of cooperation against Japan by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the early stage of the war, the former chairman of Shandong Province, Shen Honglie, and his subordinates believed that since the government had announced cooperation, they should treat the Communists with courtesy. Therefore, Shen had appointed several Communist figures as county magistrates. Moreover, most of Shandong Province was occupied at that time, and the judgment of the overall situation was unclear. Even those who had always been dissatisfied with the Communist Party at least adopted a policy of non-offense towards the Communist Party. Coupled with the protection and mutual exploitation of Shi Yousan, commander of the Tenth Army Corps, the Lu Communists expanded from six detachments to nine detachments in the year and a half from the spring of the 27th year to the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1938-1939), and the number of people also expanded from seven to more than 30,000.

Xu Xiangqian Changes His Style

Xu Xiangqian, the valiant general of the Eighth Route Army's 115th Division, first entered western Shandong and then moved to southern Shandong in March of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Before Xu Xiangqian entered Shandong, the Communist army at that time, whether towards the people or the National Army, at least on the surface, still acted according to reasonable and legal guidelines. The relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to a greater or lesser extent, still maintained peace and cooperation. After Xu Xiangqian entered Shandong and Yan'an ordered him to command the entire Shandong military, he changed his previous style and adopted a policy of terror. As long as it could implement his basic policy of "70% development, 20% coping, and 10% resisting Japan," it was permissible to divide and attack the National Army, to use severe punishments and cruel laws against the people to drive them, and to collude with the enemy as long as their interests did not conflict. As a result, the people were coerced into joining the Communist Party and the Communist army, which increased sharply. Attacks and seizures of equipment from the National Army, especially the local teams and guerrilla detachments under the provincial government, were frequently heard of. At the end of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), Yu Xuezhong was ordered to come to Shandong to establish the Headquarters of the Jiangsu-Shandong War Zone. Due to the discord between Yu and Shen, it objectively created many opportunities for the Communist Party to expand its strength. At that time, the guerrilla teams under Chairman Shen's command were mostly reorganized from civilian armed forces, their strength was weak, and their forces were scattered, making them the most ideal target for the Communist Party to expand its strength. After each ambush on the guerrilla teams Shen could only beg for help from Yu's regular 51st and 57th armies, and Yu's troops had a ‘not my business’ attitude and would not provide appropriate assistance, so from winter of the 28th to the winter of the 30th year of the Republic (1939-1941), the Communist army almost completely wiped out the local troops and the main force of guerrilla teams under the jurisdiction of the Shandong provincial government's administrative offices and county governments by both hard and soft tactics. Subsequently, in the 31st year of the Republic (1942), during the enemy's large-scale mopping-up operation, the Yishui "Encirclement" headquarters base was also forced to abandon. Shen went to the Central Government to report on his work and was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The Central Government appointed Mu Zhongheng, commander of the 51st Army under Yu, as chairman of Shandong, uniting military and political power. However, they could not withstand the repeated mopping-up operations by the enemy and puppet forces, the multiple attacks by the Communist army. In addition, in the autumn of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Wan, brigade commander of Yu's 57th Army, defected to the Eighth Route Army, and in the beginning of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), Wu Huawen, commander of the New Fourth Army, surrendered to the enemy and puppet forces, Shandong's situation became increasingly precarious. Therefore, by the summer of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the headquarters and the provincial government had to withdraw to Fuyang in northern Anhui. Until June of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), when the former chairman He Siyuan disguised himself and entered Shandong alone, the entire Shandong had been occupied and controlled by the enemy and puppet forces and the Communist army.

A Cancer Grows From This

Before the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist army first used various methods to occupy 23 county towns including Yishui, Mengyin, and Feixian. After Japan surrendered, the Communist army took advantage of the fact that the National Army's takeover arrangements were not yet finalized. First, they reorganized the original Shandong troops, except for the six divisions of the New Fourth Army (the New Fourth Army had a total of seven divisions, of which the Fifth Division was in northern Jiangsu at that time, and Xu Xiangqian's troops had been transferred to the Northeast). With the nine detachments and the best elements of the militia in each county as the backbone, by the end of January of this year, they had successively expanded into eleven liberation divisions, seven new divisions, seven columns, ten garrison brigades, and four independent regiments, totaling 429,400 people. (Before the victory of the War of Resistance, Xu's troops were transferred elsewhere, and the Shandong military was then commanded by Chen Yi, which will be detailed later.) At the same time, from August 11th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) to the ceasefire order on January 13th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), they captured 66 counties and cities including Pingdu, Muping, Yantai, Hecheng, and Haiwei from the National Army, attacked the National Army 2,194 times, killing one division commander, two brigade commanders, four commissioners, seventeen county magistrates, and more than 50,000 officers and soldiers of middle and lower ranks. They also captured six counties, including Laiwu in eastern Shaanxi Province, from the enemy and puppet forces, incorporating more than 5,000 Japanese soldiers and more than 50,000 puppet troops under Zhang Xixian and Han Shuchen. After the announcement of the ceasefire order on January 13th until April 21st, the Communist army again captured the county town of Liuchuan and 19 railway stations including Hongshan, as well as two coal mines. From June 8th to 17th, they launched a major offensive and captured five counties and four towns including Jiaoxian, Dexian, Tai'an, Gaomi, Jimo, Chengyang, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and Zaozhuang. The ceasefire order became a unilateral obligation of the government. Although the government submitted a memorandum to the Beiping Military Mediation Department on June 19th, the Communist army continued to attack as before. In order to defend itself, the government, around the Double Tenth Festival last year, had the famous anti-Japanese general Wang Yaowu clear the Jiaoji Railway line. From the end of last year to recently, in order to crush its plan to encircle Xuzhou, a major battle was launched in southern Shandong. The Communist army suffered more than one-third casualties. Although its strength has gradually weakened, the deeply rooted momentum it has cultivated in Shandong over the past nine and a half years, which is enough to start a prairie fire, has not diminished in the slightest. Of the 107 counties, three ordinary cities, and one special municipality in Shandong, only 34 counties, one ordinary city (Jinan), and one special municipality (Qingdao) are still in the hands of the National Army. Considering that the Communist army has been continuously reinforced from the Northeast and Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi, it can be seen that it will spare no expense to defend the two-thirds of the counties and cities it occupies in Shandong.

### Will There Be Another Famine This Year?

—New York, 14th (Airmail Report) By Xiao Fu

Will the world not experience a severe famine this spring and summer like last year? Many countries still do not have enough food, and there will be famines in some places, but they will not be as severe. This year's food production is expected to be more abundant, and the transportation routes damaged during the war can be gradually restored, so there is hope for a better resolution of the food problem.

The production of wheat, sugar, and potatoes will increase in various parts of the world, and the number of fish caught will also be higher. The production of rice and vegetable oil may also increase, but meat, milk, and lard will remain as scarce as this year.

Reports from wheat-producing areas in various continents indicate that this year's harvest is better than any year during the war, with a production equivalent to 5,900,000,000 bushels. This is the reason for optimism among people who eat bread.

People who eat rice—mostly in Asia—can also expect a better harvest, but it will probably be 10% less than before the war. Asia's population is increasing rapidly, and the harvest may not be enough to avoid famine. Last year's harvest was 6,300,000,000 bushels, and this year it is expected to be 6,900,000,000 bushels, but this is still far from the pre-war 7,400,000,000 bushels. The difficult areas are in Europe and Asia.

Europe

Europe's staple food is flour, and production will be 1,200,000,000 bushels. Last year's production was 1,030,000,000, and the pre-war average production was 1,620,000,000 bushels. Heavy rains in the United Kingdom and Western Europe and droughts in Eastern Europe have all reduced production. In the United Kingdom, there were continuous cloudy and rainy days during the harvest, and several grains sprouted. This type of grain cannot be used for bread and can only be used as feed for livestock.

Eastern Europe and mainland Russia lacked rain, and the rice and wheat harvests were not good. The production of flour, potatoes, and sugar in Central and Eastern Europe does not even slightly exceed 70% of pre-war levels. This is due to the lack of fertilizers and political instability.

The warm Mediterranean region has the prospect of a bumper harvest. Greece, Italy, Spain, and French North Africa all have better harvests this year than last year. The production of rice, wheat, potatoes, sugar, and oil can reach 85% of the pre-war average.

The harvests in western Germany and Austria are the most hopeless. Due to bad weather, political chaos, and a shortage of labor, this year will be as bleak as last year.

Asia

Although Asia's production is high, the population is increasing too quickly, offsetting each other. India's population has increased by 25 million in the past five years.

Siam, Burma, and Annam used to be rice-producing areas, but current production is below pre-war levels. The Japanese invasion caused considerable damage.

India has several difficult days before the harvest in December. During this stage, food will be imported from foreign countries on the one hand, and the amount of allocation will be reduced on the other hand. India relies on the United States, Brazil, and other countries for assistance. However, foreign assistance is limited, and difficult years cannot be avoided.

The Western Hemisphere has a prosperous harvest.

Canada

Canada is expected to harvest 400 million bushels of flour next year, the highest record since 1942, exceeding the pre-war average by 35%. Some food is being shipped to the United Kingdom.

United States

The United States is expected to harvest 1,160,000,000 bushels of flour, an increase of 37,000,000 bushels over last year. The rice harvest may be the same amount. Last year, the United States shipped part of its grain to Europe and Asia to relieve the famine. This year's export volume is 275 million bushels. Because part of the grain needs to be stored, it is reserved for use in years with poor harvests.

The production of oil this year is not good, and some will need to be imported. The current stock is the smallest in 20 years, and the meat production is also less than last year.

The strike by the longshoremen's union in the United States has prevented grain from being exported, causing panic in many countries in the Far East that are waiting for American grain. In addition to this, the transportation difficulties caused by the war are also a problem.

Argentina

Argentina's exports of rice and wheat are lower than pre-war levels, but meat exports are higher than in 1945. The area of cultivated land increased by 10% last year, and the harvest is expected to increase this year.

This year's world food supply is better than last year, and in addition to harvest factor, there are the following reasons:

The distribution system continues to be implemented in many countries. For example, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom still maintain bread rationing.

Some countries in urgent need of food are provided with assistance. This method will continue, and countries in need of financial assistance will also be subsidized.

Although food production is large, there seem to be problems with ships. Without sufficient ships, grain cannot be exported, which is equal to nothing. Therefore, a large part of the existing ships should be reserved for the transportation of grain.

In short, the world can probably avoid a large-scale famine this year. However, it will take a considerable period of time to restore pre-war daily diets. There will be no signs of abundance before 1948.

### Taiwan Forestry Experiment Institute

— Taipei, 7th Dispatch (Airmail) - Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu

The Portuguese used to call Taiwan "Ilha Formosa" (Beautiful Island). Indeed, Taiwan can be divided into tropical and subtropical zones horizontally. Vertically, it has tropical, temperate, and frigid zones due to varying altitudes. Combined with abundant rainfall and ample sunlight, the forests are suitable for growth, with an especially diverse range of species. Forests, occupying about 70% of the province's total area, nearly 38 million mu, perpetually cover this vast island.

Raising Chickens to Eat Eggs - Consumption Exceeds Production

After the Japanese occupied Taiwan, they highly valued forestry. On one hand, industrial development required timber as raw material, fuel, and data. On the other hand, they protected forests to reduce losses from geological erosion and wind and rain disasters. Therefore, they devoted full effort to management, land reclamation, surveys, research, and experiments, achieving some success. According to past statistics, although Taiwan's annual timber consumption always exceeded production, this was precisely the Japanese approach of raising chickens only to eat the eggs. If we arbitrarily cut down forests without protection and management, eating the chicken along with its skin and meat, I believe that one day Taiwan will only have a few frigid-zone forests remaining on the inaccessible mountaintops.

As early as the 44th year of the Meiji era in Japan (the first year of the Xuantong reign in the Qing Dynasty), a forestry research institution was established under the Colonial Production Bureau in Taiwan. Although its name and system have changed repeatedly, it has consistently conducted highly planned experiments for Taiwan's forestry without any difference in intent. In the 28th year of the Republic, this institution was directly under the Governor-General's Office and was called the "Taiwan Governor-General's Office Forestry Experiment Institute." It was divided into sections such as breeding, management, timber, and forest products. All work related to forest research, experiments, surveys, manufacturing, cultivation, utilization, and everything else was fully included. As a reporter, I am very willing to introduce this large-scale research institution to the country.

A Mound of Debris - Extensive Efforts to Organize

The Forestry Experiment Institute is located in the Taipei Botanical Garden. It originally contained more than 1,200 species of plants, encompassing everything, like a global nursery. However, after the war, due to the construction of air-raid shelters on the grounds, holes were everywhere. Some of the planted trees had their trunks and branches broken by air raids, and some were cut down by locals after the victory. Only roots and stems less than three inches high remained on the ground. Upon takeover, it was just a garden of lush weeds. This loss cannot be compensated for in a short period. After gradual organization, the felled trees were simply left to their fate. The remaining six hundred or so plant species had their rotten and withered branches stripped away, and many labels were added, making it seem somewhat lively.

The damage to the buildings was relatively small. More than 2,500 books were received, as well as more than 26,800 specimens, representing more than 6,000 species. Instruments such as microscopes, slicing machines, and testing machines also numbered in the hundreds. The plywood factory and paper-making factory were quite large in scale. Unfortunately, eight electric motors were stolen during the takeover.

Artificial Ivory - Extracting Sugar from Wood

The institute is currently divided into the departments of Forest Breeding, Forest Biology, Forest Chemistry, Forest Management, Forest Utilization, and Wood Science. The Forest Breeding Department originally planned to investigate the germination, flowering, and fruiting times of useful tree species, study the breeding of useful tree species, with a particular focus on variety improvement, research and observe various meteorological conditions related to forest cultivation, and investigate and analyze the physical and chemical properties of forest soil fertility, such as soil temperature, soil permeability, soil moisture and air content, soil chemical composition, etc. There are nineteen research, investigation, and experiment items for various useful trees. However, according to Director Lin Wei-fang, because the agreed-upon personnel have not yet fully arrived and the requisitioned Japanese personnel have been repatriated, it is necessary to adopt partial experiments. They are currently testing the relationship between seedlings and temperature, moisture, soil, and light intensity. The Biology Department was established not long ago, focusing on the organization of the botanical garden, and also conducting a systematic survey of plant classification, ecology, physiology, and distribution. The Management Department originally planned to study tree shape adjustment for afforestation, experiment with thinning afforestation, and conduct other research, investigation, and experiments related to forest protection. Currently, it is focusing on material organization and plan creation. Much of the practical work is carried out by various branch offices. The Chemistry Department specializes in the research, investigation, experiment, analysis, and identification of the utilization and propagation of forest products. Currently, it has already completed research and experiments on tannin for leather dyeing, plywood glue, and casein (an animal-based adhesive, commonly used in plywood for airplanes). The resin extraction section is also conducting experiments. This year's plan includes manufacturing artificial ivory (made by pressing casein into wood under heat and pressure), bakelite, extracting sugar from wood, and manufacturing artificial wool and artificial leather. Director Lin said that there are very few people in the country who study forestry, and even fewer who study forest chemistry. However, they have now hired Xu Kuang-wu, Lu Zhao-yi, and Wang Xiang-ji, three people with very high status in the domestic forest chemistry field, to lead the work in this department, so future developments are very worthwhile to anticipate.

Manufacturing Plywood - Making Paper from Wood Fiber

The Utilization Department originally planned to have several items for the research, investigation, and experiment of wood and bamboo utilization, the identification of wood and bamboo, and the experiment of physical and mechanical properties, etc. Currently, the wood strength section has added an "Amsler" type 30-ton strength testing machine in the strength testing laboratory and borrowed an "Akashi" type 5-ton strength testing machine from the Third Aircraft Factory to carry out various tests on wood's load-bearing strength, compressive strength, tensile strength, shear strength, cutting strength, and hardness, especially focusing on various tests of materials used for airplanes. The wood anatomy section and the wood craftsmanship processing experiment are also in progress. An important task in the modern application of wood is the artificial drying of wood. This is now being tested. The method of wood preservation is very interesting, using various different chemicals, and pressing them into the wood with varying degrees of intensity using immersion or heating methods, and then placing it in a bacterial culture to observe its corrosion and conduct research and experiments. All the equipment for the plywood factory is well equipped.

Group Illegal Logging - Forests Suffer Devastation

The institute currently has four branch offices, namely the Zhongpu Branch Office in Tainan Jiayi, the Hengchun Branch Office in Kaohsiung, the Lotus Pond Branch Office in Taichung, and the Taimali Branch Office in Taitung, and an experimental site in Baxianshan. Almost one is allocated in each latitude, so the research value is very large. The Japanese indeed spent a lot of effort in managing these places in the past. For example, in the Lotus Pond Branch Office, the experimental sites for Taiwania cryptomerioides, Machilus kusanoi, and Chamaecyparis formosensis have been around for more than 30 years. However, after the victory, the local people collectively logged these excellent experimental forests. The Pingpu Branch Office has planted valuable trees such as teak, silver oak, Indian sandalwood, and iron knife wood. After 40 years of experimentation, the growth is very suitable, and the results are good. Unfortunately, after the victory, the excellent experimental trees were also completely cut down. The Indian rubber trees and mango trees in the Jiayi experimental site of the branch office, which were specially used for collecting rubber, were also stolen. Seventy-three teak trees alone were stolen. The Hengchun Branch Office specializes in introducing famous foreign trees from Southeast Asia. There are more than a dozen species, and they grow very well. They are good species for future promotion. However, they are still openly devastated by the locals. When arguing with them, they roll up their sleeves and say: "The Three Principles of the People stipulate government of the people, by the people, for the people, so these forests are ours, and we can cut them however we want." Director Lin said that this is the most heartbreaking thing he has felt since taking over the Forestry Experiment Institute. However, who would not feel heartbroken to see such a good foundation devastated like this?

Past Achievements - Further Promote and Enhance

According to Director Lin, the Japanese showed some achievements in the Forestry Experiment Institute in the past. In addition to the specimens in the botanical garden and herbarium being commendable, in terms of afforestation experiments, the following major achievements can be listed: such as sowing afforestation experiment, forest tree seed experiment, the relationship between container size and the capacity weight and number of seeds, Acacia confusa seed germination promotion experiment, Roystonea regia and Archontophoenix alexandrae seed germination promotion experiment, Toona sinensis seed germination promotion experiment, Catalpa ovata seed storage experiment, Cinchona seed storage experiment, the relationship between the annual accumulation of mother trees of Cunninghamia konishii and Taiwania cryptomerioides and the shape and germination power of seeds, Cunninghamia lanceolata afforestation and its growth survey in northern Taiwan, Rhus succedanea transplantation experiment in eastern Taiwan, rotting heartwood, Sapium sebiferum transplantation experiment, Diospyros kaki cultivation experiment, Tectona grandis seedling method experiment, Casuarina equisetifolia afforestation experiment, Cocos nucifera cultivation experiment, redwood transplantation experiment, Grewia tiliaefolia cutting afforestation experiment in India, Grevillea robusta and Cassia siamea seedling cultivation experiment, Cinchona cultivation experiment, cocoa tree cultivation experiment, rubber tree cultivation experiment. Regarding useful plant experiments, there are more than 20 kinds of transplantation experiments such as Agave sisalana, Chrysanthemum pacificum, Manila hemp, Miscanthus sinensis var. condensatus and Musa textilis from Red Head Island and Ryukyu, and Panama hat grass. With such a good foundation, we hope to further promote and enhance it.

According to Director Cai Meng-jian's report at a work review meeting, the steps for rehabilitation and relief work in Jiangxi are: first, to save lives; second, to solve livelihoods; and third, to solve production. Currently, it has reached the stage of providing relief for livelihoods and production. Following this instruction and four operational principles—1. relief distribution points, 2. relief to individual counties, 3. transportation distribution lines, 4. supervision in divided areas—the main focus of the work is to revive the rural areas of Jiangxi, known as the "Jiangxi Granary," and to increase the production of the abundant but bankrupt areas. Therefore, the rehabilitation work in Jiangxi has now reached the rehabilitation stage.

Reviving the rural areas is the focus of the current stage of Jiangxi's rehabilitation work. In addition to implementing emergency rural relief, such as lending seeds, farm tools, plowing cattle, and repairing farmhouses, to help farmers resume cultivation, the Jiangxi Branch also uses new machinery to promote the reclamation of wasteland, improve production techniques, and increase food production in order to achieve rural revival.

The prevalence of cattle plague is a fatal wound in Jiangxi's rural areas. Each year, approximately 25,000 plowing cattle die from the epidemic in the affected areas. In today's rural areas, where plowing cattle are scarce, how can the dead cattle be replaced? The Jiangxi Branch and the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Institute jointly established a cattle plague prevention team. Since late August of last year, they have been gradually implementing free injections in the areas with the most severe cattle plague epidemics in the province, such as Ji'an, Jishui, Taihe, and Yongxin counties. As of the end of November last year, a total of 27,890 plowing cattle in 83 townships had been injected, benefiting 26,459 farming households.

In order to resettle disaster-stricken farmers, promote the reclamation of cultivated wasteland, experiment with mechanized collective agricultural production, improve production techniques, and revive rural areas, the Jiangxi Branch has selected rural areas that have suffered severe disasters to start establishing large-scale cooperative farms. The Zhanggongdu Cooperative Farm in Yongxiu County has completed preliminary preparation work, planning to reclaim 5,000 to 10,000 mu of cultivated land and recruit 100 to 200垦民. It is expected that after the initial construction phase is completed this year, it will be able to achieve self-sufficiency and self-reliance. The Xiangfuguan Cooperative Farm in Gao'an County is also being planned. It plans to reclaim 2,000 mu of cultivated wasteland in succession and recruit 40 to 50垦民. In addition, the Self-cultivating Farmer Demonstration Zone, sponsored by the Commissioner's Office of the Third Administrative Region of Jiangxi, has also received a subsidy of 10 million yuan and 1,000 bags of flour from the Jiangxi Branch to recruit墾民 and engage in reclamation.

Repairing farmland water conservancy is an urgent task in the post-disaster rural areas. Because the river dikes and embankments in various places were either in disrepair for many years or were dug up and destroyed by enemy troops, Mr. Zhang Guoji undertook the reorganization of farmland water conservancy projects during his tenure. With an expenditure of 100 million yuan, he cooperated with the Yongli Bureau to repair the embankments and culverts in Nanchang, Xinjian, and Yongxiu counties, completing 63 breaches, 189 dangerous sections, and 100 culverts, benefiting a total of 765,520 mu of farmland. In May, the Jiangxi Branch cooperated with the Jiangxi District of the Yangtze River Yongli Committee's dike blocking and embankment restoration project to repair the dikes and embankments along the rivers and lakes in the province. The initial phase of the project has already been implemented in the suburbs of Nanchang City and in Nanchang, Xinjian, Jinxian, Hukou, Pengze, Yongxiu, Qingjiang, Fengcheng, Xingan, Linchuan, Yujiang, Jiujiang, Ruichang, Wannian and other counties, repairing 237 embankments, benefiting 3,459,620 mu of farmland. Director Cai Meng-jian once accompanied Duncan, a representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), to inspect the work site and believed that this type of work was truly beneficial to the rural areas and should be strengthened. Therefore, he further used the existing relief supplies to organize a second phase, while also taking into account drought prevention projects.

The Longxi Gate in Jingjiang and the Jiurui Embankment in Ruichang, Jiujiang, are several major farmland water conservancy projects that the department has recently organized. After completion, the benefited farmland will often be over 140 mu.

It is estimated that there are 500,000 mu of farmland in Jiangxi that were abandoned during the war and have not been reclaimed. In order to utilize the farmers' winter leisure time to reclaim wasteland and increase production, the Jiangxi Branch cooperated with the Jiangxi Provincial Land Reclamation Office to launch a comprehensive winter reclamation and village restoration movement in a competitive manner, with the goal of reclaiming 400,000 mu of wasteland.

The winter reclamation and village restoration movement is scheduled to be completed before the end of March this year. The total amount of subsidy and relief funds is 200 million yuan, and 20,000 bags of flour and 20,000 pieces of agricultural tools are allocated for awards. The first phase of funds and materials has been distributed to various counties and is now being actively promoted.

The losses suffered by Jiangxi's industry during the war were extremely severe. In terms of construction, the estimated loss of houses in the province is more than 50%, the damage to roads reaches 90%, the tonnage of surviving waterways is less than one-eighth of the pre-war level, and railway vehicles have been completely relocated, with only the roadbed remaining. As for the original public and private mines, numbering more than 250, the number that can barely maintain production today is less than one-fifth of the total number during the war. Therefore, the disasters suffered by various industries in the province, both directly and indirectly, are very deep.

Over the past year, assisting in the repair of public buildings has been an important task of the Jiangxi Branch in the industrial relief sector. A total of 58 health institutions have been allocated for repair. Secondly, in order to assist in the restoration of transportation, in addition to allocating 3,000 bags of flour to subsidize the earthwork project of the Nanxun Road, another 3,000 bags were allocated to subsidize the Wuwan Highway project. In addition, highways such as Taihe, Ganxian, Wan'an, and Pingxiang, the Zhanggongdu Bridge wedge on the Nanxun Highway, and the Taiping Bridge in Nancheng have all been allocated funds by the department for repairs, and are currently under construction. The Zhongxiao Bridge in Ganxian and the Longkai Iron Bridge in Jiujiang are also applying for funds and planning to repair them.

Developing industrial and mining enterprises is an effective measure to support small-scale handicrafts. Jiangxi has organized loans for the paper industry, brick and tile industry, etc., and has also applied for industrial and mining equipment for various mines in an attempt to restore the inherent industrial and mining enterprises. However, among the relief materials distributed to Jiangxi by UNRRA, very few industrial equipment has been transported. Currently, only one set of power generation equipment each has been approved for distribution to the Nanchang Water and Electricity Plant and the Bole and Pingxiang mines. As for rural industry, due to the wide scope and limited manpower and financial resources, it can only start from developing special product industries. It has already planned to establish three demonstration factories for porcelain, hemp, and papermaking, and two brick and tile cement factories.

The biggest difficulty in Jiangxi's current industrial relief work is that the Executive Yuan stopped the original special construction funds from August of last year, so the construction project was unfortunately announced to be suspended. Schools and rural farmhouses in various places that have been damaged and urgently need subsidies for repairs are looking forward to receiving relief. However, the relief and rehabilitation office that is responsible for this work is also "unable to help." Now they can only do their best to focus on repairing water conservancy projects, assisting in the restoration of transportation, and developing special product industries, and pay attention to using the work-relief method to conform to the principle of "incorporating rehabilitation into relief."

The reconstruction of the province's industrial and mining enterprises is dependent on the arrival of industrial and mining equipment from the Executive Yuan. This is an urgent call in industrial restoration.

### A Chronological Biography of Ye Xia'an

— Lu Danlin

Over the past ten years or so, I have read several satisfying chronological biographies of modern figures. One is the "Biography of Mr. Zhang Jianzhi of Nantong" and the other is the "Chronological Biography of Mr. Liang Yansun of Sanshui." These two biographies provide detailed descriptions of China's politics, culture, and economy in the past 80 years and can be used as a concrete and micro-level reference for China's modern history.

However, these two chronological biographies were compiled by later generations after Zhang and Liang passed away. Recently, I read "A Chronological Biography of Mr. Ye Xia'an," which has further deepened our understanding. Because Zhang's period of political activity was very short, and Liang's official positions were limited to the north, while Ye's, in addition to the north, served as the Minister of Finance of the Great Protectorate during the Southern Protectorate Movement, the Minister of Railways of the National Government in the 20th year of the Republic, and even during the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a director of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund. Up to now, although he has not actually participated in political work, he is actually still planning and guiding cultural and economic construction undertakings and has taken part of the responsibility. Therefore, we read the chronological biographies of Zhang, Liang, and Ye in sequence, which is no less than an abridged version of China's modern history. Moreover, there are countless precious historical materials in it, which cannot be found even in modern history books.

Ye is known as one of the two great generals of the transportation industry, the other being Long Jianzhang. Ye's alias is Yu Hu, so people call him Hu. When we talk about the senior figures in today's transportation industry, everyone unanimously recommends Mr. Ye Xia'an (Gongchuo), which is a fact that no one in China's construction industry can deny. From the 66 years of historical events in his chronological biography, we not only know people by discussing the world, but we can also know the world by knowing people. In the chronological biography, Ye's political career began at the age of 26, when he entered the General Affairs Section of the Archives Department of the Postal Department as a clerk. Before long, he was appointed as a chief drafter, which is equivalent to a section member who drafts documents. However, from chief drafter, he was promoted rapidly and served as the Minister of Communications three times, and as the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Railways once each. He oversaw the national postal, telecommunications, aviation, and road administrations for decades and was indeed an outstanding construction leader. From his chronological biography, we can understand the evolution of China's transportation, politics, economy, and culture over the past few decades, which can be used for historical research and reference for research and tourism administration. And the changes he experienced are all closely related to his lifelong career.

When Ye was eighteen years old, he took the children's examination, and the examiner Zhang Baixi was extremely impressed by his railway poem and admitted him to the prefectural school as the top student. Ye's appreciation by Zhang began from then on, and his later achievements were mostly closely related to the railway, which can also be considered a coincidence.

Ye was unusually intelligent in his early years. At the age of twelve, he met Wang Degeng, and Wang used his name to form a couplet. Ye responded with "Gongshuzi," and Wang was surprised and praised him upon hearing it. And his "Ode to the Silkworm" written at the age of fifteen can summarize his life. The poems are like this: "Clothing covers the world, who can recognize its kindness! Once the work is done, the cast-off skin remains. Working to forget one's life, laboring in the hope of little success. Although bound by one's own threads, it is not a pitiable worm!" Words are the voice of the heart, which shows his ambition. The promotion of civil servants has a certain procedure. The promotion and transfer of officials in the former Qing Dynasty was even more difficult. However, he entered the Ministry of Posts and Communications to work in November at the age of 26. In March of the following year, the Ministry established a Railway Coordination Office to oversee the affairs of loaning money to various roads. He also served in the office, and in June, he filled the position of road administration assistant drafter. In July, he was nominated as a probationary secretary, and in August, he was appointed as a small seventh-rank official in the capital. In September, he served as the acting secretary and filled the position of section chief of the Secretariat's Confidential Section. In October, he filled the position of section chief of the official section of the Road Administration Department, and in November, he filled the position of the general section member of the Railway Administration. It was equivalent to the coordinator at that time. In April at the age of 28, he filled the position of road administration secretary, and in May, he was promoted to the road administration assistant secretary. In September, he was promoted beyond the normal promotion to the road administration director and also transferred to the secretariat as a judge. We can only see from this short period of more than a year, the rapid promotion, that without extraordinary talent, there would be no such promotion. This proves that he has special skills. Therefore, he was able to lay the foundation for China's transportation industry for decades, and his students and former subordinates are all over the country.

Hu Hanmin was Ye's childhood (seven years old) classmate. In the twelfth year of the Republic, after reading Ye's "On Using Transportation to Save the Country," he wrote a letter saying, "After reading your book, I am deeply impressed by its thoroughness and insight. However, I have not seen this book in Shanghai, and the public's discussion of transportation is not fair. It seems that the propaganda campaign is too late, so that those who are complacent have taken the lead in public opinion. Repeated slander will destroy gold. Isn't it a regrettable thing!..." Hu and Ye knew each other for decades and still had such words. Those who do not understand the content of the transportation industry naturally do not understand it even more, and they are even more estranged from those who were in charge of transportation at that time.

Ye certainly had great achievements in the transportation industry, but he also had detailed descriptions of China's political reforms over the past few decades, such as the abdication of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the Hepu Peace Conference, the suppression of the Restoration, participation in the Protectorate Movement, the change of banner in the three northeastern provinces, as well as the cultural movement, national diplomacy, the organization of national heritage, the compilation and printing of series of books, the promotion of art, and the preservation of monuments in his chronological biography. It not only commends his conduct, but in fact, it is enough to be our guide. We should not forget this point when reading the chronological biography.

This chronological biography, more than 380 pages, was printed and published by the Xia'an Draft Chronological Biography Compilation and Printing Committee in October of last year as a commemoration of Ye's 66th birthday. Because it is not for sale, in addition to his relatives, friends, students, and former subordinates who funded the book for preservation, it may be a bit difficult for outsiders who want to read and cherish it. It is said that only 2,000 copies were printed in the first and second printings.

### On Cultivation

— Tradition First

By Zhu Guangqian, Published by Zhong Zhou Society

Mr. Zhu can be said to be a mentor to Chinese youth. His "Twelve Letters to Youth" has been one of the most popular books among middle school students for many years. "On Beauty" is also a good book. However, I like his "Literary Psychology" the most. His writing is not deliberately crafted like that of so-called literary figures, but reading his books naturally cultivates a sense of beauty in people. In the past decade or so, Mr. Zhu's thinking and scholarship have progressed. Although the language of his Literary Psychology is beautiful, the conceptual framework is not yet rigorous enough. Last month, I read two articles by him on aesthetics in the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, and I personally felt that his theory was much more rigorous, although the expression in his writing seemed a bit too plain.

I had heard long ago that Mr. Zhu had a book on self-cultivation, but I couldn't find it. Recently, I happened to buy it at a bookstall in Nanjing. Although I still enjoy reading his books as before, I feel that it is not as good as I had hoped. Mr. Zhu said, "Some of the things I said in my debut work were quite naive for a young person. When I wrote them, I was inevitably driven by momentary passion and lacked discretion. Looking back now, I feel quite ashamed. Now that I have eaten ten more years of meals, read a few more books, encountered more human affairs, and spent more time thinking and experiencing, I feel that although the old words do not need to be repeated, the loopholes must be filled." However, I feel that in the process of Mr. Zhu patching the loopholes, the passionate naivete that he felt "ashamed" of has also disappeared. I think this is a pity. Although we are against preachy lectures, we would still like to see people having passionate and spirited conversations with us. We regret that Mr. Zhu lacks this youthful vigor.

This book is a collection of many short essays. It begins with some heartfelt words, saying, "The current students are all walking a common and dim path, which does nothing to advance culture or improve society." He also said, "Education does not seem to have a good influence on people's quality. This generation of people treads the same path as the previous generation with their eyes open, and the next generation of people still treads the same path as this generation with their eyes open. This cycle continues endlessly, and the retribution is the same. 'When will the long night end?'" Therefore, he wants young people to understand their era, to understand the current position of the nation, to understand the individual's relationship to the nation, and to make themselves a powerful part of society. He then discusses aspiration, the psychological pathologies of youth, how to interact with others, compassion, shame, learning, reading, as well as friendship, sex and love, leisure, and physical education.

Although these are his successively published thoughts, there is a consistent central idea. He himself said, "In general, I like calmness, composure, stability, and fortitude. I use a detached spirit to do worldly work, and I respect ideals and will, but I do not belittle emotions and imagination... I believe in the accumulation of over four thousand years. I am not borrowing from the creators of ideologies." What I like about these articles is that the topics they discuss are the crystallization of the author's decades of experience. There is no affected moaning or empty talk. For example, he wants young people to (1) have the courage to take responsibility for themselves; (2) know how to be pragmatic, accept the current situation and seek solutions; (3) understand that their own mental illnesses must be cured by their own efforts. Although these have a slight preachy tone, I am pleased that the content is based on experience and the analysis has a scientific basis. Moreover, he proposed a positive way to fundamentally transform young people, which is to implement a new type of education. He advocates that the focus of education should shift from attending classes and reading books to learning how to be a person. He said, "Many complex courses must be cut away with decisive measures. Students should spend at least half of their time living in genuine groups and engaging in national activities." He even has a practical education reform plan, which is truly different from the lofty ideals discussed by those high-minded educators.

However, what we want to criticize is that these articles are not as detailed as his previous ones, and the thinking is based more on experience and less on analytical work. This is enough to reflect the anxiety of wartime life, which has affected the work of scholars. He said, "These articles were written late at night while listening to my wife and daughters snoring... Although I was quite diligent, the writing is inevitably a bit slack and perfunctory." However, this frank and sincere attitude is still lovely.

I remember that Feng Youlan's books and theories are always "for the sake of achieving peace for our country and enabling our hundreds of millions of people to live and work in peace," while Mr. Zhu said, "Many authors currently writing books claim to want to contribute to the great cause of nation-building, wielding a pen and starting a new school of thought. I do not have this kind of learning, nor do I have this kind of ambition or delusion. I know that this booklet is like a floating cloud, appearing for a moment and then disappearing. But I hope that during this time it can present a brilliant light and shadow through the crystal-clear heart-cloud of the reader, just as a floating cloud does through the clear water of a pool. If the spirit does not perish, then this influence, however subtle, can spread infinitely." We feel that this brilliant light and shadow is more impactful on young people than those great works that "establish the heart for the world, establish life for the people, continue the lost learning for the past sages, and open up peace for all generations."

### Introducing Two Pamphlets

— Xin Jun

"Our Motherland" Series, New China Publishing House

Recently, I read the three published books in the "Our Motherland" series and feel that they are must-read books for young people because they point out the current situation of China in various aspects for young people, enabling them to gain a clear understanding and strengthen their love for the country. Its writing is simple and popular, making it very suitable for the general public of young people.

Now, I would like to introduce two of the best books and solemnly recommend them to you young people.

### "What is the National Assembly?"

— By Peng Hesheng

First edition, December 1946

The name "National Assembly" is familiar to every young person, but young people may not all understand the meaning, organization, and powers of the National Assembly. This book clearly explains the parts that young people are not very familiar with.

First, it explains what the National Assembly is, stating that the National Assembly is an institution that exercises civil rights and guarantees that "the sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to all citizens." The author clearly explains the relative terms of direct democracy and indirect democracy. The book also gives examples of Sun Yat-sen's teachings on the National Assembly.

Second, it describes the powers of the National Assembly: It explains the powers of the National Assembly in three aspects: formulating the constitution, exercising central ruling power, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, discussing the advantages and disadvantages in a very accurate way.

Third, on the aspect of the National Assembly and the Parliament, it explains the difference between the National Assembly and the Parliament, the advantages of the cabinet system, and the "tangible" National Assembly, in a concise and clear manner.

Fourth, it talks about the organizational law of the National Assembly and the election of representatives. The author points out the advantages and disadvantages of the organizational law and the electoral law in a very truthful manner.

Finally, the book looks forward to the future of the National Assembly and democratic politics. The author gives a prospective explanation of the National Assembly and the future of Chinese democratic politics, standing on his objective political perspective.

Chinese democratic politics must be implemented, and it is necessary to understand the National Assembly. So, to understand the National Assembly, young people should read this book.

### "The Motherland in the Last Century"

— By Huang Yaomian

First edition, January 1947

The past century of China has always been a history of the people's struggle against slavery. This small book clearly and accurately explains the various events that have occurred in China in the last century. The content is also explained in five points:

First, from the Opium War to the Eight-Nation Alliance; we know that the Opium War was the first to break through the political and economic walls of China, enabling international capitalism to plunder and exploit. This book first points out the Opium War and the Anglo-French Allied War, which led China to embark on the path of semi-colonialism. After that, the author briefly describes the Taiping Rebellion and the Nian Rebellion, the two anti-Qing autocratic movements. The author clearly tells the young people about these.

The loss of border territories and vassal states after the Opium War, the fact that imperialists intensified their plunder, the author also describes in the same way. The Sino-Japanese War rapidly lowered China's status. At that time, China still maintained an independent appearance on the surface, but in reality, it had been divided by the powers. This section of facts is also told to us in this book.

The details of the Hundred Days' Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Eight-Nation Alliance War are written clearly in this book, which does not take up much space.

Second, the causes, process, and lessons of the failure of the Xinhai Revolution. This book describes the establishment of the Tongmenghui, the success and failure of the Xinhai Revolution, the North-South negotiation with Yuan Shikai, and the Second Revolution caused by Yuan Shikai's dream. The author also explained it appropriately.

Third, it points out World War I and China, as well as the Twenty-One Demands between China and Japan, Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor, and the revolt of the military governors. These historical facts related to World War I and China can all be seen.

Fourth, the May Fourth Movement and the revolutionary climax of 1926, the author points out the causes and process of the May Fourth Movement and the formation of the revolutionary climax of 1926.

Finally, it talks about the September 18th Incident and the Anti-Japanese War. Every young person may still remember this part of the facts. The book further strengthens our understanding.

This book clearly tells young people about the basic knowledge of Chinese history in the last century. All young people should read it.

### "The Razor's Edge"

— Li Dongfang

The Razors Edge by Somerset Maugham

This book was first published in February 1944, and it has been almost three years now, so it cannot be considered a new book. However, it is still very popular. In addition to the fact that this bookstore has published 15 editions and that bookstore has published 5 editions, the popular version of the pocket bookstore has been printed several times. Hollywood made it into a movie last winter, spending millions of dollars. This film, starring Tyrone Power as the lead and Gene Tierney as the female lead, caused a sensation in the United States. Talking about "The Razor's Edge" is very fashionable in the social circles of the upper and middle classes.

Why is it so successful? Because it best suits American tastes? Not only that. Americans today are already able to appreciate things that do not only suit their tastes. I think this is progress for Americans. This book tempts Americans to use their brains to think about life's problems, and Americans feel that it is very interesting. This is the reason for the book's huge success.

The author is British and has lived in the United States for a long time and is very familiar with American society. Few Americans can match his writing. (At most eight or nine people). He is famous throughout the world for "Of Human Bondage," and has also written a book about China, China Screen, which is not very flattering to the Chinese habit of using people as animals (such as pulling carts and boats, etc.).

The words "The Razor's Edge" come from the Indian classic, Ratha Upanishad, which says, "Salvation is like climbing over a razor's edge." And this book is the story of a young man who hopes to be saved and to save others.

This young man was an air force pilot in World War I. During the battle, he saw his best friend shot down and killed while trying to save him, and he was deeply moved. He also saw dead bodies piled up like salted fish on the battlefield, but just a few days before, they were still full of life. He had gone through the matter of life and death, but he could not understand it. But he wanted to understand very much and looked down on everything else.

He returned to his hometown of Chicago. His fiancée was waiting for him, and his mother-in-law was planning his future. The best way out seemed to be to join the stock exchange and become a broker's partner. He could get rich quickly and have a high social status! In this way, he could get married, have children, and educate them. He only felt bored.

His fiancée hoped that he would start working immediately, and then get married after he got a job. He said, "I want to study 'learning' first." What kind of "learning" does he want to study? He did not go to school to get a degree, but hid in public libraries or nightclubs, reading random books. He read randomly without a plan, and no one knew when he would get it. The stock exchange? He had no interest. "Why persuade people to buy stocks and be fooled?" Moreover, he had seen people die, seen people live, made friends with heroes, and seen heroes turn to dust, so going back to sell stocks and count money was too boring.

His fiancée was very cute, he knew that, and he had never loved another woman. But he was not as anxious as she was. He asked her for a year's leave, and then he would come back and get married. This young man then wandered around the mountains and rivers, traveling to famous cities.

He did not even give her a real address, but asked a travel agency to forward letters. In short, he spent much of his time in Paris.

A year later, his fiancée and her mother came to Paris with the purpose of finding the young man and taking him back to get married. He was very happy and had sweet talk with his fiancée, but marriage required him to work: selling stocks. He begged to let him study further, and then wait until he fully understood life. His fiancée was not happy.

His fiancée angrily returned the ring and went back to Chicago to marry a small boss on the stock exchange. One year, two years, three years went by. Life was very happy, with food and clothing, and she had two lovely daughters.

He did not mind, but went to experience the taste of life in addition to reading. He went to a coal mine to work as a miner, and then went to a farm in Germany to work as a "long-term worker." He traveled to many places, pursued the truth, visited famous teachers, and finally achieved his goal in India. He became a disciple of an old master and gained many subtle insights. The old master ordered him to go down the mountain and experience the secular world again.

A long time later, he met his fiancée again in Paris. The world had changed quickly. Prosperity turned into depression. A certain storm wiped out the property of his fiancée's husband's family. Her husband also suffered from an incurable disease that caused frequent headaches. Her whole family moved to a small city to live. His fiancée cooked and washed clothes, and her husband did low-level manual labor, earning very little. Her uncle was still doing well in Paris and wrote to her, asking her to take her husband to Paris for treatment.

The young man was already middle-aged. His name was Larry. Larry still did not associate with the woman's uncle, and he got along well with the author (Maugham), but Maugham did not know much about his whereabouts. It just so happened that after the woman's family moved to Paris, Maugham met Larry on the street and took Larry to the uncle's house to see the woman and her husband and children.

Everyone had unspeakable emotions when they met. However, Larry was not very sad. He cured the bankrupt husband's headache, using hypnosis he learned in India. Everyone went to a low-class cafe, where they met a pitiful old friend who was working as a prostitute. Larry decided to save her, get her out of her misery, help her quit drinking, and was preparing to marry her. However, the woman actually sabotaged it, tempting her to relapse into alcohol abuse, making her ashamed and leaving.

In Marseille, this prostitute got along well with a sailor. As a result, she was killed by the sailor with a razor blade and thrown into the sea. The police found Larry and Maugham's names among her belongings, and asked them to take care of the funeral. This poor woman could not pass the "razor's edge."

Larry never saw the woman again. He only wanted to buy a streetcar and become a driver after returning to the United States. This job had a good income, was very free, and allowed him to meet many people.

There is no doubt that "The Razor's Edge" is perfect in technique. Its advantage lies in making people think deeply. The woman is not a bad person, but a very reasonable ordinary person. She loves Larry. Of course, Larry is not a heartless bad person either. He has unspeakable difficulties. It is also difficult to determine whether he has really pursued the truth, and it is not necessary to determine it. Truth is not easy to pursue, and it is always worthy of our sympathy if one is willing to pursue it. That prostitute is really too pitiful.

Everyone admires the energy of the Americans. But they are not like our Chinese nation, which is old and sad, and they do not know very well the impermanence of human life. They can get many benefits if they are willing to spend a little precious time to think about it by reading this book. (We Chinese and Indians think about it too much.)

### Arts and Literature Scene

— Bo Lin

Recently, two French cultural figures came to Shanghai: one is Cartier, the editor-in-chief of Le Matin, and the other is the female novelist Roube-Jansky. The former is traveling around the world and passing through China; the latter likes China very much and plans to stay in various Chinese cities for a longer period of time in order to get to know China.

Pierre Bonnard, the greatest French painter of modern times, recently died of pneumonia in Cannes. People in the art world expressed their condolences. Bonnard was an authority in the modern French art world, and his achievements are a milestone in the history of French painting. His death is a great loss to the French cultural world.

Recently, the French community in this city organized a drama club and prepared to stage a play. They are now actively rehearsing, and the performance is expected to be held around Easter.

French films are also appearing in this city: French newsreels were screened at the French Association on Huanlong Road at 6 pm on the 23rd of this month. The latest French film will be screened at the French Association at 6 pm on March 2, and may be commercially screened in cinemas in this city in the future.

The French Association recently held a cultural lecture on the topic of "French Literature and Today's France." The content gave a detailed description of the three major schools of French literature: existentialism, communism, and Christianism. There was a detailed introduction to the publications during the French occupation period, such as the famous "Midnight Series," and newly published magazines and books, newly famous writers, and the situation in various literary departments such as novels, essays, poems, and dramas. It is said that there will be similar lectures in the future.

The authoritative French film magazine "Screen" recently published a long article introducing Chinese films, giving a detailed and accurate report on the history of Chinese films and the struggle of Chinese films during the Anti-Japanese War. The evaluation of Chinese films is very high, and it concludes by saying that it hopes to see peaceful productions soon.

### The Difficulty of Socializing

— Qi Lou

Several years ago, I read something like "The Road to Success." The most touching sentence for me was that young people must develop outwards and not be afraid of socializing if they want to succeed. The first step was to advise people to take the initiative and say hello to people they know. I felt that as long as you were willing to do it, even a fool could do it, so I started to implement it.

At a lively banquet, I met a small businessman I had seen more than three times. I felt that I had to put my determination into practice. I walked over, my face was facing him, and my eyes looked at his eyes pleadingly. His eyes were looking at the top of me; I walked over again, his eyes were looking at our right side; I took another step forward, and his eyes were looking at our left side; I was almost touching him, and he suddenly lowered his eyes and looked at the ground. In short, he saw everything, but he didn't see me.

But I was determined, and I called out to him in a low voice:

"Mr. Chen!"

He raised his head, staring at me as if he were looking at a white wall. At that moment, I almost lost confidence and thought I had recognized the wrong person, if it hadn't been for the posture he used to lift his glasses, which reminded me of the impression he gave when he first received me in the manager's office.

"I am Zhang Qilou..." I mustered up my courage again.

"Oh?" His eyes widened even more, and then he said in an unusually polite manner, with an attitude of a wise man valuing the talents under him, "I'm sorry, it seems that we haven't met before. I'm afraid you've recognized the wrong person."

"I... I have visited you before."

"Oh, is that so? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I still have to say a word to Old Zhou," he rushed past me and started talking to a small banker. From then on, I dared not look at him again.

From then on, I knew how difficult "socializing" was, especially when you met a myopic and forgetful noble.

### Small Incident

— Ji Shui

The Hangzhou-Shanghai train, which was supposed to depart at 6:10 in the morning, was already packed when I arrived at 4:00. Fortunately, I didn't have much luggage, so I squeezed into a third-class car that was about the same age as me.

Finally, I occupied a relatively spacious foothold. I held on to the back of someone's seat with one hand, and stood in the "at ease" position, preparing to stand for a long time. There were no electric lights in the car, only a faint cold light from the platform. I leisurely looked at the companions in the carriage with the mood of "observing all things": some were dozing off, some were chatting, some were cursing, and some were saying nice things, while the car door was still squeezing and creaking, and people were coming up one after another. Suddenly, the woman holding the child next to me and a man sitting down started arguing. The woman said, "Because I'm holding a child, I can't stand for a long time. I just want a little space from you. You just have to squeeze a little bit. What does it matter?" The man said, "I came at two o'clock and only got this seat. If I give it to you, wouldn't my three or four hours of 'early' be for you to 'get up' with? I didn't receive your money, did I? Besides, since you know you want to sit, why didn't you come earlier?" Then another standing man said, "Why are you so rude? The woman who is holding the child is not sitting, but you, a young and strong man, are sitting. Are you at ease? You don't understand the rules at all." Suddenly another man shouted loudly, "This is his priority. What does it have to do with you? In this world, where are the rules being talked about? Where are the rules being talked about?" Finally, half a seat was squeezed out for the woman holding the child, and the storm subsided immediately. I looked at each of them with amazement and admiration. I didn't expect to encounter the long-extinct "justice" and the virtue of daring to speak out today.

It wasn't until the train entered Linping Station, and everyone put down the glass windows to buy spiced bean curd and tea eggs from the vendors, that I realized that they were a couple and the two were fellow villagers. So, I was at a loss again.

### I Don't Want to Be Insulted - A Female Employee's View on Female "Vases"

— Lin Mei

Seeing other people have jobs, I am very envious and also want to find one for myself. But what kind of job is good? Female employees in government offices have always been referred to as "vases." The name "vase" has some insulting undertones. I am not envious. I am willing to use my intelligence and physical strength to earn the compensation I deserve because I also know that regardless of whether it is mental or physical labor, it is still labor, and labor is sacred.

I wanted to find a job, and I finally found one. I work as a copyist in the manager's office of a certain company. The manager also treats me quite favorably, so I am exceptionally happy. However, after working for more than a month, I realized that I had been fooled.

The story is like this: one day, someone introduced a female employee. This female employee was very plainly dressed, with a slightly pale complexion and a few pockmarks. However, her demeanor was natural and generous, and her conversation was also very elegant. It was said that she had graduated from a university with a degree in commerce. This is a talented person who should have been hired as a matter of course, as there are several female employees with only a primary or secondary school education in our company. However, unexpectedly, she did not win the favor of the manager.

I was very strange and therefore studied it carefully. It turns out that the manager's standard for hiring female employees is still based on the word "appearance." Therefore, the female employees in our company are mostly young and beautiful, without dark faces or pockmarks, and without old women with chicken skin and white hair. No wonder that new female employee with pockmarks was not hired. Isn't the manager using our faces to make money for him? I understood this and couldn't help but feel endless sadness. It turns out that my position was obtained by relying on my youth and beautiful face. If, after ten or twenty years, wouldn't I still be unemployed? Am I still not a "vase"?

I feel insulted, but how can I avoid being insulted?

### Talking About Troupe Performance Drama

— Song

Recently, cooperative performances have been popular. In Shanghai and Beijing, famous actors are gathered to perform their signature plays to attract audiences. In fact, this is a derivative of the charity performances and guild performances in Beiping. Tracing back to its origin, it actually started with the troupe performance dramas of various subjects in imperial examinations. In the past, the rules for opera troupes were extremely strict. Actors from one troupe could never perform in another troupe. However, in troupe performances, actors from various troupes could be gathered, and those who never collaborated could collaborate. In addition to the troupe performances of various subjects, the most prominent was the Grand Council of the Military Affairs Department. Every year on the second day of the New Year, it was held once. In the year of Ji Mao, the fifth year of Guangxu, I accompanied my father to the capital. The following year, the troupe performance in the year of Geng Chen was undertaken by my late father. At that time, Grand Secretary Zhang Ziqing, a minister of the court, was most fond of drama, so the performances were always very popular. The fortunes of the various subjects of the imperial examination had their ups and downs. Those with prosperous fortunes held independent performances, while those with declining fortunes combined two or three subjects. For example, my late father's Dao Guang Yi You subject and my elder brother's Tongzhi Geng Wu subject were both the most prosperous subjects. The location of the troupe performances was always in Caisheng Hall or Wenchang Hall. In the middle of Guangxu, it was in Huguang Hall. During the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, it was in Jiangxi Hall. After the imperial examinations were abolished, charity guild performances rose one after another. The period from the early Republic of China to before the 17th year was the era of extreme prosperity. However, troupe performances can be divided into a stage from the beginning of Guangxu to Wu Xu. At that time, Yang Yuelou, the father of Xiao Lou, Yu Ziyun, the father of Shu Yan, and Yang Guiyun, the grandfather of Baozhong and Baosen, were all the best of their time. Each time, there must be Kunqu performances. Shi Xiaofu, the father of Hui Bao, and Zhu Lianfen, the father of You Fen, were the leaders in this field. There must also be famous amateurs guest starring. The most famous were Chen Zifang and Wei Yaoqing. In Peking opera, Yuelou's "Changban Slope" was completely different from Xiao Lou's. His monkey plays were the best with "Water Curtain Cave." Ziyun and Xiaofu always performed "Yu Tang Chun," "Cai Lou Pei," "Sacrificing to the River," "Sacrificing to the Pagoda," or "Pu Fan." The play "Pu Guan" was highly valued because it required two bearded actors to perform together. When Yang performed, Ju Xian and Long Changsheng must collaborate. In Kunqu, Zhu always played the Go board. In Peking opera, Chen and Wei always performed the first two acts of "Rainbow Pass." Wei Yaoqing had the nickname "Wei the Life Taker" because his charm was even more seductive than that of Xun Huisheng and others. When troupe performances recruited famous actors, no one dared not to participate because if they didn't, the South City neighborhood had the possibility of arresting the leading actor, which was also a brutal policy of the feudal era.

### Madame Lotus Stamen

— Guo Hua

"Madame Lotus Stamen," which is showing at "Du Mei," is a Soviet film. Unlike most Soviet films, it has absolutely no propaganda undertones. Although at the beginning of the story, three storytellers said, "There is truth in this," the film did not emphasize the so-called truth in a way that made people uncomfortable.

The story is a fairy tale, or rather a folk tale. It tells the story of three sons who marry wives. The youngest son marries a frog, which turns out to be a beautiful woman. There are snake spirits, enchantresses, and spider spirits, as well as a dragon-slaying sword, which together make for an interesting story. Just for the sake of the story itself, parents can take their little darlings to see it.

### Value of Cigarettes

— Yuan Qinsun

Reports say that the German people do not trust the legal tender and use American cigarettes as the standard, vying to collect them. Each box is worth 1,200 marks, equivalent to 100 US dollars. If calculated in our country's legal tender, it would be 1.64 million, which is equivalent to 3.4 taels of gold. In China, each box of American cigarettes costs 3,000, which is only worth 40 US cents. Based on Shanghai's 4 million citizens, each person consuming one box per day would require 1.6 million US dollars. However, this is vastly different from Germany.

### Thought Can Maintain Youth, Part Two

— Translated by Xue Qing

Do not confuse the youth you used to know with true youth. Because this can restore youth to those who are already old. In any case, as long as you don't think you're old, you won't age. If you try to avoid aging, you will be the first to age.

Now I am going to tell you the secret to maintaining youth: it is very simple, which is to pay more attention to your thoughts, keep them forever young and full of vitality, and don't let your thoughts stagnate. Times are constantly advancing, pay attention to your surroundings, and learn new things anytime, anywhere. In this way, you will always be young.

In addition, do not let your life be too monotonous. I often see two kinds of people with different personalities. The first kind of people pay close attention to their family and work, and at the same time constantly seek other interesting jobs. They read newspapers and magazines and choose hobbies that use both their hands and brains. The other kind of people, starting at the age of thirty-five, begin to fall into a rigid and comfortable mechanical life. Every day after work, they go home to rest, watch some comic strips or sports news after dinner, or listen to the radio before going to bed. His wife, in addition to managing the household and taking care of the children, only listens to flattering operas, reads convoluted love novels, and participates in bridge games for recreation. For these two types of people, the first type becomes younger with the increase of years, while the second type seems to have suffered a fatal injury. If his life does not change, he will appear old at the age of forty-five.

Don't worry about your age; it is still not too late to make your life more interesting. Don't say, "I'm too old, it's too late!" Remember that a fifty-year-old housewife with specialized experience eventually became an outstanding industrial designer. Another retired electrical engineer is now a highly paid ceramic artist. Among my clients, there is also an old lady in her seventies whose children said she should retire, but she successfully opened a bridal cooking training school.

Don't think you're too old to go back to school. Someone entered medical school at the age of seventy, and he is now a famous doctor. Another person entered law school at the age of seventy and is now a very active lawyer. A ninety-one-year-old woman from California entered university to study American history for recuperation. Another woman started painting at the age of seventy-seven and held a solo exhibition at the age of eighty. Today, although she is eighty-six years old, she is still living healthily. So it's not too late, you can still create a new career.

In short, anyone who lives a progressive life, regardless of age, will remain young as long as you are willing to do it carefully. So keeping your mind always awake and lively is the secret to eternal youth. (Translated from Reader's Digest, January 1947, "Your Mind Can Keep You Young")
