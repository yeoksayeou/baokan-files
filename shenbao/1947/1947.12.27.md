[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The State Council meeting on the 26th discussed seven important cases. The details are as follows: The central government budget for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic of China has been decided to be re-submitted for review. The key points for the research of the committee on the adjustment plan for the treatment of civil and military personnel have been resolved to be re-submitted for review. The national salt tax increase will be implemented from January 1st of the following year. The implementation measures for setting up a temporary additional tax on customs duties have been passed. The case regarding the authority to increase postal and telecommunications prices has been resolved to be sent to the Legislative Yuan according to the original proposal. The supplementary election regulations have been passed according to the original review opinions. The request to increase the number of Manchu legislators and supervisors has been resolved to be passed, with 15 legislators and 8 supervisors. However, it is still subject to review and can only be implemented after legislative procedures.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The central government's general budget for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic of China, after being submitted by the responsible authorities, was not approved by the State Council due to the large deficit in revenue and expenditure. It was decided that the civil servant treatment case submitted at the same time would be jointly submitted to a special review committee composed of the presidents of the five yuan, the director of budget, the minister of finance, and government officials Wang Yunwu, Yu Jiaju, Ji Yiqiao, Weng Wenhao, and Chen Huide for further review. During the meeting on the 26th, Budget Director Xu Kan, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, Premier Zhang Qun, and Deputy Premier Wang Yunwu, among others, gave lengthy reports on the compilation process of the above two cases. The meeting was temporarily adjourned. Some committee members believed that the current national financial difficulties require that the budget revenue and expenditure should strive for balance, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and reduce personnel and simplify administration, which is the fundamental way to be diligent in governing the country. President Chiang personally attended and presided over the State Council meeting today and gave instructions on the national budget issue.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The budget for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic of China totals 902,264.549 billion yuan, an increase of 200 billion compared to the total national budget for the entire 36th year of the Republic of China. The case has been resolved to be re-submitted for review.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] It is reported that the biggest feature of the national general budget for the first half of the 37th year is the establishment of fees. For example, the expenses of the Ministry of Communications, the Resources Commission, etc., have increased compared to the past, and it is mainly based on the Constitution to increase the education, science, and culture budget to 15% of the total amount. As for the salaries of public officials, because it has not yet been decided, it will be listed under the second reserve fund. As for the revenue sector, the main sources are still expected to be tax revenue, state-owned enterprise income, Japanese reparations in kind, and debts.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The issue of adjusting the treatment of public and education personnel was brought up for discussion at the State Council meeting on the 26th. After two hours of meticulous discussion, no conclusion was reached. When the discussion reached the middle, President Chiang withdrew to another room and immediately handed it over to a special committee for review. After detailed consultations among the five parties, they reconvened to discuss, but in the end, because the issue was too broad, it could not be decided for a while, and it was immediately handed over to a special committee for review. According to what was submitted to the meeting for discussion today, it was the key points studied by the Committee on the Adjustment Plan for the Treatment of Civil and Military Personnel organized by the Directorate General of Budget, and the speeches by Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, etc., all indicated that the national government was bearing too much burden, and some people believed that the distribution of supplies to public and education personnel in the past was inevitably biased and could not be universal. It was also heard that Xu Kan, when speaking at the meeting, believed that rather than disliking the large budget, it would be better to cut redundant institutions and reduce staff, and issue a considerable amount of severance pay so that the salaries of those in office could be adequately paid. However, this statement only expressed his opinion and did not have any specific suggestions.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The government has decided to levy a temporary additional tax on import goods at customs, starting from New Year's Day of the 37th year of the Republic of China, temporarily levied for half a year, increasing by 50%. However, cotton, rice, flour, wheat, and coal, which have fixed official prices, are not included in this example. Secondly, gasoline, diesel, and kerosene have also increased import taxes and are not included in this example. All other imported goods are subject to taxation. Furthermore, the matter of increasing postal and telecommunications prices was brought up again at the State Council meeting. It was decided that during this period of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the State Council, as the highest power organ of the country, has the power to make expedient decisions without first going through the Legislative Yuan, and the Executive Yuan will supplement and send it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The national salt tax increase case has been passed at the State Council meeting on the 26th. It was decided to implement it from New Year's Day of the 37th year of the Republic of China. The ordinary edible salt will be increased to 250,000 yuan per dan, and the earth paste and fishing morning salt will each be increased to 200,000 yuan.

### Ambassador to Turkey, Li Dijun, Explains the Features of the New Constitution

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 25th Dispatch] On the day when our country began to implement the Constitution, our ambassador to Turkey, Li Dijun, specially published a statement to the Turkish press, saying: "The Chinese government and people, regardless of the cost required, are determined to implement the Constitution from today." The ambassador explained to the Turkish people all the democratic features of the new Constitution, and continued: "In the past 36 years, there has been the destruction of feudal warlords, followed by the invasion of Japan, and now there is the rebellion of the Communist Party. However, the Chinese people have persevered and strived for democracy and finally succeeded." The ambassador said: The Chinese government and people "do not underestimate the hostile forces that are currently preventing the country from being unified and democratic. In fact, the Communist Party is currently trying to overthrow the legitimate government of China by force and trying to impose the most oppressive totalitarian regime on the country. However, under the wise leadership of President Chiang, the Chinese people will surely quell the Communist rebellion, just as they have previously defeated the warlord separatism and crushed the Japanese invaders. They firmly believe that the new Constitution will be fully implemented, and China will be a bastion of democracy in the Far East. Their confidence is not only based on their own inherent strength but also relies on the broad support of all freedom-loving nations in the world, and the Turkish people are also one of them."

### Assets of the China Textile Corporation: Priority Purchase Principle: A Total of Four Items Awaiting Approval from the Executive Yuan Before Implementation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The method for applying for priority purchase of the assets of the China Textile Corporation has been approved by the meeting of the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises and is being reviewed by the National Economic Council. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, it can be announced and implemented. As of now, more than ten units, including Dahua, Yuxing, Daxing Textile Company, Puyi Jingwei Company, Tianjin Huaxin Textile Company, and the Postwar Private Textile Factory Restoration Committee, have applied for priority purchase. The Supervisory Committee has not made any decision on this. The meaning of priority purchase is that, under the same price and the same principles of the Supervisory Committee's sale, manufacturers are allowed to submit evidence based on the facts and reasons they have, and after review by the committee, they are approved to purchase with priority. The principles of priority purchase are: Private textile companies in the rear, which suffered losses during the war due to supplying military needs, may be allowed to purchase with priority depending on the amount of losses caused by supplying military needs, but they must submit evidence from relevant agencies proving the facts and figures of the losses caused by supplying military needs. If the original factory property was forcibly occupied and damaged by the enemy puppets during the occupied period, or if it was forced to sell a part or all of it, and concrete and legal evidentiary documents can be submitted, the committee may review and determine that it is indeed the case, the original factory may be applied for priority purchase, but if the enemy puppets continue to operate after the sale and the increased assets exceed the scope of the original factory assets, or if the enemy puppets merge the two factories and the original assets cannot be subdivided, this is not included. Textile manufacturers who voluntarily sold to the enemy puppets before or during the war cannot request priority to repurchase the original factory property. The request of local governments to operate and sell to private individuals is not in line with the purpose, and it is proposed that according to the above four principles, if the manufacturer is allowed by the committee to purchase with priority, if they fail to comply with the regulations of the committee and pay the factory price to the national treasury within a certain period of time, the priority purchase will be revoked after the deadline.

Editorial

### Forward to Benevolence and Democracy! - Thoughts on Pope Pius XII's Broadcast Address -

On the eve of Christmas, Pope Pius XII broadcast to 400 million Catholic believers worldwide, expressing deep concern in his address for the current situation in China. We have not yet had the opportunity to read the full text of the Pope's broadcast, but from the snippets published in the newspapers, it is not difficult to discern the general spirit of the entire address. This spirit is to guide humanity to move forward to benevolence and democracy. Yes, we must overcome hatred with benevolence and overcome totalitarianism with democracy.

Originally, the Pope has a customary broadcast every Christmas. Apart from Catholic followers and various European and American countries, we would not have paid general attention to it. We are neither a Christian nor a Catholic country. The Pope's speech, although a well-rounded, comprehensive article with profound meaning, seems to many people to be somewhat irrelevant to us. This is extremely natural, but this year, the Pope's address directly mentioned China, and based on the existing signs, we really cannot maintain the same indifferent attitude as before. Within Christianity, there is a distinction between Catholicism and Protestantism, and within Protestantism, there are various denominations, but whether they believe in Protestantism or Catholicism, they are all Christian believers who believe in Jesus Christ. The Roman Pope is the spiritual leader revered by 400 million Catholics worldwide. Although various Protestant denominations have different attitudes towards the Roman Pope, given the large number of Catholic believers and the length of history, it would be no exaggeration to say that the Roman Pope is, in fact, the highest leader of Christianity today. Because he is the most exalted leader within Christianity, his every word and deed are of concern to the world, and now even we in China should not ignore them.

Why? In the current world situation, we can clearly see the struggle between Christ and anti-Christ. When we discussed the glorious beginning of constitutionalism the day before yesterday, we said: weighing the overall world situation, if the world is truly divided, this division will definitely not be between East and West, but will be between the Christian world and the anti-Christian world. The forces against Christianity may be able to dominate for a time, but the result will inevitably be failure. The reason is that the forces of Christianity represent democracy, while the forces against Christianity symbolize totalitarianism. In such a world situation, under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, we can already see the direction in which we should move forward in the future. What is this direction? It is to move towards the Christian world, that is, to move towards democracy and freedom, and to oppose totalitarian autocracy. In Chairman Chiang's address to the people of the whole country on the eve of the implementation of the constitution, he clearly pointed out: "The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to universally grant to our compatriots the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, individual dignity and freedom." The implementation of this constitution with Christian doctrine components, and "the year 1947 of the Republic of China, which is the year 1947 of the birth of Jesus, will be the day when the unified, independent, equal, and free new opportunities of our Republic of China and all its people begin." It can be seen that from now on, our country's democratic constitutionalism will be deeply connected with Christianity, which represents the forces of democracy. Only in this way, we should always pay attention to the trends in the Christian world, and not be complacent and refuse to make progress.

Therefore, we are particularly excited to read Pope Pius XII's broadcast, and what comforts us most is the Pope's concern for China. He said: "Europe and the whole world, including distant and wounded China, are further away than before from true peace, complete and certain restoration, and a new order based on the agreement of public opinion. Those who deny and create division are confident that their days are getting closer and closer, while the friends of peace, the promoters of lasting harmony, comparing the spirit of Christ with the difficult situation of today's world far from the spirit of Christ, cannot help but feel deeply saddened. However, the true strength of Christ knows the meaning of the era in which we live better than anyone else. In today's competition between two major forces for the position of master of the world, hatred has a greater attraction for mankind, and all symbols seem to be heading towards division, but the true love of mankind can complete the unity of the world. We hereby issue our heartfelt appeal to those who believe in the true God and peace in the world." The Pope also quoted the famous line from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, re-proposing "To follow Christ or to oppose Christ? That is the question." As we said, the current world situation can be said to be a struggle between Christ and anti-Christ, a struggle between benevolence and hatred, and a struggle between democracy and totalitarianism. At this time, the Pope's re-mention of "To follow Christ or to oppose Christ?" adds a fresh meaning, which is "To follow democracy or to follow totalitarianism?" The root cause of the current world's disturbances and the competition between the two major powers of the United States and the Soviet Union is probably due to this question. Where to go, the Chinese people should be able to judge for themselves!

From the Pope's address, we can see that the ideal of Christianity, moderation and peace, coincides with the Three Principles of the People, which are the foundation of our nation. The true love that the Pope speaks of is our benevolence. Only based on benevolence can the world be united, and "the world as one family" and the ideal of world harmony that we possess can be realized. Hatred may have a greater attraction for mankind, but benevolence will eventually overcome hatred. We take the Three Principles of the People based on benevolence as the highest guiding principle for our nation-building. We are willing to use our strength to devote ourselves to the reconstruction of world peace and order, and at the same time, we hope that Christian countries based on benevolence can have a deeper understanding of the difficulties we are currently facing, and can provide sympathetic assistance in our efforts to quell the rebellion and build the country. If the democratic forces of the world can unite in this way, they will surely be able to prevent the reincarnation of totalitarian forces, and the reconstruction of world peace and order can naturally be expected to be achieved in the shortest possible time. We must overcome hatred with benevolence and overcome totalitarianism with democracy.

### The Executive Yuan and the United Relief Agency Announce Their Closure - The Two Directors Report on Two Years of Work

[Our Newspaper Report] The Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Huo Baoshu, and the Director of the UNRRA China Office, Cleveland, jointly held their last press conference yesterday before the closure of the two agencies. They delivered speeches on the spot, announcing the closure of the two agencies and briefly reporting on the main work in the past two years. After the two directors finished their speeches, Director Huo also answered various questions from reporters.

Regarding the distribution of fishing boats by the Fisheries Administration, Director Huo stated that the fishing vessels of the administration have complex equipment and must be used by trained personnel. There are currently a total of 128 ships of various sizes. The general policy of the government is to resell about 60 of them to private fishing companies, but they will not be concentrated in Shanghai. The detailed sales plan will be announced soon. The conditions are quite favorable, with installment payments and a long repayment period. Some of the ships are temporarily kept by the Fisheries Administration because other equipment has not been completed.

Also, the Executive Yuan's Air Transport Brigade will also be closed at the same time as the Executive Yuan, as agreed. However, this brigade has made great contributions to our government and export commodities, and there is a real need for it to continue to exist, so it is currently in contact with the Ministry of Communications. After the closure of the two agencies, the Post-War Affairs Committee will continue to handle fisheries recovery, rural industry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, agricultural machinery and other tasks and various materials. The committee is scheduled for two years.

Regarding past administrative errors and corruption incidents, Huo frankly admitted that the management and system aspects were not thorough, but said: According to the cases handled by the Investigation Department of this agency, it only accounts for 3/1000 of the total number of more than 20,000 employees. Comparatively speaking, it should not be considered too great an error.

Director Cleveland of UNRRA said in his speech that the UNRRA China Office is about to officially close, and this experiment in promoting international cooperation has also come to an end.

About 100,000 tons of UNRRA materials have not yet been completed, including locomotives from Australia and British equipment. At the request of the Chinese government, this office has retained a number of technical personnel to take care of the work, and five foreign personnel have joined the Management Committee. In addition, a special gift of US$5 million was given as foreign exchange expenses to continue the association's program. I plan to stay in China for another month and return home after transferring my duties to the Management Committee.

It is learned that Director Huo has decided to take the post of Director of the Import and Export Management Committee after the closure of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has been approved by the Executive Yuan to close at the end of the year.

Mr. Rao is now eagerly hoping that archaeologists at home and abroad will cooperate to continue the excavation.

### Grain Prices Are Rising All Around

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 26th] The selling price of white rice in Suzhou today has risen to 1.1 million yuan, setting a new record.

### The Siam Rice Mill Monopoly Plan - Will Be Appropriately Adjusted - Siam's Premier Tells Reporters

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 26th] Siam's Prime Minister Nai Khuang Aphaiwong, in view of the general dissatisfaction caused by the Siamese government's announcement of the rice mill monopoly, and the actual difficulties encountered by the Siamese Rice Company in implementing this plan, met with several Chinese reporters on Christmas Day and said that the plan would be adjusted, including the weekly rotation of rice to supply the Siamese Rice Company and other private rice mills. If the effect is good after the adjustment, the Siamese government may abolish the rice control plan that is currently in effect. Qualified observers and experienced rice merchants in our country also believe that "the weekly rotation method will inevitably have many technical problems," because if this method is honestly implemented, the monopoly plans of several powerful groups will completely fail.

### The Directorate General of Telecommunications Holds - Telecommunications Technology Competition

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The 28th of this month is the first Telecommunications Memorial Day in our country. The Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications has specifically held a telecommunications technology competition in Nanjing on this day, with items such as sending and receiving telegrams and telephone switching. The participants in the competition are all outstanding technicians selected from various places. In addition, the bureau hosted reporters on the evening of the 26th to report on the development of the telecommunications industry in our country. The Deputy Director of the Bureau, Qian Qishen, presided over the meeting and briefly stated: Our telecommunications industry has a history of 66 years, which can be divided into four periods. The first is the founding period, from the seventh year of Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. The second is the expansion period, from the establishment of the National Government to the beginning of the War of Resistance. The third is the period of resistance and construction, which is the situation during the eight years of the War of Resistance. The fourth is the period of revival, which refers to the situation after the victory of the War of Resistance and the return to peace. The bureau has formulated a five-year plan for post-war telecommunications construction, the main points of which are that domestic communications are mainly based on wired telegraphs, supplemented by wireless telegraphs, and international communications are mainly based on wireless telegraphs. The construction of the domestic communication network will divide the country into several regions, select a key point in each region as the regional center bureau, and select several key points in each region to establish external regional center bureaus, etc., to establish a national communication network. According to this plan, a total of about 350,000 pairs of kilometers of telegraph and telephone lines, 467,000 telephones in cities, and about 240,000 tons of foreign materials are needed, along with other equipment. More than 90,000 staff are needed, but now due to banditry and military needs, everything cannot be implemented as scheduled, and materials are difficult to obtain, so it is difficult to realize for a while.

### Our Trade Delegation to Japan - Can Arrive in Tokyo in the Middle of Next Month

### Liu Zhi Talks About His Impressions of Visiting Taiwan - Customs, Habits, and Human Feelings Are No Different From Those in the Mainland - All Circles Unanimously Condemn International Conspirators

[Our Newspaper Report] General Liu Zhi was invited by Chairman Wei Daoming at the beginning of the month to visit Taiwan for more than half a month. He flew from Taiwan to Shanghai by plane a few days ago. Yesterday, reporters went to pay their respects and asked about his impressions of visiting Taiwan. He said: Taiwan is an inherent territory of China. Recently, a few international conspirators have attempted to separate Taiwan from China and arrogantly advocated so-called "self-determination" and "trusteeship." The local public opinion organs and the press in Taiwan Province have all sternly refuted and unanimously criticized them. Based on my on-the-spot observations in Taiwan this time, Taiwan's customs, habits, and human feelings are no different from those in the mainland provinces. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for 51 years and did not achieve the goal of assimilating the Taiwanese people. Most of the Taiwanese people migrated from Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and there are also those who migrated from various provinces in the mainland. For example, in the former Qing Dynasty, thousands of people migrated from Jiangxi. They engaged in various handicrafts in Taiwan. The Japanese ruled Taiwan and adopted a purely colonial policy to establish a base for advancing south and fulfilling their aggressive ambitions. Therefore, the Taiwanese people were treated unequally in politics, education, and economics. All senior government officials were Japanese, and they implemented enslavement in education. The Taiwanese people had few opportunities to receive higher education. For example, out of 3,000 students at Taiwan University, only one-tenth were Taiwanese. In the economy, they squeezed raw materials as much as possible. 70% of the land was taken over by the government and rented to farmers through the hands of local tyrants. After the farmers worked hard to cultivate the land, they had to pay 75% to the government and keep 25% for themselves. After the restoration, it became inversely proportional, so the farmers' lives have been greatly improved. The Taiwanese people were in a state of slavery during the Japanese rule. Now, people's opinion organs at all levels of provinces, cities, and counties have been generally established, and the provincial government can also respect public opinion and strive for good governance. During my stay in Taiwan, I went to Keelung in the far north and Eluanbi in the far south, and visited the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant, the Alishan Logging Area, the Chianan Irrigation Project, the mines, sugar factories, lead factories, oil refineries, and cement factories. I felt that all the constructions were quite grand and arduous, which could not be achieved by the provinces in the mainland. Earthquakes, typhoons, rainstorms, and others are known as the five disasters of Taiwan, but they can still achieve this result, which shows that human effort can overcome nature. According to the Director of the Construction Department, if they use one point of strength in other places for construction, they must use eight points in Taiwan, which shows that if the provinces in the mainland can concentrate their efforts and focus on construction, the results will definitely surpass those in Taiwan Province. During my stay in Taiwan, I was invited to participate in the second anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Chiayi Municipal Government and unveiled the memorial monument to the late Chairman Lin. The late Chairman Lin served as an official in the area in his youth, and the people of Chiayi specially built a monument to commemorate him to show their remembrance.

### Tokyo International Tribunal Packed, War Criminal Tojo on Trial, US Lawyer Reads 60,000-Word Defense, Claiming Japan Acted in Self-Defense

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo appeared at the Far East International Military Tribunal on the afternoon of the 20th for his defense. The audience was exceptionally large, but military police forbade standing for security reasons. At the opening of the court, Tojo's defense lawyer Kiyose delivered an address, calling Tojo a strict disciplinarian who faithfully followed the Emperor's will. He claimed Japan was provoked by the United Nations and fought for self-defense and survival. Tojo would not evade political or administrative responsibility for any actions. The defendant then stepped into the witness box, and his 60,000-word statement was read by his American lawyer, Blakeney. Tojo attempted suicide with a pistol after Japan's surrender but failed and has now fully recovered. He appeared in court in military uniform but without insignia.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 26th] The Tokyo International Military Tribunal concluded its interrogation of former Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo at 3:00 PM on the 26th. From 3:15 PM, the interrogation of former Prime Minister Tojo, who is attracting worldwide attention, began. Anticipating Tojo's interrogation, the audience began arriving in the morning, causing the courtroom to be crowded with almost no space to stand. Former Prime Minister Tojo, without his general's insignia or waist sword, stood in the defendant's seat wearing a light yellow military uniform. News photographers vied to capture this historical moment, with flashes of magnesium lighting creating a grand spectacle. During this time, the sound of Tojo reading his written testimony was constant. The main points of his written testimony totaled seven: Japan did not plan or prepare for war against the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands; the war against the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands was caused by their provocations, and Japan started it out of necessity for self-preservation and self-esteem; the Japanese government completed the procedures with thorough good faith to deliver a legal declaration of war to the United States before initiating the attack; the true meaning of the Greater East Asia was not aggression; there was no such thing as a military clique; the independence of the supreme command and the operation of the Liaison Conference and the Imperial Conference; Tojo's so-called specialty in military administration lay in control and discipline.

### Tojo Accuses Britain and the United States of Aiding China During the War, Making it Impossible for Japan to Resolve the "China Incident"

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th] Former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, the first Japanese war crime suspect, stated that the United States succeeded in its scheme to force Japan into war in the Pacific. Reports from Japanese intelligence personnel before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor indicated that Britain and the United States were determined to wage war against Japan, forcing Japan to take decisive action.

As Tojo stepped from the war criminal's dock to the witness stand, a confident smile was visible on his gaunt face. The International Tribunal was packed today, as curious spectators wished to see the once powerful Japanese dictator and hear his defense. The reporters' seats, usually half-empty, were also full. The Tojo Cabinet is accused of responsibility for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Tojo denied that the bombing of Pearl Harbor was a premeditated surprise attack. He stated: It is unbelievable to say that Japan deliberately delayed the declaration of war by ambiguous means, thereby enabling this surprise attack to succeed. The facts of the war prove that the United States had prior knowledge of our attack and was prepared. Delaying the declaration of war had no special effect. He also said that Britain and the United States aided the Chinese government, making it impossible for Japan to resolve the "China Incident," and that since Britain and the United States had applied economic pressure on Japan, Japan had no choice but to exercise its absolute right of self-defense to break down the obstacles surrounding Japan. The Japanese government's use of force was out of the need for self-preservation and self-defense, which goes without saying.

### Japan Wanted to Use Soviet Aid to Continue the War with the Allies - A Secret Revealed by Togo at the Time

[Reuters Athens, 25th] After Greek guerrillas declared the establishment of a provisional government yesterday, nearly 500 communists have been arrested by the authorities in Athens and its suburbs.

[Reuters Belgrade, 26th] Markos Vafiades, commander-in-chief of the Greek guerrillas and prime minister of the provisional democratic government, gave a radio address on the 26th, stating that the main goal of the provisional government is to liberate Greek democrats from the shackles of foreign imperialists and their lackeys. The new government will govern the liberated areas according to democratic principles. The provisional government will establish friendly relations with all countries that support the purposes of the United Nations, and will pay particular attention to the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union.

### British Christmas Gift - Trade Agreements to Be Signed Separately with Various Countries

### Earth-Penetrating Bombs Destroy Underground Defense Works - Successful Testing by US Military in Germany

[United Press Washington, 25th] US Air Force personnel revealed today that they had invented a method of bombing underground defense works during three months of testing in Germany. The US military used 25,000-pound bombs, dropped from high altitude, on German submarine factories near the port of Bremen, bombing the crust and reinforced concrete. The results were completely satisfactory, and the accuracy was better than expected. The German submarine factory had a roof of up to 24 feet thick. More than 40 of the giant bombs and some 100-pound small bombs were used in the test. The giant bombs included 30 "Amazon" and "Samson" 25,000-pound bombs. All the bombs used were not filled with explosives, only to determine their penetration and the strength of the bomb casing. If explosives were loaded, it would endanger nearby residents. Earth-penetrating bombs can generally be loaded with atomic explosives.

### Key Points of Tojo's Defense Statement

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] The main points of Tojo's statement are as follows: "I never expected that the war I waged would be denounced by the victorious countries as an international crime, and that the legal officials of the defeated country would be individually regarded as criminals. As Prime Minister, I believe that there is no escape from guilt, and I am sincerely willing to accept all responsibilities in that regard." Tojo consistently attempted to exonerate the Emperor from responsibility for the war: "There should be no misunderstanding about the true position of the Emperor. In fact, all responsibilities should be borne by the Cabinet and the responsible officers of the General Headquarters." Regarding the failure to warn the United States before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the statement said: The Emperor "repeatedly instructed me and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy to issue a warning before the attack. The Emperor's will was conveyed to the Liaison Conference. I believe in my conscience that the notification of the declaration of war was always transmitted to the United States in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We naturally trusted our diplomatic officials in carrying out such an important matter." Regarding the execution of American and Allied pilots, Tojo admitted to enacting laws concerning prisoners of war, but argued that Japan never ratified the Geneva Convention. "Japan's concept of prisoners of war is different from that of Europe and the United States." Tojo also accused American pilots of violating international law as a justification for Japan's passage of the Prisoner of War Disciplinary Act in 1943: "On April 18, 1942, the pilots led by Doolittle violated international law and regulations and committed atrocities in the Tokyo area, because attacking civilians is a crime under recognized international law." Tojo said that as Minister of the Army, he reduced the death sentences of five of the eight American airmen sentenced to death for bombing Japan. Tojo denied delaying the presentation of US President Roosevelt's last-minute letter to the Emperor. He claimed that when he first heard of the letter, the planes on the mobile task force had already taken off. "Intentionally delaying a letter from the head of state to the Emperor is tantamount to offending the Emperor, and no one in Japan would dare to do this." Tojo described his surprise and hesitation when he first received the order to form a cabinet, but then defended Japan's position, claiming that the "encirclement" of Japan by the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands made it impossible to resolve the "China Incident." Tojo attempted to shift the responsibility for the Tripartite Pact to the late Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, and claimed that Japan's subsequent national policy was not affected by the Pact, especially since Japan was deceived by the superficial amity between Germany and the Soviet Union when negotiating the Pact. Matsuoka later signed a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, but it also lacked practical benefits. Subsequently, after obtaining guarantees of territorial expansion, the Soviet Union agreed to and advanced on Japan while the neutrality treaty was still in effect. Tojo said that Matsuoka's trip to Berlin when negotiating the Tripartite Pact fostered a political prejudice that was indifferent to efforts to seek compromise with the United States. The successive resignations of the Konoe Second Cabinet were also due to Matsuoka's attitude, hoping to oust Matsuoka so that negotiations with the United States and the Allied countries could be completed smoothly. Tojo also said: "The rapid resolution of the China Incident required cutting off cooperation between Chongqing and Great Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in the South. The three countries actively prepared for war in the South, completed the encirclement of Japan, and US senior officials repeatedly made provocative remarks and actions. The strengthening of economic pressure, the obstruction of our access to essential supplies, and the attempts of Great Britain and the United States to unite Vietnam and Thailand all demonstrated hostile actions. After the breakdown of commercial negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, the encirclement was completed." The freezing of Japanese assets in the United States and the British and Dutch having "the closest ties" drove Japanese commerce toward destruction. "We are competing against the two largest countries in the world. The hope of victory is obviously slim, but Japan had no choice but to advance in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, defend important strategic strongholds, occupy areas for military purposes, and do its best to repel enemy attacks. However, the Supreme Command and the Japanese government had no war plans against specific enemies. Our purpose was to prevent war, not to prepare for war." Tojo strongly refuted the notion that the Emperor approved the war, "On November 2, 1941, when the Emperor received two decisive plans, I saw in his expression the grief caused by his love of peace. When listening to our plan, the Emperor was solemn and thoughtful, and then regretted it. 'If we cannot break the deadlock, is there no other way but to fight Great Britain and the United States against our will! I hope you will do your best to overcome the difficulties in the negotiations.'" Tojo said that he "shared the Emperor's anxiety" and had done his best to maintain peace.

### Two Supervisory Commissioners Elected in This City, Tao Baichuan and Yang Hu Elected, More Than Two Hundred City Councilors Solemnly Cast Their Votes, Many Coming Despite Illness or Returning from Afar

(Reported by this newspaper) The election of Supervisory Commissioners by the City Council was completed yesterday afternoon. At 6:00 PM that evening, the election supervisor, Mayor Wu, unsealed the ballots and counted them in public. As a result, Tao Baichuan (78 votes) and Yang Hu (68 votes) were elected. Another candidate, Councilor Jin Longzhang of the Democratic Socialist Party, received 51 votes. Councilor Jiang Hao, although he had formally announced his withdrawal from the election, still received three votes. In addition, there were four invalid ballots.

Yesterday, a total of 204 city councilors from various parties in this city went to the City Council on Tanggu Road to vote for the Supervisory Commissioners. The other thirteen councilors were unable to attend due to illness or being out of Shanghai. Mr. Du Yuesheng personally went to the meeting yesterday afternoon, but because the voting booth was located on the third floor of the Council, and Mr. Du's health was not good, with a very high fever, and he could not stand, he was helped by his car to the front of the Council, where voting supervisor Jiang Huaisu waited in front of the car for him to circle his choices, stamp the ballot, and take the ballot. Youth Party Councilor Li Fadao flew back to Shanghai from Guam specifically to vote. Yang Minghui, Mao Jiaju, and Jiang Jizhou also rushed back from Taiwan to vote. Wang Zhuyi was originally nominated as a voting supervisor, but because he was ill and could not stay long, he still voted despite his illness. In addition, Gu Baoyu and Deng Chuankai rushed back from Nanjing, and Cao Ziyan returned to Shanghai from Suzhou, all of which are sufficient to show the enthusiasm and importance attached to the election of Supervisory Commissioners by individual councilors. Furthermore, Xu Shihao was originally scheduled to go to the United States on the 24th, but the departure date was changed to the 26th, and the election was also changed from the 24th to the 26th, so he was able to catch up.

The thirteen councilors who did not vote were Ye Fenghu (in Wenzhou), Wang Zhengting (in Qingdao), Shi Bangfan (in Beiping), Cheng Junguan (in Changzhou), Zhuang Heqi and Cao Jun (in Nanjing), Quan Daoyun (in Hefei), Shen Chunhui, Wu Qiding (sick), Sun Yunjun, Ding Shanming, Zhang Yuliang, and Bao Wenxin (all not in Shanghai).

Voting ended at 5:00 PM. Mayor Wu arrived at the meeting at 5:50 PM. Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Bureau, as well as councilors from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, also arrived successively to observe the counting of ballots. Councilor Tian Shujun and Ms. Yang Hu, daughter of Yang Hu, had arrived early to wait for the counting of ballots. The mood on all sides was quite enthusiastic. During the counting of ballots, in addition to Mayor Wu, Qun Yue, Xu Yongzuo, and Shui Xiangyun served as supervisors. The method of counting ballots involved calling out the votes and marking "正" (zheng, meaning "correct") characters. After the results were announced, Secretary-General Xiang broadcast the results of the ballot counting, and Mayor Wu officially announced the names of the elected Supervisory Commissioners. It is also understood that there are no alternate positions for Supervisory Commissioners.

### Mrs. Speaker Pan Broadcasts to Raise Funds for Winter Clothing

Mrs. Tang Guanyu Pan, the wife of Speaker Pan, was invited by the Shanghai Women's Association to broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station at 7:00 PM yesterday afternoon, calling on women's circles throughout the city to step up fundraising for winter clothing and cash for winter relief. The following is a transcript of her broadcast speech:

Fellow compatriots: The weather is getting colder day by day. As the end of the year approaches and the new year is approaching, the number of refugees on the streets crying out in hunger and cold is also increasing day by day. They come from northern Jiangsu, Anhui, or Shandong. Their hometowns have been harassed and destroyed by the Communist bandits, their fields are barren, and their houses are damaged. Their properties and their jobs have been completely lost, and they have become a group of unemployed people waiting for rescue!

This large group of refugees are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and are also citizens of the Republic of China. But while people are celebrating Christmas and the New Year, they have no clothes or food, and they do not know what tomorrow will bring. They are all our compatriots, and they themselves are innocent, but because of the insane Communist bandits who are wandering around and causing chaos, they have suffered indescribable disasters and can no longer live in the bandit areas. At the same time, they are unwilling to obey the Communists' arrangements, so they have to leave their homes and families, and travel thousands of miles to the big city of Shanghai to struggle to survive. Fellow compatriots in Shanghai! Although we also feel that prices are rising and life is difficult, we can still勉强 (miǎn qiǎng, barely, manage to) make a living; moreover, there are still many wealthy families and philanthropists in Shanghai who will sympathize with these thousands of refugees and extend a warm hand to help them.

Therefore, the Shanghai Women's Association has launched, under the call of the Winter Relief Association, to expand our campaign to solicit winter clothing. We are all determined to call on all the ladies and misses in Shanghai in this very short period of time to quickly check the extra cotton clothes and quilts, or other clothes that can keep out the cold, in their own homes, and donate them to Room 320, 3rd Floor, Pudong Native Association, or Shanghai Women's Association at 580 Nanjing West Road, so that they can be sewn and distributed to the refugees in various shelters in batches, so that they can勉强 (miǎn qiǎng, barely, manage to) survive the severe winter. If there are no old clothes or pants, we hope that you will donate cash as much as possible and send it to the Shanghai Women's Association. We will naturally immediately make cotton clothes on your behalf and distribute them to the refugees, for the benefit of all sisters.

Fellow compatriots, we Chinese people have always emphasized doing good deeds. The so-called "A family that accumulates virtue will surely have surplus blessings" and "Helping others is the source of happiness" all explain that helping others and helping those in need will definitely bring unparalleled comfort and the children and grandchildren can get great virtue. And in Shanghai, acts of charity and disaster relief have always stood at the forefront of the whole country. Sisters, seeing these many refugees who are shivering in the cold wind, with insufficient clothes to cover themselves and not enough food to eat, especially the plight of women and children, they must all feel unbearable to stand by and let them freeze to death and starve to death. Sincerely hope that you will show your human compassion and actively donate winter clothing or cash, and extend your warm hands to help those refugees who have been persecuted by the Communists and have no home to belong to. "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda!" I am broadcasting this, and I wish all the sisters who are happy to do good deeds!

### ·Chennault's Wedding· The President and Mrs. Chiang Send Gifts

### Another Communist Bandit Supply Organization Smashed, More Than Ten Key Criminals Sent to Nantong for Interrogation

(Central News Agency) Peng Jiyun's Nantong Fisherman Self-Defense Force seized a bandit transport ship on the 7th of this month in the waters off Lusi Port, confiscating twenty-eight reams of heavy-weight drawing paper used for mapmaking and currency printing, and one hundred and sixty dozen dry batteries. Upon inspecting the identity of the escorts, it was learned that the materials were to be handed over to Zhang Weiqing (alias Chen Yongfu), the general manager of the Jianghai Trading Company of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist bandits in Central China. They were transferred to the military district authorities and confessed that the drawing paper and dry batteries were exchanged for public cotton allocated by the military subdistrict and sold in Shanghai, the person in charge of the transaction was a certain manager of a certain flower shop in Shanghai, and the person responsible was someone from a certain place. The First District Pacification Command dispatched Ji Zhongpeng, a senior colonel section chief from the Second Department, and Zhu Chongwen, a group leader, along with investigators, to Shanghai to investigate. Later, Jiang Huamin, director of the Dead Second Department, was also ordered to come to Shanghai to plan and direct. After Ji Yuchang first consulted with Tao Yishan, director of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, the No. 6 Water Patrol Team of the department was temporarily used as an office. Captain Feng Zhong of the brigade designated a batch of cadres to assist and complete the deployment. Actions began on the night of the 17th of this month. During the day, more than ten key criminals, including those involved in bandit activities and important merchants, were placed under house arrest. Among the documents seized were two large lists of hundreds of military supplies purchased by the bandits; a portrait of Mao Zedong, and two editions of the bandit's Xinhua Daily newspaper, as well as a large batch of propaganda promoting student unrest. More than two hundred large and small packages of "public cotton" transported from bandit areas, and part of the proceeds, were seized. Director Jiang has sent the related criminals, transcripts of their confessions, and the spoils to the Nantong Headquarters for interrogation and then reported to the Ministry of National Defense for verification.

### Disregarding Life, Female Police Officer Commits Suicide: Returning from Dancing at Midnight, Taking Poison in Despair, Leaving a Suicide Note without Revealing the Cause

(Report from this newspaper) Zhu Xiuhua (pictured), an undercover female police officer in the Criminal Police Team of the Two Roads Bureau Police Department, suddenly committed suicide by taking Lysol in her dormitory yesterday morning. The cause of her suicide is under investigation. Zhu was 21 years old, from Hangzhou, quite attractive, good at socializing, and had received secondary education. She was usually devoted to her duties and highly valued by her superiors. She was amiable to people, and her colleagues enjoyed being around her. She had a reputation as the "flower of the criminal police." Yesterday, all her colleagues were saddened by this terrible news.

### Veteran of American Aviation, Colonel Lindbergh Arrives in Shanghai, Representing Pan American Airways to Inspect Far East Facilities

(Report from this newspaper) The famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh arrived in Shanghai yesterday noon on a Pan American Airways passenger plane from Hong Kong and checked into the Hua Mao Hotel. Lindbergh is a veteran of the American aviation industry and the first person in aviation history to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. More than ten years ago, he piloted a plane for Pan American Airways to test fly the Pacific Ocean and open up the Far East route, a great contribution.

It is reported that this trip is to inspect the equipment of Pan American Airways stations in the Far East region and will soon go to Tokyo.

### Movie Theater Industry Firmly Refuses Auditing, Decides to Automatically Adjust Ticket Prices, Association Official Says Date Around New Year's Day

(Report from this newspaper) Movie theater merchants gathered yesterday to exchange opinions on the issue of movie ticket price increases. According to the association official, since the adjustment of movie ticket prices on September 6, prices have risen again and again, and various expenses are huge, making it impossible to maintain operations. The prices of Peking Opera theaters in this city have been automatically adjusted again and again, and the highest ticket price is now 160,000, about 80,000 times the pre-war price. The prices of other local operas are also more than 50,000 times the pre-war price. However, the current highest ticket price for movie theaters is 25,000 yuan, which is still 12,500 times the pre-war price, and each ticket price adjustment must be approved before it can be implemented, unlike other theaters that can automatically adjust prices as needed. The previous opposition to adding a 20% winter relief donation to the ticket price was because it violated the entertainment tax law. This time, each movie theater requested to adjust the price by one time from December 15, and the Social Affairs Bureau is still reviewing it and has stated that it needs to submit business accounts for verification to confirm a loss before it can approve the price increase. The industry believes that there is no case of operating for personal gain or committing fraud, and there is no basis for this audit, so it firmly refuses. The association official also stated that the increase in movie ticket prices is now no longer "a battle that must be fought for" but "a battle that must be fought." Each movie theater will implement automatic adjustments, and the date should be around New Year's Day. Each theater will "willingly accept punishment" for this move. The industry will convene a general meeting of all members in the next few days to make a formal decision on this matter.

### Electrical Engineering Society Tea Party Welcomes Lu Zongcheng

### Shen Siliang Released from Prison

Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for treason years ago. He has now served his sentence and was released from prison at nine o'clock yesterday morning. However, Shen Siliang's appeal to the Supreme Court against the sentence has not yet been answered.

Suicide… The Night Before

On Christmas Day the day before yesterday, Miss Zhu was exceptionally excited, purchasing a large batch of candies to distribute to her colleagues. Yesterday afternoon, she invited friends to have dinner together and personally cooked the dishes. After the meal, they went to a dance hall together and chatted and laughed as usual, only jokingly telling her friends in the dance hall, "Let's have fun together here tonight. Tomorrow I will be leaving." When asked where she was going, she said, "To heaven." Everyone thought she was going to Hangzhou to see her mother because her home was there, so they didn't investigate further. It wasn't until midnight that her friends sent her back to her dormitory. Another colleague, Pan Yiping, who shared a room with Zhu, happened to have taken leave to go to Nanjing the day before, giving Zhu a chance to commit suicide at her leisure.

Discovery… Too Late

It wasn't until around six o'clock yesterday morning that Pan returned from Nanjing and saw that the dormitory door was tightly closed. She pulled it open, but it wasn't locked. As soon as Pan entered the room, she smelled a strong Lysol odor. Zhu, seeing Pan enter, suddenly jumped up from the bed, rushed out the door, and began to vomit. Seeing this, Pan knew something was wrong and discovered an empty Lysol bottle on the table. She shouted for her colleagues in the next room. After a flurry of activity, she was rushed to the Railway Hospital. Although she received emergency treatment such as gastric lavage, the poisoning was too severe, and there was no hope of recovery. She died at 7:48.

Suicide Note… To a Colleague

It was later learned that Zhu's intention to commit suicide had been decided as early as two weeks prior. In her suicide note to her colleague Li Bingjie, she said, "I wanted to die a few weeks ago. Life is no longer worth living for me. I borrowed a handgun from a colleague two weeks ago" (note: undercover female police officers do not have guns). A photo was attached to the suicide note, and it also said, "You are my best friend. Since you got married, we have been distant. This is due to the environment. This is a photo for you to keep as a permanent memento." At the end, she wrote "Why am I" and "I am so miserable" three times. The full text of the suicide note was about two thousand words long. All her diary entries and correspondence had been burned before the suicide. She had also clearly marked in advance which of her belongings were to be given to her colleagues and which to her aunt.

Reason… Speculation

After the case occurred, the police department telegraphed Wuxi to summon Zhu's friend Li Bingjie to Shanghai for questioning. Li arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. According to Li, Zhu had a fiancé named Bai Shui, who is currently working in the 17th Traffic Police Detachment in the Northeast. He and Zhu were not on good terms. Recently, a friend of Bai, Zhang Yunkang, who is an air force pilot, came to Shanghai to visit Zhu and repeatedly invited her out, showing a strong intention to pursue her. However, Zhu had no affection for him. Zhang was resentful because he couldn't win her over, and he slandered her to Bai, sowing discord. This also gave Zhu a major shock. Zhu's family was also very complicated, and she was not tolerated by her father, so the reason for her suicide must not be simple.

### Mistress Resumes Prostitution, Paramour Wants to Die Together

(Report from this newspaper) Pan Xiaomei, a prostitute in the Hong Ji brothel at No. 5 Yin Yu Lane, Liulin Road, lived with Zhu Yongci, a flour factory employee, two years ago. Later, Zhu lost his job, and they could not maintain their livelihood, so Pan resumed her old profession. On the 16th of this month, Zhu went to the brothel, hoping to see Pan, but she was not there. Zhu then committed suicide by taking poison, but fortunately, he was rushed to the hospital and saved. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Zhu took a bottle of disinfectant to the brothel and falsely told Pan that they were going to a lawyer's office on Taicang Road to discuss ending their cohabitation relationship. When they reached the west end of Xing'an Road and Huangpi South Road, Zhu pulled out the disinfectant and poured it on Pan's face, injuring her eyes. Zhu also swallowed disinfectant and committed suicide. The police arrived and sent both of them to the hospital.

### Shanghai Writers Association Year-End Meeting to Be Held at Police and Community Center Tomorrow Afternoon

### Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha Returns to Qinghai to Visit Relatives, Stops Over in Shanghai

(Report from this newspaper) Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha, the elder brother of the Dalai Living Buddha of Tibet, arrived in Shanghai yesterday noon on a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Calcutta. Also coming were the Tibetan National Government official Dan Jigme Norbu Living Buddha. Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha is returning to Qinghai to visit relatives.

He will also go to Beijing to represent the Dalai Lama in paying respects to President Chiang.

Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha is very young, only twenty-seven years old this year. He became a monk at Tar Temple in Qinghai at the age of seven, and went to Zhaba Temple, one of the three famous monasteries in Tibet, at the age of twenty to study Buddhist scriptures.

He had a fountain pen in his collar and a flat top haircut. He had a very handsome face, but otherwise, there was nothing special about him.

Tibetan Merchants… Found the Living Buddha

The current 14th Dalai Lama is his fourth younger brother. Their family is originally a Tibetan ethnic group from Yuhai, engaged in agriculture. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Tibetans searched everywhere for a replacement, but they had not found one after more than three years. In 1938, a group of Tibetan merchants came to their home and stayed overnight. In fact, this group of people were disguised to find the Living Buddha. The 14th Dalai Lama was only four years old at the time. After discovering him, they asked him, and his birthday perfectly matched. He also recognized the creations of the old Dalai Lama. Later, they escorted this young Dalai Lama to Lhasa to ascend the throne. He has been there for thirteen years now.

Second Younger Brother Studies… at the Central Military Academy

There are a total of five brothers in their family. The third and fifth younger brothers are still in Qinghai. The second younger brother is called Jia Rong. He is nineteen years old this year. Last year, he came to the East with the Tibetan National Assembly representative. Later, he entered the Central Military Academy to study. Now he speaks Mandarin very well. Yesterday, he came to Shanghai to welcome his brother. When reporters interviewed him, he translated. He wore an air force uniform and a leather jacket, looking completely like a modern urban youth, standing with his brother as if they were from two different eras.

Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha has a very high position in Tibetan religion, but he has no contact with politics. According to him, the current situation in Tibet is still stable. The British run a hospital in Lhasa, which is very popular. The Dalai Lama has recently given two lectures, which is a major event in Tibet.

### Municipal Government Tightens Staffing, Possibly Implemented Next Spring, Each Bureau and Department Cuts Staff by One-Tenth, Position of Deputy Bureau Chief Still Intended to Remain

(Report from this newspaper) The issue of municipal government staffing cuts was seriously discussed at yesterday's municipal meeting. The municipal government's organizational regulations approved by the Executive Yuan allowed all existing institutions to be established, but in terms of staffing, the total number of people applied for by the municipal government was 3,576, and the Executive Yuan ordered a reduction of one-third. After receiving the instruction, the municipal government ordered the heads of each bureau and department to study in detail and provide opinions separately. The personnel department collected and researched them together and decided to reduce the staffing of each bureau and department by an average of one-tenth, about 300 people, according to the authorized staffing. The deputy directors of each bureau are intended to remain in office because they are actually needed. As for other actual difficulties, such as the current four sections of the Public Works Bureau being cut to six sections in the new organizational regulations, and similar reductions in other bureaus, the municipal government believes that it is actually difficult to comply and has decided to maintain the status quo for the time being. The specific situation will be reported to the Executive Yuan. As for the staffing reduction standards that have already been decided, they will be based on their qualifications and usual work performance evaluation standards and may be implemented starting next spring.

### Three Industries Host Director of the Financial Administration, Hoping for Analysis of Current Ailments… Do Not Only Implement Negative Controls

(Report from this newspaper) The Silver, Money, and Trust Industry Association of this city held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Bank Club, inviting Li Lixia and Bi Delin, the director and deputy director of the Financial Administration of this city, and fifty or sixty directors and supervisors of the Three Industry Association. First, Li Fuxun, Shen Rixin, and Qi Zhi, the directors of the Three Industry Association, gave speeches, roughly saying that the purpose of financial control is to stabilize prices, which is necessary. However, the general public often blames financial practitioners for price fluctuations. In fact, today, each industry colleague has an average deposit of only a few hundred million yuan and has no ability to speculate. They deeply hope that the financial control authorities should analyze the current ailments and prescribe the right medicine, and not only implement negative controls, but also pay more attention to the development of the financial industry.

### Investing in Production: An Ideal Way Out

Then Director Li gave a speech, roughly stating that all industries currently need stability, especially the financial industry. The control authorities will actively resolve the current difficulties and not only engage in negative controls. Today, how the financial community can find ways to invest huge amounts of capital in productive enterprises is truly the most ideal way out. The establishment of the Financial Administration of this city has three characteristics: 1. Simple organization. 2. Simple and practical management methods. 3. The government takes the lead and manages national banking institutions even more strictly than commercial banks. The management authorities have long had a deep understanding of everyone's insights. The tea party dispersed at around 5:00 PM.

### "Social Butterfly" Leads to Embezzlement and Robbery, Boyfriend Conspires with Accomplices to Rob, Exposed and Arrested One After Another

(Report from this newspaper) "Social Butterfly" Wang Yuefen, whose original name is Zhou Fengzhen, lives at No. 21 Fuxi Lane, Xiangyang South Road, and frequents dance halls and theaters. She and her friend Shen Xingben have a deep affection. Shen often goes to her home and thus gets to know Wang's younger sister, Meili, and Di Yonggao. Over time, the younger siblings told him that Yuefen had $1,000 in US currency, and he had evil intentions. He then conspired with his friends Liang Zhenyue and Wang Yunian. He purchased a cotton rope and an empty coat box, agreeing that around 3:00 PM on the 27th, Shen would invite Wang to drink coffee at the Four Sisters Cafe. At that time, he would order Liang and Wang to enter the tea house under the pretext of giving a coat as a gift. Meili cordially welcomed them and went into the kitchen to make coffee. Seeing that the time was ripe, the two took out the cotton rope and first tied up her younger brother Yonggao on a chair and stuffed his mouth with cotton.

### Pilgrimage to Qufu: A Trip to Southwestern Shandong

[Special Dispatch from our Jinan Office, 23rd] Of the 107 counties in Shandong province, the Communist presence has been eradicated in two counties. One is Chang Le County, notoriously managed by Commissioner Zhang Tianzuo concurrently. The other is Qufu County, the "essence of sages and virtuous men."

Under the governance of County Magistrate Wang Zhenyu in Qufu for over a decade, even during the War of Resistance, he led the 230,000 people of the county in guerrilla warfare against the enemy. In late 1945, the Communist bandits amassed over 30,000 troops to attack. County Magistrate Wang led local forces in resistance. By New Year's Day 1946, they were ultimately defeated due to the disparity in numbers. County Magistrate Wang,

disguised in the darkness,

jumped from the city wall, managing to escape. On March 9, 1947, with the assistance of the National Army, after recovering the county seat, he earnestly organized the people, trained the people, guided the people, and controlled the people. He treated genuinely repentant and returning Communist members with leniency, implemented a policy of generosity, and strictly prohibited the people from taking revenge freely. On ordinary days, he spent almost two-thirds of his time traveling and inspecting the villages and townships, going deep among the people, and blending with them. He effectively eliminated corrupt officials and gentry, started anew with the people, shared their joys and sorrows. Thus, the Eighth Route Army could no longer find a foothold in the county, truly achieving "no thieves locally, so thieves do not come."

The old city of Qufu was originally located four or five li east of the city. It was moved to its current location during the Ming Dynasty, with a circumference of twelve li. The Confucius Temple occupies one-third of the area. Accompanied by County Magistrate Wang, I admired the Apricot Platform in the temple, the cypress planted by the Master, the Dacheng Hall, the Lu Wall, the Poetry and Ritual Hall, and other sacred sites. Then, I visited the Saintly Residence. Fortunately, Kong De-cheng, the Sacrificial Official of the Dacheng Zhi Sheng Xian Shi, was at home. During our conversation, I learned that he would

definitely go to America for inspection

before January 15th next year, for a period of eight months. All the procedures for going abroad have been completed. This return to his hometown is not for election campaigning but for a "family sacrifice." He has declined the government's nomination as a National Assembly representative candidate for Qufu County three times, but all requests were denied. Kong Decheng is a 77th-generation descendant of Confucius, currently about 30 years old, with a handsome appearance. He wore a fur robe and a fur hat. The Kong residence is a typical example of Chinese aristocratic architecture. Kong himself still retains a strong traditional aristocratic style. Inside the three-door main hall, the white-on-black wooden plaque of the "Chen Qi Chu" (Reception Office), responsible for communication, is still hung. Beyond the four-door entrance, there are wooden plaques for "Secretariat" and "General Affairs Office." Only the reception room opposite the Secretariat is a semi-Chinese, semi-Western building with white mud ceilings and floral ceramic tiles. Kong is a close friend of the veteran statesman Zhang Puquan, despite their age difference. When I told him that Elder Pu had passed away from angina pectoris on the 16th of this month, he expressed deep sorrow and regret and told me, "Elder Pu originally had heart disease. The

proximate cause of his sudden demise

may be related to the Shandong election issue. The reason is that when Mr. Ding Huaifen brought the list of Shandong National Assembly representative candidates to Beijing, several fellow villagers whose names were not on the list came to Beijing to lobby. Elder Pu, after discussing it with Mr. Ding, agreed to change a few names on the original list. This was heard by those who were removed from the list, who then went to Elder Pu to protest, saying: We in Shandong have elders of our own. You are an elder from Hebei Province. Please do not interfere in Shandong matters. Elder Pu then restored the preliminary list. Elder Pu's sudden death from angina pectoris may not be unrelated to this."

During their occupation of Qufu, the Eighth Route Army did not damage the Confucius Temple or the Confucius Forest outside the North Gate. They only plastered slogans on the red walls on both sides of the Confucius Forest. After the National Army recovered it, they washed and scraped off the slogans but did not repaint the walls. Therefore, at first glance, the walls appear very mottled, but this does not detract from the solemn grandeur of the Confucius Forest. Few outsiders know how much property the Confucius Temple actually has, but reliable sources say that there were originally over 6,000 hectares of land, extending east to the shores of the Yellow Sea, all being

Kong family temple property.

During the Eighth Route Army's occupation, some of it was struggled against by clansmen. It is now said to have been returned, but in counties outside the control of the National Army, rent has still not been collected. Kong Decheng was originally a posthumous child. After his father, Duke Yansheng Kong Lingyi, passed away, his uncle Kong Lingjun served as acting duke for eight years. However, clansmen, envious of this "vacant post," continuously accused and attacked Kong Lingjun for eight whole years. It was not until Kong Decheng officially took over that things calmed down. He now has one son and two daughters. The son is six and a half years old. This has always been a serious problem in old Chinese families, and hopefully, it will not be repeated in the Kong residence. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### Yang Yanbin Case: Suzhou High Procuratorate Indicts Yesterday

[Special Dispatch from our Suzhou Office, 26th] Yang Yanbin, who held false positions such as Chief of Staff of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and County Magistrate of Puppet Wuxi and Wujiang counties, was rumored after the victory to have gone to the Taihu Lake area, rallying over a thousand people and calling himself the "Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Army." It was later confirmed that this was a misreport. However, small groups of bandits entrenched in Taihu Lake were indeed former subordinates of Yang. The authorities then appointed Yang as a pacification commissioner to comfort the refugees. Amidst the suppression in Jiangnan, he temporarily became a news figure, and Yang's crimes as a traitor were spared prosecution. However, the Suzhou High Procuratorate recently received accusations that Yang arbitrarily killed people during his tenure in puppet positions. After investigation, the crimes were confirmed, and he was indicted today and transferred to the criminal court for trial according to law.

### Haining's Rising Sandbank Begins to Collapse

[Special Dispatch from our Haining Office, 25th] The rising sandbank at the seawall outside the South Gate of this county has lasted for almost a year. At its largest, the sandbank reached fifteen li and could be walked on to the opposite bank of the Qiantang River, causing sea transport to be cut off. The transit business has moved to the two warehouses, and the commerce in the urban area has become doubly desolate. According to the person in charge of the Hangzhou-Haining section of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, the rising sandbank has recently begun to collapse. As of now, only about three li remain. If the tide is slightly stronger, it will all be submerged. The famous "Haining Tide" will return to its former glory. However, seawall projects have already been emphasized by all parties. The vicissitudes of life are unpredictable.

### Senator Ou Humiliates Councilor Ma Qu to be Transferred

[Special Dispatch from our Haining Office, 25th] County Councilor and Director of the Press Association, Wu Jingya, had criticized the police station director's protection of gambling and neglect of public security at past council meetings. This incurred the hatred of Ma Qu, the director of the said police station, who on the 8th of this month, took advantage of Wu's presence at home, threatened him and humiliated him on the main street, causing public outrage. Representatives from Yanguan Town had petitioned the county government several times, almost leading to a town-wide strike. The county council and all its members also appealed to all sectors with justice. The County Press Association, the Press Friendship Association of the ten districts and the Press Associations of Jiaxing, Chongde and Pinghu counties sent telegrams of condolence and support for freedom of speech and personal freedom, vowing to provide support. County Councilor Wu Jingya also filed a lawsuit with the district court. The court opened a trial on the 13th of this month, but Ma Qu failed to appear in court. The County Council specially convened a temporary county administration review meeting on the 20th and resolved to request the county government to promptly dismiss Ma Qu and punish him severely.

After the incident, parties and government officials mediated. According to the county government's announcement today, three agreements have been reached: Ma Qu will be transferred and the position of director will be taken over by Zhu Bodi. Ma Qu will publish in the newspaper: "It is difficult to shirk responsibility, so I hereby publish an apology and respectfully apologize to the County Council." Also apologize in person. Councilor Wu withdraws his lawsuit from the District Court. However, it is heard that the press will file a complaint against Ma Qu again.

### Ministry of Education Emphasizes Normal School Education: Orders Promulgation of Improvement Measures for Elementary Normal Schools: Provinces Must Not Reduce Existing Schools Under Any Pretext

[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 26th] The Ministry of Education emphasizes normal school education and has recently issued improvement measures for elementary normal schools, with six key points, ordering their implementation: 1. Regarding the age of admission to elementary normal schools, a previous order had been issued to all provinces and cities to raise it to 15 years of age. Since some provinces and cities are still unclear, it is proposed to reiterate the previous order. 2. The original temporary duration of study at the school was four years. However, since the provinces needed teachers urgently, the number of schools offering a three-year system has increased. Now, provinces can still offer a four year program if teacher quantities are still insufficient. 3. Regarding the reduction in the number of schools due to the abandonment of rural towns, it is proposed to order all provinces to earnestly follow the provisions of the Second Five-Year Plan for National Education, and should expand the number of classes year by year, and shall not reduce the original schools under any pretext. 4. Provinces should give priority to employing elementary normal school graduates and teachers who have been trained and certified as qualified to serve as primary school teachers, and implement an internship system, training unqualified teachers in phases. 5. It is ordered to all provinces to earnestly improve the treatment of primary school teachers so that outstanding young people will enter normal schools and make excellent teachers feel at ease in their work, thereby promoting the early popularization of national education. 6. Provinces where elementary normal school graduates are sufficient for allocation may consider converting them into normal schools.

### American Educational Institutions Discriminate Against Minority Students

[Reuter's News Agency, Washington, 25th] Legislation prohibiting secondary schools and universities from discriminating against minority students is expected to face strong opposition in Congress. This law was drafted by the President's Higher Education Committee, but its fate in Congress is expected to be the same as the ban on employment discrimination, which has been discussed for more than a decade without a resolution. It is universally acknowledged here that a system of discrimination against minority students still exists in American educational institutions, but those who oppose correcting the racial discrimination system believe that correcting this traditional system will inevitably cause resentment among people in the southern states. Even a small number of members of the President's Higher Education Advisory Committee also advocate "only setting up schools exclusively for blacks, rather than allowing blacks and whites to study in the same place." For example, in Washington, only Howard University simultaneously accommodates black students. The Advisory Committee's report also recommends suspending government funding for schools with racial discrimination systems. Although this legislation will be submitted to Congress, southern state lawmakers will definitely find ways to obstruct it.

### President Cheng of Jiaotong University Has Returned to School from Beijing: Discusses Financial Strain at Jiaotong University

[Reported by This Newspaper] Cheng Xiaogang, president of National Jiaotong University, returned to school the other day after traveling to Beijing last week to request the Ministry of Education to increase the university's operating expenses. According to him, the university's current operating expenses and equipment funds are extremely strained. The Ministry of Education only approved an increase based on the university's pre-war expenses. However, pre-war expenses were based on the number of students. The number of faculty and students has increased dramatically since the war, and the increase in expenses has not been proportional. This is a common feeling among all national universities today. The significant inadequacy of operating expenses is obvious.

### City Government Orders Closure of 204 Silver Shops and Money Exchanges

Money Exchange Trade Association to Also Cancel Registration

The Shanghai Financial Administration has determined that the money exchange industry in this city has mostly engaged in foreign currency exchange business. Since the government explicitly banned gold sales and foreign currency circulation, the money exchange industry has long lost its business objectives and is no longer viable. However, it has been found that the industry mostly uses the names of "silver shops" and "money exchanges," which is confusing with the names of "silver and money houses" approved by the Ministry of Finance. In order to prevent confusion and prevent the circulation of illegal currency, the bureau has decided to rectify the situation. It has announced to all money exchange shops that, from this date, in addition to ceasing money exchange operations, all original names of "silver shops" and "money exchanges" and their signs must be removed. The industry's trade association must also cancel its registration to reflect the actual situation and prevent abuse. Those who fail to comply or secretly violate the order will be sent to the court for strict legal action upon discovery. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance for record, the bureau has specifically requested the City Government to investigate and execute the order. The City Government issued an order to the police department on the 26th to cooperate with the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus to enforce the order. A total of 204 money exchange shops are to be closed, and their names are as follows:

San Tai He Ji Silver Shop, San Tai Silver Shop, Shanghai Xu Ji Shop, Da Kang Zhi Ji Silver Shop, Da Li Bank, Da Hua Fa Ji Bank, Da Sen Silver Shop, Da Fa Lu Ji Shop, Da Kang Chang Ji Shop, Da Hua Shop, Da Lai Shop, Da Feng Shop, Yuan Shun Shop, Yuan Sheng Silver Shop, Yuan Long He Ji Shop, Yuan Da Silver Shop, Zhong Hong Silver Shop, Ren Tai Jian Ji Shop, Gong He Shop, Zheng Feng Yu Ji Shop, Zheng Feng Heng Xiang Ji Silver Shop, Zheng Zhang Silver Shop, Yong Sheng Yi Ji Silver Shop, Yong Chang Money Exchange, Yong Cheng Hang, Yong Feng Silver Shop, Yong Da Xiang Ji Shop, Yong Xing Silver Shop, Yong Fa Silver Shop, Yong De Shop, Yong Tai Shop, Xuan Cheng Hao, Tong Feng He Ji Silver Shop, Tong Sheng Kui Ji Shop, Tong He Silver Shop, Tong Li Yong Ji Silver Shop, Tong Tai Ren Ji Shop, Tong Chang Shop, Tong Feng Heng Xie Ji Shop, An Tai Shop, Ji Tai He Ji Silver Shop, Cheng Ji Shop, You Li Silver Shop, He Feng Silver Shop, Xin Cheng Shop, Li Tai Silver Shop, Li Ji Silver Shop, Li Shen Xie Ji Shop, Yong Tai Yong Silver Shop, Hong Yuan Xin Ji Shop, Hong Xing Silver Shop, Hong Da Silver Shop, Tian Cheng Shop, Tian Tai Silver Shop, Zhi Tai Silver Shop, Xie Xing Silver Shop, Xie Kang Silver Shop, Xie Cheng Silver Shop, Xie Qing Silver Shop, Xie Tai Bao Ji Silver Shop, Hou Chang Shop, Hou Ji Shop, Ying Xing Yi Ji Silver Shop, Mao Kang Shop, Mao Feng Tai Ji Shop, Mao Tai Chang Ji Shop, Mao Chang Silver Shop, Heng Mao Yi Ji Shop, Heng Tai Xin Ji Shop, Heng Tai Silver Shop, Heng Tai Shop, Xin Yu He Ji Shop, Xin Cheng Chang Silver Shop, Zhen Tai Xie Ji Shop, Jin Da Jiu Ji Silver Shop, Jin Tai Xie Ji Silver Shop, Xiang Tai Wen Ji Silver Shop, Xiang Feng Shop, Xiang Sheng Shop, Xiang Yuan Shop, Xiang Mao Shop, Xiang Kang Silver Shop, Yi Feng Money Exchange, Yi Xing Xing Ji Silver Shop, Tai Lai Silver Shop, Asia Shop, Shen Chang Shop, Tong Tai Silver Shop, Zhou Xin Shop, Shun Feng Shop, Shun Da Shop, Shun Li Silver Shop, Shun Ji Shop, Tong Yuan Shop, Tong Yi Silver Shop, Jing Cheng Silver Shop, Feng Kang Yi Ji Shop, Long Chang Silver Shop, Wei Da Silver Shop, Hua Tai Silver Shop, Hua Da Shop, Hua Cheng Silver Shop, Hui Kang Shop, Fu Xing Hua Ji Shop, Fu Yuan Shop, Fu Da Shop, Fu Xing Shop, Yu Feng Silver Shop, Yu Xing Feng Ji Silver Shop, Yu Long Shop, Sen Tai Shop, Sen Yuan Shop, Jun Chang Yuan Ji Silver Shop, Wei Ji Silver Shop, Fu Kang Shop, Zhong Xue Shop, Zhong Ye Silver Shop, Xin Feng Silver Shop, Xin Tai Ying Ji Shop, Xin Feng Hang, Xin Tai Shop, Xin Long Shop, Xin Kang Shop, Qin Da Silver Shop, Qin Tai Silver Shop, Qin Chang Shop, Wan Kang Feng Ji Shop, Wan Tai Silver Shop, Wan Mao Ren Ji Silver Shop, Wan Tai Xing Ji Shop, Wan Tai Xing Ji Shop, Wan Xing Silver Shop, Wan Shi Shop, Wan Feng Shop, Wan Li Yong Ji Shop, Wan Xiang Hao, Yuan Feng Shop, Yuan Chang Xin Ji Shop, Ju Feng Shop, Fu Cheng Silver Shop, Fu He Xiang Shop, Fu Chang Silver Shop, Fu Kang Qing Ji Shop, Fu Da Qi Silver Shop, Fu Sen Song Ji Shop, Fu Chang Xie Ji Shop, Fu Da Zeng Ji Silver Shop, Cheng Da Hao, Rui Feng Silver Shop, Hui Tong Shop, Ding Da Shop, Ying Tai Shop, Qing Yu Silver Shop, Qing He Shop, De Tai Yi Ji Shop, De Xiang Shop, De Chang Shop, De Tai Shop, Run Tai Yuan Ji Shop, Run De Silver Shop, Xing He Rui Ji Shop, Xing Hua Shop, Ji Chang Shop, Lu Zhang Ji Shop, Heng Feng Shop, Hong Chang Silver Shop, Hong Tai Song Ji Shop, Hong Yu Zhen Ji Shop, Hong Yu Gong Ji Shop, Hong Chang Yun Ji Shop, Hong Feng Shop, Lian Feng Hao, Lian He Shop, Lian Fa Hao, Zhen Xing Tai Ji Silver Shop, Feng Xiang Shop, Bao Da Silver Shop, Bao Hua Shop, Shi Cheng Silver Shop, Bao Tai Song Ji Silver Shop, Bao Yuan Chang Bing Ji Shop, Bao Feng Silver Shop, Bao Shen Fu Ji Silver Shop, Bao Xiang Ning Ji Shop, Bao Yu Silver Shop, Bao Kang Yi Ji Shop, Bao Kang Fa Ji Shop, Bao Chang Silver Shop, Bao Long Silver Shop, Bao Xing He Ji Shop, Han Yong Silver Shop, Ji Chang Shop, Bao Chang Chang Ji Silver Shop, Fu Lai Silver Shop, Lu Yong Xing Silver Shop, Yan Da Shop, Chang Tai Shop.

Small Stocks Generally Plummet; Hua Shares' Situation Uncertain

Hua shares experienced a general trend of "selling small and buying big" activities yesterday. Small stocks are gradually facing a "sunset is infinitely good" situation. Yongsha is still stable, but the process also appears uncertain. Short sellers are instead buying goods off-market, suggesting a potentially major change in the future.

Opening prices were high, especially for small stocks. Qinxing opened high at 57 yuan, and Xinhua even reached the涨停(price limit). However, the situation changed after the opening. Small stocks rose too sharply and quickly fell. Yongsha advanced to 551 yuan and 560 yuan, then retreated to 544 yuan and 553 yuan. Feng'an挂涨停(price limit up), and Yongsha returned to the 550 yuan and 560 yuan range. Off-market interest rates opened lower at two jiao four and two jiao eight and a half fen. Yongsha soon weakened again, falling to 543 yuan and 549 yuan, before once rising to a high of 560 yuan and 569 yuan, only to fall again to 547 yuan and 553 yuan. Yongye 挂涨停板(price limit up). Yongsha's noon closing price was 554 yuan and 561 yuan. All small stocks, except those whose managers abandoned maintaining them, experienced a very general trend of "selling small and buying big" activities, resulting in second-tier and miscellaneous brands closing at lower prices. Xinhuo, however, closed at a high price. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the immediate delivery shares Jingguang and Jingfu fell by half a percent, Jinglun and Zhabei fell slightly, Xinhuo and Huochai Zhongxing rose by half a percent, Xinhua, Feng'an, Yonggong, and Huafeng rose by one percent, Yongye 涨停(price limit up), Zhongfang, Tongyi, Datong, Meiya, and Shangwu were flat, and the rest rose slightly. Among the deferred delivery shares, Huafeng and Xinhuo rose by half a percent, Jingfu fell by half a percent, and Xinguang and Qinxing fell slightly. The rest rose slightly.

Some rumors in the after-market fueled selling pressure, and state-owned banks intervened significantly. Yongsha fell sharply, especially Qinxing, which fell to a low of 41 yuan, the most severe. However, with the support of the managers, small stocks were rescued. Yongsha's immediate delivery closing price was 548 yuan, while the deferred delivery price was instead 546 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the immediate delivery shares Tongyi, Datong, Shangwu, Huafeng, Jinglun, Chen'an, Jingfu, Xinhua, and Huaxin were all down by half a percent, Qinxing was down by one percent, Huochai was flat, and the rest were down slightly. Among the deferred delivery shares, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Qinxing, and Xinguang were all down by about half a percent, and the rest were down slightly. Off-market, old shares continued to see gains, especially Dasheng No. 1 Factory, which rose by 20 percent. The largest gains were by No. 3 Factory, Nanyang, Xinhua, Shang, and Shijie, which each rose by 10 percent.

Rice Prices Rise Again; Oil Market Rises Straight Up

Yesterday, a total of over 17,800 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. Inland prices rose again, and as a result, both japonica and indica rice rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan. The price of white rice remained firm, secretly increasing to kill the trend. The supply of flour was insufficient to meet demand, and prices rose straight up after the opening, increasing by more than 10,000 yuan. The price limit was consistently above 40,000 yuan for all flours. Bran also rose sharply by 10,000 yuan, and there was still a shortage of supply.

Although soybean cake trading was slow, all commodities rose, making sellers even more firm and following the rise by 10,000 yuan. Guest help for yellow soybeans remained stagnant, and the local market was normal. High-quality goods were average, and Duhuang was also lackluster. However, oil factories increased their intake of medium and low-quality guest soybeans, raising prices by more than 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were sluggish and uncompetitive. The situation was flat and weak. The supply and demand of mung beans were both scarce, and there were no temporary fluctuations. Red beans were also traded lightly, with no price changes. The arrival and storage of wheat were both scarce, and prices continued to rise by 20,000-30,000 yuan.

Red sorghum spirits were actively traded, rising by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Northern corn was actively digested, rising by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to be digested, and high-quality goods rose again by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Few transactions of medium-quality goods occurred in the local market, and the situation was temporarily flat. Tianjin sesame seeds were actively traded, with aggressive purchases. Guangdong merchants also participated, and the market was chaotic. At the closing, prices jumped wildly and unevenly, soaring by more than 100,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan.

The oil market was soaring. Ningbo merchants purchased, and southern China inquired. Prices soared by more than 100,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, and the situation was chaotic, with no formal market conditions.

Yarn Control Committee Convenes Cotton Textile Industry Leaders to Discuss and Hope for Sincere Cooperation from Private Factories

[Report from this newspaper] Yuan Chen, Chairman of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, convened the heads of the six district cotton textile associations, including Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, Liu Jingji, and Rong Erren, at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yuan expressed that after the passage of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations, he deeply hoped that all yarn factories would cooperate sincerely and provide detailed reports on their cotton inventory, cotton demand, and cotton yarn production. If the management regulations can be effectively implemented for three months to half a year, it will be clear that the regulations are not intended to exploit the textile industry, but rather to help the development of the textile industry's future. Representatives from private factories immediately expressed several opinions: (1) The management regulations did not mention increased production. For example, there are currently 4.5 million spindles nationwide, but only 3.6 million are operating. The reasons for the 900,000 spindles that are not operating should be investigated and quickly put into operation to increase cotton yarn production by 20% to adjust supply and demand. (2) The management regulations still require permits for the transportation and sale of cotton yarn to various locations. This creates great doubts for the operations of each factory. In the current period of material shortage, regulations restricting the transportation and sale of cotton yarn should be reduced. (3) The spinning and weaving sectors have had close relationships in the past. This should be taken into account under the unified purchase and sale system. This will avoid the separation of high-quality raw material supply in the cotton yarn and cloth sectors, which could damage the reputation of each factory's original product trademarks. (4) If the rigid regulations on cotton-for-yarn exchanges encounter fluctuations in the cost of living or commodity prices while cotton prices remain the same, a flexible solution should be sought. Yuan stated that as long as all factories can cooperate sincerely, he is willing to consider any difficulties that may be encountered after implementation.

### Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Raised to 29.52 Million Yuan for 20-Count Yarn

[Report from this newspaper] The negotiated price of cotton yarn by the Spinning and Textile Adjustment Committee has been adjusted yesterday. The price of 20-count yarn has been raised to 29.52 million yuan. The prices of other counts of yarn have been determined separately in proportion and with reference to market conditions.

Yesterday, the committee and the Spinning and Construction Company sold yarn separately, resulting in a total sale of 1,626.5 pieces, equivalent to 2,304.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were a total of 364 applications. The selling price of yarn by the Spinning and Adjustment Committee for 20-count yarn varied from 30 million yuan for Ruyi to 32 million yuan for Hongkui Xing. 39.5 million yuan for 32-count Yenfeng, 43 million yuan for 40-count Riguang, and 49.5 million yuan for 42-count double-strand Lanfeng.

Firm Yarn Prices

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was firm due to the increased negotiated prices for yarn sold by the Spinning and Construction Company. Furthermore, with looser credit among industry players and a healthier appetite, and with the arrival of guest traders to inquire, the market situation was generally optimistic due to the forced shutdown of the Qingdao Yarn Factory. Until 11:30, the Spinning and Construction Company suddenly suspended the price and accepted bids from industry players, leading to a weakening trend. However, by closing time, continuous purchases from all parties caused prices to recover. As a result, the immediate price of 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn reached 50 million yuan, and the forward price was 50.05 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, prices for 40-count and 32-count yarns rose by 100,000-200,000 yuan to 700,000-800,000 yuan. Prices for 20-count yarn fluctuated. Prices for 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns, etc., varied from 150,000 yuan to 500,000-600,000 yuan.

Slightly Softer Cloth Market

The cotton cloth market opened yesterday with the Spinning and Construction Company's unified allocation of cloth, with more gabardine being sold, increasing the amount of chips on the market. Many floats sold off heavily. It was also heard that the Shanxi gang's large orders of gabardine notices had been sold off in small amounts, causing prices to fall once. However, after 10:30, a Hankou gang suddenly came to absorb many gabardine warehouse receipts, and Guangdong gangs also increased their intake, strengthening the market. Manufacturers, however, were tied up with employee year-end bonuses, weakening their willingness to increase their intake. Local buyers were also scarce. As a result, the limited price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth remained unchanged at 1.372 million yuan, but off-market bids rose to 1.386-1.387 million yuan with transactions. Prices for other grades of fine cloth fell slightly by 4,000-8,000 to 12,000 yuan. In addition, except for Zhigong and blue cloth, which were firm, most other cloths showed a flat or soft trend.

[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Export Committee reported that since the 24th of last month, the committee has processed a total of 123,741 pieces of cotton cloth for export in exchange for Indian cotton.

### Cotton Merchants Hold General Meeting Yesterday to Fight for Future Status

[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Merchants Association of this city held a temporary members' meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM yesterday. The presidium consisted of Liu Pingxun, Zheng Zhezheng, and Chen Qingzheng. Liu and Chen first delivered speeches, stating that cotton merchants have no status in the passed management regulations for cotton yarn and cloth. Cotton merchants have a history of over 8,000 years, and they made great contributions to the purchase of cotton during the Anti-Japanese War. Cotton prices have depreciated since the announcement of the unified purchase policy, and cotton merchants have suffered significant losses. The management regulations give status to yarn and cloth merchants, but cotton merchants are excluded. A discussion was then held, and it was finally decided to appoint 17 people, including Liu Pingxun, to convene a small group meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon to study detailed measures, and then visit Chairman Yuan of the Adjustment Committee next Monday to petition.

### Responsible Person from Fuel Management Discusses Coal Supply Situation

[Central News Agency, this city] According to the responsible person of the Fuel Management Committee, due to the recent difficulties in transportation on the Beining Railway, in order to increase reserves, efforts will be made in the future to source coal from Taiwan and the Jinpu Railway to ensure smooth supply and make up for shortages. Taiwan regularly exports coal, totaling 40,000 tons per month, of which 20,000 tons are shipped to Guangdong and Fujian, 5,000 tons to Qingdao, and the rest to Shanghai. This month, a total of 1,740 tons have been shipped, and the Tainan ship loaded with over 7,000 tons on the 23rd of this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of the month. The output of the Huainan, East China, and Zhongxing mines along the Jinpu Railway totals 200,000 tons per month, of which 40,000 tons have been shipped to Pukou. Transportation has been coordinated with the Railway Bureau and will soon be shipped south in a steady stream. It was also learned that the Beining Railway was severely damaged by bandits on the 9th of this month, resulting in only 50,000 tons of coal being shipped to Qinhuangdao in the first ten days of this month. After emergency repairs, transportation was restored on the 24th, and a small amount of coal was shipped from the production area. In view of the fact that coal reserves in Qingdao are not as abundant as in Shanghai, in order to supply in advance, 7,600 tons have recently been shipped from Qinhuangdao to Qingdao, of which 2,000 tons have been allocated to the China Textile Construction Company, and the rest to the local power plant.

### Deadline for Exchanging Three-Year Allied Bonds Completed

Those Who Exceed the Deadline Will Be Considered Donations

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has stated that the affairs of the 33rd year Allied Bonds have been concluded for a long time, but some areas still have not completed the exchange of the bonds. The ministry has now issued a general order to the finance departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to complete the exchange before the end of March of the 37th year. Those who exceed the deadline will be considered to have donated to the country and will be transferred to the national treasury.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Shares Mediocre

Public bonds were quite mediocre yesterday. Unified C opened at 30,000 yuan, with a low price of 29,300 yuan and a high price of 31,000 yuan, before closing at a price of 0.05 yuan. Compared to the previous closing price, A and B were flat, C rose by 200 yuan, D rose by 400 yuan, and E fell by 200 yuan. 3 million yuan was traded.

Foreign shares rose and fell unevenly yesterday, but were generally mediocre with little change. Yisha opened at 428,000, gradually falling from 430,000 to 415,000 before stabilizing slightly. However, there was still little improvement in the after-market. The Guangdong gang sold, while securities companies and foreign companies bought. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, British Union, Tram, Agriculture, and Guangdong Commerce were flat, Tram fell by half a percent, and the gains and losses of other shares were minimal.

### US Wartime Bonds to Fall in Price from the 24th

[Central News Agency, this city] According to relevant sources, the Federal Reserve Bank has stated that the price of the 2.5% bonds of September 1967-72 will fall from 7037-32 yuan to 7038-32, the price of the 2.5% bonds of December 1967-72 will fall from 7077-32 yuan to 7038-32 yuan, and the price of the 2.5% bonds of 1959-62 will fall from 70073-32 yuan to 100 yuan. The Federal Reserve also convened brokers dealing in these bonds on the evening of the 23rd, publicly stating that it would fully maintain the new prices of the bonds after the price drop. This news is relevant to the future of the US dollar exchange rate in our country. Another authoritative figure in the financial sector in this city stated that this news confirms that the US currency is also continuing to depreciate. The Federal Reserve's move is due to the fear that banks and brokers dealing in these bonds will sell the bonds they hold due to the depreciation of the currency, which would be detrimental to the operation of the financial market. Therefore, it has stated that it will clearly maintain the quasi-price of the bonds after the price drop. Therefore, we can predict that the exchange rate of our country's US dollar will not be further lengthened in the short term.

### Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Banking Association

[Report from this newspaper] The Banking Association of this city convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at around 5:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Chairman Li Fusun. Important discussion proposals included: The Ministry of Finance previously borrowed from various banks, mostly using public bonds issued before the war, which will be repaid at a rate of one to one, resulting in too much loss for the banking industry. In addition, pre-war deposits in the banking industry have also been repaid after being increased by 1,700 times. Therefore, it was generally agreed to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to negotiate a proper solution. Important decisions were also made regarding the payment of special business tax: (2) The tax rate remains unchanged at 4%. (3) Each head office will collect and pay the taxes to ensure accuracy and convenience. (4) After the year-end final settlement, all members of the association will be notified to handle the matter together.

### Business Briefs

Huainan Mining Railway and Datong Coal Mine Companies held a joint extraordinary shareholders meeting at the Bank of China on the fourth floor yesterday afternoon. Chairman Zhu Yong reported on the merger of the two companies and approved the capital adjustment plan for revaluing the fixed assets of the two companies. The total adjusted capital is 18 billion yuan, divided into 180 million shares, each share worth 100 yuan.

### Livingstone's Views—On the Functions of History and Literature in Education

— Mao Zishui

Sir Richard Livingstone, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, wrote a small book in 1943 entitled "Education for a World Adrift". Like Livingstone's other books discussing education, this book is well worth reading carefully by those who care about modern problems and educators. One chapter in the book examines history and literature from an educational perspective, and the arguments are very balanced and insightful. I will now summarize the main points of this chapter as an introduction.

Livingstone believes that the primary task of education is to cultivate moral character, and the cultivation of moral character lies in enabling students to see the greatness in life and to recognize the highest qualities in life. The great scenes in life are taught to us by the two subjects of literature and history in every school.

However, if we want to see the highest qualities in life clearly, we must read literature and history with a special eye. There is more than one way to read a book. Let's talk about history first. We can see it as a record of the rise and fall of dynasties; but soon after closing the book, we forget those events. Of course, we can pay attention to specific things, such as the growth of civilization, the development of political thought, and so on. These are all necessary and essential knowledge. But this is not the main purpose of history in education. If we want to obtain spiritual value and "good" examples from history and literature, we must search carefully. In recent decades, there have been three changes in the fashion of history teaching. At first, the emphasis was on emperors and generals, diplomacy and war; later, attention was paid to social conditions and the lives of ordinary people; finally, history became the story of human beings evolving from animals to savages, and from savages to civilization. There are many reasons for human progress. Physiology, climate, and economics are all factors; great figures are also a factor. The rise and fall of nations, the ebb and flow of civilizations, can indeed give us a "great" picture, but in the words and deeds of great figures, we can see clearly human courage and perseverance, human desire for wisdom, and human sincerity and reverence for "good"—these are the pure forces that drive humanity from darkness to light, from savagery to civilization.

We can divide the people who created civilization into three categories. One is the people of action, one is the people of thought, and one is the people of revelation. These three types of people are the three strands of the great rope of civilization. If we cannot recognize one strand clearly, we will not know the structure of the whole rope. The influence of people like Faraday, Darwin, Pasteur, and Adam Smith is naturally great; but their influence is different from that of Socrates, Plato, the Stoics, Jesus, and Augustine, and even more different from that of Alexander, Augustus, Cromwell, and Napoleon. If we read history as a record of human evolution, we must see clearly all three strands of this great rope of civilization—the spiritual, the intellectual, and the political. In fifth-century BC Athens, we must remember Socrates and Democritus (the expounder of ancient Greek atomism), as well as Pericles (the Athenian statesman); in the twelfth century, we must remember St. Bernard as well as Henry I; in the sixteenth century, we must remember Thomas More, Copernicus, as well as Henry VIII and Martin Luther; in the nineteenth century, we must remember Darwin and Shaftesbury, as well as Bismarck and Cavour. Historians often suffer from prejudice. Early priests could not see the strand of thought and knowledge; modern Wells, in addition to science, also neglected other strands.

In the slow, roundabout, and discontinuous progress of mankind, Socrates seems more important than Pericles, St. Bernard more important than Frederick, Thomas More more important than Henry VIII, and Pasteur and Darwin more important than Bismarck. However, with this view, we inevitably risk looking down on entrepreneurs. In reality, a politician with both greatness and goodness may contribute less to civilization, but is as worthy of respect as religious figures, reformers, and scientists; because his work may be even more difficult than theirs.

In the spiritual life, we can also divide it into several levels. Some people are pioneers of new ideas. Hosea said, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." Jesus said, "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven." These kinds of words and views can change the world; they are revelations of higher standards of living; they are pregnant with new life.

The second is those who cultivate themselves and act with integrity. Socrates was such a person; St. Bernard was also such a person. In times of difficulty and hardship, few people are more worthy of emulation than St. Bernard. In his time, bandits roamed and religion was corrupt. He could have drifted along with the tide to preserve his life in troubled times, or he could have fallen into pessimism and given up on himself. But he did not. He used his perseverance and determination to engage in a hopeless war in the hope of changing the world and improving it. If there were not a few such people in the world, humanity might not have made much progress.

Let's turn to literature. Like history, literature is a treasure trove of the first-class achievements in life. Reading literature is like reading history, it depends on what path we take. Usually when we read an essay or a poem, we can pay attention to the time of writing, the origin of the article, the author's resume, and the appreciation of his work by his contemporaries; we can also pay attention to technical aspects, such as words, tones, and structure; we can also read it with a mood of passing the years; we can also read it with the purpose of obtaining the life and world views of the wise men of the past. The function of literature in education lies in this last point of view.

Some literature is a direct revelation of the highest qualities of human life and nature, such as Arnold's "Morality," Wordsworth's "Ode to Duty," or his "Character of the Happy Warrior." These poems read almost like the chapters of Plato, Spinoza, or Kant. In these words, we feel that poetry is a criticism of life, it is unsystematic moral philosophy. Such poems, like philosophy, are easier for people over twenty to understand and appreciate than for people under twenty.

In some poems, the ideas of life are not simply stated, but are attached to things. Wordsworth's "Leech Gatherer" is an example. The subtitle of this poem, "Resolution and Independence," shows the poet's intentions at the time.

There is also a class of poems, such as Spenser's "The Faerie Queen," Milton's "Paradise Lost," Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound," and Tennyson's "Idylls of the King," that contain a view of life, but it is not very obvious.

These poets all want to express their moral concepts didactically. But moralists are not necessarily the best moral teachers. Fortunately, Britain has produced the world's greatest poet, and this poet's concepts of good and evil are very clear. All kinds of human character and interest, except for religion and science, can be found in Shakespeare's works. The characters he describes are good, bad, great, and small; but who is good and who is evil is very clear.

The highest qualities in life and human nature are scattered in many places in history and literature, as long as people know how to find them. But here, a problem arises again. Good and bad, wheat and chaff, grow mixed together in these fields. Attila, Borgia, and Frederick the Great, in one sense, are great men. Villon and Boccaccio can also be said to be first-class writers. But this kind of superiority is not what we are looking for. In literature and history, just like in life, there is both good and evil, and they are mixed together. It is very dangerous to ignore good and bad and not to choose carefully. The worst thing is to be infected with those abnormal opinions and poisoned by "teaching obscenity and theft"; the best thing is to become a person "without a sense of right and wrong." We certainly do not want to subject our pure-hearted youth to the harm of such works. This is a major problem in education.

Do we want to implement the method of withdrawal or deletion? This is almost impossible. Can we withdraw history? Can we erase the records of great traitors and villains? Not to mention anything else, the Christian Bible also has good and bad in it. Who can have the opportunity to revise it? But even though we cannot withdraw or delete, we must always have a distinction between good and evil.

Some great figures in history are like stars, always shining brightly; some are like meteors, looking brighter than stars, but only flashing for a short time. We must not confuse greatness and goodness. Between 1770 and 1870, there were three people who changed the situation in Europe: Frederick the Great, Napoleon, and Bismarck. Many history readers are blinded by their brilliance. In reality, their greatness cannot cover up their sins. The world would be better off without them. I say this not out of disgust for politics. Political power and justice are not mutually exclusive. Abraham Lincoln of the United States also lived in this period; but he combined greatness and goodness in one person, he was a model politician, he was someone we should all emulate.

### "Archaeology in Gansu"

— Lecture by Dr. Pei Wenzhong, recorded by the Peking University History Society

The Xiahe River Basin During the height of the Yangshao culture, this culture also spread to this area. However, there is another culture in this area, which is the "Qijia period" used by Mr. Andersson, which I changed to "Qijia culture". Mr. Andersson believed that the Qijia period was one of the earliest periods of painted pottery culture, but according to the results of our observation this time, I believe that Qijia is another system of culture, developed in the Xiahe River Basin, and reached the Taohe River Basin at its peak. The Qijia culture occupied a long period of time, earlier than or appearing at the same time as the painted pottery culture. The Qijia culture seems to have been influenced by the Microlithic culture. The existence of small stone tools and Comb ceramics is proof of the influence of the microlithic culture.

3. Questions brought back

This time in Gansu, after five months of fieldwork, we only brought back many questions. We cannot talk about any discoveries. We hope to continue working in the future to solve these many questions. I will now just mention a few big questions and talk to you about them.

(1) The Origin of Painted Pottery Culture

Painted pottery culture has been found in Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, and this time we saw the heyday of painted pottery culture in Gansu. Where did the painted pottery culture originate, in Henan? Or did it originate in Gansu? This is a question that our predecessors debated but failed to solve. This time we went to Gansu, but we still brought this question back and still haven't solved it. As for the relationship between foreign painted pottery cultures, such as those in Central Asia and Europe, it is naturally even more impossible to talk about.

(2) The Origin of Chinese Culture

How did Chinese culture come about? We still don't know. We only know that there was an Yin culture (that is, Xiaotun culture). The Zhou dynasty destroyed the Shang, and then passed it on to the Han dynasty. The characteristics of Chinese culture were complete and the development was at its peak. In the four regions I passed through this time, we can see that Han culture replaced any earlier culture. Whether Yin culture is Chinese culture is a question. What was Chinese culture like before the Yin dynasty? It is even more impossible to talk about. I once said that the reason why painted pottery culture declined in the upper reaches of the Wei River was due to the influence of "primitive Chinese culture", that is, primitive Chinese culture rose in the upper reaches of the Wei River, replacing painted pottery culture. The so-called "primitive Chinese culture" is a hypothetical term. Whether the culture that rose to replace painted pottery culture can be considered Chinese culture is really still full of questions. If we can solve this question, we will be one step closer to solving the question of the origin of Chinese culture. To solve these many related questions, we still need our future efforts.

(3) The Question of the Zhou Ethnic Culture

According to ancient records, the Zhou ethnic group came from the west, developed in the lower reaches of the Wei River, and then moved east to destroy the Shang dynasty. However, what we know today about the culture of the early Zhou dynasty is almost entirely inherited from the Yin culture. The Zhou was an ethnic group. Before destroying the Shang, they secretly had their own culture. If the Zhou ethnic group did come from the west, then they must have come from the upper reaches of the Wei River. What we obtained from our investigation in the upper reaches of the Wei River this time was that the decline period of the painted pottery culture, in terms of the era, was approximately equivalent to the era when the Zhou ethnic group lived there. Is the painted pottery culture after the decline the Zhou ethnic group's own inherent culture? This is a question worthy of study, but unfortunately our work this year did not solve this question. We brought it back and asked everyone to solve it.

(4) The Question of Limestone Dwellings

During this trip to Gansu, we initially saw thin layers of limestone, and later we tried excavating several places. In one place in the Taohe River basin, excavation revealed that this limestone layer was square, with a round pit in the middle, which seemed to be a place for burning fire. In a limestone layer, four coarse rope-patterned pottery and a tripod ding were unearthed. The remains of a woman and two young children were also discovered. Observed from various aspects, this limestone layer was the floor paved in the ancient people's dwellings, and its age was approximately equivalent to the period of the decline of the painted pottery culture, and at the latest before the Han dynasty. What is the relationship between these dwellings and those in the lower reaches of the Wei River and Henan? What is the exact age of this dwelling? What about the upper part of this dwelling and its doors? All these need to be solved in the future.

(5) The Question of Mr. Andersson's Various Stages

Based on the results of our observation in Gansu this time, we feel that there are also considerable problems with Mr. Andersson's staging. The first is Mr. Andersson's "Qijia period". Because there is very little painted pottery in this period, Mr. Andersson believes that this is the earliest period of painted pottery culture. According to what we have found this time, the so-called Qijia period sites are widely distributed in the Xiahe River Basin and are very developed. I personally believe that the Qijia period represents another type of culture, which is temporarily called "Qijia culture". This culture is a complex Amphora-style large-eared pottery pot, and at the same time has struck stone tools and microliths. I speculate that the Qijia culture is another system of culture. I don’t know whether this culture and the painted pottery culture came before or after. It's very strange. Mr. Andersson's "Xindian period" does not exist in the upper reaches of the Wei River.

As for Andersson's "Siba period", what we encountered this time were only tombs, and no dwellings were found. Does this period belong to the painted pottery culture system or the Qijia culture system? Is there any relationship with limestone dwellings? At present, it is impossible to determine.

In summary, our archaeological work in Gansu this time did not solve the problems, but brought back many questions, asking everyone to solve them with us. If we cannot solve them now, we should continue to work hard to find a solution in the future. We are engaged in academic work, and we cannot hope for quick results. For example, we spent several months this time and walked a very limited distance, and there will be no results. However, we can bring back many questions and talk to everyone about them. In terms of academic research, it can be said that this trip was not in vain. (To be continued)

### On the Translation of Buddhist Scriptures as Literature (Part 2)

— Zhou Yiliang

My second point is to regard the translation of Buddhist scriptures as fables, stories, and popular literature of this kind. We know that India is the origin of many fables and fairy tales in the world. Buddhist scriptures absorbed many of these stories and were translated and transmitted to China. Many Chinese stories and myths were influenced by the translation of Buddhist scriptures. The most popular example is the three disciples of Xuanzang in *Journey to the West*—Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Heshang—all have Indian prototypes, as Mr. Chen Yinke has already pointed out. (See "The Evolution of the Story of Xuanzang's Disciples in *Journey to the West*," published in the Bulletin of the Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, Volume 2, Part 2.) Earlier, many popular literary works unearthed in Dunhuang, such as *bianwen* (transformation texts), were also based on Buddhist scripture themes. Going back even further, most of the *zhiguai* (records of anomalies) novels of the Six Dynasties were more or less products influenced by Buddhist scriptures. Therefore, when discussing literature, Buddhist scriptures are undoubtedly a treasure trove. To study the origin and evolution of Chinese popular literature, Buddhist scriptures are also an indispensable key.

Pali Buddhist scriptures contain the most fables in the Jataka tales. In the Chinese translations of Buddhist scriptures, the collections in the *Sheng Jing* (Scripture of Births) and *Liudu Ji Jing* (Collection of Six Perfections Sutras), etc., are the most comprehensive. Let me give an example. This fable's Sanskrit text can be found in the *Panchatantra* (Five Chapters). In the Chinese translations of Buddhist scriptures, the *Liudu Ji Jing* translated by Kang Senghui of the Wu dynasty, the *Sheng Jing* translated by Zhu Fahu of the Western Jin dynasty, and the *Fo Benxing Ji Jing* translated by Baoyun and Nanjotara all contain the same account. I will use the version in the *Sheng Jing* here as a representative because it is the best written of the three. It is not only instructive but also full of wit, humor, and humanity. The original text is as follows:

"In the countless eons of the past, there was a monkey king. He lived in the forest, eating fruits and drinking water. He thought that all beings, moving and breathing, should be liberated and reach Nirvana. At that time, he befriended a turtle. They respected each other and never quarreled. The turtle often visited the monkey, eating and drinking, and discussing the righteous principles. His wife saw him often going out and not staying at home, and suspected him of being promiscuous outside. She asked her husband, 'Why do you go out so often? Are you being unrestrained and immoral outside?' Her husband replied, 'I have become friends with a monkey. He is intelligent and wise and understands the principles of righteousness. I often visit him to discuss the scriptures and laws. We only talk about pleasant things and there is no licentiousness.' His wife did not believe him and thought otherwise. She was also angry at the monkey for enticing her husband to go out so often and always plotted to kill him so her husband would stop. She then pretended to be sick and lay weakly in bed. Her husband took care of her, providing medicine and treatment, but she still did not recover. She said to her husband, 'Why bother with medicine? My illness is very serious. Only by obtaining the liver of your close friend, the monkey, can I live.' Her husband replied, 'He is my close friend. I entrust my life to him and have no doubts about him. How can I plot against him and use him to save you?' His wife replied, 'We are husband and wife, one body. If you don't think of helping me but instead protect the monkey, that is not reasonable.' Her husband, pressured by his wife and respecting her, went to ask the monkey, 'I have often visited you. I hope you will not refuse to visit my humble home for a small meal.' The monkey replied, 'I live on land, and you live in the water. How can I follow you?' The turtle replied, 'I will carry you on my back. It will be alright!' The monkey then agreed. The turtle carried him to the middle of the river and said to the monkey, 'Do you want to know the truth? The reason I invited you is that my wife is sick and needs your liver to cure her illness.' The monkey replied, 'Why didn't you tell me earlier? I hung my liver on the tree and didn't bring it with me. Let's go back and get the liver, and then I will go with you.' He then returned to the tree, jumping and rejoicing. The turtle asked, 'You said you would bring your liver to my house. Why did you go back to the tree, jumping and leaping? What is the reason?' The monkey replied, 'There is no one more foolish than you in the world! How can anyone have a liver and hang it on a tree? We are friends, entrusting our lives to each other, and yet you plotted against me, wanting to endanger my life? From now on, let us go our separate ways!'"

In this passage, "Ren" (仁) is a respectful term for the second person, an abbreviation of "Ren zhe" (仁者, benevolent one). "Zhi cou" (至凑) and "Qin qin" (亲亲) are also common terms in early translations of Buddhist scriptures.

In addition to fables, there are many good stories in Buddhist scriptures. The main collections include the *Zhi Qian Yi Zhuan Ji Bai Xiang Jing* (Collected Parables of Zhi Qian), the *Xian Yu Jing* (Sutra of the Wise and Foolish) translated by Huijue and others of the Northern Wei dynasty, and the *Za Bi Zang Jing* (Miscellaneous Collection of the Vinaya) translated by Jijiaye and Tan Yao of the Northern Wei dynasty. The *Mulasarvastivada Vinaya* translated by Yijing contains many long and complex stories. Only a few collections of *avadana* exist in the original Sanskrit versions of these stories. I recently heard that the Sanskrit text of the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya has been discovered in Kashmir. When it is printed in the future, it will undoubtedly add valuable materials for studying these stories. Unfortunately, the stories are too long to quote. I will only give a brief example. This story also appears in the *Sheng Jing*, but the wording and structure in the *Mulasarvastivada Vinaya*, *Po Seng Shi*, Volume 12, are better, so I will use Yijing's translation. It tells the story of a weaver's uncle and nephew who committed theft together:

"The weaver obtained what he wanted with plenty to spare. The nephew asked the uncle, 'I am working in the same trade as you, why is your house always full and prosperous, while my home is always in need?' The uncle told the nephew, 'I do two trades, and you only do one.' The nephew asked the uncle, 'What is the second trade?' He replied, 'I steal at night.' The nephew said, 'I will also steal with you.' The uncle replied, 'You cannot steal.' The nephew answered, 'I am very capable!' He thought, 'I will try first.' After thinking this, they went to the market together. The uncle bought a rabbit and asked the nephew to prepare it: 'I will take a bath and come back to eat.' After he prepared it, before the uncle arrived, he ate one leg. When the uncle returned from his bath, he asked his nephew, 'Is it ready?' The nephew replied, 'It is ready.' The uncle said, 'Since it is ready, bring it here for me to see!' The nephew brought the rabbit to his uncle. The uncle saw that the rabbit was missing a leg. He asked the nephew, 'Where is the fourth leg of the rabbit?' The nephew replied, 'The rabbit originally had only three legs. Why are you asking me for the fourth leg?' The uncle thought, 'I am already a thief, but this nephew is a greater thief than I am.' ... That night, he and his nephew dug a hole in someone else's wall, intending to steal valuables. After digging the hole, the uncle first put his head into the hole. The nephew said, 'Uncle, you don't know the art of stealing! How can you put your head into the hole first? This is not good. You should put your feet in first. If you put your head in first, they will cut off your head, and everyone will recognize it, bringing disaster to the whole family. You should put your feet in first.' Hearing this, the uncle put his feet in. The owner of the house woke up and shouted 'Thief!' The people heard the noise and grabbed the thief's feet inside the hole. At that time, the nephew pulled his uncle out from outside the hole. He was not strong enough and feared that disaster would befall him, so he cut off his uncle's head and ran away. He reported the matter to the king and his ministers. The king told his ministers, 'The one who cut off the head is the biggest thief! You should place the thief's body in the middle of the four streets and secretly watch. If anyone mourns and takes the body away, that is the thief, and you can arrest him.' The ministers obeyed the order and placed the body as the king instructed. The thief-nephew thought, 'I should not directly carry my uncle's body, lest people recognize me! I should pretend to be crazy in the four streets, hugging men and women, trees and stones, cows and horses, and pigs and dogs.' After thinking this, he acted accordingly. When the people of the world saw him hugging everything everywhere, they all knew he was crazy. Then the thief-nephew hugged his uncle, weeping bitterly, and left. The ministers reported to the king, saying, 'Those guarding the body saw only a crazy man hugging the body and weeping, and no one else.' The king said, 'He is the dog thief, why didn't you catch him?' ... At that time, the thief again thought, 'How can I not bury my uncle? I must bury him!' He pretended to be a cart driver, loaded with firewood, and drove to the body. He quickly untied the ox and set fire to the cart. Then he ran away. At that time, the fire from the cart burned the body to ashes. ... At that time, the thief again thought, 'I must set up sacrifices at the place where I buried my uncle's body.' After thinking this, he pretended to be a pure Brahmin and went around the city begging for food. He then placed the food in five places at the cremation site to secretly sacrifice to his uncle, and then left. ... At that time, the thief again thought, 'I must throw my uncle's bones into the Miqia River.' After thinking this, he pretended to be a skull heretic, took the remaining ashes from the bones, and smeared them on his body. He collected the burned bones and placed them in a skull bowl. He threw them into the Miqia River and left."

### Remembering the Humiliating National Policy of the Japanese - Low Eaves, Part Two

The breaking point of the "July 7th" Incident was the small town by the Lugou Bridge in Pingxi (formerly the seat of the Xilu Subprefecture, now Wanping County). The Japanese army was conducting exercises nearby, claiming that during the roll call, "one person was lost." They insisted on entering the city to prove "themselves," which was not allowed. The defending army, responsible for its territory, believed that foreign soldiers searching the city at will was a great disgrace and decided to resist. Both sides opened fire, triggering a full-scale war that poisoned Chinese territory, plundered and harmed the Chinese people, and launched the Pacific War. Ultimately, they suffered a crushing defeat and, in August 1945, accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered completely. From high-spirited arrogance to bowing their heads in submission, they truly "lost face."

The Japanese used the excuse of "losing someone" to search for the missing soldier more than once (in Beijing dialect, it's called "zhao cha'er," in Shanghai dialect, it's called "ban cha tou," meaning deliberately making trouble). For example, the "September 18th" Incident also used the wording "Nakamura's disappearance" to justify shelling the Beida Camp. In Shanghai, from the "January 28th" to the "August 13th" incidents, almost every incident used "losing someone" as a pretext.

In June of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Japanese Vice-Consul in Nanjing, Kuramoto, suddenly disappeared. The Japanese ambassador and the Japanese government again used this as an excuse to make a fuss, making threatening and intimidating statements. Wang Jingwei, who was then the President of the Executive Yuan, panicked and ordered a large reward and searches everywhere. As a result, Kuramoto was found in a secluded mountain cave in the suburbs. The reason was that he was pessimistic and world-weary but was playing a joke on his country's "losing face" policy. Wang quickly sent someone to escort him to the Japanese embassy. The embassy was very embarrassed and sent him back to Japan on charges of "humiliating the country." In fact, Kuramoto's case was a minor matter and did not constitute "humiliating the country." However, the Japanese side's intimidation and demonstrations resulted in an anticlimactic situation and international ridicule, which was indeed a bit "humiliating"!

### Intelligence

— Wang Baili

The judiciary emphasizes evidence. Solid evidence makes people confess their crimes without resentment. Otherwise, even if the criminal confesses, those watching will still not understand the reason, making it difficult to establish credibility. However, the search for evidence is truly not easy. Wang Dongxu's *Liunan Suibi* records: "Shi Min, courtesy name Ziqiu, was a native of Changshu. He once served as the magistrate of Gushi County. Two villagers entered the city and moored their boats in the same place. One was a rice seller, and the other was a rapeseed seller. They argued over a bamboo basket and started wrestling. The basket originally belonged to the rapeseed seller, so they sued in court. Ziqiu declared to the crowd, 'This matter does not need to be judged by people, judging the basket is enough.' He then ordered a constable to take the basket and beat it with a stick. The onlookers were puzzled. When the stick struck the basket and broke it, rapeseed rolled out from the seams. The rice seller kowtowed and confessed his crime. Everyone praised him as a divine magistrate." Also, "Sheng Yuzan of Wuxian County once served as the magistrate of Lanxi County. Two families argued over a calf and filed a lawsuit. Sheng then had two mother cows brought to the side and ordered someone to stroke the calf. One mother cow made a mournful sound, and he was able to find the owner and return the calf." His discernment was similar to Shi Min's, both due to precise understanding. Also, Lu Yitian's *Lenglu Zashi* quotes Luo Siju of Fuyang's anecdotal stories as a regional commander: "The commander once led troops into the South Mountain to search for remaining bandits. The villagers complained that monkeys stole crops from the fields. Every morning, they fired firearms to scare them away. The commander asked the reason and ordered a monkey to be captured. He ordered someone to shave its hair, paint its face with colors, creating large eyes and ugly features. The next morning, when the monkeys came, he released the monkey. The monkeys saw it and were all startled. The monkey belonged to their group, but they did not understand why they were startled and thought they had abandoned it, fearing they would be captured again. They chased after it relentlessly, crossing dozens of mountains. After that, they never came again. Everyone admired his intelligence." Although this matter is different from the previous two, they all relied on superior understanding. Therefore, I have recorded them together.

### News from the Porcelain Department

— Zhou Jingxiang

Lord Ling Xiaohan'ge discussed the "porcelain" of Jingdezhen in this publication, expressing relief that it was not completely destroyed. The author has lived in Jiangxi Province for several months. Although I am completely ignorant of "porcelain," I have a high interest in appreciating it. When I have nothing to do, I always carefully observe the porcelain shops and chat with people in the industry. I will briefly describe some of my observations, which I believe will be of interest to those who care.

Although the Victory Kiln was added to Jingdezhen after the victory, the output of the Victory Kiln is not much. Among them, the innovative Victory Teapot can be considered a novel and popular product. On both sides of the lower end of the teapot spout, there are embossed circular Victory characters. This can be regarded as a representative work of the Victory Kiln and also a product of the "Porcelain Capital" commemorating the victory.

Although Jingdezhen has the title of "Porcelain Capital," it is actually a poor handicraft industry area. The locals call themselves "grass shoe heads" because seven or eight out of ten people wear grass shoes. As the name suggests, one should know the degree of poverty. The number of industrial workers is only one-third of what it was before the war. The capital of most factory owners is insufficient, so production is decreasing daily.

Exquisite fine porcelain is now rarely produced, and antique imitations are also becoming scarce. Usually, a plain body with fine painting is considered a high-quality product. There are also few successors to the talent of porcelain painting. Currently, Zhang Zhitang's horse paintings and Liu Yucen's bamboo paintings are considered famous porcelain painters. In addition, Zou Houwen's landscapes and Xiong Mengwei's flowers are also well-known old masters.

A teapot with a famous painting costs more than 100,000 in the market, and a small set of five stationery items requires 200,000. In the past two months, prices have increased by more than two times. A table of fine porcelain tableware costs more than 10 million, and ordinary tableware costs 5-6 million. People in the porcelain industry believe that porcelain prices are still cheap. They say: If you compare it with the price of colored pigments, the price increase of porcelain is far behind! This is also a fact.

Jiujiang is now a distribution center for porcelain. Porcelain shops are lined up like scales, with a shop every three steps and a store every five steps. They all display new and different patterns to attract passersby, which is a bit dazzling. Every time a ship docks in Jiujiang, it carries some porcelain out. However, the porcelain carried away is all of medium and lower quality. Fine porcelain sells more slowly.

Genuine old porcelain is very rare. Only Huachang Porcelain Shop still has some on display. Porcelain figurines, such as the Three Stars of Fortune, Longevity, and Prosperity, Guan Gong, Ji Dian, and Guanyin statues, are most exquisitely produced by Guanghua. Small pieces of painted porcelain are most numerous and exquisite at Lisheng Porcelain Shop. Because there are many porcelain shops, business is also dispersed, which still seems to be sluggish. Currently, the waterway is shallow, and the transportation of goods from Jingdezhen is greatly hindered. Transporting by manpower on land costs 500,000 per load, so the cost is getting more and more expensive.

Jiangxi's porcelain industry is still in a dim process. It urgently needs blood transfusions and heart strengthening to prosper. At the same time, quality improvement and retraining of technicians are also urgently needed. Because the craftsmen have a deep conservatism and lack new scientific technology, many people think of our porcelain expert, Mr. Du Chongyuan. He had the determination to reform the "Porcelain Capital," but he broke the entire renovation plan for the sake of the war and sacrificed his life in the remote Magicians' Hall. Not only did the country lose a specialized talent, but it was also a great loss to Jiangxi's porcelain industry! (Sent from Jiujiang)

### On Reducing the Burden on Students

— Tizhai

The other day, all the newspapers published the news that the Ministry of Education had decided to revise the secondary school curriculum standards to reduce the burden on students. It is said that the main subjects such as Chinese, mathematics, and English will be reduced appropriately. English will be no more than three or four hours per week, and mathematics will also be less than five hours, etc. This is naturally a matter worthy of discussion in the education community, although I have not seen any opinions on it to this day.

The call to reduce the burden on students existed before the war. The first person to propose it was Ms. Chen Hengzhe, who elaborated on her theory of the excessive burden on students in a Sunday essay in the *Ta Kung Pao*, citing her own children as examples. During the War of Resistance, the curriculum standards (based on the 25th year of the Republic, 1936) were revised. The main trend was to increase war-related technical courses such as military training and nursing, and the number of class hours for academic subjects was reduced, which can be said to be the implementation of Ms. Chen's proposal.

For the sake of the physical health of the second generation of youth, we absolutely do not oppose reducing their mental burden. However, we feel that there are many problems here that must be solved in conjunction; otherwise, although the burden is reduced, the benefits may not be there.

According to the intentions of the Ministry of Education, although regular classes will be reduced, more time for self-study will be added outside of class, which is the so-called self-study guidance. The term self-study guidance has been popular in the Chinese education community for many years, but how many can truly provide self-study and guidance? Only God knows. The prerequisites for self-study guidance are equipment and talent. Taking the hundreds of public and private middle schools in Shanghai as an example, how many have complete and well-equipped libraries and laboratories? How many teachers are truly able to fulfill their guiding responsibilities and have the ability to guide? I feel that there are many doubts.

Lin Yutang once wrote an article about self-study. He argued that universities do not need to spend so much money hiring lecturers and professors but should use the funds to expand libraries. A university student should have the ability to use books to increase their knowledge independently. Incompetent professors sitting idly in their positions are not as good as students reading a few more books. This is indeed true, and I think that in the process of education, there may be such a day, such as today's correspondence schools, etc., which are not this idea? However, at present, the most difficult thing is how to have such a sum of money to buy so many books. The funding for public schools is limited, and private schools don't even need to be mentioned. Even if they have money, they won't do it. Students' heads are almost empty except for Chinese textbooks, English textbooks, and trigonometry and geometry. They can't wait for the bell to ring and flock to the cinemas (movies are also education, but it's hard to say in Shanghai). Lower down, dance halls and Yue opera theaters are also the only places for them to pass the time. The teachers lecture until their throats are dry, but they are still confused. If they simply don't lecture, what will be the result? I probably don't need to say it again. Every year, when universities enroll students, people lament the low level of students. Is it that the students themselves want to be at a low level? Is it because there is too much homework and the burden is heavy that they are at a low level? I don't think we should put the blame all on the students. If I were to go to this kind of empty "school" at this time, there would probably be no other way to go than to be at a low level.

University professors go to be officials, and middle school teachers are promoted similarly. Today's middle school teachers also have some problems. But can we blame them? The salary is low, and they cannot make a living. Not to mention that the basic level and qualifications are not enough, even if they are, who has the mind to teach well? Who can have the leisure to improve themselves? With teachers like this and equipment like this, will simply reducing the burden on students have an effect?

However, in the current environment, what qualifications do we have to demand more equipment and improve the quality of teachers?

Chapter 5: Unexpected Calamity (26)

Qihuan was deeply moved by what Zhu Qi said. She felt that others could not forgive her, but he could. He could completely express the unspeakable pain in her heart, truly her first soulmate in life! At this moment, she was extremely moved, hugged Zhu Qi's arm with both hands, buried her face on the back of his hand, and cried! Zhu Qi also felt sad and comforted her, "Don't cry, your health is important!" The more Qihuan thought about it, the more heartbroken she became. She couldn't hold back her tears and cried for a while, venting all the stimuli she had received, the accumulated depression, and the grievances she had suffered. Only after this great cry did she feel a slight relief. She wiped her tears and said, "Only you can understand my pain. Not even my father, my mother, or my brother know. Not to mention others. If they knew I suffered this loss, I'm afraid they would laugh at me. I really have no face to go back." Zhu Qi said, "This is already in the past. Don't mention it again. Get well and go back. Who will know! Even if they know, they will only think you were injured in a car accident. Please rest assured. A person gains more experience and increases their knowledge. The hearts of people in society today are so sinister, especially you young ladies, so innocent and romantic. You don't know that people's hearts are so bad? You are lucky to be unlucky today!" Qihuan saw that Zhu Qi's words were considerate and called her "Miss," which showed how much he respected her in his heart and that he did not look down on her in the slightest. When she first met him, she only thought he was a handsome man. After talking to him, she only knew that he was honest and not a frivolous young man. Now, she saw that he was a sincere, enthusiastic, righteous, and empathetic man who deeply understood women's psychology. Such people are rarely seen. It's just a pity that he already has a wife! Gratitude and admiration intertwined, and although Qihuan didn't say a word of thanks, her eyes were full of affection, and her feelings of gratitude and admiration were revealed beyond words. The two chatted for a while, and Zhu Qi looked at his watch, which pointed to twelve o'clock. It was getting late, so he advised Qihuan to rest early and took his leave. From then on, whenever Zhu Qi had time, he would take the time to visit the hospital. For several days in a row, Qihuan's family and outside relatives and friends knew that Qihuan was injured in a car accident and was recovering in the hospital, but they knew nothing else. In the hospital, Qihuan only hoped that Zhu Qi would come early to talk, feeling that talking to Zhu Qi was more enjoyable than anything else. After a week, the wounds on Qihuan's face and arms had gradually healed. Zhu Qi received a mission from the head office to investigate the business of the Tianjin branch and came to say goodbye. When Qihuan heard that Zhu Qi was going away, even though it was for a very short time, she felt sad in her heart. After Zhu Qi went to Tianjin, every two or three days, she received a letter from Qihuan, reporting that his scars had healed, reporting that he had left the hospital and returned home, and hoping that he could return to Peiping as soon as possible to see her again. If he was late, she could not wait. It turned out that she was also leaving Peiping. (End of this chapter)

### In Memory of Comrade Zhang Puquan of the National History Museum

— Jin Gong

First Poem

Joining the Tongmenghui, at the age of twenty-four (in the thirty-first year of Guangxu, he and I joined the association in Tokyo), I was just a youth, running around like a shadow, advocating righteousness together, having faced danger several times, clearly a secret society (formed the Mingmingshe in Hongo District, Tokyo, secretly discussing revolutionary plans), relying on the eastern neighbor for protection.

Second Poem

Uniquely having extraordinary aspirations, sharing difficult and bitter years, a word related to revolutionary affairs, astonishing the four seats, driving out the Qing court, the Yuan government was new, the cattle and horses of Longmen, lamenting this cold year.

### On American Magazines

— Ze Shi

Since the victory, Shanghai has discovered many "American accessories," one of which is the American magazine stands near the popular street cinemas. They are filled with a colorful array, with several types such as Reader's Digest, Crown Magazine, and Life Magazine piled high, indicating good sales. I don't know how many copies of each fashionable American magazine can be sold in Shanghai, but the enthusiasm and abundance of stock probably compare favorably with ordinary Chinese magazines.

This is a phenomenon worth pondering. Shanghai is said to be an international city, but now it is a "city of American accessories." As far as magazines are concerned, although British magazines are written in a language similar to that of American magazines, they are nowhere to be found on the stands, let alone Russian or French magazines. Even if today's America is superior to Britain in terms of army, navy, air force, or other technical sciences, Britain is not necessarily inferior to America in education and arts. Since Chinese people can read English anyway, why do they flock to American English magazines and look down on British ones?

The scarcity of Russian and French magazines is, of course, due to the rarity of Chinese people who understand Russian and French. Why is it rare? This is certainly the result of Chinese primary and secondary schools only having English classes and no Russian or French classes. Chinese education authorities and the education sector advocate English education; public central primary schools have English classes in the fourth grade, and private primary schools with some church school characteristics teach ABCD in the second grade. An English expert once said to me: I believe learning English should start no later than eight years old. When asked why, he said, “My children all started learning English at school before they were eight years old. Whether their phonetic foundation was properly prepared, I don't know because I was already forty-eight years old when I learned English. But in any case, my children's Mandarin pronunciation is inaccurate, and they have lost much of their native accent. Is this a gain in English at the expense of Chinese, or is it like a hunchback somersaulting, failing on both ends? I don't know."

But the effect of Anglicized education has finally emerged, which is the increasing sales of American magazines. Reader's Digest is said to have foreign language editions, such as French, Spanish, and Japanese editions. I once wondered why there was no Chinese edition, but now I understand that since the Chinese intellectual class has become an English-speaking class, there is naturally no need to waste manpower and money translating it into Chinese!

However, there are good reasons for Chinese people to love reading American magazines. The content of general American magazines is different from that of Chinese magazines. In short, the former emphasizes life, while the latter emphasizes the world and the nation. It is not easy to determine who is right and who is wrong, but if someone prefers to read works that are closely related to life and does not welcome speeches about governing the country and bringing peace to the world, then it is natural for them to like reading American magazines that talk about life, and they should not be equated with those who believe that even the moon is better in America.

### Ode to Light

— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Long Sheng

It's actually childish and laughable to say that I lived in Chongqing for nearly three thousand dark nights, and spent this sixth of my life under the flickering light of vegetable oil and tung oil.

Like a firecracker exploding in the sky and earth, the sound of victory lightly touched my heart and it burst open. Like a child, I smelled the air, and upon entering the city, I smashed the "bright oil lamps," vegetable oil lamps, carbide lamps, and Mobil lamps to smithereens; celebrating the light, venting anger at the darkness: Ah! No longer writing and chanting poetry under this pitiful flame! Ah! No longer being a ghost composing poems in a autumn grave!

I wasn’t naive enough to dream that the moment victory arrived, the Chongqing power plant's new machinery would immediately fly in from overseas, generating 100,000 kilowatts of electricity to compensate me for the eight years of failing eyesight. Impossible! But I did have this expectation: after several organizations, a certain population, and several wartime factories returned east, how much electricity would be saved? The consumption of a place serving as the capital would shift to the light of an ordinary city, and there would be no more "power outages" no matter what.

For two years, my wife complained more than a dozen times, not because I broke the oil lamps, but because I shouldn't have exchanged two boxes of "fish candles" (Note: This is a Chongqing term, derived from whale oil) for cigarettes and turned them into wisps of smoke.

In the Northeast, the force of aiming practice was limited to burning an incense stick in the dark, placing it a certain distance away, gradually moving it further away, aiming and hitting the flame on the incense stick. In days without power outages, a 100-candlepower electric light had the same eye-training effect. Light lies in the ambiguity of existence. If you want to visualize it, it's best to use an idiom for criticizing Song Dynasty lyrics: "The idea arrives, but the brush doesn't." To put it more simply, it's like an old woman who can't sleep on a winter night in Jiangnan, sitting up and idly stirring the embers in her hand warmer. You should be able to appreciate this "artistic conception," right?

In addition to the fixed area power outages twice a week, sometimes the lights suddenly went out, which was called a temporary power outage. The people in the city were like ants spat on by a naughty child, immediately scrambling and bustling about, rushing to the small shops to buy candles and oil. It's not an exaggeration to say they were like ants. Often in dark alleys, "two ants" would touch each other, and without a sound, they seemed to understand each other and went their separate ways, never arguing.

Last night, I was teaching a night class at a journalism school when the lights suddenly went out. I stood on the high platform and watched the students and workers busily lighting a row of white candles on the table. I felt a bit self-satisfied, like Ah Q, as if I had ascended to the altar—becoming an angel, especially after the lights came back on and a halo (!) faintly appeared above my head.
