### The Prelude to the Great Annihilation War Begins: National Revolutionary Army of Shandong Recovers Yishui, Communist Army of Jiaodong Levies Grain to Transport to Dalian

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 9th] The great annihilation war in Southern Shandong has begun. The National Revolutionary Army, moving north along the Yi River, recovered Yishui on the afternoon of the 8th. This not only completely cut off the Communist bandits retreating to the Yunmeng Mountain area from their supply line to Zhucheng, but also completely trapped the main force of 120,000 Communist bandits, who had scattered to Qingtuo Temple, Duozhuang, Feixian, and Jiehe areas, within the pocket formed by Yishui, Linyi, Sishui, Mengyin, and Donglidian, which are encircling them. This is indeed a rare and easily lost opportunity for the National Revolutionary Army to annihilate the main force of the Communist East China Field Army. Strategically, the National Revolutionary Army has already taken an absolutely advantageous position. Furthermore, the main force of the Communist bandits is concentrated in a small mountainous area, where water and food are extremely difficult to obtain, which is also sufficient to deliver a death blow to the Communist bandits.

[Our Correspondent in Linyi, 9th] The fighting on the southern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains is fierce and intensifying. After four days and nights of encirclement and fierce fighting by the National Revolutionary Army, over 20,000 Communist troops from four columns, who had been rampaging around Qingtuo Temple and Tangtou Town, were annihilated. In addition, the Communist forces besieging Feixian have increased to three columns. Although they entered the city walls on the evening of the 7th, they have fallen into a counter-encirclement by the National Revolutionary Army and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 9th] The National Revolutionary Army, which attacked Gaomi from Jiaoxian, officially recovered Gaomi city before noon on the 9th.

[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 9th] The war in Western Shandong has become stable. The attempt of Liu Bocheng's troops, who had been harassing Heze, to flee south and cut off the Longhai Railway was completely crushed by the timely arrival of National Revolutionary Army reinforcements. The Communist army, unable to flee south to Laiwu, turned to bypass Wenshang with its main force and harass the outskirts of Ningyang. At the same time, the 8th Column of Chen Yi's forces, which had been fleeing west from Tusikou, also attacked Tai'an city after capturing Zhonggong on the 7th. In order to take the initiative, the National Revolutionary Army in the city voluntarily abandoned the city walls on the night of the 7th. In addition, the 3rd and 10th Columns of Chen Yi's forces, originally based in Zibo, and the Communist army on the north bank of the Yellow River, also attacked and harassed the area around Mingshui, Puji, and Yancheng. In order to maneuver, the National Revolutionary Army voluntarily retreated to the line of Longshan, Jieshou, Feicheng, Guyang, Qihe, and Sangdiandian on the morning of the 8th.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 9th] A portion of over 5,000 men from the 6th Column of the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces fiercely attacked Qingze on the 7th. The defending troops bravely counterattacked and repelled them on the morning of the 8th. Around Jixiang and Juye, approximately 20,000 men from the 2nd and 3rd Columns of the Communist bandits infiltrated on the night of the 7th. The National Revolutionary Army is blocking them and fierce fighting is underway. Caoxian was captured by over a thousand bandits on the night of the 7th.

### The Beitashan Incident Remains Unresolved: Outer Mongolian Army Continues to Harass, Repeatedly Attacks Baiyangou but is Repelled

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 8th] Qitai News: Since our Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with Outer Mongolia regarding the Beitashan incident, our troops, in addition to securing their positions, have hoped that this matter can be resolved through diplomatic channels. However, for more than a month, the Mongolian army, except for a slight retreat in the early stages of the incident due to criticism from world opinion, has continued to harass us from time to time in order to contain the actions of our National Revolutionary Army in Xinjiang. Its purpose clearly has broad political significance. At around 9 p.m. on June 26th, over 300 Outer Mongolian cavalry attacked our Usman troops south of Huzhi'erte (northern foothills of Beitashan). Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 27th, when they were defeated and retreated. At 3 p.m. on the 28th, a twin-engine fighter plane flew over our positions to reconnoiter and strafed with machine guns. At dawn on July 3rd, over 300 Mongolian cavalry attacked our Baiyangou (northern foothills of Beitashan). After fierce fighting, they retreated towards the southeast of the Baiyangou front at 2 p.m. During the fighting, one light bomber and one heavy bomber flew in to assist in the battle, dropping many bombs and strafing at low altitude. Nomadic civilians and livestock in our rear area were killed or injured. At 9 a.m. on the morning of the 4th, the Mongolian army attacked our Baiyangou positions again. After a day and night of fighting, the battle was exceptionally fierce. They were finally defeated and retreated at 10 a.m. on the 5th. The emotions of the military and civilians here are extremely indignant. They urgently hope that the government will make a final protest to Outer Mongolia to stop this continuous and shameless behavior, and return all the land it has invaded from our country, otherwise, effective measures should be taken to drive the entire Mongolian army out of our territory. It is reported that the Mongolian army has invaded more than 600 *hua xing* (Chinese miles) of Xinjiang. Bulgar and Chahantonggu and other places were invaded and occupied last year.

### U.S. Congressman Judd Calls for Aid to China, Praises Chairman Chiang for His Far-Sighted Vision

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] U.S. Congressman Judd urged the United States to provide greater assistance to China immediately when meeting with reporters today. Commenting on Chiang’s July 6th broadcast, Judd said: "Chairman Chiang told the people of the country that 'if the whole country does not unite to suppress the rebellion, the entire country will be lost.' This statement will prove to be correct in future history." Judd said that Chairman Chiang has a far-sighted vision. He has been aware of it in other countries for a long time. He had already foreseen the ambition of Japanese military aggression, just as he sees the scourge of the Communist Party today. Chairman Chiang never tolerates any country. He opposed Japanese aggression from the beginning. Chairman Chiang tried to reach a political solution with the Communist Party, but the latter made it impossible. Therefore, Chairman Chiang has no choice but to fight the Communist Party to the end, and he is well aware of all the difficulties he has encountered. Judd criticized the United States and other allies for abandoning China in a crisis and said, "Chairman Chiang must rise up to resist the encroachment of evil, just as he rose up to resist Japan in 1937." Judd said: "The United States' policy towards China is very short-sighted. The United States has procrastinated with communism and even promoted its formation. He said that the United States should immediately provide China with assistance, especially since China was an ally of the United States in the war and undoubtedly saved the lives of 100,000 American soldiers?

### The Crisis of World War III is More Serious in the Far East than in Europe: Speech by Sir Bland

[British Information Service, London, 9th] Sir Bland gave a speech on "The Current Situation in China" at the Overseas Building last night to a large audience, in which he made a predictive abandonment of his views, saying that the outbreak of World War III is more seriously dangerous in the Far East than in Europe. When he criticized the Yalta agreement regarding Northeast China, he said: "For the past hundred years, the Northeast has been the site of competition between Japan and Russia, and the final outcome between the two countries is unavoidable. Now that Japan has been defeated, Soviet Russia is confronting the United States in the Far East." Sir Bland praised Chinese culture, calling it one of the greatest achievements in history. Other empires built on force rose and eventually collapsed, but China still exists. Today, this ancient political system has become the past, and China is now struggling to find a new political system. In this country, where villages are the units of republican political systems, the experiment of establishing a centralized government has not been successful. Sir Bland further said: "I greatly admire the Chinese people, and I am an admirer of Chinese culture. I love the Chinese people and love their shortcomings, but I think that recognizing the shortcomings of the Chinese people is harmful and useless to them." When asked whether the Chinese language is an obstacle to the unification of China, he replied: The fact is just the opposite of what is asked. Chinese characters are a factor in uniting China. Although Chinese is difficult for foreigners to learn, it is more beautiful, more expressive, and more freely usable than other alphabets. Answering another question, Sir Bland said: China's economic situation is indeed very bad. There have been very few industrialization plans since the war, and its current export business is very small compared to before the war. However, China has just suffered a very kind of experience, and he is deeply convinced that China has not lost its ability to reverse the situation.

### The Control Yuan to Hold an Extraordinary Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Cooperation with Mobilization Work

The Control Yuan is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 9th, at which this matter may be discussed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] On the 8th, the reporter encountered President Yu Youren at the external public memorial ceremony for Yang Guangxing. When asked about the progress of this general mobilization case, Yu pointed out that since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the results of the victory have been reduced due to the Communist Party's division and interference, construction has been unable to proceed, and the people's livelihood has fallen into extreme pain and panic. At this point, it is necessary to remove all obstacles to peaceful construction and overcome all environmental difficulties. Peace, democracy, and unification are inseparable. Without unification, there is no peace and democracy. I hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will pursue this goal together.

[Another Telegram] All parts of the country have universally expressed their support for the government's call for general mobilization to suppress bandits and implement constitutional government. On the 8th, those who expressed their support to the government included the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, the Rongxi Sichuan Postal Service Association, the Sichuan Municipal News Reporters Association, the Changchun Municipal Temporary Assembly, the Guizhou Provincial Assembly, the Commercial Federation, the Henan Nanyang County Assembly, the Shanxi Provincial Temporary Assembly, the Ningxia Assembly, and various mass organizations. On the 8th, the Taiwan Provincial All Circles Public Memorial Ceremony for the Martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War and the Compatriots Who Died in the Disaster specially donated 100 million national currency and telegraphed it to the Ministry of National Defense, requesting it to comfort the soldiers at the front.

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 9th] Qihua Telephone: The military and civilians here were very excited to learn that the central government has issued the General Mobilization Order, and they all believe that it is time to suppress the rebellion and defend against insults. They quickly notified the troops guarding Beitashan of this news.

### Chunhua and Other Counties in Northern Shaanxi Implement a Scorched Earth Policy in the Cauldron-Shaped Area and Implement a Village Consolidation and Immigration Plan

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 9th] In the old cauldron-shaped area of Chunhua, Yaoxian, Yijun, and other counties in northern Shaanxi, the military authorities believe that the area has ravines and complicated terrain, with many mountains and little land, sparse residents, and frequent appearances of traitors and bandits, making it difficult to clear them out. Therefore, it is recommended that the Shaanxi Provincial Government implement a scorched earth policy in this area and completely transform it. The Provincial Government has decided to implement a village consolidation and immigration plan, ordering the residents in the area to move to designated locations outside the area and concentrate. The original area is designated as a restricted area, destroying roads and not allowing residents to re-enter to live and cultivate. However, the government will provide migration fees and allocate housing and arable land at the centralized location. The total cost is 200 million yuan. The Provincial Government will allocate it to the special commissioner's office in the area at one time for overall planning and distribution. The Malanzhen Beauty Post Office, which was temporarily established after the liberation, will be canceled at the same time, and the old jurisdiction area will be returned to the jurisdiction of the respective county governments.

### The Political Consultative Conference Becomes a Historical Term; The Organization of its Secretariat is Announced to be Terminated

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] The "Political Consultative Conference," an organization established to unite various parties to discuss national affairs, is now deemed unnecessary to exist. Therefore, the name of the Political Consultative Conference and the organization of its Secretariat have been formally announced to be terminated. It is reported that this decision was made because all agreements and decisions made since the establishment of the Political Consultative Conference have been rejected by the Communist Party, and the government has been able to implement the Constitution and convene the National Assembly in accordance with the implementation. The Communist Party has torn up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, refused peace talks, and the government, in desperation, has implemented general mobilization throughout the country. All parties that can participate in the government have already participated. After the promulgation of this General Mobilization Order, the government's attitude has been clarified, and the Political Consultative Conference has lost its effect. Therefore, it has been decided to terminate it.

The industrial section has also been revised based on the first phase of the economic construction plan and the industrial construction outline. The entire plan has not been reviewed and completed today. The meeting decided to recommend Chen Lifu, Xu Kan, Xiao Jie, Yu Hongjun, Chen Fang, Zhang Jiaxuan, and Weng Wenhao to conduct a comprehensive review. The meeting on the 9th was chaired by Xu Kan.

### General Mobilization Measures Under Study, Censorship System Not Heard to be Reinstated, Director Tung Hsien-kuang's Signed Response to Reporter's Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau held a press conference at its office at 4:30 PM on the 9th. Director Tung Hsien-kuang answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: Does "General Mobilization" mean that the government will utilize private individuals' foreign assets?

Question: Will central ministries or provincial governments undergo any changes due to general mobilization?

Answer: The implementation measures for general mobilization are still under study by the government. Before they are finalized, I cannot disclose the details.

Question: Where is General Chen Yi currently, and what position does he hold?

Answer: General Chen Yi is currently residing in Shanghai and does not hold any government position.

Question: After the implementation of the General Mobilization Order, will the government reinstate postal and telegraph censorship?

Question: It is rumored that China will implement military and general censorship systems. Can Director Tung provide a detailed explanation to clarify the truth? Is there any plan to implement a censorship system? According to the Xinmin Daily, all military news will be centrally released by the Central News Agency from now on. Is this true?

Answer: I am not aware of any government plan to implement general or military censorship. The report in the Xinmin Daily is not accurate.

Question: What is the current military situation?

Answer: In the past week, the National Army recovered the communist bandit supply bases of Nanma, Donglidian, and Linqu in eastern Shandong. It will now be much more difficult for the communist bandits in southern Shandong to obtain supplies from Hebei or Yantai, and they must take longer and more inconvenient routes. In the Northeast, the communist bandits who were defeated at Sipingjie retreated eastward to Xi'an and Xifeng and westward to Liaoyuan. The communist bandits are regrouping to prepare for a new offensive. The National Army moving southward in central Hebei joined forces with the defending troops at Jingtangpu on the 5th. Jingtangpu is located 15 kilometers northeast of Baoding. The 45,000 communist bandits under Chen Geng in northern Henan occupied Bo'ai and Qinyang and fled towards the north bank of the Yellow River, attempting to echo Liu Bocheng's offensive in western Shandong.

Question: Can general mobilization quell the internal rebellion as expected?

Answer: The vigorous implementation of national general mobilization indicates the government's determination to eliminate all obstacles to unification and national reconstruction. I firmly believe that this measure by the government and the awakening of the people will enable the task of quelling the communist bandit rebellion to be accomplished at an early date.

Question: Regarding the Dalian issue, has the Soviet side responded, or are there any other new developments?

Answer: There are no new developments regarding the Dalian issue.

[Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, 9th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, after discussing current affairs on the 9th, sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting the vigorous implementation of revolutionary diplomacy and the recovery of Lushun and Dalian to eliminate the source of unrest.

Sale of State-Owned Enterprises - Recent Developments

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, Director Tung Hsien-kuang gave a report at the press conference on the 9th. It is reported that the measures for allocating state-owned production enterprises to private operation, which are related to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, are: (1) The China Textile Machinery Corporation will sell 70% of its total assets. (2) The China Tobacco Company will be sold in its entirety. (3) The China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company will sell all of its original 40% of government-owned shares. (4) The China Silk Company will first issue stocks for 50% of its shares and sell them publicly. The recent developments are as follows: (1) China Textile Corporation: The company's assets are vast and its equipment is complex. To handle the matter carefully, experts and relevant personnel have been hired to form a valuation committee. Former Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun and Vice Minister Liu Siying have successively served as chairmen to date. The committee has held five meetings, and the valuation work is actively underway. (2) China Tobacco Company: The preliminary estimated value of the company's factories and three warehouses at the end of March this year was 61.4333 billion yuan. The first and second factories have been approved for priority purchase, totaling 6.9611 billion yuan. There are 65 cigarette machines, with a potential monthly output of 10,000 large cartons and an actual output of 6,000 large cartons. The profit for the 35th year of the Republic was 4.25 billion yuan. (3) China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company: The company's total registered capital is 6 billion yuan, with 40% being government-owned shares, which are offset by enemy and puppet properties taken over. The properties taken over are the Toyota Automobile Factory, the Fifth Factory of the Japan Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the Far East Steel Wire Cloth Factory, and two properties on Yuyuan Road and Emei Road in Shanghai. The market value was estimated at 4.575 billion yuan in mid-November of the 34th year of the Republic, which already exceeds the 40% of government shares. Recently, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee re-evaluated it at 44.2447 billion yuan. This amount will be sold to the people without the company having to transfer the accounts. This method has been directly reported by the committee to the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) China Silk Company: The company has three silk mills and one spun silk mill that can be used to issue stocks, with a total asset value of 6.33 billion yuan. All are valuations at the time of takeover. However, how to value and price them has been referred to the Executive Yuan for instructions. In addition, there are several units of silkworm farm research institutes left for experimental use and with no hope of profit, which have been approved for priority purchase, but the method of issuing stocks has not been adopted due to the different nature of the operations.

Furthermore, the press conference will be adjourned for one month during the summer, which has been agreed upon by the reporters attending the meeting on the 9th.

### Distribution of Japanese Reparations to Begin Soon, MacArthur's Headquarters Announces, China, Philippines, Netherlands Indies, etc. Asked to Apply

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the first batch of Japanese reparations will soon be distributed to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands Indies, Burma, and Malaya. These countries should submit their applications immediately. The reparations include machine tools, metallurgical machinery from former Japanese arsenals, and artificial rubber plant equipment. These factories are not needed by Japan's peacetime industry. The Far Eastern Commission stipulates that the first batch of reparations is 30% (China 15%, Philippines 5%, Netherlands Indies 5%, Burma and Malaya combined 5%). Representatives from all countries accepting reparations are present here. MacArthur has not specified a distribution date but expects it to proceed quickly.

[Another dispatch] Despite MacArthur's announcement today that the first batch of Japanese reparations will soon be distributed to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands Indies, Burma, and Malaya, many obstacles remain ahead. The Far Eastern Commission has listed surplus materials that can be used for reparations, including arsenals, aircraft factories, machine tools, shipbuilding facilities, steel mills, and power plants. Although MacArthur has proposed machine tools and some machinery this time, he has not specified whether these reparations constitute the full 30% of the first batch, nor has he specified when they can be dismantled and shipped. Officials at MacArthur's headquarters and representatives from China, the Philippines, the Netherlands Indies, Burma, and Malaya have not commented on these issues. However, machine tools are the only remaining industrial surplus in Japan that has been allocated for reparations based on a provisional plan. China and the Philippines are particularly keen to obtain power plant machinery.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] According to well-informed sources, the initial reparations include only two parts of the eleven or twelve categories of materials in the 30% temporary reparations plan. According to this source, the first step can only include a portion of the 30% because the full list of 100% has not yet been completed. The delegations of various countries in Japan have not yet received the list of factories included in today's announcement.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The Allied Reparations Technical Advisory Committee held its fourth meeting today to continue discussing the monetary value of reparations. Many Allied countries opposed the U.S. valuation method, believing that the U.S. valuation was "too high." It is also understood that preparations are underway to distribute more than 300,000 pieces of mechanical equipment. It is expected that a draft of the list can be completed within three months. After the list is prepared, the countries requesting reparations may submit their requests immediately, but the transportation of the reparations may be delayed until May or June.

### Taiwanese Provincial Government Receives Japanese Assets, Part to Be Used as Reparations

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 8th] The Taiwanese Provincial Japanese Property Handling Committee, after working for one year and four months, has recently listed in its final report the total amount of Japanese assets received in Taiwan, which was recovered from half a century of occupation in the previous year, as 15,665,535,108.37 Japanese yen. (Regarding this statistic, our correspondent in Taiwan reported a few weeks ago, which was published in this newspaper on the 27th of last month).

The Japanese assets left in Taiwan can be used to offset a portion of Japan's reparations to China when the peace conference with Japan is convened in the future. However, it is believed that the portion that can be offset will not be very large. According to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, only a portion of the Japanese assets received by China in Taiwan can be used as reparations, and not all of the assets can be used as reparations. For example, land seized by the Japanese from Taiwanese compatriots, military supplies left behind by the Japanese army, buildings of the Governor-General of Taiwan, and some concealed Japanese assets discovered by our side are all in the "non-reparations" category. Therefore, it is necessary to recalculate how much of the above total amount can be used as reparations and how much cannot be used as reparations.

### Chairman of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce Discusses Trade with Japan: National Goods Urgently Need to Open a Market in Taiwan

[Our Correspondent] Liu Qiguang, chairman of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce, is scheduled to go to Beijing today (the 10th). He told reporters yesterday that he will discuss the control of coal and trade with Japan with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Regarding the control of coal, the current method cannot encourage coal merchants to develop new mines. Taiwanese merchants hope that for the increased production quantity beyond the current output, half will be allowed for merchants to freely transport and sell, and the profits obtained will subsidize the losses suffered due to control. Under the new method, it is estimated that one million tons can be increased in production within a year, which will greatly benefit the coal shortage in North China and South China. Regarding trade with Japan, because the existing industries in Taiwan were all established by Japan, the parts of the machines cannot be used unless they are manufactured by Japan. Therefore, many factories are currently shut down. After the resumption of trade with Japan, it is hoped that Taiwan's sugar, salt, and fruits can be exchanged for a large number of Japanese-style machine parts. In the past, Taiwan was a market monopolized by Japanese goods. If national goods cannot open up a market in Taiwan in the future, then after a year, Taiwan will undoubtedly become the world of Japanese goods again. I have met with 27 national goods manufacturers in Shanghai and made three suggestions at that time: (1) I hope that business people in this city will organize a delegation to Taiwan for inspection; (2) I hope that a large-scale national goods exhibition will be held in Taiwan on October 25th of this year to commemorate the second anniversary of Taiwan's recovery; (3) Establish a Taiwan branch of the National Goods Joint Venture Company in Taiwan. All three points were accepted, which is very gratifying. At the same time, with the low cost of electricity and labor in Taiwan, developed transportation, and economic stability, it is an ideal location for industrial development. Therefore, I also hope that small factories in Shanghai will move to Taiwan to operate within a possible range. Japanese industrial materials for reparations can be allocated in large quantities to set up factories in Taiwan, and large amounts of idle funds in Shanghai can be used to buy Japanese factories that are stalled in Taiwan. If this can be done, it will definitely improve the industrialization of Taiwan and greatly help the national economy. Since the reform of Taiwan's system, politics and economy have become stable. In the future, we should gradually strive for prosperity.

Oppose Pauly's plan to retain 1.5 million tons of Japanese merchant ships and submit it to the Ministry of Communications for reference. (2) The cost of small steamers is too high. Request the government to provide appropriate subsidies and allocate government-priced coal. (3) Requesting the continued issuance of salvage and repair loans and extending the repayment period. The Maritime Affairs Paper proposed: (1) Improving pilot management. (2) Requesting the cultivation of maritime talents. The Port Affairs Group proposed: (1) Taking over the port affairs jointly managed by the Customs.

At the same time, a port management organization should be established by the Ministry of Communications to facilitate the takeover. (2) Transferring customs ship taxes to the Maritime Administration Bureau for collection. (3) Formulating port regulations. (4) Defining seaport engineering plans. (5) Establishing a port construction machinery team. (6) Completing the Tanggu New Port within a limited time.

### Business Delegation to Japan at the End of the Month, Completely False to Say They Will Go to the United States Instead

[Our Correspondent] According to a member of the business delegation to Japan, the rumor that the delegation will go to the United States instead is completely false. The Allied Headquarters originally hoped that the Chinese business community could produce a delegation to go there. Now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a document to explain this, and the number of people in the delegation is also being discussed. It is expected that it will be possible to make the trip by the end of this month. When private trade in Japan opens next month, 64 Chinese businesses will be able to participate. This number is equal to the number of British Empire businesses, second only to the United States. Our difficulties are nothing more than two: one is that transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and our U.S. dollar position is lacking; the other is that we lack exports, and some major exports are in competition with Japan. The purpose of the delegation's trip to Japan is to investigate the materials that each side can supply. As for the list of 64 businesses, the competent authority will review it based on the nature of their business, and this will take time. Regarding trade policies with Japan, Nanjing has repeatedly held meetings to discuss them. Taiwan occupies an important position in Sino-Japanese trade because the sugar, salt, and fruits produced there are urgently needed by Japan, and Taiwan's camphor can be sold to the United States. Taiwan has a good industrial base and a stable currency system. We should give American business people the opportunity to inspect Taiwan, and in the future, American capital may participate in Taiwan's economic construction.

### Chinese Communists Refuse to Stop Military Action, Yellow River Levee Restoration More Difficult, Talks Between Mixed Committee Yield No Results, Ministry of Water Resources to Issue Announcement Explaining the Process in the Coming Days

[Our Correspondent, Nanking, 9th] The Mixed Committee organized by the Government, the Chinese Communists, and UNRRA for the Yellow River levee restoration work held a meeting in Dongming on the 7th. The representatives of the Chinese Communists, Wang Huayun and Yang Gongsu, arrived at 10:00 AM. At the meeting, the representatives of the Government and UNRRA pointed out that the Chinese Communists' crossing of the river and harassment from the Jiekou area on June 30th hindered the Yellow River levee restoration project, and that the military issue should be resolved first. The representatives of the Chinese Communists did not agree and insisted on discussing the current state of affairs. The representatives debated fiercely for two hours without any results. The representatives of the Chinese Communists then stated that the mission of the Mixed Committee was different from that of the former Joint Committee, which only discussed the levee restoration issue. They had not received this order when they came, so they needed to return to Shandong to ask for instructions before they could continue the discussion. The talks were suspended at about 6:00 PM, and the representatives of the Chinese Communists stated that they must return to the north bank of the river on the 8th and would reply at 2:00 PM whether to continue the meeting. Subsequently, representatives of the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of National Defense, and UNRRA, Lu Zhenxing, Ye Nan, and Ding Zhizhong, returned to Bian on the 8th. In addition, the representative of the Ministry of Water Resources specially stated at the meeting that the Ministry of Water Resources expected that all dangerous projects on the Yellow River could be completed before July 10th. Now the Chinese Communists have suddenly crossed the river to disrupt the project, and all previous efforts have been wasted. If the south bank collapses, the responsibility should be borne by the Communist side.

[Another dispatch] It has been learned that Minister of Water Resources Xue Jianbi will issue a public announcement in the coming days to clarify the responsibility for the Yellow River levee restoration, explain the process of consultation and obstruction by the Chinese Communists since the Yellow River damming, and describe the repeated attacks by the Communist army and even crossing the river after the completion of the damming, as well as the convening of the Mixed Committee for consultation. The announcement will be made public.

Editorial

### How to Advance the China Reconstruction Finance Corporation?

The economic reform plan has been reviewed, and there are reports that it will be submitted to the National Economic Council for discussion today. According to the plan, many of the more meaningful suggestions for the current situation have been adopted, such as the establishment of the China Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It is reported that the National Economic Council has already made concrete decisions regarding this measure during its review, and we would like to offer our views to promote its early realization.

The so-called China Reconstruction Finance Corporation is essentially a counterpart to the Kōgyō Ginkō, or an industrial investment bank. Its most important task is to provide industrial capital to facilitate its development and financing. Therefore, the required capital amount is quite large, and cannot be compared to other general financial institutions. The reason for this is very simple: industrial capital must have two essential elements: low interest and long duration. Without either, it is not sufficient to fulfill its mission. Although current financial institutions seem to have a surplus, the industrial sector still feels that financing is difficult and capital is short. Despite the fact that the Joint Treasury of Four Banks accepts all kinds of industrial loans, with amounts ranging from tens to hundreds of billions, the financial difficulties of the industrial sector have not been alleviated. This is because the aforementioned two essential elements have not been fully met.

Why can't these two essential elements be fully met? There are naturally many reasons. There are too many banks and institutions, and the dispersion of forces makes it impossible to supply sufficient head offices, this is one reason; in name and form, each institution is divided and in charge of its own affairs, but in fact, most of them are still commercial in nature, this is another reason; the general interest rate is too high, and the interest rate on industrial loans is naturally raised accordingly. It is not easy to suppress. Doesn't the economic reform plan clearly acknowledge that there are unreasonable behaviors such as withholding interest and collecting handling fees? This is the third reason; the government's monetary policy is too unstable, sometimes quite loose, sometimes suddenly tightened, and the difference in the level of interest rates often exceeds more than one, making it difficult for the general financial and industrial sectors to let go and engage in their work, this is the fourth reason; because the value of the currency is too unstable, reducing people's interest in savings, especially long-term savings deposits, which are extremely rare, making it impossible for the financial sector to obtain funds that can be loaned out for a long time, but specialization has not been thoroughly achieved. In addition, the new banking law has stipulated for industrial banks: loans for agricultural, industrial, mining and other production, public utilities or transportation enterprises are their main business, and it is limited that more than 65% of the total amount of deposits they receive should be applied to industry. However, how to gradually adjust in order to comply with this provision also requires a considerable amount of time, this is the sixth. In short: whether various financial institutions are happy to accept this low-interest and long-term industrial loan is one question; and whether they actually have such sufficient ability is another question. Therefore, the establishment of this China Reconstruction Finance Corporation seems to be very necessary for the current national industry.

The question is how to raise the huge capital of this company? Raising commercial shares is, of course, a necessary part of the topic. There is so much idle capital in the market now; in theory, we can take this opportunity to absorb it in order to incorporate it into the right battlefield and assist production. However, the target of idle capital is probably not where the drunkard's intention lies. Judging from the results of the solicitation of US dollar bonds, it is obviously close to ideal to rely solely on commercial shares for funding.

Secondly, let the national banks share a part, which seems to be possible. In the past, industrial loans were often jointly borne by various banks. Now the situation is the same, and the goals are the same, but instead of turning small amounts into large amounts, it is handled by another fixed group in charge, and I believe that there will be no lack of collective efforts and optimistic success. However, the joint forces of the four banks are still unable to cope with the current needs of the industrial sector. Will their strength be expanded if they change their approach in the future? This is of course also a question.

The next is to absorb foreign investment, which is a very ideal requirement, and its possibility seems to be very high as long as the method is appropriate. Because this is a purely financial institution and a sound institution that promotes production, it does not contain any political implications. If the task of this institution, as intended by the original proposer, is to be expanded to include agency machines, raw materials, guarantee savings, remittances, etc., we believe that there is reason to arouse the interest of foreign investors.

The next is that the government allocates a part of the funds. Regarding this point, we would like to lend a hand to the government. The first is the handling of Japanese compensation factories. According to the government's unofficial statement, a price sale method will be adopted in the future. It seems that this sum of money can be fully or partially allocated to be used as the funds of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Because the money exchanged from the factory is still used to help the industry; it can be called justified. Moreover, according to the name, the Japanese compensation materials were originally to compensate the losses of both public and private parties. If it is inconvenient to directly compensate the losses of each individual due to various reasons, then directly using it to enrich the funds of China Reconstruction Finance is indirectly to supplement the vitality of the general national industry, which is much more meaningful than transferring it to other areas.

The second is to transfer the security deposit funds paid by various banks and institutions. This reserve has always been deposited in the Central Bank with interest. The new banking law has been changed to be deposited in the bank designated by the central authority in charge. If designated by the central authority in charge, the deposit to China Reconstruction Finance Corporation is legally compliant; and it seems very appropriate in terms of sentiment and reason to deposit it in the company with low interest, and the company still lends it to industry with low interest. As mentioned above, the difficulty of industrial capital lies in the longer period in addition to the low interest? This point, the security deposit in the original paying banks, although the deposits of its depositors are constantly changing, and as a result of innovation, the total amount payable; under normal conditions, there will never be a sharp change. Therefore, changing the payment to the Reconstruction Corporation is most suitable as a long-term industrial loan. Of course, from the perspective of the Central Bank's operation, this may be a loss. However, the Central Bank has wider sources of income and does not necessarily need this sum of money to operate. It has the responsibility to regulate and assist various banks; it should be able to support the full or partial movement of this security fund.

The government has confidence in the company's assistance, and we don't need to add our two cents. However, financial difficulties are a well-known fact. However, these two methods do not require the government to issue more banknotes, nor do they require the creation of another source of income. With a wave of the hand, the company can lay the foundation and quickly start its business. If we combine the other fund-raising solutions above and promote them at the same time, the company's required amount of gold, although large, will not be at a loss, and the financial difficulties currently faced by the national industry can be greatly helped.

For industrialized countries, this type of industrial finance is an indispensable organization; their names are not exactly the same, and their businesses may not be completely consistent, but the point of providing low-interest and long-term industrial loans is generally the same. Undoubtedly, the guidance and assistance of this type of financial institution is a major aid to their rapid development in industry. My country is currently facing numerous difficulties, and the oppression of high interest rates is a fatal injury to the industrial sector, so we hope that this plan can be established quickly, and we especially hope that all relevant parties will apply various possible methods to promote it as soon as possible.

### Franco's Test

Franco's Spain recently held a plebiscite, which in practice is somewhat equivalent to the popular vote in our theory of the five-power constitution. According to the Associated Press's message from Madrid, over 80% of the national population approved the head of state construction law submitted by the government for a vote, and absolutely trusted Franco as the head of state, and authorized Franco to appoint the royal family to succeed him. According to Reuters, there was no disturbance in the country that day. This is truly a major test for Franco. We seem to be no longer able to say that Franco's regime does not have the support of the people: over 80% of the national population supports him, which cannot help but make us have some feelings.

Franco's Spain seems to have been deprived of its civil rights in international politics. It is not a member of the United Nations, nor does it participate in various international conferences. All of this is due to the conspiracy and destruction of the International Communist Party. Since the Soviet Union opposed Franco's Spain's participation in international politics, and most countries after the war yearned for the beautiful dream of "one world" and did not want to break with the Soviet Union, under this situation, Franco's Spain could only seek its own development in "glorious isolation." However, what is worth noting is that although the US government has not publicly given Franco support, the US business and financial sectors have often provided assistance to Franco's Spain. Moreover, what is even more worth noting is that although the Communist Parties in various places continue to launch anti-Franco movements, the Soviet official sometimes sends autumn waves to Franco. Franco's Spain is worthy of our attention; in addition, if South America's Argentina and other countries that inherit Spanish culture are united, it is by no means shallow that it is related to the lasting peace of the world. We cannot follow suit and ignore Spain!

### US Still Hopes Soviet Union Will Participate in Marshall Aid to Europe Plan; Romania Refuses to Attend European Conference; Sweden and Norway Have Accepted Invitations from British and French Governments

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco 9th Broadcast: US Assistant Secretary of State Aima made a statement to reporters today, expressing the hope that the Soviet Union will reconsider its position of refusing to participate in the Marshall Plan. It is said that the more participants in this plan, the more effective it will be.

[Our Newspaper News] London 9th Broadcast: The Soviet Union's attempt to dissuade the Nordic countries from participating in the European Plan Conference has failed. Sweden and Norway have stated that they have accepted the invitation, and there are rumors that Denmark is also preparing to accept it. The Soviet ambassadors stationed in the above three countries only expressed their opinions to the governments of the three countries, saying that the Marshall Plan would undermine the sovereignty of the participating countries, but it seems that they did not intend to use diplomatic pressure.

[French News Agency Romanian Capital 9th] The Romanian cabinet decided this morning to refuse to participate in the European Conference.

[United Press Bulgarian Capital 9th] The Bulgarian Council of Ministers decided today not to participate in the European Conference to be held in Paris on the 12th of this month.

[Reuters London 9th] Among the 22 European countries invited by Britain and France to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Aid to Europe Plan, 12 countries have agreed to participate.

### Bevin Discusses European Cooperation; Praises Marshall's Economic Aid to Europe Plan; Particularly Pleased with the Transfer of Power in India

[Reuters London 8th] Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a speech at a luncheon at the Fulham Club today, expressing optimism about the situation in Europe and advising Europeans to abandon all obstacles to cooperation. He stressed that Europe needs unity and harmony, and that historical and ethnic prejudices that hinder cooperation must be abandoned. Bevin added: The issue of peace with Japan is causing a lot of headache.

When mentioning the situation in India, he believed that the transfer of power to the Indians was a great victory for British and Indian politicians. The fate of these 400 million people can be discussed and handled in a rational and agreed-upon manner, without resorting to guns, which is very gratifying. There is no serious unrest within the British Empire, as Britain is trying to meet the gradually increasing needs of its people. When mentioning the situation in Europe, Bevin believes that there is now a pleasant symbol that European problems can be dealt with on an economic foundation, which may be the greatest contribution to promoting European unity. Europe needs unity and harmony. The wounds it suffered during the war were enormous, but he is still optimistic about Europe's future. He hopes that the European people will abandon the historical or ethnic prejudices that hinder cooperation. He feels that in today's environment, impatience is another seed of struggle, so it must not be allowed to occupy human thought, and honest policies must be pursued to achieve the goal. When he met with the French and Soviet foreign ministers in Paris, he said that the continued existence of the post-war consequences in Europe should be stopped. He should do his best and cooperate with those who are willing to cooperate, and keep the door open to those who have not yet expressed cooperation. He believes that since those who are not very cooperative cannot be satisfied with words at present, they should be proven with facts. Just when European unity seemed impossible, Secretary of State Marshall suddenly called on Europe to unite and help itself without discussion, and allowed the United States to use its resources to assist the recovery of Europe, so that Europe would not suffer another catastrophe. As far as Europe is concerned, it cannot ask the United States any more questions or ask for explanations. Europe should take advantage of Marshall's generous offer and automatically engage in cooperation to show that the saying that Europe is divided is just nonsense.

### Security Council Discusses Balkan Situation; Soviet Representative Proposes Counter-Proposal; Full-Scale Offensive Against Truman Doctrine

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, August 8th Dispatch] When the United Nations Security Council resumed its contentious debate on the Balkan issue, Soviet Representative Gromyko launched a new full-scale offensive against the Truman Doctrine. In a lengthy and fierce speech lasting eighty minutes, Gromyko opposed most of the investigation reports and recommendations of the Balkan Investigation Committee, widening the gap between the Soviet Union and the United States.

At the same time, he submitted a Soviet counter-proposal to the Council. Although these counter-proposals are in fact destined to fail, they are intended to show the Soviet Union's repeated efforts to obstruct the Truman Doctrine's policy of preventing Communist expansion. Gromyko urged the Council to demand the complete withdrawal of foreign military personnel stationed in Greece and to establish a committee to ensure that any economic assistance provided by foreign countries is only used "for the benefit of the Greek people."

Gromyko subsequently vehemently rejected the recommendation of the United Nations to establish a special committee to continue monitoring the troubled region of the Balkans, pointing out that the committee proposed by the US representative could become a source of misinterpretations and expansion. He requested that the Council overturn the majority decision of the Balkan Investigation Committee and attribute the responsibility for the border incidents to the Greek government.

[Associated Press, Roswell, New Mexico, August 8th Dispatch] According to intelligence officials at the US Army bombing base here, the US Army has now obtained a "flying saucer," which landed on a pasture here last week.

Wright, the inventor of the airplane, believes that this matter is only a kind of propaganda to support the State Department's current movement, "to make us get involved in another war, so that people will frighten each other, thinking that foreign countries are taking action against us."

The Executive Yuan responded that it could be submitted to the Budget Review Committee for examination, and pointed out that the Zhejiang sea wall project receives a one-third subsidy from the government annually, suggesting this could be followed. Thereupon, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Shanghai Bureau of Public Works, who had accompanied the representatives to Beijing, explained that the Shanghai Municipal Government's finances were strained, and that its situation was different from that of Zhejiang Province. Furthermore, he emphasized that the requested amount was based on early estimates, and that if the funds could not be allocated promptly, the project's progress would be significantly hampered.

### Laid-off Workers from Jiangnan Shipyard Organize Petition Group, Set to Travel to Beijing Today

[Our Dispatch] Due to a lack of foreign exchange to purchase materials, the Naval Jiangnan Shipyard has laid off 309 of its 3,000-plus workers. The laid-off workers have been petitioning and appealing to various agencies daily, demanding four things: (1) reinstatement of employment, (2) opposition to alternating work schedules (working one day, off the next), (3) guaranteed employment, and (4) government allocation of foreign exchange for shipbuilding and construction. All currently employed workers unanimously support them. Yesterday afternoon, the laid-off workers also sent representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs to petition, but the bureau refused to accept the petition on the grounds that the Jiangnan Shipyard is a military institution. The laid-off workers have now organized a petition group and plan to send representatives to Beijing today, together with representatives from the General Labor Union, to petition the Navy Department and other agencies.

### Case of Japanese National Concealing Goods: Informant Files Another Complaint, District Procuratorate Reopens Investigation, Defendants Released on Bail After Interrogation

[Our Dispatch] A Japanese national named Liao Cixiong established the Zhonghe Hospital at 239 Lao Bazi Road during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. After Japan's surrender, fearing that the property and its contents would be seized by our side, he falsely claimed to be Danish and fraudulently registered the hospital with the Danish Consulate, applying for a land lease. After completing the formalities, he sold the hospital to Lü Jinfu, the owner of Kang Yi Foreign Firm. The agreed-upon price at the time was 10 million yuan. Lü, seeing that the hospital had over a hundred rooms, occupied a large area, had magnificent architecture, and complete sanitation facilities, and that the building was full of valuable goods, agreed to purchase it immediately, considering it a rare opportunity.  He was previously transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation on suspicion of concealing goods. Previously, after investigation by Prosecutor Cao Hong, the case was deemed a regular criminal "receiving stolen goods" case suitable for the amnesty regulations, and therefore, was not prosecuted. However, the informant filed another complaint with the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice has now sent the case back to the District Procuratorate for reinvestigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Cao Hong, who is handling the case, summoned defendant Liao Cixiong, Zhang Boquan, secretary of Kang Yi Foreign Firm, and related party Lu Yiyun for interrogation, and each was released on bail after interrogation.

### Daughter of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Found After Disappearance; Marriage-Related Stress Led to Running Away From Home; Acting Abnormally, Wandering at Hangzhou Station; Xie Liheng's Family Overjoyed Upon Receiving News

[Our Dispatch] Xie Zheng, the 28-year-old fourth daughter of Xie Liheng, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner residing at 20 Mei Fu Lane, Pike Road, disappeared from home three days ago due to a nervous breakdown. Just as the family was extremely anxious and searching everywhere, she was discovered at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's Hangzhou Station yesterday morning. However, the railway authorities were unaware of her identity. Initially, they noticed her wandering inside the station for a long time without leaving, and due to her

peculiar attire

and mysterious behavior, the railway police became suspicious. Upon approaching her for questioning, she remained silent, only shaking her head. They then took her to the local police precinct. The woman remained silent as before, only gesturing to indicate that she was a mute. Subsequently, they gave her paper and pen for communication. The woman quickly wrote on the paper, revealing her name to be Xie Zheng, originally from Changzhou, residing at 20 Mei Fu Lane, Pike Road, Shanghai. She was then temporarily detained. Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, the woman became terrified and, in desperation, suddenly

shouted for help

This made the police even more suspicious. After further interrogation, they telegraphed the Shanghai Police Department to notify the woman's family. The Xie family, who had been in a state of chaos due to their daughter's disappearance for three days, was both shocked and overjoyed upon receiving this news. Last night, the reporter visited the Xie residence and inquired about the details from her second brother, Xie Linshen. According to him: Xie graduated from Yunzhong Girls' High School in Shanghai in the early years of the War of Resistance, and then

went to Chongqing

to continue her studies at Sichuan Provincial Fourth High School, graduating and starting work at the Changshou Resources Committee in 1943. According to rumors, Xie was suffering from

marriage related stress

Initially depressed, her behavior gradually became abnormal. In the spring of last year, Xie returned east by boat, at which time

the whole family was delighted

Hoping that this would alleviate her mental distress. Unexpectedly, Xie remained unchanged, often showing signs of restlessness. The family then intended to arrange a marriage for her, hoping that this would lead to a cure. Who knew that upon hearing this news, she not only showed no interest but actually increased her mental illness, ultimately leading to the recent episode of running away from home. It is now known that the Xie family has arranged for her eldest brother to go to Hangzhou today to identify her and bring her back to Shanghai.

### Wage Dispute in the Civilian Shipping Industry: Labor and Management Both Petitioned Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Workers in the civilian shipping industry have been on strike for six days due to a wage dispute. Previously, the highest monthly salary for workers in the industry was 248,000 yuan, and the lowest was 77,500 yuan, in addition to alcohol money. Subsequently, the workers demanded a doubling of wages. The Bureau of Social Affairs, in conjunction with the Bureau of Public Utilities, stipulated that from May, the highest salary would be 744,000 yuan and the lowest would be 232,500 yuan. The management stated that it could not afford this, only agreeing to an increase of 1.1 times, so the workers began to strike. Through mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs, a compromise solution was proposed to increase wages by 1.5 times. The labor side indicated that it could agree to this, but the management still stated that it could not afford it. Yesterday, both sides sent representatives to the bureau to petition. The case is pending further mediation for a decision.

### Li Lili in Hollywood; Sun Yu Expected to Return This Winter

[Our Dispatch] The famous Chinese movie star Li Lili has recently been in Hollywood, observing American film production techniques. In the photo, standing next to Li is her friend, Hollywood star George Raft, who is currently producing a film called "Intrigue" at his own expense. The photo shows Li and George in front of the film's set.

Li was a key actress for the old Lianhua Film Company. In 1944, she went from Chongqing to the United States, which was the year before the victory of the War of Resistance and at a time when the Pacific War was tense. At that time, the United States had several films planned to be gifted to China, but there was an urgent need for Mandarin dubbing and suitable talent was lacking. Later, they learned that Li Lili was a famous Chinese actress visiting the United States, and she was invited to take on the dubbing work. After the victory, Li completed her mission and went to Hollywood. At that time, Sun Yu, the famous director of the old Lianhua Company, along with Si Tongmin and Zheng Yongzhi, also came to the United States to study. They jointly researched screenwriting methods until now.

Li recently sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, stating that she will return to China with Sun Yu in November of this year, because her husband, Luo Jingyu, is currently the director of the China Film Studio in Nanjing, and she may take the opportunity to showcase her talents.

### Master Scholar of a Generation, Hu Pu'an, Passed Away Yesterday; Funeral Today Followed by Public Memorial Service; Funeral Committee Telegrams National Government for Posthumous Commendation

[Our Dispatch] Revolutionary elder, master scholar, former Director of the Shanghai Gazetteer Office, and current Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Documentation Committee, Hu Pu'an (pictured), had been suffering from hemiplegia for years and recently contracted liver cancer, which proved incurable. His condition suddenly worsened the night before last, and doctors were helpless. He passed away at 3:50 AM yesterday, at the age of 70. His remains were moved to the China Funeral Home on Huashan Road yesterday morning. The cremation is scheduled for 2:00 PM this afternoon. His friends have established the Hu Pu'an Funeral Committee to handle the funeral arrangements. Yesterday's meeting decided: (1) to send a telegram to President Chiang Kai-shek to report the news and request that veteran members of the Party and State in Nanjing be listed as initiators to hold a memorial service on a fixed date; (2) to send a telegram to the National Government requesting posthumous commendation and to have Hu's biography included in the National History Archives; (3) to request the Municipal Government to allocate funeral expenses; (4) to hold a public memorial service after the funeral today. Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Zhang Yi and others were chosen to preside over the memorial.

Mastered Politics, Economics, History, and Philology from a Young Age

Hu Pu'an, a native of Jing County, was born on October 8th, 34 years before the founding of the Republic of China. From a young age, he studied the Confucian classics and history, excelling especially in philology. Before the founding of the Republic, he participated in the Tongmenghui, the Nanshe, and the Guocui Xuebao in Shanghai, promoting principles and advocating revolution. Subsequently, he served at the Minli Bao, Taipingyang Bao, and Zhonghua Minbao, and lectured at various universities in Shanghai. In 1916, he served as a secretary at the Ministry of Transportation. Later, he served as a secretary in the office of the Fujian Province Inspector General, and then came to Shanghai to serve as the Chief of the Compilation and Investigation Section of the Jing-Hu and Hu-Hang-Yong Railway Administration. At the same time, he continued to teach, serving successively as the Chairman of the Department of Sinology at National University and Chizhi University. In 1930, he served as a specialist at the Examination Yuan and also as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, concurrently serving as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. He resigned in 1932, continued to teach at various universities, and presided over the editorial policies of the Minguo Daily. In April 1939, he suffered a stroke, becoming hemiplegic, and remained at home, focusing on writing. His works, such as "An Ancient Historical View of the Book of Changes," "Commentary on Zhuangzi," "Theories of Confucianism, Taoism, and Mohism," and "New Interpretations of the Doctrine of the Mean," were innovative and formed his own unique perspective.

Confined Himself to Writing During the Occupation

During that time, the atmosphere of the enemy was menacing. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang secretly established an organization in the isolated island of Shanghai to control public opinion, called "Zhenglun She," dedicated to providing anti-Japanese and anti-puppet editorials to the newspapers. Mr. Hu was hired as the chairman. After Shanghai fell under enemy occupation, the environment became increasingly harsh. He confined himself to writing, remaining unwavering and unyielding, a spiritual fortress behind enemy lines. After the victory and restoration, the Minguo Daily resumed publication in Shanghai, and he was appointed as the president. When the Shanghai Gazetteer Office was restored, he was appointed as the director. When the Gazetteer Office became the Documentation Committee, he continued to serve as the chairman, working extremely hard. In his spare time, he continued to write and teach without tiring. His recent works, "Methods of Confucian Self-Cultivation" and "Absolute Theory of Philology," are particularly renowned works.

Liver Cancer Proved Incurable

Mr. Hu practiced what he preached in academics, was knowledgeable and insightful. Although he suffered from illness for a long time, he remained steadfast in his beliefs. His indomitable spirit was enough to overcome the invasion of the disease. It was only recently discovered that he was suffering from terminal liver cancer, and doctors were helpless. He finally passed away yesterday morning. He had three sons: the eldest, Daoyan, is a senior engineer at the Ministry of Transportation and is currently on his way back from the United States; the second, Daozhang, works in the news media; the youngest, Daotong, works at the Municipal Gazetteer Office. He had four daughters: the eldest, Weiping, is skilled in calligraphy and painting and married to a Mr. Xu, who has passed away; the second, (missing name), married to Chang; the third daughter, Qin, married to Sun; and the fourth daughter, Ling, is not yet married. His eldest grandson, Chuanjun, is only four years old.

### Terrible Accident on Yangshupu Road: One Killed, Twenty-Nine Injured in Vehicle Overturn

[Our Dispatch] At approximately 8:05 AM yesterday, a truck with license plate number 42970, belonging to the China Agricultural Machinery Company at 1314 Zhengdong Road, driven by the driver Wei Shaoming, was transporting technicians to the Hudong Jungong Road factory. When it drove to the entrance of the No. 17 Textile Factory on Yangshupu Dongting Road, a textile worker named Wang Xuemao attempted to cross in front of the truck. Wei braked suddenly, causing the truck to overturn. Wang Xuemao was crushed and his skull fractured, killing him on the spot. At the same time, twenty-eight male and female technicians on the truck were injured and were all sent to the hospital. Wang, the director of the Yangshupu Police Precinct, rushed to the scene with police officers to investigate upon receiving the report. The driver who caused the accident also suffered head injuries.

### Introduction to Employment Scam: Two Defendants Summoned, Only One Appears in Court

[Our Dispatch] Wang Daoyao and Wang Guangming colluded in fraud. Wang Guangming claimed to be the director of the Investigation and Guard Group of the Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee, responsible for recruiting over one hundred investigators and guards, each of whom could earn a salary of several hundred thousand yuan per month. At that time, many people seeking employment approached Wang, each paying an introduction fee of 320,000 yuan. More than forty people were deceived, collecting a total introduction fee of over ten million yuan. Afterwards, when the victims Lu Wei, Qiu Yougen, Miao Kaiyan, etc., realized they had been scammed, they filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Cao Hong, who is handling the case, summoned the defendants for interrogation. Wang Daoyao did not appear due to illness. Wang Guangming appeared in court for questioning and was released on bail pending further investigation.

### Private Radio Station Busted: Used Only for Providing Business Information

[Our Dispatch] Gan Jue, head of the intelligence team of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, recently discovered Qu Jinshan, Ku Kangnian, Huang Shuxi, Zhang Zhao'ou, etc., operating a private radio station inside the Huashang Hotel room 14 on Beihai Road. After investigation and interrogation, it was confirmed. Ku Kangnian confessed: He used to work for the puppet Central News Agency. Recently, due to unemployment, Huo Xiang, a friend from Nantong, who was a reporter at the Lianghuai Salt Field Commissioner's Office, wrote to him saying that several cloth shops and pig merchants in the area needed someone to send telegrams on their behalf because the telegraph bureau was too slow, so he consulted with his friend Zhang Zhao'ou, purchased parts, assembled a transmitter, and charged a low fee to solve his livelihood problem. After investigation by the office, it was determined that Qu and others had violated the ban on setting up private radio stations, but there was no evidence of collusion with bandits and they were not military personnel, so they were granted bail and the case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation last night.

[Our Dispatch] Cheng Shuzi, deputy manager of the Guoguang Grand Theater, planned to study abroad in the United States at his own expense. The other day, he purchased 500 American dollar bills and placed them in an envelope in a desk drawer. He then cleaned out the drawer, piling the miscellaneous items on the desk. Coincidentally, the maid asked him to take a bath. After Cheng went inside, the maid saw that the desk was messy and threw the waste paper, etc., into the wastebasket and dumped it into the trash can in the alley. Cheng had forgotten about the dollar bills at the time. It wasn't until the following afternoon that he remembered the matter and questioned the maid, who was speechless. Cheng then reported it to the Songshan Police Department, who sent police officers to take the maid in for questioning. After learning about the situation, the police officers investigated and learned that two second-hand cloth dealers were suspected and are currently conducting investigations.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation

(1) "Rice" Rent

Chen Huaxun asks: Last October, I rented a side room downstairs from landlord Mr. So-and-so, stating that the rent was five dou of rice, to be paid monthly in cash at the current market price. At that time, the price of rice was 54,000 yuan per shi, so five dou of rice was actually worth 27,000 yuan. Because I urgently needed a place to live, I had no choice but to agree temporarily. Now the price of rice has soared, and I can hardly afford it, and I can't imagine what it will be like in the future. I would like to ask: (1) Is it legal to calculate the rent in rice? (2) At that time, it was agreed verbally, and there was no contract, is it valid? (3) If I can no longer afford the rent, can I refuse to pay it? (4) If I refuse to pay it, what kind of procedures should I take?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) There is no legal basis for calculating rent in rice. (2) A lease contract that is not established in writing is regarded as a lease with an indefinite term. Verbal contracts are not prohibited by law, but those that violate the prohibitions of Article 71 of the Civil Code are invalid. (3) The parties can negotiate with each other fairly according to the law. (4) If negotiations fail, you can apply to the court for an increase in rent.

(2) Cohabitation Dispute

Chen Ziwén asks: Mr. So-and-so has been cohabiting with Ms. Jia for many years, and the woman even has a handwritten note stating "I will not marry anyone other than you for the rest of my life." Recently, Mr. So-and-so got into a conflict with the woman's mother while drunk. At that time, the woman's mother took her daughter back, claiming that she was breaking up with Mr. So-and-so and that she would remarry. Afterwards, although Mr. So-and-so pleaded repeatedly, it was of no avail. I would like to ask: (1) With the above evidence, can Ms. Jia be forced to continue cohabiting with Mr. So-and-so? (2) If Ms. Jia remarries, does Mr. So-and-so have the right to interfere? (3) If the son born to Mr. So-and-so and Ms. Jia is adopted by his biological mother after several years, can it be refused?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Since there is no formal marital relationship, cohabitation cannot be forced. (2) There is no right to interfere. (3) Although it is a non-marital son, the relationship with his biological mother cannot be rejected.

### Statement by the Joint Chamber of Commerce: Striving for National Assembly Legislator Seats, Ten Reasons Against Legislative Yuan's Reduction

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the standing directors and special committees of the National Joint Chamber of Commerce hosted a press conference at the Jin Gu Hotel. Chairman Wang Xiaolai, directors Zhu Huiqing, Ji Dianchuan, Qiao Senrong, and Shou Jingbi successively reported that the allocation standards for the number of legislators and National Assembly representatives from professional groups were unfair. The Joint Chamber of Commerce will unite with commercial organizations from various provinces, cities, and counties to fight for justification. The Joint Chamber of Commerce has organized a special committee, publicly electing Wang Xiaolai, Lu Xiaobo, Zhu Huiqing, Luo Qinghua, Wang Yizhai, Shou Jingwei, and Li Jianting as members to specifically engage in this movement, and has issued a declaration of more than 2,500 words, listing ten major reasons against the Legislative Yuan's reduction of the number of legislators and National Assembly representatives from professional groups. The main points are as follows:

Repeatedly Changing the Decisions of the Highest Conference

The number of legislative seats for professional groups was initially determined by the Supreme National Defense Council to be 119. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan arbitrarily reduced it to 56 through resolutions, while the number of professional seats in the National Assembly, 450, was passed according to the original number. The same object, but different resolutions; the same standard, but different amounts. Later, with the reorganization of the government and the abolition of the National Defense Council, the State Council re-determined the number to be 112. Unexpectedly, the Legislative Yuan changed it again, reducing it to 84, always using the excuse of wartime conditions and repeatedly making it a fait accompli before the adjournment, sending it to the State Council for reluctant retroactive approval. The solemn law, repeatedly resolved by the highest authority, stipulates, according to the "Outline of Legislative Procedures of the National Government," that "all draft laws are decided by the Political Council in principle, and the Legislative Yuan shall not change them." Now, the Legislative Yuan has repeatedly arbitrarily changed the decisions of the highest conference, which undoubtedly destroys the law and disrupts discipline, undermining the spirit of constitutionalism.

Furthermore, the legislators before the implementation of the Constitution were appointed by the National Government rather than elected by the people. Their nature was that of government officials, and the National Government was essentially their parent body. How can government officials resist government orders? Where is the discipline? Where does the national law exist? Now, the National Government, in order to accommodate the facts, readily approves the number illegally and arbitrarily determined by the Legislative Yuan, which does not meet actual needs, which is nothing less than cutting the feet to fit the shoes.

Disregarding the Social Department's Allocation Standards

The allocation of seats for National Assembly representatives and legislators from various sectors of the industry and commerce alliance should reasonably refer to past standards, review the total number of current members, as well as historical evolution, fairly determine them, and respect the opinions of the competent authorities, codify them, and form them into law for public knowledge. This time, the Legislative Yuan disregarded the allocation standards proposed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and arbitrarily allocated them out of thin air, as if giving alms, with highs and lows depending on their whims, obliterating everything, purely based on subjective likes and dislikes, taking the opportunity to maximize authority.

Standards and Proportional Increases Should Be Stipulated

The total number of National Assembly representatives exceeds 3,000, with only 13 from the business community, accounting for only 4/1000. The total number of legislators exceeds several hundred, with only 5 from the business community, accounting for only 6/1000. What is the basis for this? Even within the same industry and commerce, why are 17% of the legislative seats given to industry and commerce, while only 7% of the National Assembly seats are given? Moreover, considering the allocation of all professional sectors, is the standard based on the number of members? Or is it based on the level of knowledge? Is it based on the importance of the position? Or is it based on the quality of character? It is truly incomprehensible. We do not object to increasing the number of farmers and workers, and we also welcome an increase in the number of journalists and educators, but standards should be stipulated and proportions should be increased to ensure fairness.

Love for the Country Has Never Been Second to Any Sector

Commercial organizations in our country have a history of more than 60 or 70 years. They are interconnected throughout the country and serve society, and their love for the country has never been second to any sector. In every revolution, members of the business community have participated in every campaign, donating money and supplies without reservation. During the Northern Expedition, the contribution of our business community to the National Revolution, whether it was pre-war cover, mid-war assistance, or post-war effectiveness, was obvious and still vivid in our memories. Sun Yat-sen's declaration during his northward journey strongly advocated the participation of professional groups in politics. This can be described as learning from past events for future reference.

Greatest Sacrifice, Heaviest Tax Burden

During the War of Resistance, businessmen were the first to rise up, making the greatest sacrifices, and their tax burden was always heavier than that of any other group. They repeatedly braved dangers and difficulties, engaged in trade, strived for materials, and regulated supply and demand to prosper the rear and promote the overall mobilization of the national economy. Even when the war had not yet ended and the flames of war were becoming more severe, industrial and commercial enterprises were on the verge of collapse. The government painstakingly worked to salvage the situation, and industrial and commercial entrepreneurs also exhausted their wisdom and efforts to break through the difficulties and jointly plan for the country's prosperity and strength. If the political system discriminates against and oppresses them, wouldn't the government be undermining its own foundation and destroying its own strength to quell the chaos and build the nation? Those who are loyal to the country would never resort to such a poor strategy.

### Extortion Attempt Fails, Incites Labor Strike, Joint Logistics Headquarters Clothing Factory Requests Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, due to the need for bundling hemp ropes for this year's winter military uniforms, signed contracts with Yifeng Trading Company, Xintai Rope Company, and Xiyuanxing Rope Store to manufacture 200,000 catties of hemp ropes. The three companies then set up a factory on Manufacturing Bureau Road to supervise the work and expedite production, hoping to deliver the goods on time to meet military needs. A local gangster, Yang Baichuan (also known as Yang Haichun), actually extorted 20 million yuan with guns and axes, but failed. Harboring resentment, he incited the workers to strike because most of the workers in the factory were his followers.

At the start of the game, China United attacked fiercely, and Shi Jin and Shi You frequently launched fierce shots, but they either hit the post or were caught. However, Deqi was in the battlefield, and China United only fought with ten people, so the situation changed.

The Navy launched a rapid counterattack. In the 24th minute, center forward Sijishi got the ball and went deep, and Jun Gan rushed out too early, and was shot empty, China United lost a goal first.

Then the Navy got another chance to rush in, and in the mixed attack, the right auxiliary hit one with his head, two to zero, China United actually got a zero egg in the first half.

After the break, China United adjusted the obstacles, Hong Qi replaced his brother as the right wing, Jinhe as the auxiliary, and Yingqi changed positions with Bingzhao. This time, there was a bit of vitality. After five minutes, Yingqi got a chance at ten yards and kicked the ball. The ball rubbed the post and went into the net, leveling the score to two to one.

In the next ten minutes, China United was at its peak, but unfortunately, it couldn't get in. After a long attack without success, the downward trend appeared. It was repeatedly scored by the Navy for three more goals, before Jinhe grabbed a goal back, making it five to two at the end of the game.

Indeed, China United lost miserably, but because they were tired, lacked cooperation, how could they not lose! The Navy played fast enough and had enough combat spirit. Victory was won by hard work. Both sides of this game focused on the points and arranged the positions as follows:

(Navy Team)

Bulao Greenmei Ingre Sijishi Balan Shi Shidichen Lielun Long Shi Siditu Matatu Baliyun

(China United Team)

Tan Jun'an Xie Jinhong Huo Yaohua Luo Weiquan Guo Yingqi Liu Qingcai Li Shiyou Zhuo Shijin Li Bingzhao Li Deqi Xie Jinhe Li Hongqi

### Impressions of the Star Island Expedition (1)

[Central News Agency Singapore Air Dispatch] On Sunday, June 22nd, under the scorching sun, the ever-victorious Hong Kong Star Island Football Team was finally defeated 3-1 by the Malayan Chinese United Team (referred to as Ma Hua). This was Star Island's first defeat since the expedition, and the most surprising news in the football world in months. In terms of performance, this match was not very exciting. In terms of effectiveness, Ma Hua was indeed better than Star Island. The comparison of 3 to 1 is not an exaggeration. In fact, the Ma Hua forwards, if they had cooperated a little more, could have scored two more goals. Indeed, Star Island's defeat gave us a lot of stimulation and extra excitement, but in our hearts, we still feel unsatisfied and unhappy, because the entire Star Island team's performance that day was unusually abnormal. Winning under its abnormal situation inevitably leaves a kind of contemplative meditation. Before the game, the local newspaper boasted that this was a competition for the championship and runner-up of next year's National Games football tournament. The Hu brothers (Hu Jiao and Hu Hao) each held a view, and both had the belief that their respective teams would win. Under such circumstances, what we expected was a fierce battle between equally matched forces, but the result was a one-sided, lackluster little game. Ma Hua won, but it did not win happily. Star Island played four consecutive games here, and the lineup, except for the goalkeeper, has not changed.

Zhu Zhaoheng, Yu Yaode, Liu Tianshen, Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Song Lingsheng, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Zhu Yongqiang, Feng Jingxiang, Xiao Gaoshan Slave

(Zou Wenzhi's performance in the first battle)

In the first two games, the performances of the center forward Zhu Yongqiang, the left winger Liu Songsheng, and the left defender Liu Tianshen were the best. Overall, Star Island is weaker in defense and stronger in attack. The attacking technique is a short triangular pass, which is better than crossing from both wings. It is a pity that several first-class players were injured in Star Island's expedition to the Philippines. Therefore, in the several games in Singapore, the ideal lineup could not be presented. Left winger Cao Qiuting and inside forward Zhang Jinhai were two strong players who could not play due to injuries. Although Liu Songsheng was competent and happy to switch from left center back to left winger, it weakened the strength of the center back line a lot. Xu Jingcheng, the once famous center back, is quite different from the past. His clear head and feet are still there, but his heavy body has affected his agility. The former Xu Jingcheng was the best at dribbling the ball back and forth, but now he can only retreat as the third defender, not only losing the heroic spirit that used to run through the entire field, but even when defending against the enemy, he often makes blind mistakes.

### Purchasers of Cotton Yarn Allocated by the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association Should Deliver Goods Within the Time Limit - The Silk Textile Association's Fourth Committee Discusses Business Plan

[Reported by this newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association was held in the conference room of the association at 10:30 AM yesterday. Chairman Zou, Vice Chairman Wang, and committee members Liu Siying, Wu Weijing, Li Shengbo, Tang Xinghai, Rong Erren, Zhang Wenqian, Shi Fengxiang, and Yuan Zhongyuan attended. The discussion continued until after 1:00 PM before the meeting ended. The main cases discussed are recorded as follows:

(1) Chairman Zou presented a detailed booklet on the overall cotton textile adjustment business plan of the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association. The content can be mainly divided into two points: (A) Active aspects: National cotton spinning business construction plan, including raw cotton production increase targets, spinning spindle expansion numbers, and the enrichment of various textile machinery equipment. (B) Passive aspects: How to thoroughly implement the yarn and cloth adjustment policy, how to strengthen production, how to reasonably allocate finished products, including local distribution, supply to other cities, and promotion of exports. The attending committee members believed that the content of the plan was detailed and lengthy, and needed to be studied individually before providing opinions for discussion. It was decided to discuss it again at the fifth committee meeting to be held on the 11th.

(2) In order to avoid the cotton yarn jointly allocated from being used for hoarding and speculation, if the cotton allocated by the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association is not delivered within one and a half months after the purchaser takes delivery, the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association will take it back at the original allocated price.

Cotton Inspection Pending Decision

(3) In order to determine the quality standards of cotton in various regions in the second half of the year, and the method of inspecting cotton for water seepage and impurities, it remains to be implemented. However, whether the inspection work should be carried out by the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is still to be decided by the authorities for compliance.

(4) The six district cotton spinning guilds have submitted approximately 7,000 pieces of cotton yarn to the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association for joint distribution. The reservation orders for this batch of cotton yarn can be sent by the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association to the China Cotton Textile Construction Company today. Therefore, the amount of cotton yarn for joint distribution is expected to increase from tomorrow.

[Another dispatch] Chairman Zou of the association left for Beijing last night. It is heard that he will make requests to the central authorities regarding the future cotton textile adjustment policy of the association.

[Another dispatch] The association approved a total of 3,229 pieces of cotton yarn and 161,588 bolts of cotton cloth for transportation between the north and south in June. The allocation quota for transportation between the north and south this month is 5,147 pieces of cotton yarn and 239,337 bolts of cotton cloth.

### Yong Yarn's Capital Increase is Scheduled for Suspension - The Situation of the Chinese Stock Market Gradually Shows a Deadlock - There is Hope for Reducing the Margin for Forward Transactions

Chinese stocks fluctuated uncertainly yesterday. Before the capital increase, people were not without the idea of circulating Yong Yarn. There were still many蠢動in the middle. Finally, starting from the 17th, all current transactions must be suspended, and the new shares have an undetermined release date. Many stock holders inevitably took the opportunity to slip away at high prices, and retail investors were ultimately defeated. Except for Jingfu, which constantly absorbed chips at No. 204, the final result was stable, and the remaining stocks all declined in a step-wise manner, ending in a state of fatigue. Yong Yarn continued to call lower after closing. In the early morning, people's hearts were still firm, and the opening prices of the stocks were all higher. Yong Yarn opened higher to 10,700 yuan. After opening, Nos. 224, 231, 65, 76, and 89 all entered, rising from 10,650 yuan to 10,830 yuan. Nos. 61, 213, 4, 141, 235, 174, and 9 sold off, retreating to 10,750 yuan. Later, it was rumored that the representative of the broker was summoned to Beijing again, and that there was a saying that the margin for forward transactions would be reduced. Nos. 224, 89, 232, 154, 153, 102, 56, and 223 entered to 11,020 yuan. After that, although Wuhe was raised to the daily limit by No. 89, Yong Yarn was supplied and sold by Nos. 235, 152, 85, 148, 104, 91, 60, and 177, and gradually fell to 10,650 yuan. Except for Nos. 134, 223, and 14, which entered to 10,800 yuan, Nos. 91, 223, 94, 104, 125, 142, 232, and 149 sold one after another.

Nos. 224, 218, 55, 4, 155, 223, 226, 104, and 69 all entered, and the rising wind started quickly. There was a sudden short squeeze, and soon it leaped to a high price of 11,050 yuan. Nos. 171 and 157 took the opportunity to release the dragon, and the number forced to turn back. Soon Yong Yarn implemented a capital increase, and all transactions were temporarily suspended starting from the 17th. The date when the new shares will be released was not mentioned, but it was revealed on the market. Nos. 60, 224, and 152 also fell back to 10,550 yuan. Although Nos. 177, 77, 231, and 160 came to enter to 10,800 yuan, Jingfu gradually rose due to the efforts of No. 204, and the situation was quite strong. At the close, many were forced by time to sell off again by Nos. 112, 143, and 102, and closed at 10,650 yuan.

Buying Gold for Foreign Exchange is Probably Difficult to Realize at Present

There is a proposal in the economic reform plan to buy foreign exchange with gold. This issue has been submitted by the National Economic Commission to the Central Bank for research. It is reported that the relevant departments of the Central Bank have submitted opinions separately and will be sent to the Economic Commission for a final decision. According to Shao Zhenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, in his personal capacity, it is not appropriate to buy foreign exchange with gold today, because after implementation, gold will become a scarce commodity, and merchants who generally do not have foreign exchange will compete to buy it. The涨风is enough to be alarming, and it may stimulate gold prices, and other prices may also be fluctuated. A certain economic authority also has the same view, and believes that this measure is harmful and not beneficial, and does not agree.

### The Margin for Forward Transactions Deposited in the National Bank is Expected to be Accommodating

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 9th] An order from the Ministry of Finance and Economics requires that 70% of the 30% margin for forward transactions be changed to deposit in the National Bank. Various securities trading brokers feel inconvenient, because according to past circumstances, 80% to 100% of the margin for forward transactions is deposited in the China and Traffic Banks, and various经纪人 also handle delivery and settlement in the China and Traffic Banks, which can be offset on the same day. According to a person in charge of the Ministry of Finance who spoke to reporters, it is not necessary to change the deposit of the margin into the National Bank, or it can be handled accommodatingly. However, the original order was decided by the Executive Yuan, so it is always pending the final selection of the Executive Yuan.

### Good News for the Textile Industry - The Indian Silk Market Improves

This is indeed good news for my country's silk processing industry.

Textile Construction Yarn Allocation

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company, as usual, handled the joint distribution of cotton yarn on behalf of the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association, allocating a total of 1,747 pieces of yarn, all of which were allocated to manufacturers. A total of 238 purchase orders were received.

Rayon Advances

The market price of rayon fluctuated unstably yesterday, and finally closed with an advance. Although money is tight, there is still no sign of small reductions. Gaoshan Youguang, No. 120, opened at 30.6 million yuan in the morning, and the transaction was completed immediately. People's hearts were invigorated and continued to move forward. The highest bid was 1.6 million yuan for a double offer. It fell due to many parties dumping at high prices, and 30.7 million yuan was the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, because there was still no news on the allocation of goods, holders inevitably became奇居, and it rose again. The final price was 31.2 million yuan, with 500,000 yuan out, and the closing price was 1 million yuan higher than the previous day.

Factory Jing Steady

The factory Jing market was steady yesterday. Although rayon continued to rise, it was difficult to be optimistic about the market price due to the greater supply than demand. The high-uniformity five担头 did not close yesterday, and the asking price remained unchanged. There were slight transactions in零担, and the market price was slightly increased. The transaction price of high-grade 零担 C-grade goods was 33 million yuan, and the price of E-grade goods was 32 million yuan. Dry Jing was active, and a transaction of 21.3 million yuan was成交, and five arches lacked a transaction, but the shouting price rose by 500,000 yuan.

The last trade on the interval date was 1,100 yuan.

Glimpse of Opinions on Allocating and Selling Man-Made Silk

The silk weaving industry in the four districts was allocated foreign exchange by the government to purchase man-made silk from abroad to meet the needs, but the new and old meetings differed, and there were different opinions. Some proposed to allocate according to the allocation volume in December last year, and some advocated on-site investigation and re-distribution. According to the director of the industry association, it is most appropriate to re-investigate and actually allocate the actual dominant position, because the allocation volume in December last year was not uniform, and the silk goods weaving factory was also allocated man-made silk, and the one that actually needed man-made silk was allocated very little. Therefore, it is most fair to determine the allocation based on the current actual needs. There is no other appropriate delivery.

### Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Continue to Rise - Cause and Effect, the Number of Chips is Decreasing

Yarn: The price of cotton yarn continued to rise. It was heard that the Cotton Textile Adjustment Association's acquisition of private yarn accounted for 75% of the total output. People were worried, and the number of chips turned to exhaustion. The Changjiang Gang and Guangdong Gang frequently expressed intentions to purchase, coupled with the sharp increase in cloth prices, and people's hearts vibrated. The prices benefited and soared. The price slightly declined at the close, but it still rose a lot compared to yesterday. The highest price of 20-count special double horse was 12.4 million yuan, and the closing price was 12.2 million yuan, rising by 400,000 yuan. The double horse was 11.15 million yuan, up 450,000 yuan. The 24-count fine yarn was slightly higher, and the 16-count Guangming was 9.7 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan. The 10-count yarn was in season and the price was the most popular. The 10-count Boy Scout was 9.5 million yuan, which was almost close to the price of 16-count yarn.

Cloth: Cotton cloth叠创新高价, especially 12-pound龙头细布, leading the upward trend. According to people familiar with the industry, people outside the industry are not asked about the price of 龙头细布, and they are trying to purchase it. Today's off-site transaction, the price of 龙头细布 is 476,000, which is still difficult to collect. In order to avoid stimulation, the industry association will suspend the sale and purchase in the venue from today, and strictly investigate and prohibit non-members of the industry from entering the transaction. Moreover, in the future, transactions will also be suspended in the afternoon.

Cotton: Yesterday, the spot cotton transaction was very旺, and the cotton yarn in the venue rose back, and the trend was very firm. It was also heard that there was another adjustment to the negotiated price of cotton yarn, so the yarn factory did its best to absorb it first, and the customer also made up for it, and the market price rose slightly compared to the previous day. The opening price of each grade to送厂 was approximately 2.1 million for Lingbao, 2.15 million to 2.22 million, 1.94 million to 1.99 million for Shashi, 1.865 million for Hanxi, and 1.63 million for Firebird.

### Overview of the Work of the National Bank Discount Committee Since February - Approved Loans of More Than 36 Billion Yuan

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to make all circles understand the progress of the work of the National Bank Discount Committee in the past two months, the committee specially invited the local press to the committee's conference room at about 4 pm yesterday. The committee's Peruvian director, Lin Yue乐, reported on the overview of the committee's work in four points. The content of the conversation is briefly recorded as follows:

(1) The Central Bank Discount Committee was established in early April of this year. As of June 30, it has accepted 273 applications with a total amount of 84,265 million yuan, and has approved 209 loan applications with a total amount of 36.02 billion yuan. (2) President Zhang, and Vice Presidents Chen and Liu, all believe that increasing production is the most urgent task at present. They have formulated the Central Bank's measures for Shanghai commercial banks to apply for rediscounting. All are done with caution. The candidates for the Discount Committee are all leaders from the local financial and business circles. When discussing applications, they are moderately strict and gradually expand the mission of the Discount Committee. Recently, a procedure for handling industrial loan cases has been formulated as a guideline. (3) The Discount Committee strives to be simple and quick in reviewing loan applications. (4) The loan application procedures are also simplified.

[Another dispatch] Since the committee was established in early April, the loan cases and amounts approved each month have been increasing month by month. In April, there were a total of 29 loan cases with an amount of 1.01 billion yuan. In May, there were a total of 41 loan cases with an amount of 11.05 billion yuan. In June, there were a total of 139 loan cases with an amount of 23.96 billion yuan. The loans approved in June accounted for 66.3% of the total loan amount. It was also found that among the total loan amount of 36.02 billion yuan that has been approved, industrial loans accounted for 86.37%, and cotton dyeing and weaving industry accounted for the largest percentage of industrial loans, accounting for 11.85%. The wool textile industry was the second, accounting for 6.30%. The third was the underwear weaving industry, accounting for 6.08%.

### Foreign Currency Notes for Tea Remain Stable

The green teas like "Chou Chen" and "Chen Mei" which are exported to French Africa, have been actively inspected by a portion of exporters in recent days. Yesterday in the market, some buyers came forward to inquire about prices. However, the sellers' thinking frequently shifted towards firmness, and their willingness to sell was not strong. As a result, negotiations at the close of the market did not reach a satisfactory conclusion, and transactions remained at a standstill. The market trend, on the other hand, became increasingly stable. Domestic tea sales remained good, and the market presented a consistent state throughout the day, with prices remaining similar to the previous day. It is reported that this year's newly fried green tea from Wuyuan is in short supply, prompting merchants to transport it from the production areas. Currently, companies such as the Great China Tea Company have already transported the tea. However, due to high acquisition costs and all related expenses, the asking price is said to be considerably higher than before.

New Methods for Tung Oil and Bristle Purchases and Sales - Technical Aspects Still Under Study - Exporters Still Hope Not to Purchase Directly

The government authorities have revised the methods for the purchase and sale of tung oil and bristles. The China Trust Bureau will purchase from merchants in the production areas and then resell to exporters, who will purchase with foreign currency. The China Trust Bureau is preparing to implement this new method. However, many technical problems remain to be studied. According to leaders in the tung oil and bristle industries, this method is indeed an improvement over the previous one. People in both industries welcome it. Because domestic producers have a guaranteed outlet, and exporters can act as sales agents, the path for smuggling can be blocked. Regarding the China Trust Bureau's direct purchase in the production areas, it is still considered to be competing with the people for profit. People in both industries also hope that merchants will be entrusted to make purchases on their behalf.

### Wheat Loans Can Be Implemented Immediately - Total Amount is 60 Billion Yuan

[Report from this newspaper] The long-planned wheat loan has had its principles determined and is said to be implemented within days. It is reported that the wheat loan is divided into two parts. One part is an ordinary wheat loan, with the amount of the loan for each factory based on 1 billion yuan for every 1,000 bags of daily production. When applying for the loan, each factory must pay 30% of the loan funds. The estimated total loan amount is 60 billion yuan. The other part is a milling loan, entrusted by the government to the Fuxin, Maoxin, Hanfeng, Huafeng, and Yutong factories for milling. Each factory pays the loan funds in the same manner as the previous part. The total loan amount is approximately 100 billion yuan.

In addition, the flat-price flour allocation for this city in July will be supplied by each factory allocating 260,000 bags of flour each month after the wheat loan is issued.

### Export Promotion Association to Send Personnel to Investigate - The Situation of Wenzhou Export Goods

[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Association previously approved a letter from the Wenzhou branch of the Bank of China, roughly stating that sailboats in the area often carry goods for export and requested to settle foreign exchange with the bank, but it was unknown whether this was allowed. The association, not knowing the details, decided to send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation before determining how to handle the matter. It is reported that the association dispatched its specialist committee member Huang Yan and the vice manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, Zhen, to conduct the investigation yesterday.

Taiwanese Lumber Arrives in Shanghai

Currently, Taiwan's Phoebe zhennan and Hinoki cypress continue to arrive at the port, with sellers quoting prices between 6,400 yuan. European pine is stable, while Chinese fir is weak.

### Rationed Sugar Prices Increased

[Report from this newspaper] The Price Evaluation Committee's Sugar Evaluation Group held its seventh meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Because the exchange rate in the Taiwan dollar zone has recently changed again, the allocation price of the Taiwan Sugar Company's 23rd phase has also been discussed and adjusted, increasing by slightly more than 30% compared to the previous phase. The new prices, after being submitted to and approved by the Chairman Kai Xian, are announced as follows:

(1) Special grade cotton white sugar: 630,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 705,000 yuan for wholesale. (2) Grade A cotton white sugar: 580,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 650,000 yuan for wholesale. (3) Special grade granulated white sugar: 610,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 683,000 yuan for wholesale. (4) Grade B granulated white sugar: 550,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 616,000 yuan for wholesale. (5) Brown sugar: 510,000 yuan per dan for rationed sales, 571,000 yuan for wholesale. All sugar merchants may begin applying from today.

The Fifth Phase of per capita sugar distribution was resolved by the group at yesterday's meeting to continue, and sales will begin in early August. The prices are still to be discussed and determined.

### Small Yarn Factories in Other Cities - Requesting Allocation of Foreign Cotton

Seventeen small yarn factories in Changshu, Wuxi, Taicang, and other three counties recently sent more than ten representatives to Shanghai to request the Cotton Regulation Committee and the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee to allocate bulk cotton. After listing the reasons, they sent a letter to the Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District to appeal on their behalf. The main points are as follows:

In the past, the application for the allocation of foreign cotton by small yarn factories in various places was stipulated by the Textile Management Committee that those with less than 3,000 spindles would not be allocated. Several applications have been rejected. However, the spindles of small factories, if calculated individually, are insignificant. But if considered as a whole, the quantity is considerable from a production standpoint. They make a contribution to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Currently, large and medium-sized yarn factories in this city and other cities have obtained priority in cotton allocation. The production organizations of small yarn factories should be treated equally, regardless of size. Recently, cotton prices have been rising daily. The raw materials needed by the small factories, which together own 32,000 spindles, all rely on purchases from the black market. Their export costs are much higher than those of large factories, making it difficult to compete. They are on the verge of being unable to survive. In order to maintain the industry, regardless of the amount of equipment, the original regulations should be revoked. The foreign cotton stored by the head office should be quickly approved and allocated to facilitate production.

### Foreign Cotton Arriving at Port at the End of April - Cotton Merchants Request Exemption from Purchase

[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Merchants Association of this city stated that according to the regulations of the Central Bank, for those who had already arrived at the port before April 30 of this year but were unable to obtain a permit for foreign cotton outside the quota, the batch of cotton should be purchased by the China Trust Bureau. The batch of cotton owned by the members of the association amounts to more than 20,000 dan. In order to request the authorities to consider the difficulties of the merchants and exempt them from purchase, the association convened a meeting of member representatives at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It was decided to send Chairman Liu Xun-Sun, Director Chen Qing-Cheng, Sun Bing-Zhi and others as representatives to request the China Trust Bureau to exempt them from purchase.

### How America Attacks Communism - Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation

— J. Edgar Hoover

Americans are currently constantly reviewing methods of preventing communism, verbally and in writing, with insightful views, making it impossible for the American Communist Party to evade the truth and moral perspective, and exposing its despicable identity nakedly. The reviews of the Communist Party by the American cultural and journalistic circles are particularly worthy of our borrowing. The "Newsweek" published on June 9, with anti-communism as the central theme, published Hoover's famous anti-communist remarks, which are especially worth reading.

Our best strategy for defending against communism is our

American-style

way of life. The American Communist Party, in addition to secretly spreading rumors and causing confusion, attempting to weaken the people's belief in democratic work, will never be able to achieve its hope of subverting the government. We have the strongest democracy, more freedom and a higher standard of living than anywhere else in the world, but our government! It has been a guiding light in the world's disturbances for two centuries! It is currently the target of red fascist aggression in America. It is the mainstay of preventing the world from becoming a red fascist world.

We cannot ignore this aggression. We must encounter and pursue it head-on, but within American methods. We must avoid using the struggle methods of the Ku Klux Klan, South American Colombia, and some fascist countries, just as we avoid using the struggle methods of the Communist Party. Absolute leaning to the right and leaning to the left are equally dangerous. There is no choice between fascism and communism, both are totalitarian, anti-democratic, and anti-God. Both use rebellion and treachery to achieve their despotic and dictatorial purposes. We do not need to adopt the espionage system commonly used by fascism and communism to fight against the Communist Party.

We have worked hard to protect ourselves from espionage and sabotage during this war without sacrificing general civil rights. We can also use the same defensive strategy, democratic methods, and the American way of life to protect ourselves from the infiltration of communism.

Our most reliable weapon is the truth; the Communist Party really cannot stand the perspective of broad daylight. Their effective work is to wear a privately concealed mask. Lies and deception are their main tools. There is really no more despicable trick than them! But they are skilled at evading the words. Lenin's remarks, the "God" of communism, are their excuse. According to Lenin: "Revolutionaries must never take legal and illegal riotous ways to fight at the same time, that is the most undesirable revolution."

Maintaining the American-style way of life in the

Anti-Communist Struggle

The first step is to first expose the original goals of communism and then compare it with the American way of life.

The Communist Party has two organizations: one is the "periphery" and its tail is completely open. They engage in shouting deceptive propaganda and put forward many "trumped-up" labels: "anti-communist", "reactionary", or even "Hitler followers" to the people who reject their doctrines. Anyone who opposes the Soviet Union is a "fascist", "imperialist", or "dictatorial capitalist". Communist swindlers or communist teams also praise democracy, but they only "say what they say is not what we mean". They use "progress" as a word to hide their conspiracies in the false words of labor, social welfare, and education.

Another organization——the underground organization——is a communist team with strict training, they try to suppress the false and argumentative speeches of others, and tightly hide themselves. This is the most dangerous communist figure. The preface to the Communist Party Constitution states: "The work of the Communist Party is all to fight for peace and the elimination of fascism," which is the most typical deceptive language. We remember that when communism and fascism were once allies (referring to the German-Soviet alliance), the Communist Party said

Threatening the White House

Opposing the rental of numerous support, opposing the volunteer soldier law, and the American Mutual Defense Act. When the Soviet Union left its alliance and became an enemy of Germany, the American Communist Party changed its slogan overnight, and shouted to revitalize the Soviet Union, enrich military equipment, and open up a second front.

The fact that communist members plan to use armed riots as a means of revolution is evident in the open statements of communist civil servants. A teacher advised his classmates: "We must learn to hate the capitalist class, without hatred there is no struggle. We...the vanguard of the working class, must teach the workers to learn to hate... Facing bloodshed, we must make the blood splash on the streets, just as they washed Russia with blood, the workers must be organized, so that they can avoid failure when the revolution comes." The Communist Party almost unanimously believes that the revolution will not rise unless a "major crisis" such as a general strike comes, an external war can be transferred to a civil war or an economic panic?

We get a hint from this, that as long as we continue to work in a democratic way of life, the "major crisis" that the Communist Party never forgets will never come.

The Communist Party has especially regulated its consciousness for all party members. The Workers' Daily quoted Stalin as saying: "We thoroughly apply the methods that Lenin tried to use to cover the consciousness of party members... a party member absolutely obeys party discipline, contributes party fees and his job and work to the organization."

If we cannot have a broad understanding and understanding of the purposes and plans of the Communist Party, we cannot effectively suppress the coercion of the Communist Party. This understanding will drive the Communist Party out of the hearts of good American citizens. But where will this kind of information come from?

The American Press

And the broadcasting industry is very alert to defend against the threat of red fascism, and has done a commendable job of exposing the evils of the Communist Party. We are moving in the right direction.

I have noticed that speakers generally carefully use the name "Communist Party." It is a deceptive and dangerous move to apply the name "Communist Party" to those honest, upright American liberals and progressives, and the reason is only a difference of opinion. We must clearly distinguish between liberals and recognized communists. Although the Communist Party has flaunted that they are progressive, these millions of pure free and progressive people are the most powerful and decisive enemies of the Communist Party.

Newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and many specialized books that comment on communists are the most accurate sources of information. These will provide patriotic citizens with reliable facts.

Recent Congress

Interest in the Communist Party problem has been renewed, as can be seen from the activities of the House of Representatives "Committee to Investigate Actions Against the Interests of the American People". This committee is responsible for publishing facts about the activities of non-American forces within the United States. That work must also be obtained through the cooperation of loyal and patriotic Americans.

The committee has many valuable reference materials in its files, which, if used carefully, can be the best source of information for the referees. As for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it must keep all its files absolutely confidential.

American citizens must pay attention to all the facts related to their class. They must maintain a strong interest in and close attention to the organization of all the machines related to them and the schools that their children attend, and even what kind of people they are who are elected as public servants by the people in their trade unions.

Every citizen has the right and the responsibility to elect those who are loyal to the American way of life to take on the affairs of the country. A civil servant in a local government, state government, or federal government who is not loyal to the country may have a harmful effect on the country due to his treasonous behavior or the promotion of Marxist philosophy. Because the Communist Party claims that they are a political party, they should have the right to participate in the government, such as the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, etc.; in fact, they are only a part of the staff of an international criminal conspiracy, they are simply

Not a Political Party

—Trade unions have always been the goal of the Communist Party. The Communist Party has not forgotten Lenin's teachings: "In order to infiltrate the trade unions and progress and publicize communism, we will spare no sacrifice and use all methods, even if it is in conflict with the law, but we can skillfully conceal it and strive to achieve the goal." The American view of trade unions, as James Gambas said: "To be a good trade union member, one must first be a good American."

Communist members in trade unions—like Communist Parties everywhere—are subject to the orders of the highest authorities of the Communist Party. They absurdly conflate the purpose of the Communist Party with the purpose of labor and regard them as the same.

The Communist Party is the majority who are not affiliated with trade unions. At a recent Communist Party meeting, a labor leader admitted that Communist Party members only account for a local area

Union Members

Eighteen to nineteen percent of the number of people. In a union with 10,000 members, only 500 Communist Party members controlled the entire union. In another union, 8,500 members attempted to rescue the union from the hands of the Communist Party and failed, and the union only had 100 Communist Party members. What's more, a Communist Party member was able to influence the resolutions of the union meeting by using his hands.

Thoughtful American trade union members, if they are as concerned about trade union affairs as the Communist Party, may soon avoid the threat of the Communist Party.

### An Interesting Small Country in Southeast Asia - Strange News from Sarawak - The Overseas Chinese Vote Determines Which Faction Rules the Country

— Fuzhou, 4th (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu of this newspaper

Overseas Chinese from the Min and Guangdong provinces have footprints all over the islands of Southeast Asia. The Communist Party of China (CPC) controls the economic power of various overseas Chinese settlements, and also has a pivotal force in the rise and fall of local society. The reporter had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Wang Shiqin, a member of the overseas Chinese community who had just returned from the conquered country of Sarawak, who explained the process of the conquest of this small kingdom of Sarawak in great detail. The unique style and system of the country involved in it made people yearn for the ideal of the Republic of Maratha. In particular, the way in which an overseas Chinese vote determined the fate of Sarawak was quite interesting. Domestic newspapers have not yet publicized this, and few people in China know about it. I am writing this article to introduce it to the readers.

A Small and Abundant Country

The Kingdom of Sarawak was established in North Borneo, with an area of ​​almost 202,000 square kilometers, equivalent to a province in Guangdong. The country is divided into six provinces, and each province is divided into several counties. The capital is Kuching. There are many rivers in the territory, which is convenient for transportation. The population is about 340,000, about the same as Fuzhou. Among them, there are 70,000 to 80,000 Malaysians, more than 150,000 Dyaks (a brown indigenous people), and more than 110,000 overseas Chinese. The famous Sarawak reclamation movement in the 19th century was led by Huang Naishang from Minqing to colonize the land. Therefore, there are quite a few overseas Chinese throughout Sarawak. It is said that 105 years ago, British sailors arrived in Sarawak, occupied the area and established a kingdom, and lived there as kings. So far, it has been passed down to the third generation, ruled by Raja. Because of its small size, it has not had formal diplomatic relations with other countries. The domestic industry and commerce are quite developed. The agricultural products are mainly tobacco, fruits, wood, and rubber. The wood produced is called "Billiam," which is as hard as iron and does not rot for thousands of years. It is truly a treasure. The minerals are rich in gold, iron, and oil, among which the oil reserves are considerable. The oil source of the British Asian Petroleum Company mainly comes from the media fields in Sarawak. The gold reserves are also considerable, but they have not been mined extensively. The country has a vast territory and a sparse population, and the products are abundant, which also makes people's lives quite prosperous.

Officials Are Diligent and People Abide by the Law

This country claims that the country is peaceful and the people are prosperous, and the king is tolerant. Any people can meet with him. Administrative officials at all levels in the government often come into contact with the people, and widely solicit their opinions. There is no bureaucratic habit, the political atmosphere is simple and honest, and the relationship between officials and people is very good. People abide by the law and become a model. Even if they accidentally break the law, they all know to surrender to the court. There are few cases of wanted fugitives or arrests. Criminals sentenced to imprisonment can ask for leave to go home to visit their relatives, without having to find a guarantor. The court escorts criminals without the need for bailiffs, and only needs a piece of official document for the criminals to take to report themselves. There are very few cases of violations, and social order is stable. The government economizes on expenses and does not easily increase taxes to burden the people, and the people rarely evade taxes or smuggle. In the commercial market, credit is sought. It is difficult to guarantee the rootedness of the system on the land of Sarawak, which fully demonstrates the ideal of "emphasizing credit and cultivating harmony" in the world of Datong.

Owed War Debts and Relinquished the Throne

When the Pacific War broke out, Sarawak was also affected. At that time, King Ula Zha led the local Dyak natives to wage guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army, with British aircraft as cover, annihilating many enemies. The natives were brave and good at fighting, and it was their honor to cut off the heads of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army in Southeast Asia mentioned the Sarawak Dyak natives and all were silent. However, in the process of several years of war, Sarawak incurred a war debt of more than 20 million gold pounds to the United Kingdom. After the war, Sarawak was unable to repay such a huge amount. King Ula Zha, on the one hand, said that the United Kingdom was urgently demanding payment and could not be delayed. On the other hand, he did not want to increase taxes to burden the people. Under these two difficulties, last year, the King of Sha decided to hand Sarawak over to British rule as the price for repaying this war debt. The British had long coveted Sarawak's resources, and they also intended to accept it. When the time came, the King's younger brother protested to London, requesting that Britain should not take advantage of the danger to infringe upon Sarawak's independent sovereignty. As a result, two factions were formed in Sarawak, one supporting and one opposing the cession of independent sovereignty to Britain. The former was led by the King, and the latter was led by the King's younger brother, and a fierce political struggle began.

The Overseas Chinese Vote Caused the Demise of Sarawak

Finally, it was submitted to public opinion, and a public vote was held by the parliament. Before the vote, the strengths of the two sides were evenly matched, and the number of votes held by the two factions was exactly equal. Only the neutral overseas Chinese members' votes were the focus of competition. As a result, this overseas Chinese vote agreed to return to Britain. The Kingdom of Sarawak, which had enjoyed 105 years of history, was declared dead. King Ula Zha abdicated, and the British sent a governor to take over. This small kingdom has since fallen into colonial status and been included in the territory of the British Empire.

The people abide by the law and value credit, and the government is benevolent and close to the people. Although Sarawak is an insignificant small country, it has its own perfect and ideal society. From now on, it will be reduced to a colonial status, losing the spirit of independence and autonomy. We sincerely regret this. In particular, it is a strange thing that in the postwar world, when the weak nations of the world have launched a wave of national self-determination, they have actually handed over the sovereignty of the country to others.

The Leader of the American Communist Party, Dennis, Has Stopped Activities

Dennis, the general secretary of the American Communist Party, once organized the "Un-American Activities Committee" and vigorously promoted communism in the United States, and carried out fierce struggles in various production sectors. Later, due to attacks from the U.S. government and various sectors of society, its activities began to stagnate. The upper picture shows the posture of anti-communist veteran Burnell Thomas when he delivered an anti-communist speech.

### On the Responsibility of Ship Owners

— Wei Wenhan

Following the collision between the warship Fubo and the merchant vessel Hai Min, the captain of the Hai Min was detained. In addition to appealing to all parties, the families of the victims of the Fubo directly requested relief from the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the owner of the Hai Min. The manager of Liji Industrial Company was beaten and bled due to a labor dispute involving sailors. After the Zhongya steamer caught fire near Jiujiang, the families of the victims gathered and beat up the agent company. These incidents have been repeatedly published in prominent positions in various newspapers, arousing public attention to the issue of ship owners' responsibilities. The shipping business, like other businesses, is legally protected by national laws. However, in terms of its nature, it is a business containing risk. For example, wind and waves, tides, rain, fog, reefs, and other unavoidable collisions and strandings. Therefore, since the beginning of the ancient transportation industry, the rights and obligations of both ship and cargo have been stipulated. If the cargo is packaged, there are charter party agreements. If the cargo is shipped in small quantities, there are bills of lading. These regulations are based on conventions among maritime nations around the world. The most recent conference was held in 1922 in Brussels, Belgium. Based on these regulations, the United Kingdom enacted and promulgated the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act in 1924. The provisions of Section 4, Paragraph 2, are attached as follows:

Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising from the following:

A: Any unintentional or negligent act by the captain, crew, pilot, or employees of the carrier in the management of the ship or in navigating the ship.

B: Fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier.

C: All perils, dangers, and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters.

D: Act of God (force majeure).

E: War.

F: Act of public enemies.

G: Arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or people, or seizure or arrest under legal process.

H: Quarantine restrictions.

I: Any act or omission of shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative.

J: Strikes or lockouts or stoppage or restraint of labor from whatever cause, whether partial or general.

K: Riots and civil commotions.

L: Saving or attempting to save life or property at sea.

M: Wastage in bulk or weight or any other loss or damage arising from inherent defect, quality, or vice of the goods.

N: Insufficiency of packing.

O: Insufficiency or inadequacy of marks.

P: Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence.

Q: Any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier, or without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.

The above provisions are followed by various maritime nations, and our country should not be an exception.

Secondly, regarding the transportation of passengers and the injury or death of persons, since there are no regulations similar to bills of lading between the ship and the injured party, the rights and obligations of both parties are difficult to define. However, shipping is essentially a risky business, and many factors are beyond human control. Accidents and negligence are difficult to avoid. In principle, the above cargo transportation regulations should be followed. If a death occurs and the captain is immediately detained and charged with murder, and the ship owner is threatened with being beaten, the important transportation business will be seen as a dangerous path. This is truly not a blessing for the country and society. Therefore, our country must adopt fair laws and regulations of various maritime nations, enforce the law with reason, and make reasonable dispositions. Captains all hold licenses and perform their duties, and there is no risk of escape. Ship owners have ships and sufficient assets as collateral, and should not be detained for every matter, hindering the performance of duties and impeding transportation. Furthermore, the liability of ship owners for damages caused by ships is also limited. Article 23, Paragraph 1 of our country's Maritime Law clearly stipulates:

(Note: This article originates from the 1915 International Maritime Convention) The maximum liability borne by the ship owner is the value of the ship itself, the freight for that voyage, and the amount of compensation received for damages.

As for the employment of crew members, ship owners should have the freedom to hire without coercion or threat from any party. The establishment of labor unions is a legal organization. Its original intention should be to strengthen internal unity and improve service efficiency, and there should be no intention to force employers to hire. Even if the union is fighting for the right of introduction, it should strengthen its own organization and improve service efficiency so that employers are willing to accept its introduction and increase the close cooperation between employers and employees.

At this time when the National Federation of Shipping Associations is holding its inaugural meeting and people across the country are paying attention to shipping, it is hoped that our country's administrative and judicial authorities will follow the practices of advanced maritime nations and not place excessive burdens on ship owners. It is also hoped that labor union leaders will guide sailors onto the right track in order to achieve sincere cooperation between ship owners and employees.

### Examples of Song Lyrics

— Shui Chan

Edited by Chen Feishi, printed by Zhengzhong Book Company

This is a collection of lyrics recently published by Zhengzhong Book Company, included in the University Series. The author had previously used this book to teach others. The preface states the reason for writing the book: "In recent years, I have been forced to lecture on this subject, and the time is limited. It is not easy to condense a thousand miles into a foot, and to express vastness in an inch of heart. Moreover, it is unbearable to waste time in vain... Therefore, I first selected several poems from the twelve Song masters, attached my own revisions and annotations, and added my own humble opinions for the students to study, calling it 'Examples of Song Lyrics'." This book has not only been used by the author himself, but also borrowed by friends as a teaching material, and is indeed the best introductory book for learning lyrics.

This book selects six masters from the Southern Song Dynasty and six from the Northern Song Dynasty. The first rule in the general introduction states: "In my opinion, when learning lyrics, one should start with the Southern Song Dynasty and then the Northern Song Dynasty, and finally with the Five Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty. Modern historians use the method of reverse tracing. I follow this example, starting with Zhang Yan and ending with Yan Jidao, arranging them in chronological order, with the later ones in the front and the earlier ones in the back, so that one can go from the broad to the concise, and seek the source along the way." The six masters of the Southern Song Dynasty are Zhang Yan, Wang Yisun, Wu Wenying, Jiang Kui, Shi Dazu, and Xin Qiji. The author believes that "Ge Shunqing took Shi, Jiang, Wu, Zhou, Wang, and Zhang as the six masters, Zhou Yagui took Jiang, Shi, Wu, Wang, Jiang, and Zhang as the six masters, and Zhou Zhi'an took Xin, Wang, and Wu as the leaders. However, Jiang Jie's sense of life experience is the same as Wang and Zhang, and his carving skills originated from Wu. Zhou Mi also attached Tang to Wu," so all were abandoned. As for "Shi Dazu, he followed Qingzhen so closely that his every frown and smile were exactly the same. Although he was not an original creator, he was unmatched in this style after the Southern Crossing, so I dare not abandon him." The author's intention is to have beginners "first seek the elegant and upright sound from Zhang and Wang, use Wu to refine their breath, use Jiang to expand their mind, use Xin to strengthen their strength, and refer to Shi to look to the halls of the Northern Song Dynasty." The six masters of the Northern Song Dynasty are Zhou Bangyan, Qin Guan, Su Shi, He Zhu, Liu Yong, and Zhang Jidao. The author does not want to follow Ge and Zhou in using Zhou Bangyan to represent the others, thinking that "the guidance of the pioneers is not limited to one family. Su Shi's implications are lofty and his writing is ethereal. Qin Guan is elegant and graceful, and is a prominent master. He Zhu's skill in washing away the vulgar and his wonderful use of transformation are the sources of Zhou and Wu. Xiaoxuan is the conclusion of more than a hundred years. Liu Yong's lofty rhymes, strong rhymes, profound and majestic places, and subtle understandings are beyond the reach of others. The style of slow lyrics was also formed by Liu. The four are all taken by Zhou as models, and scholars should devote themselves to them." As for the Northern Song Xiaoxuan, the author only takes Yao Jidao as "the mainstay," from which to trace back to Li, Feng, Zhang, and Wen, "the torch is passed on, and the origin is easy to trace."

The whole book contains a total of fifty-three lyrics, twenty-seven from the Southern Song Dynasty and twenty-six from the Northern Song Dynasty, which is truly refined and concise. Each master is recorded with their life stories and the origins of their versions. Each poem is first attached with notes, then examined for rhythm, and then discussed in terms of lyrics. Each master is given their origin, and each lyric is given its essence. The author claims that "although one corner is small, it may be able to infer the other three; although the origin is small, it will eventually converge into the sea, because I want scholars to be able to infer other things of the same kind, and from this they can read, understand, and eventually be able to create." The author deeply regrets that lyricists "either refuse to reveal their secrets, or disdain to write them down, or else write fleeting and incomprehensible words, or pick up superficial theories, which are often chaotic and unorganized, so scholars grope and knock on the table, without knowing the mysteries, knowing the sentence but not the whole, knowing the whole but not the chapter." Therefore, he spares no effort to pass on his golden needles and write this book. Scholars who study it carefully will not have to worry about not being able to enter the room.

This book was originally a printed lecture note. It was written in 1927, and Xu Zhongke saw it and urged the author to publish it, but it did not come to fruition. It was hidden in a box for more than ten years. Later, the author fled to Sichuan to avoid the invaders, "and met Qiao Dazhuang in a cave, and they discussed it together, managing and overseeing it, as if they did not hear the rumble of the clouds." This was in October 1941. It took another six years before this book was seen. In the meantime, there have been many additions and deletions, which are slightly different from the original.

### Introduction to Sociology

— Na Ya

Humans cannot survive alone without society. Everyone knows this in this era. People can only survive in society, and everything in our society is complex and intricate. Therefore, we must understand this colorful society and strive to improve and reform a rational and happy social life.

This book first tells us about the relationship between society and people, and what the meaning of the ever-changing society is - here, it explains that everything in society is in a more or less changing progress; as well as the era of human struggle in the ever-changing society, to the era of human conquest of nature; and then explains the connection between the various eras and stages of human society.

Next, it explains the driving force of social development, as well as the contrast between the two worlds of capitalism and socialism. Although the explanation is very simple, it is very accurate.

Then, it talks about what kind of society China is. The author points out the backwardness of Chinese society, whether in economic or cultural aspects, the author clearly points out. Regarding the uneven development of Chinese society and its nature, the author also has very clear explanations.

Finally, in the conclusion, the author emphasizes that the development of Chinese society is to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

In order to avoid too many redundancies, I have only briefly introduced the main points of the book's content, and cannot cite the original text to elaborate on the content. This book is called "Introduction to Sociology", and the name is consistent with the reality. It is a preliminary path to lead us to study sociology.

### Educational Philosophy

— Yang Tongfang

Written by Lin Liru, published by Kaiming Bookstore

In the past ten years or so, domestic scholars have had three distinct perspectives on the study of educational philosophy. The first is a description from the schools of philosophical problems, culminating in the application of education. The aim is to organize the relationship between philosophy and education into a system so that the implementation of education can be based on philosophy. Second, to criticize one by one based on philosophical principles, to see whether the implementation of education is based on sound philosophical theory. Most people use this method to study educational principles. The third is to regard education and philosophy as two sides of the same coin, which are inextricably linked. People who hold this research attitude particularly emphasize the connection between educational philosophy and practical educational experience.

Practice cannot be separated from theory

Currently, the published monographs on educational philosophy are all written according to the first and second perspectives mentioned above. Few people study the third perspective, putting theory and method into one furnace, emphasizing the connection between philosophy and education, and there are no special books published. Recently, I read "Educational Philosophy" by Mr. Lin Liru, and I feel that it can meet the needs of the general public.

This is a manuscript compiled by the author in the winter of 1944 after the Japanese invaders successively captured Guilin and Liuzhou, and the Guilin Normal College went to Guizhou along the river. In addition to the "Talks on Educational Philosophy" published by the World Publishing House in September 1944 (written by traditional predecessors), Lin's book can be regarded as the only new work on educational philosophy in China. The characteristic of this book, in a word, is that the thoughts are systematic and have a center. In today's poor publishing industry, it is indeed a good book worth recommending.

Facing a new era, how should we grasp the progressive educational philosophy as a guide for educational implementation? This is what we must carefully consider. In the first lecture of the book, "Introduction", the author explains that it is impossible to abandon philosophical speculation and adopt an experimental and empirical attitude, and to pursue purely empirical scientific pedagogy. Because education is not a purely science, it must have a sound theoretical basis as a guide for practice, so as not to go in the wrong direction. "Correct philosophy starts from objective reality and explores its inherent laws from objective reality." This is worth remembering. The author also proposes the objectivity, practicality, class character and combativeness of educational philosophy. He gives educational philosophy the following definition: "Educational philosophy is a practical philosophy that explores the objective laws formed in the human world from the inevitable process of social growth, development and evolution."

Essence

The book first looks at the essence of education from the growth of human beings. Education is regarded as the learning activity of human society. Growth is developed in labor and practice. Education is also regarded as a social function, because human beings cannot leave education in order to adapt to social life, and the process of social life inevitably produces educational effects.

Regarding the purpose of education, most people put it on external powers and high success, which is too far away from the experience and life of the educated. However, education must have a purpose, because educational activities must avoid blind activities. We should "see countless relationships and countless interacting forces from the overall social life, and there are always starting points for improving human nature and many ways to achieve the goal."

Speaking of the effectiveness of education, the author first talks about the role of education for the educated, and especially emphasizes the great influence of the cultural environment of human society on the development of people's minds. Heredity is only a possible tendency, and its development is still determined by the environment. The effectiveness of education is immeasurable, as long as the educational role played by various social functions can meet the purpose that education should have, and various educational roles with different trends can be coordinated with each other under the principle of adapting to the development of human nature, the effectiveness of education will be displayed.

Method

After talking about the principles, let's talk about the method. The educational method is also the process of practice and learning activities. From the history of human evolution, we can see that education is everywhere in the practice process of human society. Dewey does not deny the practicality of learning. The author repeatedly states that educational methods and materials must be matched. If the method is mistakenly regarded as an isolated existence, it will fall into the mire of idealism. He said it well: "The method is really the way that people understand the relationship of natural changes, and thus use it to control natural changes in order to achieve the goal." Regarding learning methods, psychology has made the greatest contribution. He cited the learning psychological method provided by Gestalt psychology, which is "insight" into the situation. The quality of the learning method depends entirely on whether the learner can see the details related to the specific purpose in a specific situation. From this, the author points out that the difficulty or hindrance of learning is due to the fact that the various interrelated details in the environment are hidden and not easily grasped. The complexity of the phenomenon is of course a reason, but most of it is still due to errors in practice. Sincere and lasting practice is the only way to discover the truth and the only way to learn anything.

New trends in educational research

After reading this "Educational Philosophy", you will definitely feel the educational theory. The educational philosophy proposed by the author is based on dialectics, and the social view of education is recognized very correctly. In the last lecture, "An Overview of the Evolution of Modern Education", four valuable arguments are mentioned again: such as (1) What pedagogy wants to study is not limited to the tangible school education facilities, but to regard education as the process of personality growth and the process of social growth and development. (2) The foundation of pedagogy should be extended to various cultural sciences and draw on all sciences. (3) The status of pedagogy is not limited to applied science, but must develop into an independent science with its own position and autonomy. (4) The research of pedagogy should go beyond principles and methods, and further explore the laws of personality growth in the transformation of social growth and development, then explain the laws of historical and social educational phenomena.

### Family Education

— Xiao Chuanwen

Written by Chen Heqin, published by Huahua Bookstore

The remarkable feature of this book is that it explains and explains the specialized knowledge of child psychology and education with simple and clear examples. The problems raised in it are what every parent encounters and what every parent needs to get answers to.

Domestic educators have written many specialized and excellent books on children's education, but it is rare to find a book that embodies specialized theories in simple and concrete examples and elaborates on them, making readers feel as if they are not reading a book or listening to a lecture. Mr. Chen's book can be regarded as a rare one. The whole book is more than 220 pages long, with a text of no more than 300,000 words, but the richness of the content included is almost all-encompassing. It makes the reader feel as if they are sitting in an educator's laboratory, watching him teach and caress children. The main objects of the author's research are his own two children, and he also cites the children of his friends as examples. With the attitude of a child educator and a loving father, he stands in an objective position and gives enthusiastic guidance and calm observation, so the examples from the students are very kind and approachable, and the interest is overflowing.

The author first points out the characteristics of children's psychology, and awakens readers to pay attention to the various behaviors that occur with the development of children's various psychological states, and what kind of education methods are needed to guide them. For example, children's nature is to imitate and be curious. Parents should not only understand that this nature is good, is the key to children's knowledge, but also must go on to guide them step by step, lead him to the right and broad road, and cultivate his spirit of pursuing and researching external things. For example, children like to play, parents should make children have playmates and participate in group life, and give play to his happy nature.

The author also explains the basic principles of children's learning. Due to children's innate abilities, that is, the gradual development and growth of sensation, association, and action, so the implementation of education should be based on the stage of psychological development and give appropriate education. Children's learning is to first feel external stimuli, then combine what they feel with all the feelings, and then generate corresponding actions to respond to external stimuli. This basic principle of learning actually includes the central ideas and principles of all children's education. The author elaborates on this principle, applies it to the actions and behaviors of children's daily life, and takes this as the guide for the entire principle of educational implementation. The author can also use simple and clear examples to repeatedly explain and explain this principle, so that readers can understand it and understand it at a glance. If the author has not personally practiced it and put himself into the field of children for precise objective research and observation, he would never be able to do it, and this point may be the biggest feature of this book.

Based on the above-mentioned basic principles of children's learning, the author especially makes readers pay attention to the fact that parents should give children appropriate stimuli, so that they have a good environment, guide the children's reactions, correct their mistakes, and consolidate all the children's associations, so that they can develop effective actions.

Perhaps some people think that this book is too ordinary and trivial, and what it describes are all platitudes. That's right, the object of family education is lively and innocent children, and its nature is ever-changing and different in an instant. Is it better to explain it with formulaic principles or with actual and concrete examples? The most salable point of this book is that the author pays attention to observation, supervision and instruction in daily life, and obtains vivid examples and experiences. These examples and experiences can be explained by educational principles, but they may not be completely regulated and restricted. In other words, the examples in this book are obtained from innocent and lively children, not from empty and rigid theories. In short, this book is not a lecture in a school classroom, not a speech by scholars and experts, it is a lively and interesting description of ordinary daily events. School teachers can use this book as a textbook for education subjects, and family parents can use this book as a practical guide for educating their children. The author does not know Mr. Chen, and has no intention of deliberately promoting it, but I hope that all parents will have a copy and see what it tells you, which is exactly what you hope to get answers to day and night.

### "Soaring People"

— Yuan Ren

Compiled and translated by Jiang Si, published by Zhonghua Book Company

In the current stage of paper being expensive in Luoyang, children's books and juvenile books do not seem to be as vigorous and energetic as they were in previous years. This reflects the gradual decline and demise of children's literature, which is a loss to both the youth themselves and the publishing industry.

Recently, we are very excited to see "Soaring People" compiled and translated by Jiang Zong, just as Wei Bingxin said in the preface: "Of course, this is not a great work, but compared to the shoddy and poorly made goods that are copied from the east and west, it is at least one level higher." This is the truth. The stories compiled and translated in the whole book are about scientists, educators, and great men of the times, and are full of the central ideas of being positive, progressive, optimistic, and liberating. For a successful person, it does not exhaust its task of preaching, but tells the younger generation with the relaxed and lively tone of literature, with what kind of successful trajectory, depicting the facts of implying struggle to subdue the environment. Zhu Yixin said in the preface: "We use the active stories of human beings to provide mental food for young people, and undoubtedly we should choose these materials." I agree with his words and also congratulate the young people.

I am a youth now, and I think everyone should cherish his youth, this is a book that encourages you to work hard and fly up. It is a book about people's struggle with the environment and victory. I sincerely recommend it to young people and parents.

### Critique of "Night Play"

— Keng Qiang

(Written by Nie Gannu, published by Gaijin Publishing House)

Mr. Nie Gannu is known for his essays. His essays are sharp and powerful, carrying a bit of a "Lu Xun style." Originally, I always felt that someone who writes essays is not suitable for writing novels, thinking that the sharp tone is somewhat incompatible with novels. However, after I finished reading this book "Night Play," my view completely changed. I realized that someone who writes essays is also suitable for writing novels, especially short stories.

"Night Play" contains five short stories, and naturally, all five short stories have substance. Unlike some short story writers who often like to include one or two bad ones among several good stories, like a butcher selling meat with bones. Among the five short stories here, two are about the scenery of Sichuan during the Anti-Japanese War, two are about the work of political workers, and one is about a simple story behind enemy lines.

Generally speaking, the scenic pieces in "Night Play" are successful in expressing emotions. For example, the first piece, "Wine Boat," is a good example. Here, the author almost paints a picture, depicting all the scenery along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. From this, we can see the stuffy wine boat, which is like a small cigarette shop, with colorful cigarettes on the shelves. Next to the shelves is a counter with wine bottles, teacups, pickles, and oily noodles. At the head of the counter is a charcoal stove cooking something, and on the other side are two square tables and benches, with several people sitting there chatting. Such a scene is very familiar to anyone who has been to Sichuan and can easily evoke memories.

However, in another piece, Mr. Nie's true feelings are still successful, which is the last piece, "Younger Brother." Here, he arranged two tragic characters: an older brother who is strong and cares about face, but also cares about the country; and a younger brother who is lured by the sinful society and willingly degenerates. The older brother has thousands of contradictions in his heart. When he returns home from afar and sees the bare walls and his beggar-like younger brother, he is very angry. Why would a young man degenerate to such a state? But when he thinks about it, remembering that the person standing in front of him is his own brother, and thinking about how corrupt society was at the time, making it difficult for young people to control themselves, he forgives his younger brother. He says that as long as his younger brother is willing to listen to him and get rid of those self-deprecating habits, he can take him out, find him a job, and find him a wife. But what is the result? The older brother's hopes are dashed. A person who voluntarily jumps into the river cannot be pulled ashore. This piece reminds us of the Italian writer Giovanni Papini's "Prodigal Son," but the protagonist in "Prodigal Son" eventually repents, while the protagonist in "Younger Brother" eventually sinks deeper and deeper into the quagmire. This is the difference between a comedy and a tragedy. Although we cannot say that Mr. Nie Gannu's work can surpass Giovanni Papini's, he has at least ensured that Papini does not have a monopoly on this subject.

Comparable to "Younger Brother" is "Night Play." Here, a petite bourgeois woman is depicted. She is the daughter of the village chief, and she wants to do national salvation work, but she also dislikes being with a group of "vulgar" villagers. She has the reserve of a young girl, but she also believes that love is more important than work in life. There are many such women in China. During the war, how often did we see a petite bourgeois woman who ate well and dressed well participating in national salvation work? Shouting slogans may be their forte, but the actual work is done by those simple, earthy villagers.

In terms of content, this is a realistic short story collection. There is almost no shadow of fantasy in the five stories. Originally, in such an era where everything is in a precarious state of flux, what can a writer rely on to ease their conscience and write some frivolous articles to gloss over the situation?

### Introduction to Cai's Criminology

— Ting Guang

(Criminology, by Cai Shuhang, priced at six yuan, published by Independent Publishing House.)

In the late Qing Dynasty, due to social and economic changes caused by external factors, Chinese jurisprudence also embarked on a new path. However, for decades, in the field of Chinese jurisprudence, especially in the area of criminology, there have been few works that do not simply imitate Western works in a formalistic way, but are able to conduct in-depth explorations of Chinese history and society, and are actively constructed into a system by the author himself! Until recently, we were able to read a satisfactory book: the first volume of this Criminology by Cai.

The book is divided into five chapters: Chapter 1: Criminology, Chapter 2: Criminological Thought, Chapter 3: Criminal Law, Chapter 4: Chinese Criminal Law, and Chapter 5: The Position of Criminal Law in the Legal System. It not only emphasizes concepts but also strives to reflect social reality and fully express the author's personal thoughts and opinions. In the section on the development of Chinese criminological thought in Chapter 2, the author launches a stern critique of the tax laws of previous generations. Based on his personal observations and research on the historical and social background of China, he presents us with a path that Chinese criminal law should take in the future! In the section on the rational form of Chinese criminal law in the future in Chapter 4, he expresses boundless hope.

He puts forward some unique insights in this book. For example, although the Great Qing New Criminal Law promulgated in the second year of Xuantong is generally considered to belong to the type of criminal law in the scientific period, he points out that the promulgation of the Great Qing New Criminal Law was the beginning of China's entry into a semi-colonial state and reflects China's semi-colonial nature. There are many other similar incisive arguments.

Overall, we can find that the author's consistent approach is to attempt to integrate the general principles of criminal law with the special provisions of criminal law, to connect theory with practice, to apply processes on the one hand, and to grasp the entirety of criminal law from the legal system on the other hand, in order to demonstrate the position of criminal law in the order of national and social life, and to integrate legal concepts, methodology, and ethics into one furnace, in order to enhance the philosophical and scientific nature of criminology. It is a pity that the writing is somewhat difficult to read, but it is indeed an unprecedented good book in the still nascent field of criminology. I hereby offer a sincere introduction, and hope that Mr. Cai will quickly fulfill what he told us in the preface about the second and third volumes that he is preparing to write but has not yet written, so that they can be published as soon as possible, in order to add some vitality to the currently impoverished field of jurisprudence and provide some progressive insights.

### Being Out of School and Unemployed

— Shi Lang

The summer vacation has just begun, and students and their parents are already worried about whether they can afford the huge tuition fees after the summer vacation.

Recently, schools often invent various names to squeeze money from students, especially private schools. Someone runs a school as if they are opening a bank, and the students are the targets of the "banker" (principal) to squeeze. There are school building fees, teacher training fees, compensation fees for damaged public property, Boy Scout uniform fees... There is a long list that is unclear. When the school term starts, the school takes in a huge amount of property, and then the profits roll over, the principal becomes the general manager, the principal's wife becomes the accounting director and cashier, and the students become "goods." The principal can do whatever he wants.

People who run schools for the sake of "making a fortune" are everywhere. This is not an exaggeration on our part.

Due to price fluctuations and insecurity in life, the fees for these private schools, and the payment items listed for the next semester, will definitely kick the children of the general middle and lower classes out of school.

It is estimated that a private middle school will have to pay at least two million or more next semester, and a private university is even unimaginable.

Because the fees for municipal and national schools are relatively low, taking Beiping alone, each municipal middle school has already reached 6,000 applicants, while the quota for municipal schools is only 200. May I ask how these many students will be accommodated?!

Shanghai is the place with the most students in the country. If the authorities do not make arrangements in advance, they will become students who are out of school in the student community, and in society, they will become unemployed.

According to estimates a few months ago, the number of unemployed people in Shanghai has exceeded two million. Now, if these young people with no education and no job really withdraw from school, you can imagine the serious consequences it will cause.

Being out of school is not a terrible thing in peacetime, but at this time and place, schools cannot accommodate them, and society cannot provide them with employment. What will these young people who wander the streets do?

Here, we don't need to propose any specific solutions, but we hope that the authorities can plan ahead and find a way out for them in advance!

### Sino-Mongolian Border Treaty

— Meng Ping

After the Beitashan Incident in Xinjiang, our country protested; at the same time, the Mongolian People's Republic recognized by our country also launched a counter-protest, and the Sino-Mongolian border issue attracted the attention of the world.

The government has lodged two protests and gathered experts from all sides for research. In the future, there will inevitably be a strong debate on the Sino-Mongolian border treaty and its demarcation, as can be proved by this Beitashan incident.

In history, the Qing Dynasty's successive treaties with Russia are probably the ones where a vast territory was lost in a muddle-headed and unconscious manner. Since the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 (the eighth year of Xianfeng), the Treaty of Beijing in 1860 (the tenth year of Xianfeng), the Treaty of Tacheng in 1864 (the third year of Tongzhi), the Treaty of Kobdo in 1869 (the eighth year of Tongzhi), the Treaty of Tarbagatai in 1870 (the ninth year of Tongzhi), the Treaty of Ili in 1882 (the eighth year of Guangxu), and the Northeast Treaty of Kashgar, the Treaty of Kobdo and the Treaty of Tarbagatai in 1883 (the ninth year of Guangxu), and the Northwest Treaty of Kashgar in 1884 (the tenth year of Guangxu). Every survey and every treaty invariably involved the secret cutting of land, and this cutting of land was done unconsciously. We cannot but sigh at the lack of geographical knowledge of the people in charge at the time.

Reports say that Soviet troops have entered Tacheng, but the news has not yet been confirmed. But we cannot help but think of the story of the Russian army occupying Ili under the pretext in 1871 (the tenth year of Tongzhi). However, the imperial Russia at that time still claimed that "China would recover Ili, and after Xinjiang was settled, it would be returned." When the Qing court protested, it claimed again that "the Russian government has no intention of annexing it, and when Chinese authority can be exercised in this area and the security of the national border can be guaranteed, it will be returned."

There will inevitably be many disputes in the future Sino-Mongolian border treaty. We think of the Qing Dynasty's successive treaties with Russia, which resulted in countless losses of territory, and we also think of the Qing Dynasty's failure to recover Ili and the incompetence of Chonghou and Zeng Jize, who were unable to recover rights and interests. Looking again at the colors of Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the nine eastern provinces on the map hanging on the wall, it is too late for our nation to rise up and become strong again.

It is not only necessary for the government to gather experts to study the Sino-Mongolian border and its treaty, but it must also be strengthened!

### Idle Talk About Manuscript Fees

— Liu Yun

Writing articles to earn manuscript fees is not something that started today. It's just that in today's world, there are all kinds of ways to make a living, and none is more clumsy than a writer using brainpower as capital for a "livelihood." Workers' salaries can still be adjusted monthly based on the cost of living index, but how can writers' compensation compete with "dao" and "magic"?

Manuscript fees used to be called "brush fees," based on the idea of "virtue enriches the person, wealth enriches the house." Its "enrichment" is limited to the brush, which can be said to be taking without harming integrity. In fact, according to the notes and novels, the huge "brush fees" of ancient writers are staggering. Song Hongjin's Miscellaneous Notes: "The practice of writers receiving brush fees has existed since the Five Dynasties and Song Dynasties, and it began in the Tang Dynasty; Pei Xiu received millions in gifts for his writing; Huangfu Shi wrote the Fuxian Temple stele for Pei Du, and was given carriages, horses, and colorful silks in great abundance, but Shi still thought it was too little, and Du also rewarded him with 9,000 bolts of silk. Bai Juyi wrote Yuan Zhen's epitaph, and was thanked with saddles, horses, fine silk, and jade belts, worth more than six or seven hundred thousand. When Pei Jun died, his son took ten thousand coins to Wei Guanzhi to ask for an inscription." People in the Tang Dynasty attached great importance to their posthumous reputation, and filial sons and virtuous grandsons had to seek "brushes as big as rafters" to write epitaphs and inscriptions for their ancestors. If writers did not take the opportunity to extort, it would not be enough to show their high value. "Millions of gifts" became a trend at that time. Tang History: "The system stipulated Tiaoer Temple; Pei Du wanted to ask Bai Juyi for an inscription, Shi was not happy, so he asked him to write it, and after drinking, he picked up the pen and finished it immediately." Even for such a "rushed" piece, he still complained that the reward was too little, and Prime Minister Pei actually added 9,000 bolts of silk at once, Huangfu Shi can be said to be greedy and insatiable.

Han Yu, known as "Qi Xiang Gong," specialized in writing epitaphs for high-ranking officials and nobles at that time, and his manuscript fee income was extremely high. Liu Yuxi's eulogy for Han Changli said: "The price of one word from you is like a mountain of gold." This can be proven. One day, his disciple Liu Wen saw Zhu Ti piled up on Changli's desk and said: "This is what you get from flattering the dead in the tomb, it's better to use it to drink wine." So he took it away directly. Liu Wen's petty theft can be said to be a humorous protest against his teacher's excessive manuscript fees!

Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, it has been difficult to expect millions in brush fees; Zhongwu Jiewen: "West of Yue Gate, there is Yao Min, known for his filial piety. His residence has the Three Auspices Hall, and Dongpo once wrote a poem for him. Yao sent incense to him as a gift, but Po did not accept it. He wrote to a friend: "Yao Jun is sincere and good at doing good deeds, and his intention is extremely commendable, but there is no need to leave things behind. I returned the eighty cans of incense, as if entrusting it back to him. I have already appreciated his kindness, and keeping it would be no different from accepting it, which is why I dare not keep it for other officials." This shows that Po Lao did not accept brush fees for writing poems and articles for others, which is much better than Paris.

During the Ming Dynasty, Tang Yin often painted huge works and compiled the articles he wrote, calling them "profitable market," which shows that Jieyuan Gong not only wanted to earn manuscript fees for writing articles, but also wanted to "the more the better."

During the Qing Dynasty, Yuan Zicai's poems and articles could not be obtained without silver; a seven-character quatrain cost fifty taels of silver, and a regulated verse cost twice as much. Someone who wanted to have their name mentioned in the Suiyuan Poetry Talk had to offer a hundred taels of silver as a birthday gift. Yu Ji's manuscript fee for selling articles was also quite high, fifty taels for less than a thousand characters, and double that for more than a thousand characters. There is a poem that says: "The public tripod waits for the inscription price to be high, how can I be suitable for such a humble appearance? I only want to occupy a famous mountain seat, so that I can compete for the lyrics of Xia Li; I dare to be tired of saying it again and again, but because I am seventy years old and my strength is declining, although there are high-ranking people who laugh at me, I hope you will understand my little intention." It is filled with a humble heart, which makes people see the poet.

This kind of "brush fee" with a small poem seems to have been created by Zheng Banqiao. Banqiao's brush fee is for selling paintings, so I won't go into details. Since the Republic of China, there have been many scholars and artists in Shanghai, and there are excellent poems about brush fees. When Wang Xishen Yunzhang of Wuxi was selling articles in Shanghai, he once wrote a small poem about the brush fee: "Grinding ink is not a lonely task, the autumn heart rolls up the snow. I am ashamed that my family's tradition is to exchange red silks, and I personally learn from Banqiao." The imagery is exquisite, and one can imagine the person. As for Mr. Ji Zhiyan, who has long since passed away, he once wrote a poem about the brush fee: "Twenty years of wandering in Shanghai, drunkenly looking at the blue sky with white eyes, the rabbit escapes and his body is old, and he exchanges it for the money to sell his life in the world." The feeling of poverty and depression overflows beyond the brush and ink. When writers read it today, I am afraid they will sigh even more!

### American Miscellany

American Dollars and Nickels

Having returned to China, I am accustomed to large denominations of 1,000, 5,000, or 10,000 yuan, spending 3-4 million yuan on a suit, 200,000 yuan on a simple meal, and tens of millions of yuan for a small two-room apartment. Thinking that Americans only use a hundred or so dollars a month, it seems too shabby. American currency can be said to be quite standardized. The most common denominations in circulation are 1-dollar, 5-dollar, and 10-dollar bills. 2-dollar, 20-dollar, and 50-dollar bills are rarely seen. 100-dollar bills are practically useless. Many stores simply can't make change for a 100-dollar bill. Coins include the 25-cent Quarter, the 10-cent Dime, the 5-cent Nickel, and the 1-cent small copper coin. Even smaller is the Token used for taxes. One cent can buy four things. Before the war, America was known for having the highest standard of living, but now, cents and dimes have long disappeared in China, while Americans are still scraping by with nickels. Don't underestimate those 5-cent nickels; their uses are endless. Hundreds of things are sold for 5 cents: newspapers cost 5 cents each, soda costs 5 cents per bottle, beer costs 5 cents per bottle, streetcar tickets cost 5 cents to 1 dime, a pack of gum with 5 sticks costs 5 cents, coffee costs 5 cents per cup (sometimes a refill is free), oranges cost 5 cents each, small glass combs cost 5 cents each, yarn costs 5 cents per skein, postcards cost 3 for 5 cents, a cone of ice cream costs 5 cents, a small bag of breakfast crackers costs 5 cents, a box of bandages costs 5 cents, and playing the slot machine costs 5 cents per try. An even greater variety of goods cost 1 dime: lipstick costs 1 dime each, toothpaste costs 1 dime each, scented soap costs 1 dime per bar, greeting cards cost 1 dime each, celebrity photos cost 1 dime each, a dish of ice cream costs 1 dime, ink costs 1 dime per bottle, children's socks cost 1 dime per pair, hairpins cost 1 dime each, a peep show costs 1 dime per time, a watch strap costs 1 dime, and two slices of toast cost 1 dime. Even a single copper coin has many uses. Automatic scales cost 1 dime each, and they even give you a fortune slip, saying something about having a career, etc. The automatic peanut machine dispenses about ten peanuts per copper coin—no more, no less. Christmas seals for sealing letters cost 1 cent each, and matches cost 1 cent per box. (15)

### Talking About Hydropower Construction Amidst the Power Shortage

— Ya

Electricity is as important to industry as water is to life. These days, the city is experiencing a power shortage again. More than 200 factories in Xujiahui have issued an urgent appeal, requesting electricity supply, otherwise, how will the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers be resolved? This problem is still a small problem for the entire Shanghai, but in this eventful autumn of the nation, Shanghai, which consumes a large amount of electricity (the current generation is 180,000 kilowatts, and the pre-war capacity was 260,000 kilowatts), will always face an industrial crisis if it relies solely on coal for power generation.

Norway has no coal deposits, but has many waterfalls. By utilizing hydropower, the average power generation is the highest in the world. The UK relies on coal for industrial electricity, and hydropower is scarce (only 240,000 kilowatts in England). If you haven't forgotten, last winter, heavy snow submerged their railways, causing a coal shortage. Fortunately, the air force was dispatched, and the crisis was narrowly averted.

Therefore, for the sake of long-term planning for Shanghai's electricity consumption, we must try our best to use hydropower to liberate a portion of it. For example, the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River contain more than 10 million kilowatts, and can be transmitted westward to Chengdu and eastward to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Unfortunately, it requires a huge construction cost of 3-4 billion US dollars, resulting in a forced abandonment. The Qiantang River in Hangzhou, Qililong and other places, if funding is available, can be completed within six months to a year, with a power generation capacity of more than 150,000 kilowatts, which can be supplied to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Recently, it is said that the government has sent personnel to conduct surveys. Speaking of this, I can't help but think of the wealthy merchants of Shanghai and other places. Why are they addicted to gold and US dollars and engage in illegal speculation?

If they could contribute a portion of their financial resources to hydropower construction, the benefits to the people would be unimaginable.

According to a recent report by Chairman Weng, the total hydropower capacity of the country is 900,000 kilowatts (including 200,000 kilowatts in the Northeast. The reserves in the Northeast are 1.7 million kilowatts in the Songhua River, 1.6 million kilowatts in the Wusuli River, and 180,000 kilowatts in Taiwan. The reserves in Taiwan are more than 330,000 kilowatts). The United States currently has 50 million kilowatts. More than 60% of China's hydropower belongs to the Resources Committee, which shows that the people do not pay much attention to this. China may be like Norway, like the United States, but the country does not have much money, so the waterfalls and springs are only for people to appreciate. The planned Minjiang River in Fuzhou can be used to drive the local industry; the K.V.A. planned in the Ganjiang River in Jiangxi is being carried out by the central government with 700 million yuan, and it is expected to generate 25,000 kilowatts after completion; the Pearl River in Guangdong will be invested by an American company to establish the Pearl River Hydropower Plant; the Kangding River in Xikang has reserves of more than 150,000 kilowatts, which is enough for the entire province. After completion, the compatriots in the province will have the cheapest electricity in the country and engage in production. The funding is planned to be subsidized by loans from French banking groups. The Xuebao Mountain in Fenghua is also being considered for construction. Other waterfalls such as Yandang, Shiliang, etc., are noisy and shocking, and ten thousand horses are galloping, with a momentum of collapsing thousands of feet. It is hoped that they will be conquered in the near future, bringing great light to the local area and seeking happiness for the people.

### Sang Weihan's Iron Inkstone

—  Ren

When I was studying in a private school as a child, I remember my grandfather buying me a lacquer-covered inkstone, which was shiny and engraved with the four characters "Grind Through Iron Inkstone" in clerical script. These four characters left a deep impression on me. At that time, I thought to myself, this inkstone is clearly made of stone, why does it have to be said to be made of iron? At that time, I was afraid of my elders, and I didn't dare to ask for the truth, so I kept it in my heart.

When I reached the point where I could also use allusions to write articles, I realized that anyone who can devote themselves to learning, be determined, and achieve something is called "grinding through an iron inkstone." At that time, I still knew it was so, but didn't know why it was so. When I was able to translate the Twenty-Four Histories, I understood even more thoroughly where this iron inkstone came from. It didn't come from any great sage, but from a very despicable Sang Weihan.

Sang Weihan drafted a memorial for Shi Jingtang, recognizing himself as a subject to the Khitan emperor, and requesting to serve him as a father. The nickname of Shi Jingtang as the Emperor Son originated under his plan. At that time, Liu Zhiyuan, who was on the side, earnestly persuaded Shi Jingtang: "It is permissible to call him a great country, but it is too much to serve him as a father; it is better to bribe him with gold and silk to cause his troops; it is not necessary to promise him land, for fear that it will cause great harm to China in the future, and it will be too late to regret it." But Shi Jingtang, who only trusted Sang Weihan, was not willing to listen. As a result, the Emperor Son was created, and the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun were completely offered to foreign tribes.

The Biography of Sang Weihan in the History of the Five Dynasties: "When Weihan first took the imperial examination, the examiner disliked his surname, thinking that Sang and mourning had the same sound. Someone advised him to seek officialdom elsewhere, but Weihan said with emotion, so he cast an iron inkstone to show people and said: "If the inkstone is worn out, then I will change and seek officialdom elsewhere." He eventually passed the imperial examination."

Sang Weihan's determination to take the so-called "orthodox path" was, of course, the ambition of a scholar. Like later scholars striving for fame in the imperial examination, wanting to stand out from the crowd in the examination hall with their articles, "ten years of cold window no one asks, one fell swoop fame the world knows," this is naturally something that promising people do, who says it is not appropriate.

But unfortunately, the traditional thinking of "reading only for fame" harmed him. Although he finally made it to the top and became a high official, he inevitably left a name that could not be ground through on the pages of history. Sang Weihan, who vigorously advocated introducing the Khitans into Jin, even died at the hands of the Khitan masters because of this. This is truly a pitiful bug who introduced a wolf into the house and built a cocoon to trap himself!

Therefore, I thought of the modern poem "Studying to be a person with white hair by the pond," which is much better than the pitiful bug in the past who "Studying to be an official with white hair by the pond." Because those pitiful bugs who "grind through iron inkstones" not only make themselves pitiful bugs, but even implicate generations of descendants, who inevitably become pitiful bugs. This is truly wasting the hard work of "grinding through iron inkstones"!

A word to Sang Weihan's readers: wake up and turn back early.
