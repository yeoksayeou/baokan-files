### Four Principles for Resuming Peace Talks - Chairman Generally Agreed - Government May Send Personnel to Yan'an with Them

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for government and Political Consultative Conference (PCC) representatives and Wu Dingchang, Da Wei, and others on the 15th evening at 7:00 PM, which concluded at 8:00 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang summoned government officials to his residence tonight at 7:30 PM to study a plan for resuming peace talks. Those present included Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Chen Li-fu, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, and eleven others. The preliminary results of yesterday's talks between the government representatives at Sun Ke's residence were reported to the Chairman by Lei Zhen this morning. They continued to offer opinions on this plan tonight. The Chairman generally agreed with the four principles of the proposed plan for resuming peace talks drafted by the representatives and gave some instructions. It is also understood that the specific method of resuming peace talks has not been decided yet, but it is most likely that personnel will be sent to Yan'an.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Shao Lizi stated on the 15th that the government's plan has not yet been finalized and its content cannot be announced at this time. If the Yan'an side agrees, it will be conveyed by those going to Yan'an. Government officials may meet again within days to discuss the plan. The government's views may be conveyed to the Communist Party through Ambassador Stuart. When a reporter asked who the government would send to Yan'an, the reply was, "It doesn't matter who goes." Another reporter asked whether a round table conference or direct negotiations would be held in the future. Shao said: "This matter depends on the opinions of the Yan'an side." He also stated that what the government values is the resumption of peace talks, and it does not adhere to any particular format. He hoped that the Communist Party would not think that the government is not sincere. He said that resuming peace talks is not because the government is in a bad situation and must resume peace talks. In fact, peace talks should be resumed for the sake of the country and the people, not because one side has this need. Whether peace talks can be resumed at present depends on whether the Communist Party's attitude can change. When a reporter asked about his views on Zhou Enlai's statement, Shao said that he had not yet seen the full text.

Government's Peace Talk Opinions to Be Conveyed to the Communist Side by the Ambassador

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang met with Ambassador Stuart after hosting a banquet for government and PCC representatives on the 15th evening.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Ambassador Stuart met with Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 15th. It is heard that the government's opinions may be conveyed to the Communist side through the Ambassador.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Ambassador Stuart, accompanied by Fu Jingbo, visited Zhang Qun at 10:00 AM on the 15th. At noon, the Ambassador invited Wang Bingnan to lunch.

[Our Newspaper Report] A well-informed person from a third party told reporters: Peace talks are indeed a difficult task, but the current government plan may be considered by the CCP. Furthermore, the CCP's troop movements in Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, and various propaganda boasting of military strength, are aimed at peace rather than war. The idea is that "those who can fight can make peace," and the intention is to create bargaining chips for negotiations.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] People close to the CCP criticized the four points of the government's proposed peace talk plan reported in the newspaper, saying: "If the content of the plan is indeed as reported in the newspaper, then negotiations will 'run aground immediately after contact.' The government's proposed 'ceasefire in place' is equivalent to asking the CCP to recognize the CCP areas led by the National Army since January 13th of last year. Therefore, if the January ceasefire agreement is not implemented, the ceasefire issue and long-term peace cannot be resolved. Regarding the points of military reorganization, transportation, and local government, the military reorganization plan is one of the three agreements signed in January of last year, the restoration of transportation is one item in the June four-point agreement, and local government is part of the PCC. Therefore, what the CCP hopes for is the implementation of the entire agreement, and it cannot unilaterally put forward beneficial parts as conditions."

### The United States Will Adopt an Indirect Approach to Mediate the Conflict Between the Kuomintang and the Communists - The Ambassador Is Maintaining Contact with All Parties

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 15th] Political observers here predict that the United States will resume mediation of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists, but will adopt an indirect approach. They said: Marshall's past efforts did not take this approach. The fact that Ambassador Stuart still maintains contact with the CCP delegation in Nanjing is of great significance. It is heard that Zhang Qun told the Ambassador about the situation of the talks with representatives of minority parties in Shanghai and the government's determination to resolve the current stalemate, and assured the Ambassador that the United States' mediation still has an important task in future negotiations. Another government official, who is specifically drafting suggestions to be sent to the CCP, recently told our reporter: Marshall's departure from China and return to his country does not mean that the United States has stopped mediation. In fact, the opposite is true, and it will engage in mediation in a more informal and effective way. Therefore, the Ambassador may soon seek to promote the resumption of peace talks and reorganize the Chinese government, as Marshall requested in his statement on China.

### Zhou Enlai Delivers a Speech

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Zhou Enlai delivered a speech in Yan'an on the anniversary of the PCC, commenting on Marshall's statement. Zhou's speech was over 3,000 words long and only detailed the government's alleged destruction of the PCC resolutions and ceasefire agreement. He did not put forward new opinions on the current situation.

### Criticism from the Social Democratic Party

It's Best Not to Dwell on Past Grievances

[Our Newspaper Report] Sun Baoyi, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, said: The Social Democratic Party will consider issuing a declaration within a day or two, taking a stand on the people's perspective and stating the party's attitude towards reopening peace talks. Regarding Zhou Enlai's speech, Sun believes that the shortcomings Zhou pointed out, such as restrictions on people's freedom, lack of provincial constitutions, and failure to adopt a cabinet system, can all be corrected in the future in the constitution, but it cannot be denied that the National Assembly tore up the constitution. The government's convening of the National Assembly and passing the constitution is also not "illegal." The current problem is fundamentally not a legal issue. It is best not to dwell on past grievances and sincerely seek reconciliation. From the perspective of the party's interests, there can be various strategies, but from the perspective of the people, only peace can survive. Regarding garrisoned areas, after the implementation of the military reorganization plan, all troops belong to the state and there is no distinction between them. As far as local government is concerned, unification will inevitably form after democracy is realized. In democratic countries, the power of the central and local governments is often held by two parties. Therefore, if both parties are sincere, there are no difficulties that cannot be resolved. On the contrary, if someone disregards the suffering of the people and deliberately causes the failure of peace talks, the people of the whole country should know where the responsibility lies.

### Inauguration of the Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Representative Assembly

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 15th] The first representative assembly of the Kuomintang in Peiping opened at 9:00 AM this morning. Central Committee members Li Zongren, Luo Meidian, Chen Jicheng, He Siyuan, and others attended the ceremony and delivered training speeches.

Party affairs and political reports were also heard, and the representatives asked questions enthusiastically. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. From 7:30 PM, committee meetings were held to review proposals, and the general assembly will continue to be held on the morning of the 16th.

### Stevenson Meets with Zhang Fakui to Discuss Relations Between Guangdong, Hong Kong, China, and the UK

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] British Ambassador Stevenson held talks with Director Zhang Fakui and Chairman Luo Zhuoying of Guangdong Province this morning regarding relations between Guangdong, Hong Kong, China, and the UK. He held a press conference at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to answer reporters' questions.

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The London Times published a lengthy article by its special correspondent today, urging the British government to determine a policy for the long-term relationship between Hong Kong and China, and suggesting the development of a five- or ten-year plan for Hong Kong's socio-economic development. The article pointed out that Britain has made many efforts in Hong Kong's public works, but has made little effort to alleviate the extreme poverty of a large number of Chinese residents.

### Military Mediation Department to Be Dissolved Next Month - Jiang Wen Staff Already Decided to Be Recalled

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Authoritative sources told reporters today that the Peiping Military Mediation Department will be dissolved in the second week of next month. The US authorities stationed in Peiping have decided to recall the US staff of the Military Mediation Department in the three weeks thereafter. The peace mechanism established by Marshall after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party signed a ceasefire agreement on January 10, 1946, will "collapse" once the Kuomintang and Communist representatives are recalled. This move is probably a sign that the United States' task of mediating China's internal strife will come to an end. However, Ambassador Stuart will continue to work for peace during his tenure.

It is understood that the CCP Liaison Office here is anxiously awaiting the US policy on the Military Mediation Department. CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan has repeatedly inquired about the news that the Military Mediation Department will be dissolved at the US Embassy.

### Regulations for the Organization of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee Have Been Approved - The President and Committee Members Will Be Appointed by the National Government

The number of standing committee members is set at 95 to 125, with a term of office until the opening of the next National Assembly. The full text of the organizational regulations will be officially announced by the National Government after being submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval. Furthermore, because today's meeting discussed this case for a long time, many other routine cases were not discussed.

### Fierce Fighting on the Linzao and Taizao Fronts - Xuzhou Becomes the Focus of Offense and Defense - Communist Army in Jiaodong Launches a Supporting Offensive

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 15th] The focus of the war in Southern Shandong has now shifted to the battle for the defense of the Zaozhuang coal mines. In recent days, almost all of the main forces of the Communist army along the Taizao branch line have moved north and concentrated their forces to launch a desperate attack on Zaozhuang. The defending troops are full of vigor and calmly resisting. The Communist army has repeatedly attacked and failed, suffering heavy losses. At this moment, the Communist army's offensive is showing signs of exhaustion. A powerful corps of the National Army has now arrived near Zaozhuang. The siege of Zaozhuang can be lifted within days. The National Army in Southern Shandong is currently in a completely advantageous position, and the situation will improve in a matter of time.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] Because the Communist army in Southern Shandong failed to attack Heerzhuang, it is now concentrating all its forces to besiege Zaozhuang. The Communist army attempts to capture Zaozhuang, reoccupy Lincheng, and echo the Communist army in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. It is heard that a small number of Communist troops sneaked into the Linzao branch line yesterday, attempting to cut off the National Army's retreat in Zaozhuang, but were repelled.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] Xuzhou, historically known as a strategic location for military strategists, has now become the battlefield for both the National Army and the Communist Army to defend and attack. The Communist Army is currently attacking Lincheng on the northeast of Xuzhou, the Taizao branch line, Jinxiang on the northwest, and Yongcheng on the southwest, apparently wanting to remove the surrounding satellite cities of Xuzhou, creating the isolation of Xuzhou. The Communist Army takes advantage of its numerical superiority and adopts a piecemeal policy of defeating the National Army one by one. The National Army strictly abides by the order to stop conflicts and has many concerns, resulting in some military losses, which cannot be denied. However, the National Army's tolerance is also limited. The immovable defense made in Zaozhuang, Jinxiang, and Yongcheng is a powerful hint to the greedy Communist Army, urging them to realize and withdraw, and the country's affairs are awaiting political consultation to resolve.

[Another Telegram] (1) The Communist Army's siege of Zaozhuang, which numbered 100,000 troops, has not slackened as of the 15th. The National Army is firmly defending. (2) The Communist Army Zhang Taisheng's unit, which had sneaked into the area between Yongcheng and Boxian, launched a siege of Yongcheng County on the morning of the 15th. The National Army is fighting hard to meet the attack.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th] In order to support the Southern Shandong campaign, the Communist Army in Jiaodong launched a new offensive on the Jiaoji Railway. Parts of the 4th and 9th Divisions, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th New Regiments, the Laiwu Zidibing Corps, and the main force of the 1st Brigade, totaling more than 20,000 people, gathered in the area south of Boshan and Mingshui, attempting to move north. The Jiao Nan Column's 2nd Independent Brigade, the Binhai 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Independent Regiments, and the Binbei Military Sub-district teams, totaling about 15,000 people, sneaked into Zhucheng, claiming to attack Gaomi. The 5th Division sneaked into Pozi (25 kilometers north of Weibei) Xihai, and the 1st and 2nd Independent Regiments sneaked into Qingbu (15 kilometers southeast of Changyi), intending to attack Changyi and Wei. Another 11th Division invaded the vicinity of Suozhen, with signs of moving south to attack Changshan, Zouping, and Zhangdian.

### National Army in Northern Jiangsu Recovers Yinping

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] It is learned that: (1) Liu Bocheng's troops in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway have currently concentrated their main forces of more than five divisions, including a regiment of Japanese prisoner gunners and machine gunners, to cooperate in the battle. The fierce fighting in Miaotou Yinping in Northern Shubei has lasted for two days and nights. This morning at 6:00 AM, a certain regiment of the National Army began a counterattack and completely defeated the Communist Army, recovering Yinping at 9:00 AM.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] Although Guan Yun has been recovered, the remnants of the Communist army are still harassing the area, killing and looting without doing anything. Villages within 60 li south of the Zhongzheng Square and north of Yangjiaji have been completely burned down, corpses are lying all over the place, and even chickens and dogs are rare.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] The remaining communist forces in Northern Jiangsu, in Mu, Guan, and Yu, have indeed moved north and broke through. After three days and nights of fierce fighting on the Feizao River and Wan Wan line, the Communist Army has become hostile because of heavy casualties. The Communist Army on this line seems to be expecting reinforcements from Southern Shandong and is stepping up harassment.

### Huaiyin Gradually Restored - Muyang Lacks Cash

One Copper Coin Equals 20 Yuan in Legal Tender

[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 14th] This reporter arrived in Huaiyin from Shuyang today. Since the city was recovered, it has gradually been restored with the cooperation of the military and political authorities. Most residents are buying New Year's goods and preparing to celebrate this most exciting Lunar New Year.

[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 14th] This reporter arrived at Mao Dazhuang, southwest of Shuyang City, with the army on the 11th. In the afternoon, I entered the city with Commander Li Tianxia.

He told reporters that this trip was to inspect the situation of household registration reorganization and to help the county government raise cash to promote circulation.

At that time, Chief Judge Ju stated that those who have been pardoned and had their sentences reduced by the national law should be treated leniently, which also shows the intention to make a fresh start with the people.

### Qing Yun Troupe's Work Effective: Cargo Transport on the Beining Railway Greatly Increased

[Our Beijing Dispatch, 15th] The Qing Yun (Clearance and Transport) Troupe organized by the Pingjin Railway Bureau has achieved great success in its work. Cargo transport volume between Ping and Yu on the Beining Railway has increased from 2,500 tons per day to 8,000 tons. The detention of railcars and delays in loading and unloading have become rare. In addition, 10,000 tons of Kailuan coal are transported daily (the mine currently produces 12,000 tons per day), and 2,500 tons of Mentougou coal are transported, along with military transport. There are 2,400 vehicles regularly transported between Ping and Yu. On the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway (between Ping and Zhang), traffic has reached Qinglongqiao, with seven trains running in each direction daily, including three passenger trains, one train for coal and road materials, and three trains for cargo and military transport. Due to the outflow of grain and hides controlled by the Chahar province, empty cars often return to Ping.

The Railway Bureau plans to request funds from the Ministry of Communications to resume construction of the unfinished Shatang section, which was started by the Japanese, running from Shacheng to Tanggu without passing through Qinglongqiao. The roadbed for this section has been completed, and 9 kilometers of the 23-kilometer tunnel have been dug. The unfinished tunnel project will take more than a year.

### Ridiculous Communist Rumors

The "Captured" Brigade Commander

Huang Bao De Arrives in Xuzhou to Report for Duty

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] Huang Bao De, the commander of the 60th Brigade of the National Army, who the Communists repeatedly claimed had been captured, recently arrived in Xu to report for duty and was surrounded by the press. One reporter asked if he came from a Communist prisoner-of-war camp. Huang replied that he came from the defense zone and stated that the Xinhua News Agency's report of his capture was its usual rumor-mongering tactic and not worth taking seriously.

### Overseas Chinese Representatives in Vietnam Host Journalists, Requesting the Government to Protect Overseas Chinese Urgently, or Take Immediate Measures to Relieve the People from Suffering

[Our City News] Yan Renyi and Yang Wenzhong, representatives of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, hosted a tea party for the local press at Xinghualou Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. First, Representative Yang reported: “We, representing overseas Chinese, returned to China to report the tragic situation of overseas Chinese in various parts of northern Vietnam and to urge the government to find ways to protect overseas Chinese. We departed from Hanoi before the Lunar New Year, on December 17. At that time, the Battle of Haiphong had ended, but the suburbs were still at war. Conflict started in Hanoi on that very day. Since arriving in the capital, we have repeatedly appealed to the relevant authorities to take effective measures to protect overseas Chinese. The authorities have also expressed deep concern, but it has been over twenty days since we arrived in the capital, and we have not yet obtained concrete solutions, so we have not been able to return to Vietnam to reassure our hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese. The war in Hanoi is still continuing. The overseas Chinese area is occupied by Vietnamese troops, surrounded by French troops, and cut off from the outside world. Food is scarce, garbage is piled up, and hunger, cold, disaster, and disease are unavoidable. It has been a month since the siege began. The miserable situation is self-evident. We now hope that our authorities will do the following: (1) The government has expressed deep concern about the tragic situation of overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam and is studying various ways to protect overseas Chinese. However, the government has many affairs to attend to, and this is just one of them, so it has not been able to quickly decide everything. On the overseas Chinese side, saving lives is like putting out a fire and cannot be delayed. Otherwise, if the overseas Chinese are injured or killed, then compensation and relief will not bring the dead back to life. Therefore, we hope that our government will quickly implement its determination to protect overseas Chinese and handle it with emergency methods, instead of following routine procedures, to relieve the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese from suffering. (2) What overseas Chinese are requesting is (1) relief, (2) sending senior officials to appease and investigate losses, (3) ordering the French and Vietnamese sides to compensate for losses, (4) requesting the Vietnamese side to release arrested overseas Chinese and release overseas Chinese who are blocked in various places along the way, so that they can return to the cities, (5) allocating planes to transport rice and medicine to assist the trapped overseas Chinese, and using the same planes to transport women and children back to the country.”

### A Communist Army Commander Who Surrendered Reports the Inside Story of the Jidong "Liberated Area": Resources Are Scarce, Strong Men Flee, People's Wealth Is Depleted, Three-Fifths of the Soldiers Lack Clothing

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] Zhao Zhuoran, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Communist 14th Brigade, Wen Zhenhua, Section Chief, and Fu Shanting, Commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 33rd Regiment, recently surrendered to the National Army in Jidong. They also hosted journalists the other day to report the inside story of the Jidong "Liberated Area." A summary is as follows:

(A) Government Aspect: The main political tasks of the Communist army at present are: (1) mobilizing young people to join the war, (2) launching liquidation movements, and (3) blockading materials, resulting in a shortage of materials in various counties in the Jidong "Liberated Area," and the number of strong men who flee and are killed is numerous. The Communist army's method of blockading materials is "districts do not leave districts, counties do not leave counties." All goods must be traded locally, causing materials to flow into the hands of the Communist army. In the liquidation movement, poor people are given materials or land, which are called "fruits of victory." Especially villagers who are idle year-round suddenly get "fruits" and are unbridled in their evil deeds. Poor farmers think that if they sit and eat "fruits," there is no need to farm, resulting in the abandonment of fields in various counties, and weeds grow. The Communist army is thus able to carry out its plan to destroy the economy.

(B) Economic Aspect: The Jidong "Liberated Area" issues border currency, with Zunhua as the center. It is stipulated that one national currency yuan can be exchanged for 1.8 border currency yuan. Villagers know that the border currency's fate is not long and painfully exchange goods for goods: three *sheng* of corn for two *chi* of cloth, one *jin* of white flour for half a *jin* of corn. Senior Communist officers use their power to set up production cooperatives in units above the brigade level to squeeze the people's wealth. For example, when cloth enters the "district," a tax of 30,000 is levied per bolt, regardless of its value. Units above the army level set up trade bureaus and openly sell drugs.

(C) Military Aspect: The main force of the Jidong Communist army consists of three brigades, numbered 10, 11, and 12, with eight regiments and one garrison regiment, plus one independent regiment, one artillery regiment, totaling 10,000 men and 100,000 militiamen. Most of them are new soldiers. There is deep suspicion among new officers and soldiers. Their lower-ranking soldiers have not received undershirts for three years. In each battalion, three-fifths lack clothing. They are mainly fed with corn, and the vegetable is called "Pacific," meaning vegetable leaves floating in white water. Recently, war-weariness has been increasing. In the recent Battle of Tuozitou, as many as 36 soldiers in one company of the Communist army abandoned their guns and fled. The 3rd Battalion of the 31st Regiment is left with only one platoon leader.

### Guangzhou Municipal Council Requests Guangzhou to Be Changed to a Municipality Under the Direct Jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan

Xu Fuyingchang of the Administration told reporters: "The various sub-bureaus below need more grain, and the General Administration has more than 100,000 tons left. Therefore, we hope that in addition to grain, we can obtain more active forms of compensation. Now we plan to increase relief materials in various places in addition to grain and use local refugees to develop production." Regarding the central work of the Administration this year, the following principles were formulated at the afternoon meeting: (1) The goal of the work is to develop farmland and water conservancy first, improve transportation second, and other things last; (2) The target of the work is based on the premise that it must be completed and can be completed; (3) The undertakings held must have economic value, can directly and indirectly generate profit, and must consume the least capital and obtain the greatest benefit; (4) Assist unemployed refugees to resume work; (5) The work relief method is to improve the methods so that technical personnel and relief personnel can work together. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM, and the Shanghai Sub-Bureau hosted a dinner for all attending representatives and guests on the third floor of the hotel.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting

The meeting of the deputy foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union commenced in London on the 14th, with British Foreign Secretary Bevin personally presiding and delivering a welcoming address, expressing the hope that a situation allowing Germany to rise again would not be created. Starting from the 15th, discussions began on draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria, and an agenda will be agreed upon for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Therefore, this Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting can be regarded as a prelude to peace talks with Germany and Austria. Based on past experience, whenever the four foreign ministers encountered disagreements, they would submit the issues to the deputy foreign ministers' meeting for resolution, often achieving unanimous agreement. The German and Austrian questions, especially the German peace treaty, were not resolved by the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, nor could an agreement be reached at the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Now, they are submitted to the London Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting for handling. Standing at the beginning of 1947, we cannot help but express our earnest expectations for this international conference.

The outbreak of World War I, Japanese militarists and Nazi Germany were the main culprits; logically, after the victorious end of the war, the United Nations should have first dealt with Germany and Japan. However, eighteen months have passed since the end of the war, and peace talks with Japan and Germany have not yet begun, which can only be described as a rare phenomenon in modern diplomatic history. The reason for this is that the opinions of the major victorious powers, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, have not converged. At the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the German question, which should have been resolved first, could have been resolved, but the resignation of British Prime Minister Churchill and the sudden death of US President Roosevelt led to the replacement of two of the world's three giants. Attlee and Truman both emerged as new figures on the international stage, and there was inevitably a sense of distance between them and Stalin. From then on, the German question was shelved.

Until Japan surrendered and World War II came to a complete end, the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union met in London, and everyone felt that it was necessary to proceed with peace talks with Germany. Unfortunately, during the London Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the views of the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union on the German question were completely different, like going south while wanting to go north, and no agreement could be reached. Therefore, the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference broke up in disagreement. Later, the three foreign ministers reached a compromise in principle at the Moscow Conference, but the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to expand on the basis of the compromise reached at the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and could only avoid the important and focus on the trivial, passing draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland and deciding to convene the Paris Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference. This resulted in peace with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland being achieved before peace with Germany. Although we cannot help but feel that this is putting the cart before the horse, it is also a kind of expedient measure in diplomacy.

The main task of the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was to discuss the German question, but the drastic changes in the domestic political situation in France prevented Foreign Minister Bidault from leaving the country. At the same time, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs insisted that the Foreign Ministers' Conference could not proceed with the discussion of the German question unless French Foreign Minister Bidault personally participated. Therefore, the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference only decided on six agenda items for the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The main points are as follows: (1) Discuss the report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany; (2) Determine the form and scope of Germany's temporary political organization; (3) Draft the peace treaty with Germany; (4) Discuss the draft of the Forty-Year Treaty for the Disarmament of Germany drafted by the United States; (5) Review the report on German coal production and distribution; (6) Draft the peace treaty with Austria. Although we cannot express complete satisfaction with the results achieved by the Foreign Ministers' Conference in handling the German question for more than a year, we are still hopeful in our hearts, seeing the German question moving step by step towards a resolution.

This newspaper has repeatedly pointed out the impact of last year's New York Foreign Ministers' Conference: on the one hand, it brought a peaceful conclusion to international politics in 1946; on the other hand, it unfolded a beautiful vision for international politics in 1947. Therefore, we are particularly concerned about this year's first international conference and sincerely wish it success. However, reviewing the past, the reason why the German question has been difficult to resolve is due to conflicts of interest and differences of opinion among the countries. The foreign ministers of each country either insisted on their own opinions or only sought their own interests, unwilling to concede even a small step, making it difficult to reach a compromise. Observing the attitudes of the representatives of each country in the deputy foreign ministers' meeting, it is not difficult to see that the views of the representatives of each country remain the same, still taking the interests of their respective countries as the starting point. Therefore, we cannot help but worry here that if the representatives of the four countries do not change their attitudes and remain fixated on their own interests without considering the overall situation, then this Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting will still be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Although we are not unrealistic idealists, we still feel that if this Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in March are to complete their established tasks, then the diplomatic authorities of the four countries should base their attitudes towards Germany and Austria on reason and justice to seek a thorough resolution of the German and Austrian questions. The nature of the issues between Germany and Austria is completely different and cannot be generalized. They should be handled separately. For example, Germany should be severely punished, and it is reasonable to demand compensation for wartime losses. However, international diplomats should have foresight and attach particular importance to the re-education of the German people to eliminate the Nazi anesthesia and residual poison suffered by the German people, so that they can become a peace-loving country in the international community and no longer threaten European peace and security. At the same time, Germany's war industry must not be allowed to exist and should be stripped clean, not allowing any future troubles to remain, so that Germany's aggressive forces can rise again in ten or twenty years. Prevention is better than cure, and we must be particularly careful and vigilant at all times, and never create a situation that would allow Germany to rise again.

As for Austria, she was a victim of Hitler's aggression. The four countries should all bear the obligation to help Austria achieve independence. Not only should they verbally allow its independence, but they should also provide economic assistance in practice, making it a stable force in Central Europe, serving as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe on the one hand, and as the backbone of economic cooperation among the countries of the Danube River on the other. Central Europe is the heart of Europe, and Austria's autonomy and independence are crucial to the safety of Europe. The lessons of history are most worthy of reflection by international political diplomats.

Looking ahead to the future of the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting in handling the German and Austrian questions, although it is full of light and hope, we also see reefs and cold currents all around the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

The first is the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States. After the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference and the Second General Assembly of the United Nations successively closed, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States has improved, especially the Soviet Union's attitude towards the international community has changed significantly, from tough to moderate. On the part of the United Kingdom and the United States, there is also sincerity in respecting the Soviet Union's sense of security. In particular, the United Kingdom, fearing that the Soviet Union might lightly believe the rumors of a military alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States, sent Chief of the Army Staff Montgomery to visit the Soviet Union, which will greatly benefit the improvement of British-Soviet relations. However, judging from the future trends of US domestic and foreign policy, the improvement of US-Soviet relations under the control of the Republican Party cannot be viewed with optimism too early.

The second is the relationship between France and the Soviet Union. Post-war French politics has made significant progress and has indeed embarked on the path of peace and democracy, which the Soviet Union is happy to approach. Therefore, the relationship between France and the Soviet Union has been very friendly and close after the war, and even French diplomats, although standing in the position of a third-party mediator in previous international conferences, inevitably favored the Soviet Union. The success of post-war French diplomacy also relied on this subtle relationship. Taking the German question as an example, the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States are generally the same; the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany has long been implemented, and although they have tried every means to induce France to participate, they have not yet succeeded. From this, it can be seen that the views of France and the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States are very different, and are more similar to the views of the Soviet Union, which is also a well-known fact. For the sake of the future of Europe, and also for its own interests, it is very necessary for the United Kingdom to seek consensus with France. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, French Minister of Transport Moch made a trip to London. In recent days, French Prime Minister Blum also went to London to visit and exchange views on the German question with Prime Minister Attlee. From the perspective of the Soviet Union, an observer, a "sour" effect cannot but occur. The sudden return of Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov to his country to report on his work is indeed worthy of our attention. Therefore, France's triangular relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States is also a cold current that may affect the deputy foreign ministers' meeting.

The third is that the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and other eighteen countries have successively submitted memoranda. Standing on the side of justice, the opinions of these small countries should be respected, because the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, strictly speaking, cannot be considered true European countries, while these small countries are the true European countries; but how to reconcile the mutually contradictory opinions of each country? This makes the work of the deputy foreign ministers' meeting even more difficult.

In short, the holding of the London Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting is a prelude to the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and its success or failure will have a great impact on the development of international politics this year, and is also closely related to the Far East, enough to determine the timing of the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, we sincerely wish the London Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow in March a successful conclusion.

### Situation in Northern Jiangsu Gradually Clearing Up, Communist Troops Attempting to Flee to Southern Jiangsu, Wuxi Garrison Command Strictly Preventing

[Report from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 15th] The Communist troops in the Northern Jiangsu region have now been progressively cleared, and all Communist troops have been divided into smaller units and are attempting to flee to Southern Jiangsu.

### Yong Security Police Stationed in Suzhou Moved to Mudu, Suppressing Lake Bandits' Unrest

[Report from this newspaper in Suzhou] At the beginning of the restoration of the Suzhou Provincial Water Police organization, it was based on the pre-war water police organization, divided into five districts, and then reorganized into a general team, responsible for preventing and suppressing bandits and maintaining water security. However, water police administration was still lacking. Recently, in order to adapt to actual needs, the Suzhou Provincial Government reorganized each general team into a bureau, which would control the water police, equip them with warships, and be responsible for the security of rivers, lakes, and coasts. Zhang Shaohua, the head of the Second Water Police General Team stationed in Suzhou, has now received a reorganization order and has been transferred to the position of Director of the Taihu Lake Water Police Bureau. The teams under his command have been reorganized into water security police teams and moved to Mudu to deploy at various key points, in order to suppress the unrest of lake bandits.

### Wu Yu Li Shipping Steamer Encountered Robbery

Suffered Serious Injuries and Died

[Report from this newspaper in Wuxing] The No. 2 steamer of the Lihang Shipping Bureau in this city departed from Hu to Meixi Town at 7:00 a.m. on the 10th with 41 passengers. When passing through Tangkou, there were three people dressed in military uniforms who had been lying in ambush in the boat, speaking with a northern accent. Two of them each took out wooden guns and fired several shots outward, ordering the boat to stop. At this time, Shen Mingshi, the police chief of Anqing County, and Inspector Lu Zhongxin, who were on board, saw the situation and knew that they were bandits. They immediately returned fire with the automatic and manual weapons they were carrying, hitting one bandit, who bled profusely. Then another bandit disregarded everything and pounced on Inspector Lu, eventually seizing one of the automatic and manual weapons. After obtaining the gun, the bandit swept the gun at Shen and Lu, causing serious injuries to Shen and Lu, as well as Wang Shixian, passengers Wang Yongcai, Li Dexing, Xu Li's, and Hu Xiuzhen, all of whom were covered in blood. Order was completely disrupted, and cries shook the sky. After obtaining the gun, the bandits disembarked and left. When the boat arrived in Hucheng, the injured were sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. Chief Shen died the next day due to his serious injuries.

[Report from this newspaper in Jinshan] At about 1:00 p.m. on the 12th, Zheng Hansan, the captain of the 3rd Security Company stationed in Songyin Town of this county, believed that the security of the surrounding four villages was not peaceful and ordered four soldiers to go on patrol. When they reached the vicinity of Nanxun Dam east of the town, they discovered five or six people who looked flustered and whose movements were suspicious, hurrying eastward. The soldiers shouted at them to stop, but the bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately drew their guns and fired. The soldiers also returned fire, and a fierce battle broke out. Soldier Zhou Weilin disregarded his own safety and rushed forward, only to be shot and killed by the bandits. The bandits retreated northward. After receiving the report, the company captain immediately led soldiers, self-defense forces, and police to encircle and suppress them, and urgently telegraphed the brigade headquarters for reinforcements. Brigade Commander Li immediately led a team to search for them, but the bandits had already fled far away. They arrested one suspect and took him back for interrogation.

### Jiangyin County Government Investigates

Taking Bribes to Release Drug Offenders

[Report from this newspaper in Jiangyin] Gao Sheng, the head of the Three Principles of the People Youth League in Zhouzhuang District, learned on the 4th of this month that a traveler named Wang Shoupeng (also known as Ren Zhi) was smoking opium in the Yanling Hotel in Zhouzhuang Town. He immediately ordered the team members Wu Jian'en, Wu Longcai, and Xing Zheng to investigate and seize six fen of opium. They claimed that they would take the team to the district combat office, but Wang Shoupeng, fearing the law, later asked a resident, Zhao Erji, to intercede and released Wang for 450,000 yuan in legal tender. The money was all received by Gao Sheng, who proposed to give 150,000 yuan as a bonus to the team members. The county government has now received a report that youth league members have committed this illegal act and will send personnel to investigate and severely punish them according to the law.

### Fuzhou Big Traitor You Liumen

Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Report from this newspaper in Fuzhou] The case of Fuzhou's top traitor You Liumen has been publicly tried by the Fujian High Court and sentenced at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th. The main text of the judgment was: "You Liumen colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist his own country, and is sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for life, and his property confiscated except for a reasonable amount to be left for the living expenses of his family."

The people of Fuzhou hated the traitor's actions as a henchman for the enemy, oppressing the people. Now, hearing the verdict, the people's hearts are greatly relieved.

### Seven Banks in Fuzhou

Organize a Syndicate

Loans to Rescue Industry and Commerce

Totaling 1.05 Billion

[Report from this newspaper in Fuzhou] Regarding the small-scale industrial and commercial loans held by the Central Bank in this city to save the current industrial and commercial crisis, the matter has now become concrete. The total amount is 1.05 billion yuan, which is organized by seven banks, including the China Industrial Bank, the Provincial Bank, and the Jiyou Bank, in a joint guarantee manner. Each bank will underwrite 150 million yuan. At present, the central problem is how to determine the standards for collateral and what conditions must be met in order to qualify for the loan. According to the central government's regulations, the collateral for industrial and commercial loans should be limited to the export goods of local products, but in this province, there are no products other than special products for export. This issue is being actively investigated and discussed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with the responsible authorities. In addition, the monthly interest rate for this loan is set at 5%, with a limit of three months.

### Special Commissioners' Offices in Various Districts of Zhejiang Province

Will be Abolished Gradually Within the Year

[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou on the 11th] After the abolition of the special commissioners' offices in the six districts of this province, according to Director Ruan's talk, all administrative inspector special commissioners' offices must be abolished gradually this year.

Therefore, whether the Hangzhou Municipal Police Bureau will still be restored to the Provincial Capital Police Bureau must be decided after the promulgation of the police and security system.

### At a Time When Hao County's City Defense Was Precarious, National Army Arrived to Assist, People Welcomed Them Madly

[Report from this newspaper in Hao County] The Communist troops captured Guoyang on the 8th and approached Dasi Town in this county. For a time, the city defense was empty. The city gates were tightly closed during the day, restricting entry, and at night, lights were hung on every household, and patrols were constant. In addition, watchtowers were built, hoping to hold the city walls firmly and fight the Communist troops to the death. Because of this, the people in the city were living in terror, tossed by the wind and rain. Suddenly, at 11:00 a.m. on the 11th, the alarm bell rang loudly, implementing an emergency curfew. The four city gates were closed at that time, and sentries were densely deployed in the streets and alleys, cutting off pedestrians, as if facing a formidable enemy. It was not until about 12:00 p.m. that it was learned that the National Army's 58th Division 30th Regiment had come from Piqiao in Yongcheng to assist. Due to a misunderstanding in the telegraph transmission, the people were slightly alarmed, but seeing the National Army passing through the streets, their military appearance neat and their heroism invigorating, they all automatically hung flags and set off firecrackers to welcome them, and sent cigarettes to comfort them, their emotions were enthusiastically crazy.

### Songjiang Industrial and Commercial Loan

Negotiations Have Not Yet Yielded Results

[Report from this newspaper in Songjiang] In order to save the industrial and commercial crisis, the county government followed the provincial order to form a banking group and applied to the Shanghai Four Joint Office for a commercial loan of 5 million yuan to solve the urgent need. The county government and the county chamber of commerce sent personnel to Shanghai, and it was decided that the county bank, the Dianye Bank, and the Songjiang branch of the Farmers' Bank would act as guarantors. However, the result of the negotiations with the Shanghai Four Joint Office was that the office mainly handled production loans that required collateral and was limited to counties with branch offices of the four banks. The industrial and commercial loan requested by this county should be applied for from the Nanjing Four Joint General Office. Subsequently, the business bureau of the Central Bank was consulted, and the reply was the same as that of the Four Joint Office. Therefore, after the representatives returned with the report, the county government has reported the situation to the provincial government and requested that it send a letter to the Nanjing Four Joint General Office to apply for a loan as soon as possible.

Two Defendants Re-Sentenced

[Report from this newspaper in Suzhou on the 15th] Huang Zhaochuan and Yu Shanshen, former directors of the Suzhou branch of the Enemy Property Administration, were involved in a case where the confiscation of enemy property caused a young woman, Chang Dong'e, to commit suicide. The Wudi District Court initially sentenced Huang to three years and six months of imprisonment, and Yu to one year and nine months of imprisonment. However, both defendants appealed the sentence, and the prosecuting prosecutor also believed that the sentence was too light and filed a protest. The Jiangsu High Court ruled that the case be sent back for re-trial. The re-trial has now concluded, and the sentence was announced on the 15th. Both Huang and Yu were sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment. It is reported that both defendants still intend to appeal to the Supreme Court.

Upon learning that public funding for students in middle and higher education across the country would be completely terminated starting from New Year's Day in the 36th year of the Republic, we students were extremely surprised. Witnessing the internal strife and the government's neglect of many affairs today, we already feel deeply troubled and at a loss. Yet, the government continues to disregard education and impose harsh measures on students. We cannot help but feel heartbroken about our national culture! We cannot help but shed tears for the bleak reality!

Our country endured eight years of resistance against Japan, during which material and financial resources were severely depleted. In the occupied territories, schools were forced to relocate, teachers and students were displaced, and life was precarious. Even affording food and clothing became difficult, let alone affording to study. In areas that had not been ravaged by the enemy, people made donations for the country and became impoverished. As a result, some of our classmates till the land for others, while others serve in menial jobs (at National Sichuan University, some students clean the blackboard for the school, some work as shop assistants, some work as postal assistants, and at Southwest Associated University, students dig and weed for others). They willingly endure hardship and often go hungry, but they bear the heavy responsibility of the nation's fate, so what more can they say? What they hope for is that after victory, the world will be bright again, and they can continue their studies. But now, hearing of the cancellation of public funding, the poor will have no opportunity for advanced studies, and how can talented individuals be cultivated?

Examining the public funding system, it has a long history. The Han dynasty records state that Wen Weng established schools in Chengdu, recruiting talented young people from the lower counties to become "school officials' disciples." This is an example. Later generations followed this system in the imperial examinations, establishing "Chen students" who were given a stipend by the government. In the second year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming dynasty, each person received six dou of rice per month, and the government provided fish and meat. The number of students increased, known as "extended students." As a result, even poor scholars could rise in society. In modern times, the Soviet Union provided each university student with more than twenty rubles per month in 1937. This salary was more than enough to rival a small civil servant. In the United States, the national education budget accounts for more than 30% of the total budget. The emphasis on education is evident. As a result, both major countries have flourishing science and culture, standing side by side in the East and West. Looking back at our country's education budget today, it accounts for less than 6% of the total budget. Yet, the government still wants to reduce this small amount to supplement military spending (military spending accounts for 75% of our country's budget today). This can truly be described as squeezing the last bit of profit from the end of the sword and being good at "reducing expenses."

Throughout Chinese and foreign history, great heroes and outstanding figures, authorities in the scientific community, and leaders in the philosophical community have often come from humble backgrounds. Western orphanages and poorhouses have also been able to nurture outstanding talents. From this, we can see that talented people do not necessarily have to be the sons of wealthy families. Yet, our wise government is going against historical principles, setting an unreasonable precedent, and exploiting and suppressing the poor. We believe that this will only lead to a situation where "the upper class has no poor origins, and the lower class has no educated families." When interests clash and values are inverted, bank employees and profiteers are well-fed and well-clothed, while professors who rack their brains and students who study diligently are thin and tattered. Isn't this a strange phenomenon? Mr. Wu Youling said: "In the past, when Wei Zheng wrote the preface to the scholars' biographies, he often said that scholars of ancient times had a livelihood, but scholars of today are plagued by poverty. Intelligent people will not be willing to remain in their studies and seek poverty. This is why there are few polymaths among scholars, and learning is often vulgar." It is known that changing customs and habits must start with education. Otherwise, how can we reverse this declining trend?

For the sake of national construction, for the sake of national culture, and for the sake of the future development of higher education, we must protest, and we must protest strongly. We also make a reasonable appeal to the public with the most ardent and painful feelings, hoping to receive your strong support so that the government will give the greatest importance to education today, maintain the public funding system, and cultivate a favorable research environment to achieve the national construction mission of education. This will not only be fortunate for young students, but society and the nation will also benefit greatly.

Protest Against New Year's Rent Increase

The reader lives in a three-room sublet at No. 950, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi. Last year, they received a New Year's gift from the landlord, Gongji Shantang - a notice stating that the rent would be increased by three and a half times starting from January of this year. Upon hearing this, the common people felt both cold and frightened because although the landlord's increase of three and a half times to the second landlord isn't much, the second landlord will increase the rent by at least ten times to the third subtenant. Second landlords in this city rely on this for a living and increase rent to the third subtenants. This is a common phenomenon. Moreover, those who live in Nanshi and Zhabei are truly common people. At a time when all industries are declining, how can the common people bear the burden? (A Third Subtenant)

A Mounted Patrol Officer's Statement

Yesterday, I saw in your newspaper the news released by the Municipal Council, including the inquiries from Councilors Ding Zhaoming and Lu Sachu to the police bureau regarding the mounted patrol. As a member of the mounted patrol, I feel compelled to clarify certain points. Councilors Ding Shanming and others said, "There have been robbery cases in Beixinjing every night recently. Can the mounted patrol go to patrol and suppress the area?" The mounted patrol stationed in the West Shanghai branch, in addition to being dedicated to patrolling the area day and night, has also been assigned a detachment by the headquarters to assist in patrolling. There are records in the Xinqiong Sub-bureau's logbook, and newspapers have published news such as "Bandits are waiting for opportunities, and mounted police discovered them and scattered them. Last night, there was a shootout between police and bandits on Lincoln Road, and they fled in all directions. They were still searching late at night." This can be confirmed. Around New Year's Day, we received orders to not take holidays or rest and to increase patrols. Every day, we depart from the headquarters at 5 PM and continue until 5 AM the next morning. We spend the long nights wading through wind, rain, and mud in the suburbs. Who knows that while others are dreaming sweetly, we are working in the cold and hunger? I hope that your newspaper will reveal our actual situation so that the gentlemen know our mission. "Ziming" East of the Sichuan Road Bridge along the Suzhou River used to be the Chinese Garden. It is now paved with coal cinders and has become a parking lot for cars. It is public land of the city. Since it was opened as a parking lot, initially, because there were concrete steps at the entrance that were not leveled, it was inconvenient for cars to enter and exit, and few vehicles went to park there. Later, after leveling a few places, cars gradually parked there. However, a large part of the open space is piled with thousands of empty oil drums, and another part is occupied by ship repairers, some used as carpentry shops, and some piled with scrap steel plates removed from ships. There are many types, too many to list. As a citizen, I see that this great public land is not being properly utilized, so I raise the following questions and would like the relevant authorities to answer them: (1) Since the land has been designated as a parking lot, it should be rectified, and public telephones and managers should be set up to designate vehicle positions and entry and exit routes on the ground. It should not remain unmanaged like an empty space. At the same time, if there is a public telephone, even car owners from far away can come to park. If a small fee is charged, the management costs can also be covered. (2) It is also not appropriate to pile public property on the site. Since it has been designated as a parking lot, it should be used as a parking lot. Otherwise, if the boundaries are not clear, the entry and exit of goods may inevitably collide with cars, and car owners will definitely not want their vehicles to be damaged while parked. (3) If the goods piled on the site are commercial goods, and permission is granted by a certain agency or individual to pile them there, is a fee charged, and does the fee go to the public? (4) If the public sector does not charge a fee for the piled goods, is there a third party taking the opportunity to charge a fee? Relevant agencies cannot turn a blind eye and allow public land to be used for free. In short, I hope that the relevant agencies will promptly answer these questions and give the land a reasonable use. In this period of city treasury deficits, being able to use the land to increase city revenue will also help reduce the burden on citizens. (Shen Yu Guang)

### Postal Matters

Reply to Mr. Zheng Jimin: Regarding your letter stating the slow postal delivery between Qingpu and Jingjiang, we received a reply from the Jiangsu Postal Administration stating that your letter did not include an address, so they could not process it. Please provide Mr. Zheng's address so that they can retrieve the relevant envelope and investigate the cause of the delay. This is conveyed specifically for your information, please contact the Postal Administration directly.

Reply to Mr. Zhang Buming: Regarding your letter asking about the election of district chiefs in this city, we received a reply from the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government stating: "The qualifications of district chief candidates, according to regulations, are that they must be citizens of this district who have passed the Class A or B civil service candidate examination or review, and the current chairman of the district people's representative assembly and the current district chief can participate as candidates if they meet the above qualification requirements. There are no regulations or procedures for suppression." This is conveyed to you.

Reply to Mr. Zhang Bingnan: Regarding your letter regarding the demobilization of young soldiers, we received a reply from the Ministry of National Defense stating, "The Ministry of National Defense has been handling the collection and training of unemployed military officers as a major plan for the government's military demobilization. Since its implementation, it has repeatedly extended the deadline for collection and training and has repeatedly relaxed the standards for collection and training to take care of the actual difficulties of those seeking training. All officers who served the country during the war of resistance and did not defect mid-way have been accommodated as much as possible to give them the opportunity for further education and career change. Those who cannot continue to serve will be processed for retirement and protected by law. Simplification of the collection and training procedures has also been improved. The statement in Mr. Zhang's original letter that "there are those who are rejected because they are not military school students or National Army" is not the truth." This is the reply.

### Joint Defense of the Spitsbergen Archipelago: Soviet Union and Norway Reach Basic Agreement, Moscow Publicly Discusses Negotiations, Arouses British Reaction, U.S. Remains Temporarily Silent

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] Soviet Radio officially announced that the Norwegian and Soviet governments have reached a basic agreement on negotiations to revise the Paris Treaty of 1928 regarding the Spitsbergen Archipelago. Negotiations had been conducted in 1944-45 and reopened last month. At that time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the Norwegian Foreign Minister at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and the matter was raised again. Both sides believed that it was necessary to jointly defend the island.

The Soviet Union proposed three reasons for revising the treaty: (1) The Soviet government did not participate in the drafting of the treaty, and some countries that participated in drafting the treaty later fought against the Allied powers. (2) The treaty stipulates that Mitvitch Island be ceded to Norway, but the island actually belonged to the Soviet Union before. (3) The current status of Spitsbergen is economically and defensively unfavorable to the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative stated during the negotiations that before the war, the Soviet Navy received coal from the Soviet coal mines on Spitsbergen, which accounted for 400,000 tons of the annual output of 650,000 tons. The radio station later stated that Spitsbergen's position was extremely important in World War II.

[Associated Press, London, 15th] A British Foreign Office spokesman today questioned the Soviet Union's new claim to Mitvitch Island in the Spitsbergen Archipelago. He stated that the international treaty of 1920 demilitarized the island, and the Soviet Union is still bound by this treaty. "The area is Norwegian territory, and we do not know what right the Soviet Union has to claim any island in the area." According to the Soviet TASS news agency, an "authoritative Soviet source" said that Mitvitch Island "is actually a Soviet island" and declared that the Soviet Union and Norway have agreed that "joint defense" is necessary in the area. The 1920 treaty is still valid because some of its signatories fought against the United Nations. This refers to Italy and Germany.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Regarding the rumor that Norway and the Soviet Union have reached a basic agreement on "jointly defending the Spitsbergen Archipelago when necessary," officials at the State Department here refused to comment until they received an official report from Moscow.

### Britain and France Agree to Conclude Alliance as Soon as Possible: Blum's Visit to Britain is Satisfactory

[Report from our office] Paris, 15th, Emergency Broadcast: As a result of discussions between French Prime Minister Blum and British Prime Minister Attlee, it has been agreed to establish a Franco-British alliance as soon as possible.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Well-informed sources here say that French Prime Minister Blum's negotiations here have been very smooth and have ended 24 hours earlier than expected. Blum and Attlee originally planned to meet this morning but temporarily cancelled the meeting. This does not mean that the negotiations failed. It actually indicates that the meeting between the French Prime Minister and British Foreign Secretary Bevin was very satisfactory, all issues have been resolved, and there is no need for further discussion. It is also learned that Blum will attend a banquet hosted by the British government today and then attend a party hosted by Creech this afternoon.

### Soviet Ambassador to France Suddenly Returns to Country to Report on Duties

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] Well-informed sources here said recently that Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov suddenly flew back to Moscow, which may be related to the Anglo-French talks currently being held in London. Prime Minister Blum invited Ambassador Bogomolov to dinner on the 12th of this month to inform him that he was about to go to London and to explain France's views on the German issue.

### Security Council Discusses Procedures, China and Britain Approve, U.S. Advocates

Discussion of Atomic Control Should Come First

[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] The United Nations Security Council will meet tomorrow to discuss the issue of world disarmament. It is rumored that China and Britain have decided to support the U.S. request to discuss the control of atomic energy first. It is said that U.S. Chief Representative Austin has received notification from Secretary of State Marshall confirming that he does not intend to change the State Department's established atomic energy control policy.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 14th] Well-informed sources announced today that when the United Nations Security Council meets tomorrow to review the general disarmament plan, U.S. Representative Austin will demand that the discussion of the atomic energy control plan be limited to before the 4th of next month and will insist on an immediate vote. The U.S. chose the 4th of next month as the deadline for two reasons: (1) to avoid unnecessary delays; (2) to allow representatives of various countries to consult with their governments in a timely manner. The Soviet side had originally advocated that the disarmament plan should be discussed in its entirety. The British side believed that the U.S. and Soviet positions were not irreconcilable, but it was feared that tomorrow's meeting would not be able to reach any solution.

### Spanish Envoy to Britain Recalled

### Famine Remains Severe, Twelve Countries Request Relief

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 14th] Twelve countries that have suffered from war, including the Philippines, Korea, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, China, Italy, Hungary, Austria, Finland, and Abyssinia, submitted requests to the United Nations expert committee last week, informing them that the countries would need to transfer themselves to the United Nations agencies. Some countries, such as the United States, have indicated that they are prepared to carry out relief efforts independently after the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ends its work, but they did not expect the amount requested to be so large. According to Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee will undoubtedly discuss legislation to engage in such relief efforts to supplement the work of the United Nations, and is currently discussing allocating $40 million for relief purposes.

### Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives Meeting: Discussion of the German Treaty First; Netherlands and Czechoslovakia Submit Memoranda; Debate to be Public, Reporters Allowed to Observe

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] The four deputy foreign ministers reached an agreement last night on which of the German and Austrian peace treaties should be discussed first, after a compromise suggestion was made by the French representative, Mr. Meville. It is reported that discussions on the German issue will begin this morning, and it is not yet certain whether the discussions on Austria will continue this afternoon. Before reaching the agreement, there was a lengthy discussion. The British representative, Mr. Strung, suggested discussing the Austrian issue in the morning and the German issue in the afternoon. The actual issue is whether Germany and Austria should be treated equally and simultaneously. The United Kingdom and the United States want to quickly resolve the Austrian issue. As the British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in his opening remarks, Austria is the link between the East and the West, and all Western countries want to prevent Germany from becoming an aggressor again. The meaning of this is self-evident. It is also learned that the four deputy foreign ministers have decided to make the debate public, and reporters can attend and observe.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The Czech Foreign Minister today broadcast on Prague Radio, briefly outlining the main points of the memorandum submitted by Czechoslovakia to the four foreign ministers' representatives meeting. According to him, "We believe that regardless of whether the future German political system is federal or centralized, the strictest control by the Allies is urgently needed."

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The U.S. State Department revealed today that the Netherlands has submitted a memorandum to the deputy foreign ministers' meeting, demanding that Germany compensate for all occupation expenses and adopt strict measures to ensure the disarmament of Germany.

The competition for the position of Speaker of the Senate of the Republic was fierce, with four candidates: Mr. Le Beaul, the former speaker of the People's Republican Party, Mr. Maran of the Communist Party, Mr. Robé of the Socialist Party, and Mr. Gassé of the Radical Socialist Party. As a result, Mr. Le Beaul was elected in the third round of voting with 129 votes, due to his age.

Major Dispute Between Left and Right Wing Members

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] When the French National Assembly opened today, a major incident was triggered by the Vietnam issue, which was the result of the right-wing opposition to the opening remarks of Mr. Giachino, the head of the Communist Party parliamentary delegation. Mr. Giachino said: "We believe that the French people hope that 1947 will bring us a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam dispute. French workers recognize that conducting a new colonial war is extremely dangerous. It is not too late to resume negotiations with the Viet Minh based on the March 1946 agreement. What France is currently and will be concerned about is stopping this bloodshed and implementing a policy of peace and order in Vietnam. Equal peace can still be achieved." When Mr. Giachino spoke to this point, the right-wing and center-wing members immediately responded with resistance and hostile shouts. While the communist members applauded enthusiastically, the opposition began to bang on the table to cover up the applause. Most of the right-wing representatives immediately left the scene, and half of the Radical Socialist Party representatives also followed suit, but order was finally restored.

### Draft of the Austrian Peace Treaty Drawn Up by the United Kingdom and the United States

[Reuters, Lee Chisholm, 14th] The diplomatic reporter of the Texarkana Gazette stated: Although the British draft of the Austrian treaty has not been published, its content has been learned, including nine main points: (1) establishing a free and independent Austria; (2) withdrawing Allied troops stationed in Austria; (3) free navigation of the Danube River; (4) supporting Austria's accession to the United Nations organizations; (5) restoring the Austrian border of 1938; (6) not recognizing Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia's territorial claims against Austria; (7) not demanding reparations; (8) complete freedom of religion, no discrimination in trade; (9) only factories established by Germany in Austria after 1938 may be considered German capital. The diplomatic reporter also said that the US draft is similar to this. The United Kingdom and the United States will also advocate that Austria maintain its public security forces to protect its borders.

### France and Vietnam Maintain Their Own Positions; War Unlikely to End Soon

Hue has been besieged for three weeks. Da Nang is 60 miles from Hue. The French side did not express any opinion on this report. At the same time, United Press Hanoi reported that a Viet Minh military organization called the "Self-Defense Corps" has appeared with 1,000 members, attempting to break out of the besieged area of Hanoi. Yesterday, several assaults were repelled by the French army, and the war will continue afterwards. The authorities are now working hard to restore normalcy in areas outside the war zone. A theater in Hanoi that has not been damaged has reopened, and the audience is crowded.

### Nomonhan Battle; Over Ten Thousand Japanese Soldiers Killed; Ashes Discovered in Northeast Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The ashes of more than 10,000 Japanese soldiers who died in the conflict between the Japanese army and the Soviet Union on the Nomonhan border between Siberia and Northeast China in 1939 were accidentally discovered in Ichikawa Castle, Chiba Road, northeast of Tokyo. These were the ashes of the Guofutai troops (who were annihilated during the battle with the Soviet Union at that time). The ashes were discovered by a person who demolished a part of a completed war memorial monument under the order of the Japanese government. No one knows when and how this ash was buried under the unfinished monument, because the administrator is deceased and all the documents were lost during the war. This was obviously secretly hidden by the Japanese military authorities under the unfinished monument to cover up the true losses of Japan in the Nomonhan War.

### Yoshida Visited the Emperor Twice Yesterday; Three-Party Cabinet to be Established; Internal Negotiations Continue

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 15th] The work of forming a coalition cabinet centered on Prime Minister Yoshida is progressing smoothly. In addition to the Socialist Party convening a standing committee today, it was very quiet on the surface, but the government and the Socialist Party have been in considerable contact. The qualifications of the candidate for the new cabinet are also being investigated. Yoshida visited the Emperor twice in the morning and afternoon to report on the current situation. The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party did not make any motion on the grounds that the government had not officially expressed its will. However, because Mr. Suzuki Mo Saburo and Mr. Kato Kanji published their left-wing policy guidelines without consulting the party organs in advance, they were accused by the right-wing and center-wing factions of being a split action. The internal negotiations between the government and the Socialist Party have progressed to the number of people who will enter the cabinet and the chair. The Socialist Party may have four to five people enter the cabinet. Committee Chairman Katayama and Secretary-General Nishio will serve as state ministers, Hirano Rizo will serve as Minister of Agriculture, Matsuoka Komakichi will serve as Minister of Labor, and Mizutani Chozaburo will serve as Minister of Commerce. Regarding the experience of all cabinet members, it is said that Yoshida will decide to have six from the Liberal Party, five from the Progressive Party, and four from the Socialist Party. The cabinet members from the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party will not have major changes.

He recently told President Truman that if Marshall wants him to stay, he can dispel his intention to resign. Another Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Clayton, is said to be planning to resign when his term of office comes to an end.

### Severe Labor Unrest in London; Urgently Seeking Negotiated Solution; Sympathy for Strikers Increasing

[United Press, London, 15th] Mr. Shakesling, vice chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, declared that the labor unrest of 30,000 truck drivers and market workers is expected to be resolved through negotiations. Other workers should continue to work and wait for negotiations, without responding. However, 1,500 Thames barge workers have unanimously voted to strike and called on 4,000 other barge workers to strike unanimously today, and hope that 24,000 London dockworkers and 16,000 Liverpool dockworkers will join. Liverpool dockworkers leader Campbell, who led strikes twice in the past, advocated a "truce" of 72 hours during the negotiation period.

[United Press, London, 14th] The labor unrest of 30,000 truck drivers and market workers has expanded to dockworkers. At the same time, government, union, and industry leaders are urgently establishing negotiation mechanisms, hoping to resolve the labor unrest within 48 hours.

### Soviet Diplomatic Representative to Mexico Leaks Soviet Espionage Secrets

[United Press, New York, 14th] After Mr. Alexander Iv, former commercial counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, abandoned his position and refused to return to the Soviet Union, he recently gave a speech to reporters here, saying that Mr. Alexandrov, the Soviet observer who participated in the Bikini atomic bomb test, was actually a representative of the Soviet secret police. Although the Soviet Union has not yet learned the secrets of the atomic bomb, Soviet scientists are now trying their best to explore them and want to get to the bottom of it. Soviet spies are now conducting large-scale activities in the United States, especially concerned about the inside story of the atomic bomb.

### Charlton Dies; Another Weakness for the United States Next Week

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Lieutenant General Charlton, former commander of the U.S. Army General Inspector and former commander of the U.S. forces in the India-Burma theater, died today at Walter Reed Hospital.

### Fog and Snow; Breaking Hurricanes; Human Power is Omnipotent!

Recently, there have been frequent plane crashes around the world, resulting in the deaths of more than 300 people, but this is not a new stimulus for scientists, who are determined to use human power to overcome nature.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Recently, there have been frequent plane crashes around the world, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The biggest reason is the fog at the airport, poor visibility, and failure to land safely. American climatologists are now mobilizing to study a permanent solution to manipulate the climate with human power.

Great Work May Take Several Years

And seek to disperse the fog around the airports to ensure safety. The U.S. Weather Bureau is now working jointly with the Army, Navy, and outstanding private scientists on a comprehensive research program that may take several years to achieve results, but all hope to know for sure whether a huge amount of human power, such as atomic energy or a large fire, can break sea hurricanes. Most of the world's storms, snowstorms, and the damage they cause are caused by these hurricanes. The question is how to recognize the brewing storm and break it with sufficient force, or divert it. The focus of the research is on a new type of calculation, which will be a million times faster than the current one. According to the proposed plan, the steps are as follows:

(1) Obtain more facts in meteorology, emphasizing the laws of air movement, which requires universal observation around the world.

(2) Create mathematical formulas that contain many facts obtained from meteorological observations for calculations. The weather forecasts obtained are also based on formulas.

(3) Scientists will closely observe the generation of world storms to determine whether a large force can be used to break or divert them at any location in the storm. If this is possible, scientists will decide how humans can make a forceful counterattack against it. If atomic energy is used, they will also find ways to use it safely.

Changing the Climate is Still in its Early Stages

Humans have proven on a small scale that they can change the local climate. Mr. Shufer, director of the General Electric Experiment and Research Laboratory, drove a plane over the clouds and dropped a layer of dry ice. The observers on the ground immediately saw that the golf course was planning to conduct further research to tame the fog around the airports. Dr. Newman of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, is one of the world's most famous scholars. Several scientists are now working with him to calculate the application of meteorology to open up a new situation. Dr. Wechsler, director of the Climate Bureau's special science team, is also engaged in research. In addition, naval and army aviators and meteorologists, such as Professor Panofsky of New York University, Dr. Virey of the Alger Soil Academy, and Lieutenant Thomson, an aviation climate specialist, are all helping to solve all the problems. The Climate Bureau receives more than a dozen letters a week providing ideas for man-made climates. In fact, "rainmaking" was an ancient profession. The U.S. Morning Industry tested a theory in 1891 that if enough chemical bombs were exploded in or near the clouds, it could cause water vapor to precipitate. This was tested in Washington and Dunkirk and was able to cause rain. According to Dr. Kriss, the locations where most of the world's hurricanes occur have been determined, namely the South Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea, from which the storms on the east coast of the United States originate.

Others are the South Sea Islands, the Indian Ocean, and the western and southern Pacific. The storms that occur in the latter sweep across Japan and the Aleutian Islands, and their branches touch Canada and extend southeast to the United States, causing strong winds or heavy snow.

Burning Gasoline to Disperse Hurricanes

A scientist once suggested that when a hurricane is just beginning, if gasoline or kerosene is burned on the ocean surface at its source, the fire can split it into many small ones. Because the heat causes the air to rise, it can open up the stagnant air that remains on the ocean surface. Scientists believe that the occurrence of hurricanes is caused by this stagnant air. Dr. Wechsler does not yet know how to use atomic energy to break the hurricane. It is said that the hurricane is stagnant air, which emits a lot of heat. When the water vapor condenses into clouds, it will rain. Heat causes part of the air to rise, and the air around it takes the opportunity to enter, forming a large vortex, like water being released from a bathtub, but the air rotates and rises. This rotating air mass will move on the ocean surface. A Japanese scientist observed the typhoons in the Ryukyu Islands and estimated that the energy produced per second was equivalent to 400,000 tons of TNT explosives. Scientists have estimated that the explosive force of an atomic bomb is equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT, so 20 atomic bombs would have to be exploded in one second to be equal to the force of a typhoon in the Ryukyu Islands.

U.S. Aircraft Reduced in Number

[United Press, New York, 14th] Most U.S. airlines admit that the number of passengers has decreased in recent days. For example, yesterday, only half of the 35 planes that flew from the West arrived here, and there were many empty seats. This is probably due to seasonal factors and recent plane crashes. This situation will soon improve.

[United Press, Puebla, Mexico, 14th] A Mexican G-54 military transport plane crashed at the airport here today, killing all four pilots and 18 officers. According to witnesses, one of the plane's engines fell to the ground shortly after takeoff, and the pilot's attempt to land again was unsuccessful.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Mr. Wafferton, chairman of the House Interstate Commerce Committee, announced today that Congress has a plan to investigate plane crashes. Mr. Wafferton also said that Congress is considering authorizing the committee to summon airline employees. The committee has now taken steps to obtain all necessary information and is considering thoroughly investigating all plane crashes.

### National Government Commends Martyrs of the Local Press

The Shanghai News Reporters Association previously passed a motion during the "September 1st" Reporters' Day commemorative meeting, requesting the Central Propaganda Department to forward a request to the National Government to issue an order commending the martyrs of the local press who died during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and to provide compensation to their families. The National Government issued a commendation order on December 22nd of last year. The order has been sent by the Central Propaganda Department to the Shanghai News Reporters Association. The original letter is as follows: "Previously, your association reported a list of martyrs of the news media who died during the War of Resistance Against Japan and their deeds, requesting that they be forwarded to the National Government for commendation and compensation to their families. After the Central Propaganda Department forwarded the letter to the Civil Service Department of the National Government, it was replied that: "By order of the National Government on December 22nd of the 35th year, it is hereby ordered: 'During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the patriots of the news media in the occupied areas faced the enemy's flames, did not fear the strong, promoted national policies, and were strict and unyielding, thus incurring the enemy's jealousy and harming them recklessly. In the past few years, the number of martyrs who died one after another, even in Shanghai, has reached as many as 15. In addition to Shao Lubai, Zhang Sixu, Jin Huating, and Li Junying, who have already been commended by order, all the reporters who died, Zhu Xinggong, Cheng Zhenzhang, Zhao Guodong, Feng Mengyun, Zhou Weishan, Qin Jinghuan, Chen Tongxuan, Wu Hongshao, Zhu Mingchun, Wang Anlu, Chen Kunlin, etc., all sacrificed themselves for the country, and their loyalty is admirable. They should be commended by order and given a pension of 30,000 yuan each to show their loyalty.' This order." Therefore, it is hereby replied, and it is hoped that you will take note and inform us of the compliance." To the Shanghai News Reporters Association, Central Propaganda Department.

### Total Car Allowance for Councilors Totals Fourteen Million

### Pro-Japanese White Russian Intellectual Granted Bail of 10 Million Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] Alexander Panlin, a White Russian, was tried yesterday in the High Court. The defendant was old and frail, with a white beard, and had difficulty walking, requiring assistance to reach the court. The original indictment from the High Prosecutor's Office stated that the defendant was a known pro-Japanese White Russian intellectual. In the autumn of the 116th year (presumably of the Republic), when enemy troops attacked Shanghai, the defendant's "Schuss Magazine" published opinions unfavorable to China's resistance against Japan. He also served as the chief writer for the pro-Japanese White Russian newspaper "Russian Voice," using the name Antoloff to publish articles opposing the Soviet government and sowing discord between allied nations like Britain, America, and China. Furthermore, in the 28th year (presumably of the Republic), he served as an employee of the intelligence bureau of the enemy consulate in Shanghai, contacting accomplices in other cities to carry out pro-Japanese activities. When questioned, the defendant denied ever working for the enemy intelligence bureau and denied any contact with the Japanese. As for his past statements, he claimed they contained no pro-Japanese sentiments or anything detrimental to China's war of resistance. He presented a book of his past writings and clippings as proof. After the hearing, the defendant, citing his old age, requested bail. The collegiate panel ruled that he be released on bail of 10 million yuan, subject to being summoned at any time.

### Puppet Consulate Document Reviewer Shrinks Back to Jail After Hearing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the High Court heard two cases involving minor staff members of the puppet Foreign Ministry's Korean consulate. One was Jiang Daquan, from Shaoxing, with unkempt hair and a dirty face, appearing sickly, and wearing a tattered overcoat.

The other was Zhou Zhenbai, 26 years old, speaking with a Shandong accent, wearing an old blue suit, and a gray old scarf around his neck. He claimed to have served as a secretary at the puppet Korean Consulate General. After the victory, he was unable to return, and the puppet consulate general requested the Foreign Ministry to allow him to return, but he was unexpectedly brought here under escort. After the hearing, both defendants shrank back and were taken back to jail.

### Brothers in Misfortune Collude and Act Corruptly - Shao Yunxiang to be Ordered Arrested

Shao Yunli, formerly the head of the puppet Tonghai District Tax Bureau, is the cousin of the traitor Shao Shi-jun. During the War of Resistance, he followed the traitor Shao Shi-jun, sparing no effort in collecting taxes for the enemy and puppet regime. In addition to serving as the aforementioned puppet bureau chief, he also held positions such as the section chief of the certificate department and the seventh section chief of the puppet Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Tax Bureau. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was reported, but the defendant had already fled without a trace along with the traitor Shao Shi-jun. Now, the High Prosecutor's Office has concluded its investigation of the case, believing that Shao Yunxiang's guilt is certain. Although he has not surrendered to face interrogation, he was formally prosecuted yesterday according to law. If the defendant still fails to surrender for trial, the High Court will issue an arrest warrant.

### Sino-Argentine Commercial Treaty - Soon to be Signed - Argentine Chargé d'Affaires Talks - Hopes for Mutual Exchange of Students and Journalists

Argentine Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Shanghai, Fineda, (see photo) told reporters yesterday that "Chinese Ambassador to Argentina Chen Jie, and He Molin, the head of the Chinese commercial delegation to Argentina, are conducting commercial negotiations with the Argentine government on behalf of the Chinese government. The new Sino-Argentine Commercial Treaty will be signed once the negotiations are completed." Mr. Fineda described the bright prospects for commercial relations between China and Argentina, saying "China and Argentina both have many unique products that the other lacks, such as silk, which is China's main export and is urgently needed by Argentina." Mr. Fineda firmly believes that after the signing of the new Sino-Argentine Commercial Treaty and the smooth operation of shipping, commercial relations between the two countries will inevitably develop. Mr. Fineda also stated that he has suggested to major shipping companies in his country that they have drafted plans to open direct shipping lines between China and Argentina.

Since arriving in China in August last year, Mr. Fineda has devoted much effort to promoting Sino-Argentine relations. During the Lunar New Year, he will present President Chiang with a sword he has worn for fifteen years, a prize awarded to him by former Argentine President Uriburu when he was studying at the Argentine Military Academy. With Mr. Fineda's efforts and assistance, the Sino-Argentine Chamber of Commerce and the Sino-Argentine Cultural and Social Association have been established. The latter's main purpose is to transport cloth and grain from Argentina to China to relieve shortages. Mr. Fineda sincerely stated, "Through the above two organizations, the Chinese people will understand Argentina more deeply, and at the same time, through similar organizations in Argentina, the Argentine people will gain a deeper understanding of China. China and Argentina have many things in common. The Argentine people greatly admire China's heroic resistance to fight for freedom, independence and democracy."

Mr. Fineda believes that the mutual exchange of students and journalists is extremely important for enhancing friendly understanding between the two countries. He said that he has suggested to his government to establish scholarships and honorary degrees for Chinese students. This suggestion is being considered by a special committee set up by the Argentine government. Mr. Fineda also said that Argentina welcomes journalists from all countries to engage in news reporting, because the ideal of freedom of the press has been realized after President Perón took office in Argentina.

At the recent meeting of the Shanghai Consular Corps, Mr. Fei suggested establishing a monument to the "unknown heroes" of China. Chen Guolian, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, wrote to Mr. Fei, praising the above suggestion as an epoch-making event in the history of Sino-Argentine diplomatic relations.

When asked about his views on the Chinese political situation, Mr. Fineda believes that the current difficult situation is inevitable after China's eight-year long war of resistance. He firmly believes that based on China's abundant resources and democratic spirit, peaceful unification will eventually be realized, because the recent National Assembly and the work of constitution-making not only fully demonstrate China's democratic spirit, but also guide China to move forward towards the goal of democracy.

### Mad Cow Causes Havoc, Runs Wild, and Injures People - North Zhejiang Road - A Scene of Chaos - Police Arrive to Stop the Illegal Act - What Does "Shot Cow Steak" Taste Like?

[Report from Our Newspaper] Near North Zhejiang Road and Anqing Road (Avenue Edward VII), just when it was the rush hour of the morning market yesterday, suddenly there was a great uproar, and everyone saw vehicles and horses running wildly, and pedestrians running madly, and the order was in great chaos for a while. Then a head of cattle was seen, with eyes straight, running wildly. At that time, two pedestrians were knocked down to the ground because they couldn't avoid it in time. At that time, cars honked wildly, shouting loudly, and it was in a state of chaos. Therefore, the cattle heard the sound and became more and more terrified, and its crazy state was almost to an unmanageable point, and it was no longer possible for human power to stop it. Running east and west, jumping left and kicking right, it was like entering a no-man's land. After such a disturbance for a long time, it suddenly turned into Huaxing Road, and then turned its head and rushed to the mouth of Tianbao Lane, blocked by a bamboo fence. The mad cattle didn't care about anything, lowered its head and picked it up, with a bang,

broke away and entered. Unexpectedly, inside, there was a car factory. It happened that a worker named Ni Qijin was bending over to repair a car. The mad cattle was ignorant and could not distinguish between kindness and hatred. As soon as he saw the horns pointing down, Ni Qijin had been rushed out more than ten feet away, lying injured and unable to get up. At that time, the mad cattle suddenly turned and ran out again, re-entering the road. People became more and more frightened. At that time, the matter had spread all over the northern district. Soon, two policemen from the North Station post learned about it and ran to the scene with guns. They ordered the passersby to move away on both sides, and immediately raised their guns and fired at the mad cattle. After eight shots, the mad cattle finally collapsed to the ground. At that time, the cattle owner, a local farmer named Tan Shaoxing, also ran to the scene, horrified.

did not know what to do.

After investigation by the police, it was learned that Tan Shaoxing had led the cattle from Beiyangjing in the morning, originally intending to wait for the price to sell it, but unexpectedly, when walking to North Zhejiang Road, two naughty children chased the cattle from behind with tree branches. The cattle was frightened and ran wildly, and then this farce occurred. Afterwards, the dead cattle was still returned to the farmer and resold to the slaughterhouse. It is expected that yesterday some restaurants in Shanghai may have "shot cow steak" for sale.

### Ms. Zhai Guiru Returns from Studying Abroad - Talks About the General Situation of Women's Lives in the United States - More Women than Men, Generally Experiencing a Shortage of Men - Social Life Absolutely Open, Especially Many Cases of Divorce

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Ms. Zhai Guiru, the wife of Zhou Jingwen, a leader of the China Democratic League, recently returned from studying in the United States. Yesterday afternoon, she chatted with reporters about her experience studying in the United States and the general situation of women's lives in the United States.

Ms. Zhai went to the United States two years ago, and the purpose of her going abroad was purely for travel. She studied home economics at Manhattan College in New York and Mary College in Pennsylvania. Both schools are women's colleges, so Ms. Zhai is relatively clear about the problems of American women, especially the living conditions of female students, and has done some research, so the focus of our conversation has also shifted to this aspect.

Women's Colleges are Aristocratic. According to Ms. Zhai, the current United States is generally experiencing a "shortage of men." Perhaps it is the result of the war. According to the results of the US population statistics, there are more women than men. This situation is especially important in New York City, because women in rural areas are more willing to come to the city to learn fashion, so the ratio of men to women in New York is ten to one. Therefore, unmarried men are regarded as the most precious in the eyes of New York ladies. Every female student will jump for joy as long as she can get an invitation from a boyfriend on a holiday! Even if it is just to drink a cup of the most ordinary coffee, she will consider it as the highest honor, and must make a joyful boast to her girlfriends!

Most of the women's colleges in the United States are relatively aristocratic. In addition to imparting basic skills for self-reliance, the schools also focus on etiquette in social situations, with the aim of training them to become virtuous wives and good mothers who are good at communication. Every time at dinner, everyone must change into long evening gowns, and every move must be in accordance with etiquette. Every time a festival comes, the school specially holds a dance party to allow each student to invite their boyfriend to dance. In addition, swimming, playing ball, riding horses... the study life is easy and happy.

Satisfying the Desire to Love Beauty

In this comfortable life, American women, and even men, can be said to pay little attention to politics. Women spend most of their time and money on makeup and clothing. New York fashion companies are quite amazing, changing new patterns almost every two or three days, and you can't catch up unless you're a multi-millionaire.

Working women account for most of the total number of women in the United States, and typists account for most of the working women. Most of their goals in working are to earn some money so that they can dress themselves up more beautifully. Because cosmetics are so expensive, it is difficult to satisfy their desire to love beauty with their husband's limited income, so they have to find something to do to subsidize it.

Many Lost Children

What about the children when housewives have jobs? There are no large-scale nurseries in New York, and the situation in the United States is different from that in the country, and you can hand over the children to the nanny. In the United States, a nanny's monthly salary is 100 US dollars, which is exactly equal to the entire salary of a clerk, so very few people are willing to go to the nanny. Americans live in bungalows, drive cars, but they can't afford nannies. Therefore, mothers have to leave their children at home at will, so there are many lost children in the US police station. There are also terrible disasters caused by this. Just recently, in a family in New York City, when the parents were both out working, the seven-year-old brother joked by closing the three-year-old brother in a large wooden box, and as a result, he suffocated him alive.

Why Hit Oneself

Social life in the United States is absolutely open. Any woman can go out dancing, eating, and watching movies with a man she has never met. The result of a life that is too romantic is that there are particularly many divorces. There is a city of Reno in the United States, which is famous for its divorces? Americans call it Divorce City, where the laws are particularly free for divorce. Therefore, when either party of a Reno husband or wife intends to divorce, they only need to go to Reno once, and they can complete all the procedures in a few hours.

It is said that Sino-US relations are frequent, but the understanding of China by the general American people is still limited. At least in their eyes, China has regressed for dozens of years. Especially their observations on the political situation in our country are even more superficial. They wonder why the Chinese always change their internal war? The uninterrupted civil war in China for many years has made them feel that the Chinese have a good war nature, and every Chinese is a war-mongering. When they meet Chinese people, nine out of ten ask: "Why do you always like to hit your own people!"

Speaking of this, Ms. Zhai sighed and said that whenever she heard this kind of question, she always felt unspeakably sad. In fact, which Chinese people want to have war again?

### Department of Agriculture and Forestry Actively Plans for Coastal Fisheries and Initiates Seaweed Farming, Requests Assistance from Shanghai Municipal Government via Telegram

To develop coastal fisheries and improve the livelihood of fishermen, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to organize fishermen's groups and launch literacy campaigns among fishermen. To facilitate the implementation of these measures, the Department has sent letters to local authorities throughout the country requesting assistance. The Shanghai Municipal Government received a telegram from the Department yesterday, stating: "Our country has a long coastline and extensive fishing grounds, with fishing ports scattered along the coast and islands. Fishing vessels operate in both the high seas and territorial waters. Over seven million people directly and indirectly rely on fisheries for their livelihood. Therefore, the 'Fishermen's Movement' is of utmost importance. Before the war, coastal fishermen had limited knowledge and lacked sound organization, leading to distant fishing grounds being exploited by foreigners, resulting in encroachment on fishing resources. Consequently, fishing villages were on the verge of bankruptcy, and many fishermen resorted to banditry. The War of Resistance began, severely impacting coastal areas. Over the past eight years, the situation has further deteriorated, with fishermen displaced and losing their livelihoods. Now that victory has been achieved and territories have been recovered, fishermen are returning to their hometowns to resume their occupations. To facilitate the development of coastal fisheries and improve the livelihood of fishermen, it is imperative to start with the organization of fishermen and the launch of literacy campaigns. This will help reorganize fishing villages, educate fishermen, improve their skills, and enhance their living standards, while also collectively protecting fishing resources. This approach will not only have widespread and profound effects but will also lay the foundation for future coastal fisheries development, ensuring the smooth implementation of fisheries administration. This matter concerns the livelihood of our country's fishermen and requires the active assistance of the Department's marine fisheries supervisors in various districts to remedy the situation." After receiving the document, the Municipal Government instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs to comply accordingly.

### Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Trains Inspection Personnel

Since its post-war restoration, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been making tireless efforts in commodity inspection and other related work. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, they recently submitted a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs outlining the work to be carried out this year. The main points are (1) expanding the internal organization, (2) training inspection personnel, and (3) researching commodities. The three main points are explained as follows: (1) Before the war, the Bureau had offices on the fourth and ninth floors. Since the restoration, all personnel have been working on the ninth floor, which is too small and has hampered operations. Therefore, the Bureau will first acquire additional office space before undertaking other tasks. (2) The Bureau's main work is technical, but over the years, there has been a shortage of skilled commodity inspection personnel. In the future, the Bureau plans to recruit and train such personnel. (3) Commodities that dominate the market, both domestically and internationally, are those with excellent quality. The Bureau needs to not only inspect the quality of commodities but also conduct research to continuously improve them. This is crucial for international trade, so research efforts will be strengthened.

### Former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Staff Petition: Mayor Wu Sincerely Recommends Transfer of Debt, Negotiation with Municipal Government, Numerous Relief Items, Delayed Liquidation, Decides to Urge Financial Bureau to Expedite Handling

[Report from This Newspaper] Over one thousand Chinese staff members of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's police force and fire brigade, seeking the return of savings, retirement funds, and pensions deducted by the Municipal Council during their employment, gathered at the Bund English Consulate on the 12th of this month to petition. At that time, the English Consul responded that he would consult with Mayor Wu and provide feedback on the 15th. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, these thousand-plus retired Chinese staff members gathered again on the lawn in front of the English Consulate to await news.

The English Consulate stated that all assets and creditor's rights of the former Shanghai Municipal Council had been transferred to the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government would be responsible for settling the debts. Therefore, the Consulate notified Sun Yushu, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and Dong Shoupeng, Director of the Municipal Government's Foreign Affairs Office, to meet with the petition representatives at the Consulate yesterday morning. Sun and others explained to the crowd that, according to the regulations for the takeover of the former Concessions, the current debts were the responsibility of the Municipal Government, and therefore everyone should recognize the proper target for their petitions. Regarding the issue of the Municipal Government returning these savings, a liquidation committee had been organized with relevant agencies to seek a solution. Furthermore, Mayor Wu was extremely concerned about everyone's situation, and representatives should be sent to the Municipal Government to discuss settlement methods. However, the crowd persisted in negotiating with the English Consulate and became increasingly agitated. By 2:00 PM, there was still no resolution. Mayor Wu personally went to the English Consulate to speak to the crowd, urging them to send representatives through proper channels to seek a reasonable solution. After 4:00 PM, the petitioners left the English Consulate and went to the Municipal Government, sending nine representatives, along with Yao Jiarui, the former Chinese Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, to meet with the Mayor.

The Mayor first said, "I must handle this matter whether you petition me or the English. Both will be done". He sincerely explained that the Municipal Government had established a liquidation committee in August of last year to handle similar matters. However, due to the complex and numerous accounts, it was difficult to clear them up quickly. Furthermore, it was necessary to seek instructions from the central government before implementation. He would now urge Director Gu of the Finance Bureau to expedite the matter and do his best to consider everyone's situation, increasing the payment amount as much as possible. He also stated that representatives and Yao Jiarui could meet at any time to discuss the matter. Finally, he advised them that "debts have owners," and the Municipal Government had recognized everyone as creditors. They should not gather and petition the English Consulate again to avoid unnecessary trouble, as it concerned the honor of the country. He hoped everyone would pay special attention to this. The representatives were satisfied with the Mayor's words, and the petitioning crowd dispersed in the sound of "Entrust our Mayor to be everyone's representative," bringing a temporary end to the incident.

### Production Association Organizes Loans for 50 Small and Medium-Sized Factories, Urgently Seeking Relief to Pass the New Year, Collateral Secured with Goods Pledged on a Monthly Basis, to be Repaid Next Spring, Hoping Interest Rates will be One-Third Lower than Black Market Rates

[Report from This Newspaper] The Production Loan Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Factories, organized by the China Production Association, held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in the grand auditorium of the National Goods Exhibition Marketplace at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Meibai Road in this city. Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Wang Xiaolai attended. The meeting was presided over by the Vice Chairman of the Association, Hu Boxiang, who reported on the preparatory process. Li Jishen then delivered a speech, stating that China's industry is backward and the social economy has not yet stabilized since the victory. At a time when the crisis in the business community is deepening, the government has implemented measures to provide production loans, but these are limited to large factories. In reality, it is the small and medium-sized factories that urgently need relief. Recently, there has been a surge in factory closures in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, and the majority of these are small and medium-sized factories. Therefore, to stabilize domestic order, the government and the people must cooperate with each other.

Wang Xiaolai stated that factories in our country, regardless of their size, are currently facing enormous crises. The National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have all requested relief from the government. Relief can be divided into two steps: first, to diagnose the illness, that is, to understand the difficulties and then prescribe the right medicine; the second step is to restore health. In the government's current production loan law, if only raw materials and finished products are allowed as collateral, and factory buildings and machinery cannot be used as collateral, then the city's industry and commerce will not be able to develop. The financial and industrial and commercial sectors are interconnected. Without the industrial and commercial sectors, there would be no financial sector. He hoped that the financial sector could pay attention to this and seek to flourish together. Wang also used the analogy of the state and the people, saying that the state is like the financial sector, and the people are like the industrial and commercial sector. If the state does not care about the livelihood of the people, then when the people cannot survive, there will inevitably be great turmoil and revolution.

Chairman Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, stating that production loans are slightly different from industrial loans. Industrial loans only allow raw materials and finished products as collateral, which may result in raw materials and finished products becoming stagnant and stockpiled. Therefore, this is a contradiction: on the one hand, production is to be increased, and on the other hand, raw materials are allowed to be stockpiled. The government's current production loans have been improved somewhat, with half of the collateral being allowed in the form of factory buildings and machinery, but this is limited to large factories. Generally, small and medium-sized factories are still unable to obtain loans. In fact, small and medium-sized factories have a significant impact on social and economic order, as well as on commodity prices and the daily lives of citizens. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of the China Production Promotion Association's initiative to provide production loans to small and medium-sized factories is extremely meaningful. He hoped that all sectors would promote this initiative and that fruitful results would be achieved through close cooperation between the financial and industrial and commercial sectors.

Subsequently, committee members of the association, Sheng Gongshu and Shen Hefeng, reported on the progress of their work, stating that there are over fifty small factories urgently in need of relief before the Lunar New Year. The association has sent over two hundred letters to commercial banks in the city, but there have been no concrete results yet. Factory owners have expressed their willingness to comply with all loan procedures and have collateral and guarantors. They only seek to get through this Lunar New Year and will repay the loans next spring. They only hope that the interest rates will be one-third lower than the current black market rates and hope that the financial sector will provide assistance.

### National Goods Exhibition Marketplace Closed Yesterday: Permanent Venue to be Built on the Original Site

[Report from This Newspaper] The National Goods Exhibition Marketplace, sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Association, officially closed yesterday after its term expired. The closing ceremony was held at 4:00 PM yesterday in the grand auditorium of the marketplace on Jing'an Temple Road. Over five hundred people attended, including prominent figures from the business community and representatives from various factories. The ceremony began promptly amidst music. Mayor Wu was unable to attend due to official duties and was represented by Counselor Ge Kexin. The closing ceremony was presided over by Marketplace Committee member Hu Boxiang, who reported that the purpose of holding the National Goods Exhibition Marketplace was to arouse the attention of the Chinese people to national goods in order to compete with foreign goods. The Marketplace Director Jiang Zhonghe and the Secretary of the Industrial Association, Tian Heqing, then delivered speeches, clarifying that the promotion of national goods is urgently needed at the current time when national industries are on the verge of collapse. Municipal Government Counselor Ge Kexin said that after a long period of war, cities and villages in our country have suffered severe damage. After the victory, it is a good opportunity for industries to rise and expand. Especially since American goods are flooding the city, the establishment of the National Goods Marketplace is of great significance. After Ge's speech, the closing ceremony was completed. Starting tomorrow, the wooden structures of the marketplace will be dismantled. According to Marketplace Director Jiang Zhonghe, to fundamentally realize the promotion of national goods, it is necessary to build a permanent exhibition marketplace. After discussions with a majority of factory owners, it was decided to use the original open space. They have also contacted the landowner, who has expressed strong support. The association is actively promoting the construction of a permanent marketplace.

### One Thousand Several Hundred Criminals Meet Amnesty Criteria

[Report from This Newspaper] The city's High Court, District Court, and two Procuratorates received the National Government Gazette containing the amnesty decree yesterday morning. The content is the same as that published on the front page of this newspaper on New Year's Day. Because the city's courts have not yet received the official amnesty order, only seeing it in the newspapers, it cannot have legal effect. Therefore, the amnesty prisoners released by the District Court previously were only released on bail. From today onwards, the High Court and District Court will officially begin to pardon those convicted of crimes committed before December 31, 1946, with a maximum sentence of imprisonment of less than a fixed-term prison sentence. As for the reduction of sentences, it will have to wait until the detailed amnesty regulations are received before it can be processed. It is also learned that the High Court has investigated and found that over seven hundred criminals meet the amnesty criteria, and the District Court has found eight hundred and sixty. According to the person in charge of the High Court, the names will be officially announced after the detailed regulations for sentence reduction are issued.

[Another Report] The Shanghai Prison has been working overtime in recent days to compile a list of prisoners to be submitted to the Ministry of Justice for a decision on amnesty or sentence reduction. This list is expected to be completed tonight. Because each prisoner's indictment and judgment must be checked in detail, the procedure is extremely complicated. It is reported that after the prisoners are released, their prison uniforms must be taken off and returned. If impoverished prisoners have no clothes to keep warm, a certain relief committee has donated four hundred sets of cotton clothing to the prison (three hundred sets of men's clothing and one hundred sets of women's clothing), which the prison has already received. A lawyer named Chen has also notified the prison that he has raised four hundred sets of winter clothing to be donated to the prison, but they have not yet been delivered. This winter clothing can truly be said to be like sending charcoal in the snow for impoverished prisoners.

### Japanese National Flees Before Departure: Authorities are Currently Pursuing

### 中國農民銀行委製 平水區珠茶 每擔成本廿三萬元

Chinese Farmers Bank Commissions Production of Ping Shui Green Tea: Cost Per Dan Not to Exceed 230,000 Yuan

平水區珠茶向以銷北菲最多，卅五年度首批出產約三萬餘擔，因品質特優，戰後該地消費力減低，故雖有外商定購然出價甚低，是以甚少出口，中國農民銀行有豐於此，特商洽上海市茶業輪出業同業公會代製二批次級平水珠茶一萬二千擔，並規定成本價格最高每擔不得超過國幣廿三萬元，限兩個月內全部交貨，開該會已委託興華，久與之滬地最大兩茶業公司承製。並悉此批茶葉將與即將在滬收購之外銷茶由政府統舉輪出。

Ping Shui green tea has traditionally been mostly sold to North Africa. The first batch produced in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) was about 30,000 dan. Due to its excellent quality, the purchasing power in that region has decreased after the war. Therefore, although there were foreign merchants placing orders, their prices were very low, resulting in very little export. The Chinese Farmers Bank, with surplus funds, specifically consulted with the Shanghai Tea Export Traders Association to produce two batches of 12,000 dan of second-grade Ping Shui green tea on its behalf. It was stipulated that the cost price should not exceed 230,000 yuan per dan, and all goods must be delivered within two months. The association has entrusted Xinghua and Jiu Yu, the two largest tea companies in Shanghai, to undertake the production. It is understood that this batch of tea, together with the export tea to be purchased in Shanghai, will be exported by the government in a unified manner.

中國農民銀行滬行負責人稱：該行本年度特種貸款，以茶絲　項爲主，已後就易體計劃，呈誌行審核，約二月初旬可望批准後施行，茶葉貸款之　放，爲使不失時效起見，至週於三日間核准各外銷茶商貸款數額，如去幾新茶未收購完竣，將同時並進，範圍自茶農，製造，運輸，外銷，兼及押歷，數額一五〇億元，必要時得按照實際情況，酌損增加。絲業方面，以去年度絲絲廠，原料困難，及秋　生　收購價格迄未載定，一般蠶絲界，咸以爲本年度蠶絲業振興希壞甚小，惟以生絲爲出口物品之一，該行據政府扶植外銷物品之哲憲，決統籌計劃自製種塲，桑園，蠶室用具，蠶行設衛，繅絲車改良等，希望本年內對茶絲二項外銷情況，能予改觀云。

The person in charge of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Farmers Bank stated: The bank's special loans for this year are mainly focused on tea and silk. The exchange plan has been submitted to the head office for review and is expected to be approved and implemented in early February. In order to ensure that tea loans are released in a timely manner, the amount of loans for each export tea merchant will be approved within three days of the week. If the acquisition of new tea from the previous season has not been completed, it will be carried out simultaneously. The scope covers tea farmers, manufacturing, transportation, export, and collateral, amounting to 15 billion yuan, and may be increased or decreased appropriately according to the actual situation if necessary. Regarding the silk industry, due to the difficulties in raw materials faced by silk factories last year and the failure to determine the purchase price of autumn silkworms, the general silk industry believes that the hope of revitalizing the silk industry this year is very small. However, given that raw silk is one of the export items, the bank, based on the government's policy of supporting export items, has decided to plan comprehensively for the self-production of seed fields, mulberry gardens, silkworm room equipment, the establishment of sanitary facilities for silkworm farms, and the improvement of silk reeling machines, hoping to change the export situation of tea and silk this year.

關於外埠紗廠請購外棉問題，前紡管會議決，根據收購棉紗新辦法，對原棉之供給，均照該項辦法辦理，曾分飭各區紡織公會轉知各紗廠查報現有存棉，及今後需要外棉數量，俾資統計。惟各外埠紗廠，迄未報到，有時進行。茲以各區路途較遠，辦理轉輾需時，若不寬限期間，則事實上或不克趕辦，業再分電各區紡織公會迅即查報。又據該會劉業務處長稱：外埠紗廠請購外棉，如不將該項需要數量塡報到　則本會無從統計，以後如有需要，手續上極感困難，故希望各地紗廠切勿自行放棄。

Regarding the issue of outport yarn mills requesting to purchase foreign cotton, the previous Spinning Management Conference decided that the supply of raw cotton should be handled in accordance with the new method of purchasing cotton yarn. The textile associations in each district were instructed to inform each yarn mill to check and report the existing cotton inventory and the amount of foreign cotton needed in the future for statistical purposes. However, the outport yarn mills have not yet reported, and progress is sometimes made. Because the distances to each district are relatively far, and it takes time to handle the transfers, if the period is not extended, it may not be possible to complete the work in time. A separate telegram has been sent to the textile associations in each district to quickly check and report. Furthermore, according to the association's business director, Liu: If outport yarn mills do not fill in and report the required quantity, the association will have no way to collect statistics, and if there is a need in the future, the procedures will be extremely difficult. Therefore, it is hoped that yarn mills in various places will not give up on their own.

### 平價煤球開售 憑戶口證購買

Low-Priced Coal Briquettes Go on Sale: Purchase with Household Registration Certificate

社會局爲防止奸商操縱煤球價格起見，經典經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會洽妥，以最近由越南運來之煤　六千噸，趕製煤球交全市零售商平價發賣，原定昨日起市區六十餘家煤店同時出售，後因各項手續未全，決定今日上午九時起公開平賣，每擔國幣一萬一千元，憑戶口證辦理，本月底截止云。

In order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the price of coal briquettes, the Social Affairs Bureau has negotiated with the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to use 6,000 tons of coal recently shipped from Vietnam to rush-produce coal briquettes for sale at a fair price by retailers throughout the city. It was originally scheduled to be sold simultaneously in more than 60 coal shops in the urban area yesterday, but due to incomplete procedures, it was decided to publicly sell them at a fair price starting at 9:00 AM today, at 11,000 yuan per dan, based on household registration certificates, and will end at the end of this month.

### 繅絲廠緊急呼籲 迅速核議收購價格 今日召開緊急會議不得要領決關廠

Silk Reeling Factories Urgently Appeal for Swift Review and Approval of Purchase Prices: Emergency Meeting Today Yields No Results, Decision to Close Factories

我國生絲外銷，年來因成本過钜，外銷日益困難，繅絲廠商幾瀕破產，繅絲廠商本無意收購，後經當局允許貸款收購，惟因繅工成本超過政府生絲收價一倍以上，迭向中樞呼籲，要求依照生絲成本調整收購價格，並與中央銀行當局數度接洽，迄今遷延二月，仍未獲解決，茲絲廠以舊歷年關即屆，不容再事拖延，乃於日前由繅絲業公會常務理事王化南沈九如等往央行謁貝總裁商談，結果不得要領，繅絲業公會特於日昨舉行常務理事會議，商談對策，席間決定以絲業公會名義，致央行貝總裁一函，作緊急呼籲，盼該行於二日內令中蠶公司立即核覆辦理，該會並定今日下午舉行全體會員大會，共同解決同業危機，設若中央銀行不能決定收購價格，該會將進一步要求每担生絲光　三百萬元，以救年關烯眉之急，如再不應允，各廠惟有關廠待斃，個發生嚴　後果，其查　由政府担負云。茲探誌該會致貝生籲幾　函如下：

Due to the excessive cost of raw silk exports in China in recent years, exports have become increasingly difficult, and silk reeling manufacturers are on the verge of bankruptcy. The silk reeling manufacturers originally had no intention of purchasing, but after the authorities allowed loans for purchasing, the cost of silk reeling exceeded the government's purchase price of raw silk by more than one time. They have repeatedly appealed to the central government, requesting to adjust the purchase price according to the cost of raw silk, and have contacted the Central Bank authorities several times. So far, it has been delayed for two months and has not been resolved. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, silk factories cannot allow further delays. A few days ago, Wang Huanan and Shen Jiuru, managing directors of the Silk Industry Association, went to the Central Bank to meet with President Bei to discuss the matter, but the results were not satisfactory. The Silk Industry Association specifically held a meeting of managing directors yesterday to discuss countermeasures. During the meeting, it was decided to send a letter to President Bei of the Central Bank in the name of the Silk Industry Association, making an urgent appeal, hoping that the bank would order the China Silkworm Company to immediately review and handle the matter within two days. The association also scheduled a general meeting of all members this afternoon to jointly resolve the crisis of the industry. If the Central Bank cannot decide on the purchase price, the association will further request 3 million yuan per dan of raw silk to alleviate the urgent needs of the New Year. If it is not approved again, the factories will have to close down and await death, and the consequences will be borne by the government. The association's letter to President Bei is recorded below:

逕啓者，需政府准予按照秋期生絲成本收購並酌給利潤，以免整個繅絲業崩潰一案，前經敝會分呈院部迅予核辦並於卅五年十二月初，推派代表晉京請求，業於十二月中旬奉行政院宋院長批交台端核議，關於秋期生絲成本，復經政府機構之中蠶公司，據實調查送請察核各在案，敝會迭向貴行接洽，一再延諉，置敝會會員各廠痛苦於不顧，茲屆廢歷年關整個絲業存亡迫眉睫，台端對於本案旣負核議之責任，自應趕速遵辦，何以遲遲視若無賭，陷敝會失信於會員，各廠深爲駭異，爲此函請爺遵宋院長交核之旨，迅於二日內照中蠶公司查覆辦理，以便轉達各會員，萬一拖延，各會員不能維持而發生嚴重後果，咎將誰竭，專此奉陳，務祈立購惠覆，此致中央銀行貝總裁。

Respectfully, regarding the case where the government needs to approve the purchase of autumn raw silk at cost and provide a reasonable profit to avoid the collapse of the entire silk reeling industry, our association previously submitted it to the Yuan Department for swift review and handling, and in early December of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), representatives were dispatched to Beijing to request it. In mid-December, President Song of the Executive Yuan approved it and handed it over to you for review. Regarding the cost of autumn raw silk, the China Silkworm Company, a government agency, conducted a factual investigation and submitted it for review. Our association has repeatedly contacted your bank, but it has been repeatedly delayed, ignoring the suffering of our association's member factories. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the survival of the entire silk industry is imminent. Since you are responsible for reviewing this case, you should expedite its handling. Why do you delay it as if it were nothing, causing our association to lose credibility with its members and causing deep consternation among the factories? Therefore, we hereby request you to comply with President Song's instructions and handle the matter according to the China Silkworm Company's investigation and reply within two days so that it can be conveyed to all members. In the event of further delays, if members cannot maintain operations and serious consequences occur, who will bear the blame? We respectfully submit this and urge you to reply promptly. Respectfully to President Bei of the Central Bank.

### 僑匯逃避 多經民信局

Remittance Evasion Mostly Through Private Postal Agencies

頃據金融思權威方面告稱：關於上年度大量僑匯之逃避，其　結所在，當係外匯牌價具黑市相差縣殊，但是項逃避僑匯，亦非如外傳之甚，均落在當地錢兌莊手中，實則多半爲當地民信局所包攬。因民信局之歷史較郵局悠久，我國在明末清初之時，已有局信局之設立，故延至目前，仍握有相當勢力，且頗得各地僑胞之信賴。最近復據中行方面統計，上年十二月份該行收入僑匯，其數字又較十一月份减少，故今後對民信局之承兌寄遞僑匯，確值得注意之。

According to financial authorities: Regarding the large-scale evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese last year, the crux of the matter lies in the significant difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate. However, the evasion of remittances is not as widespread as rumored, and it does not all fall into the hands of local money exchange shops. In fact, most of it is handled by local private postal agencies. Because the history of private postal agencies is longer than that of the post office, private postal agencies were established in China during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Therefore, they still hold considerable power to this day and are quite trusted by overseas Chinese in various places. According to recent statistics from the Bank of China, the bank's income from remittances in December of last year decreased compared to November. Therefore, the acceptance and delivery of remittances by private postal agencies in the future is indeed worth paying attention to.

### 台灣航業公司成立 規劃新航綫 定斯航台滬粵青

Taiwan Navigation Company Established: Planning New Routes, Regular Service to Taiwan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Qingdao

台省行政長官公署主持之台灣航業公司，業已正式成立，資本總額爲一百億元，內台省公署六成，招商局四成，由徐學禹擔任董事長，台省公署交通處長任顯茲任總經理，該公司現已有「台北」「台南」兩輪，常川行駛，現決定開闢上海至台灣，台灣至廣州，台灣至青島之定期航綫。按滬台航綫之暢通，對本市煤斤貪米之供應，裨益極钜，現由台灣運滬之煤升，每月達六萬噸，如運輸暢通，則台煤運滬數量，尙可繼續增加云。

The Taiwan Navigation Company, sponsored by the Taiwan Provincial Government, has been officially established with a total capital of 10 billion yuan, of which 60% is from the Taiwan Provincial Government and 40% is from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Xu Xueyu is the chairman, and Ren Xianzhe, director of the Department of Transportation of the Taiwan Provincial Government, is the general manager. The company already has the "Taipei" and "Tainan" vessels, which operate regularly, and it has now decided to open regular routes from Shanghai to Taiwan, Taiwan to Guangzhou, and Taiwan to Qingdao. The smooth flow of the Shanghai-Taiwan route is of great benefit to the supply of coal and rice in this city. Currently, the amount of coal shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai reaches 60,000 tons per month. If transportation is smooth, the amount of Taiwan coal shipped to Shanghai can continue to increase.

### 猪肉銷暢價昂

Pork Sales Brisk, Prices High

近日江北毛猪來滬稍减，而時值農曆年底，本市鮮肉走銷特暢，以致　價日昂，昨鮮肉拆每擔三十四萬元至三十六萬，鮮肉莊零售腿肉每斤四千七八百元，夾精四千元，肋條三千八百元，惟近郊及蘇錫鮮肉販運來滬者，其價稍覺低廉，每斤三千五百元至四千元。

Recently, the number of live pigs from Jiangbei arriving in Shanghai has decreased slightly. As it is the end of the Lunar year, the sales of fresh meat in the city are particularly brisk, resulting in prices rising daily. Yesterday, the wholesale price of fresh meat was 340,000 to 360,000 yuan per dan. Fresh meat shops retailed leg meat for 4,700 to 4,800 yuan per catty, lean meat for 4,000 yuan, and ribs for 3,800 yuan. However, the price of fresh meat transported from the suburbs and Suzhou-Wuxi to Shanghai was slightly cheaper, at 3,500 yuan to 4,000 yuan per catty.

### 生產貸款工作 一時不易結束

Production Loan Work Not Easily Completed in the Short Term

財政次長兼四聯總處秘書長徐泊國氏，爲謀生產事業貸款臨時審委會工作推動，調查各生產機關現狀，及其資金實際運用情形，特於上週抄由京來滬，茲悉徐氏公畢，已於昨晨返京，記者鋻於各廠認爲該會係臨時組織，預料結束時期恐不出農曆年底，故於徐氏行前，特提出上項問題，向其詢問，並承徐氏解答如次，本會對審查申貸案件，未全部完竣以前，自繼續推進，最低估計尙須一個月以後，方可暫告段落，即使將來對審查各案已處理完畢時，本會工作亦未能瑧總結束階段，因彼時須根據本會貸款原則，將經常派員逕赴各廠調查其資金用途及生產狀況，此種工作當不斷進行，是則本會全部工作結束時期，實不容事前預定寧工作人員均係由三行兩局調用，對經費問題更無影響，徐氏末稱：此番視察經過情形良好，並對各委員專家審查案件不偏不倚之態度，表示欣慰。

Xu Boguo, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, came to Shanghai from Beijing last week to promote the work of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans, investigate the current status of various production agencies, and examine the actual use of their funds. It is learned that Mr. Xu has completed his official duties and returned to Beijing yesterday morning. The reporter, in view of the fact that various factories believe that the committee is a temporary organization and that the end of its term is not expected to extend beyond the end of the Lunar year, specifically raised the above question to him before his departure and received the following answer from Mr. Xu: The committee will continue to advance until the review of all loan applications is completed. It is estimated that it will take at least another month before it can be temporarily concluded. Even if all cases have been processed in the future, the work of the committee will not be fully concluded, because at that time, based on the committee's loan principles, personnel will be regularly sent directly to various factories to investigate the use of funds and production status.

### Arctic Expedition Account Jianhua

The British Arctic expedition departed not long ago, and the American Antarctic expedition continues to depart, now en route, and will surely have new records in the future. This is the report from the British Venus Expedition, newly returned from the Arctic, by its leader Morse Bick.

Standing Icebergs

On August 8, 1946, we set off, and it has been three weeks now. Today, we are passing through the Katanga River in the Arctic Ocean. Along the way, icebergs stand tall, their shimmering light very eye-catching. There are cold-resistant waterfowl along the coast, flying in flocks, like snowflakes dancing in the sky. Our three major warships are heading towards Jianhu Island. From upstream, ice floes sometimes rush down. If there were no remote ice flow instruments, the ship's hull might have been damaged. The ship traveled for three days and nights before reaching Blue Fox Island, where the strong winds roared and the climate felt even colder. This is the old destination for whaling, but when we arrived, there were no whaling vessels, nor did we see any national flags.

When leaving Blue Fox Island and heading north, the ocean surface was often shrouded in thick fog. Although we were full of courage, we inevitably felt apprehensive in the vast and foggy ocean. We concentrated our minds at home to avoid danger. One day, the thick fog suddenly dissipated, and we saw a black dot in the distance. We cheered and advanced as if we had discovered a new continent. As we approached the black dot, it turned out to be an unnamed small island. A group of walruses were tumbling in the waves. We tried to land and erected a prefabricated iron road sign on the island, which read "British Venus Expedition Discovered Native Land."

A Scene of Barrenness

Consel Island, traditionally said to be a gold-producing area, has a total area of ​​more than 2,000 square miles, with a vast land and no people, and a scene of utter barrenness. After we arrived, we set up tents on the island. Because the cold air was overwhelming, we took turns warming ourselves by the fire, and divided into five small teams to explore the mountains. Team member Wilkes found a huge piece of native gold, and Greaves also found a piece. The total amount obtained by the two people reached four kilos and sixty grams. Other team members only knew that the island produced foxes and found nothing else. However, since there is native gold, large-scale mining will surely yield good results. October 19th was my birthday. We were drinking and having fun when we suddenly heard gunfire. The team members cheered with joy because we had received a wireless report that the second Venus expedition had also caught up.

The second team had five warships, which, together with our three, totaled eight. After we erected the Venus team road sign on the island, we left Consel Island and continued north. Now our momentum is strong, and we have gained a lot of courage. After five days at sea, the Lantek ship was damaged by an ice flow. Fortunately, there were fifteen large pieces of wood tied to the port side, otherwise, it might have suffered great danger. One day, we arrived at Viti Levu Island, which is composed of more than two hundred and fifty small islands, with an area of ​​7,434 square miles. The largest of these is Viti Levu Island. We decided to land, but the mountains were covered with ice and snow, and there were no roads to follow. The cold wind was biting, and there was a possibility of fingers and skin cracking. As we passed through a deep valley, the team members suddenly saw tents at the bottom of the valley and exclaimed in surprise. At this time, everyone's attitude was frenzied, and their blood was boiling. They ran to the bottom of the valley and saw only a large, broken airplane, not tents. Inside and outside the airplane, fifteen incomplete skeletons were found, with white bones scattered all over the ground, a scene like a terrifying demon cave. We recalled the TASS report of the missing plane, which may have been this one. In addition to expressing our pity and sympathy, we also admired their ambition. So we collected the wreckage, dug a pit and buried it, and added a cross.

Nothing Gained

This unfortunate incident increased our determination to move forward. However, less than five days of northward progress made it impossible for us to advance further because the future was full of ice floes and ice blocks, with no gaps to walk. We fired more than two hundred shots, but could not blast open a passage, and each ship was covered with a layer of ice, which made it difficult for us to move and left us helpless. Now, although we still have half a year's worth of food, staying in the Arctic Ocean is definitely not a good idea, so since we cannot advance, we can only retreat quickly. When the eight ships entered Devonport, they were welcomed by tens of thousands of people, but we asked ourselves and felt ashamed that we had gained nothing from this trip!

### Early Tea President's Background良translated from this month's issue of ")"

If you have the ambition to become president, it is best to study law. In the United States, of the thirty-two men who have attained the high office of president, nineteen were quite active in the legal profession before entering the political arena. Five were farmers, two were soldiers, and the remaining six included a tailor, a writer, an educator, an editor, an engineer, and a cloth retailer.

### Shanghai Cross-Section Beggars Welcoming Spring (Part 1) Huang Ximo

During the twenty days at the end of the lunar year and the new year, it is the auspicious time for beggars. Beggars are the garbage left over from feudal traditions. They are hereditary followers of agriculture. During this period, every household is preparing for the New Year, and no one wants to get angry with beggars, lest it causes inauspicious scolding. So they have no choice but to give alms, giving alms without hesitation. The beggars also speculatively sing and play various songs suitable for the market to win the favor of the almsgivers and create a festive atmosphere around them. The begging patterns and lyrics in this season are completely different from usual. Because they can only use it once a year, this phenomenon can be seen in this city.

### Dropping the Kitchen God

On the day of sending off the Kitchen God at the end of the lunar month, there is a kind of "Dropping the Kitchen God" song, which is the exclusive performance of female beggars. Therefore, all the women and girls of the beggar households are dispatched in full force. They dress up in an extremely flirtatious manner, with their faces covered with red rouge and white powder, and their heads adorned with palace flowers. They go from house to house singing ditties. Behind them is an old beggar, holding a small gong in his hand, striking it at the door. Then the girls sing in a delicate voice:

"Plum blossoms bloom in the snow, peach blossoms wait for spring!
Kitchen God arrives, the family is good.
Where does the Kitchen God come from? The Kitchen God comes from heaven;
The Kitchen God drops once, the family is better once!
If a family doesn't drop, the Kitchen God will be annoyed."

### Happy New Year

From the first to the tenth day of the New Year, the northern beggars, whenever they arrive at someone's door, must not shout "Master and Madam" as usual, but must first recite a set of auspicious songs, conveying the meaning of "New Year's fortune". The lyrics are as follows:

"New Year, new moon, passing the New Year, red couplets pasted all over the door,
Large ingots are carried in.
Money tree comes in through the front door,
Treasure pot comes in through the back door.
Treasure pot, with golden flowers inserted,
Wealth and glory come to one family."

After reciting the song, they then shout:

"Master and Madam, Happy New Year to you! Give me something to eat."

### Pretending to Be a Turtle

During the New Year period, the local beggars often dress up as turtles and beg at the door, in small groups of two, one tall and one young, each wearing a straw hat, with glasses drawn around their eyes, making them look funny. The chorus lyrics are as follows:

"Turtles on the street, business is booming.
Incense stick nose, pepper eyes,
Awl town tail, olive head.
Little turtle, croaking: "Squeak, squeak, squeak"!
Big turtle, croaking: "Ka, ka, ka"!
Squeak, ka, ka, really noisy,
Let me beg for some copper coins to buy medicine,
Medicine kills turtles, don't come begging."

### Different Now and Then Huang Jieqing

### New Year's Day in Ancient Countries

In ancient times, the Greek New Year's Day was in June according to the Gregorian calendar; the Macedonian New Year's Day was in September; the Roman Empire's New Year's Day was first in March, and then changed to January 3rd; Mexico designated February 13th as New Year's Day; the Muslim New Year's Day was in July; the New Year's Day of Holland, Arabia, and other countries was December 28th.

### Anecdotes Fifty Years Ago Old Shanghainese Celebrating Lunar New Year Jinxia

Fifty years ago, during the New Year festivals, Shanghai gentry and merchants mostly used plum red or magenta business cards, which were twice the size of the current cards. The name was written on the front, and the store name was printed on the back, and they were delivered to relatives and friends to wish them a Happy New Year.

When offering New Year's greetings, it was customary to kneel and bow to elders, and bow with hands clasped to peers. Therefore, people who offered New Year's greetings hired accompanying servants, who carried felt mats with them. Before kneeling and bowing, the servant would first spread the felt on the ground.

At that time, women who went out to pay New Year's visits, married women mostly wore red skirts and capes; unmarried women wore only red skirts.

At that time, the Spring Festival couplets, in addition to businesses embedding the names of their stores, ordinary households mostly used sentences such as "The Emperor's grace is vast, and the imperial way is long" and "National grace and family celebration, people's longevity and abundant years." It was not until the establishment of the Republic of China and the abolition of the imperial system that they changed.

### Good Medicine for Reversing Aging Stream Translation

Scientists' research on bull hormones has proven that testosterone has the effect of reducing age by at least ten years. People who use testosterone can restore their sexual vitality and work ability from weak to strong. Clinical experience of doctors has proven that testosterone has significant effects in treating breast cancer, postpartum bleeding, angina pectoris, and muscle atrophy.

However, to obtain good results, testosterone must be used continuously or in large quantities, and testosterone is not easy to obtain and sells for US$100 per cubic centimeter, so only the wealthy can afford to buy it.

Now, amazing news has come from Mexico: people are extracting large amounts of testosterone from "sarsaparilla" roots at a low price, only one-tenth the price of animal testosterone. Testosterone tablets of this kind are already on sale in pharmacies in Mexico and South America. The inventor, Dr. Sulmo, has lived in Mexico for twenty years and has heard local natives' superstitious legends that blood-red sarsaparilla roots have the effect of strengthening the body. Sulmo not only did not ignore this superstition, but instead devoted himself to research, and unexpectedly obtained an unexpected gain.

After conducting thousands of experiments on animals and humans, Sulmo proved that sarsaparilla hormones have the same properties as animal hormones. He is currently studying a more effective method of extracting hormones from sarsaparilla roots. The current extraction method is to first peel off the outer skin of the slender sarsaparilla roots, grind them into powder, and then chemically refine them into white, odorless crystals, which are combined with a saline solution similar to human secretions, and then put into small glass tubes for injection or pressed into tablets.

Strangely, sarsaparilla is not a "new drug." As early as the tenth century, European doctors had used sarsaparilla to treat syphilis, skin diseases, glandular diseases, and rheumatism. Even today, sarsaparilla syrup is still used as a mixture in oral medications because it can increase the absorption of other drugs by the intestinal walls.

Sarsaparilla grows in tropical regions, and the most abundant production is in Mexico, Central America, and the hotter regions of South America. It is mostly wild and does not require artificial cultivation. Sulmo predicts that after this plant-based testosterone is produced in large quantities in the future, people all over the world can enjoy this cheap and high-quality youth-preserving drug, just like taking vitamins or aspirin now.

### Remnants Still Remain Ruosi

### Police Affairs

In the old residence of the "Morphine King", 1,058 catties of opium were seized in one search. This number is not small. It is said that according to the "market price", it is worth 3.3 to 3.4 billion, which is even more considerable. (See this newspaper on the 14th)

It is said that the "Morphine King" had already fled after the case occurred during the enemy-puppet period, but the opium is still there, which can be called "the remnants still remain."

Moreover, opium has a "market price," which further illustrates that there is fundamentally "poison," and it is not a question of "exhausted" or "not exhausted."

During the enemy-puppet period, opium was publicly sold and publicly smoked without any scruples. Opium naturally had a "market value," but why is there a "market price" now? (I think it may be a reporter's typo.) If there is a "market price," of course it is a veritable "black market."

However, not long ago, the authorities announced a figure, saying that several provinces such as Shaanxi and Sichuan currently "still have" 600,000 opium addicts. The two words "still have" have a strong meaning of "the remnants still remain." If we calculate it, let's count a little less, ten opium addicts smoke one ounce of opium every day, and 600,000 people smoke 60,000 ounces, which is 3,000 catties per day, calculated using a 20-ounce catty, or 900 dan per month. If everyone is an "old gun," even counting 2,000 is not too much.

Then this number is much more poisonous than the "remnants" of the "Morphine King"! Because more than 1,000 catties is not enough to fill a truck, and 2,000 dan is enough to fill a train.

"The remnants still remain"? Or is the poison still rampant? Opium still has a "market price," how should it be explained?

### The Woman Behind the Argentine President (Part 1) Zuo Xi

### A Mysterious Young Woman

When Juan Perón was elected president of Argentina, most North Americans were surprised. In their minds, they believed that after years of losing freedom, Argentina, when it could vote freely, would inevitably overthrow the dictatorship. At least in theory, Argentina was an ally that promoted world fascism. As one of the United Nations, it would certainly not vote in favor of the revival of fascism.

But these assumptions are just a kind of ardent hope. In fact, only Long's election as president was just a technical success. In the minds of the Argentine working-class voters who hold a decisive majority, the name "Perón" naturally evokes the impression of a beautiful and moving young woman. She—Eva Perón—used her beauty and sweet words to win many votes for her husband.

### Power Above the President

Today, the person who is most noticed is not the Argentine president, but his wife. Eva Perón occupies the highest position on the Argentine political stage, and the goal of all her activities is a more thorough revolution than that led by her husband. Eva Perón, the former Latin American opera queen and current Argentine president’s wife, can be called a unique and bizarre figure in the complex political world.

It is difficult to confirm from formal interviews that Eva Perón is the true authority in Argentina. On the phone, she tries her best to pretend to be Baylor's simple wife and good helper, and her words are so evasive. When reporters ask about her political activities, she replies: "Politics? No! No! I have never been interested in politics. I don't understand what politics is at all. I don't understand politics at all! The only work I care about is social welfare and relieving the poor."

But the fact is this: according to the Chicago Sun, Eva Perón's main job is an organized political movement. Every day, she meets many people in her headquarters in the Argentine capital's post office building to discuss government matters. She is currently organizing Argentine women to prepare to grant them the right to vote. According to informed sources, once this right is granted, the current government will obtain a huge number of votes in the 1948 general election.

According to Mrs. Perón herself, she is busy with social services all day long. She said: "I get up at seven o'clock every morning. I visit factories and chat casually with the workers. At lunchtime, I tell General Perón about the workers' problems. The thing I care about most is how to improve the living conditions of the poor."

### Associating with Politicians

But journalists have noticed that among the union representatives and women's group leaders gathered in Mrs. Perón's office waiting room are mixed governors, mayors, opposition politicians, and even cabinet ministers, who are all eager to report to her. They also noted that visiting guests are screened by Ernst, a secretary of German-Argentine descent.

Eva Perón's relationship with the Nazis is closer than her husband's, as can be proven from many aspects. Mrs. Perón does not deny in private conversations that the Frued family are her close comrades. According to investigation reports, the US State Department's Blue Book states that Frued is Argentina's number one Nazi. His son Rudolf accompanied the Perón couple in their election campaign, paying all expenses and guiding Eva on how to win votes. After Perón's victory, the Frued family's power did not diminish. When the United States demanded that the elder Frued be expelled from Argentina, Perón appointed his son Rudolf as his "special secretary." (To be continued tomorrow)

### A Brief Discussion on Spring and Autumn Form and Content Yang Tongfang

Regarding the issue of the form and content of art, modern aestheticians have many original ideas. Gourmont said, "It is impossible to completely separate form from substance." Our research is therefore to establish nouns, but for the convenience of exploration, such as the form and content of art, it is impossible to separate them completely. Our thoughts and emotions change rapidly, and it is absolutely not easy to grasp them, but under certain circumstances, we must also limit them so that they condense into one, become concrete things, and then can be conveyed to people, so we need a form. For example, literary works, form and content must be matched, and then the meaning of the words will be integrated, the subtleties will be conveyed, and the expressive power can reach perfection. Therefore, in order to achieve perfect expression, we cannot but pay attention to form. What people generally call method refers to this. How to frame words and phrases, how to select materials and layout, and how to put effort into diction and tone are almost all things that every successful writer must carefully consider.

Widchester believes that form is the sum total of methods for conveying emotions and thoughts, that is to say, conveying emotions and thoughts must rely on form. However, we must recognize that form is only a means, not an end. By using form to fully express the essence of the content, can a perfect work be completed. From this we can see the close relationship between form and content. Literary critics in ancient and modern China and abroad probably have the same view, that is, to make the form perfect, we must first enrich the content. Winchester wants writers to pay attention to the essence of the content, otherwise, they should not pay attention to the form. Zeng Disheng's "Qiu Que Zhai Diary" says: "When writing poetry and prose, there is a time when emotions are extremely sincere and must be expressed, but it is also necessary to have a rich accumulation of knowledge in ordinary times, without speculation, to be resourceful. The reason for what he said is enough to reach the most sincere and upright emotions in his heart. There is no suffering of chiseling words and carving sentences when writing, and there is no feeling of stagnation after the article is completed. All this is due to the accumulation of knowledge from reading in ordinary days." Wang Chong's theory of literature also emphasizes content, which he calls "the foundation of diction." He has a few words that are very well said: "Diction is the glory of a writer, the skin and shell. The essence is in the heart, and the text is written on bamboo and silk. Inside and outside are naturally consistent, the intention is taken and the pen is released, so the text is seen and the reality is revealed." This metaphor is very appropriate.

From the words of various families, content determines form, and form expresses content. If there is form without substance, then the form is merely an empty formality, like a person with bones but no flesh, still not becoming a person. If there is substance without form, it is like having materials but no structure, still not becoming a building. Therefore, content is the only condition that determines form, but on the other hand, form is also a major factor in making literary works perfect. The same kind of substance, the same kind of material, and the same kind of content can be divided into good and bad works due to the quality of expression skills. The diction of an article is like the refinement of gold and jade, and the pattern of cloth and silk. The decoration is gorgeous and the light is brilliant, which can show the magnificence of the substance and increase the reader's interest in appreciation.

I think everyone has more or less emotions and thoughts, but not everyone has the ability to express them, or everyone is very superior in it. Therefore, to convey what is in your heart truthfully is really not an easy task. It is indeed difficult to make both form and content beautiful, and both coincide without any regrets. Because emotions and thoughts are ethereal, uncertain, and changeable, without a fixed form, and the form and meaning of words are restricted by habits. Therefore, many writers feel the poverty of Chinese language and demand the creation of new and living vocabulary, so that the expression can be more complete and the meaning can be more accurate.

Liu Xie, in "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons," says: "When one picks up the pen, the spirit is twice as strong as the words. But when the article is completed, half the heart begins to fold. Why? Because the intention turns empty and is easy to be strange, and the text is subtle and real and difficult to be ingenious." Writers may not be able to understand with their hands what they can understand in their hearts, so they often feel the pain that the intention does not match the object and the text does not express the meaning. What we have always said about "eyes high, hands low" also contains this meaning. Some people, even if they can't think of it in their hearts, but when they see other people's works, they will be touched and moved. At this time, they have already realized other people's thoughts, but they can criticize and judge other people's works, but they may not be able to write it themselves.

Writers must be able to handle the thoughts they want to express with ease, and the text should be as intended. Whether writing about characters or recording events, or explaining principles, they must be just right. They must study writing skills carefully and have a thorough cultivation in expression methods. Generally speaking, the communication of thoughts is easier than emotions. If literature only publishes pure thoughts, then ordinary language can barely be enough, but when it comes to expressing emotions, it must be done with the help of perfect form. Usually, the rhetorical techniques required for articles that record events and analyze principles are by no means as difficult as those for lyrical poetry. It is also the same for readers. It is more difficult to grasp the true meaning of poetry in order to achieve the true purpose of appreciation than other words.

If we want to create excellent literary works, we must consider the form, but the prerequisite seems to be the essence of the content, because the form is attached to the essence. To be sincere is the creed we should have in writing. Zhang Xuecheng said, "Words are valued for knowledge, not for decoration," which is correct.

Form and content are equally important for composing a literary work. We do not have to argue whether form determines essence or essence determines form. A good work should be the product of form and essence multiplied, and their mutual influence on the quality of the work is obvious. Therefore, unless thoughts, emotions, and language condense together and become a chemical compound, and then written, there can be no perfect work. Mr. Zhu Guangjie said, "Thought is the entity, and language is the projection," which is the best explanation of form and content.

### Poems Talk Fragmentarily Lin Feng

Poetry is our closest companion. We complain to it, beg it for help, question it, shout to it… In the poorest days, it never leaves us, and its most superior quality is that it always gives us endless spiritual comfort, never divides a little of anything with us, even a single unit of heat. On the contrary, sometimes it will increase our body temperature.

### Landscape Zingg [French Modern Painting]

### Suppression Zang Zan

It has been many years since I saw heavy snow. These days I have been wandering in foreign lands, like a vagrant, like a mountain monk with a shaved head knocking on a wooden fish, everywhere is home, everywhere looking for the alms of warmth. But it is always lonely.

Now I have returned home and am looking at the heavy snow that I haven't seen for many years:

The snow is flying like reed catkins, filling the sky, covering the earth layer by layer, the earth is blindingly white, lonely white. When loneliness is full, a group of happy children rush out from all corners, raising a piece of life-filled shouting, and immediately start a snowball fight and build a snowman. The annual joy caused by the cold unfolds on the white snow; the snow is filled with footprints—some human and some dog.

The snow keeps falling, accumulating its cold white light. This white snow penetrates into my chest and accumulates in my heart. I always want to dissolve this cold, but I can't resist this constantly gushing cold; my heart almost loses its normal beating, as pale as snow. This heart beating out of rhythm does not fail to want to jump with the joy of the children, but it always jumps so staggeringly, like a heart patient, my heart has suffered a stubborn wound.

I also had a childhood. I also had enough enthusiasm and innocence to splash and waste at will in the ice and snow. I don't believe in cold, I believe in heat, I believe that more cold can produce more heat. So I resolutely set off with this enthusiasm and confidence. I will travel all over this icy and snowy world, like the prospectors in Alaska, chasing their hopes. My heart is white and shining, like the lights of the miners. I will hold it high above my head, hoping to see the same proof of light. Full of hope, crossing one valley after another, one village after another…

But how desolate the wilderness is! I search for stars through the dark clouds, but what I touch is only silence, a sea-like silence. I can't hear a greeting, I can't shout out an echo.

Finally, I limped back to my hometown raggedly and empty-handed. That heart that had been unattached for ten years, holding that last hope, but the fields of my hometown were barren. My hometown was as strange as another country, or even more hateful… My hope almost turned into despair, and the ideal I held above my head almost died out.

One winter passes and another winter passes. I have gained nothing, but I have only learned to suppress the enthusiasm in my heart—it has been wasted too much.

### Green Leaf Wind

Green is a symbol of life.

Plants absorb sunlight to produce chlorophyll, giving life eternal continuity and development, so the branches are lush, the flowers are in full bloom, and nature sets off a shade of lush greenery.

The feeling that green gives people is kind.

Where there is green, life is jumping and abundant, vigorous and solid.

When we lie in the spring's edge of green, how open our hearts will feel, it will often bring us a lofty buried thought and a noble belief:

Life is endless work and battle!

### Lament for the Orphaned Girl Xi Xi

In Beihai Park, Beijing, there is a place called Lancui Xuan, located at the highest point of the so-called Qiong Island. Following the stone steps upwards, you suddenly see a flat surface, looking down at the imperial city, with layers of yellow tiles reflecting in the green trees. The Jin’ao Yuyong Bridge is like a belt. The passing soldiers and horses are just like groups of ants, but they look clearly countable. Leaning on the railing and looking at the mountains in the northwest, the sunlight shines on them, showing different degrees of light and darkness, each presenting a different appearance. Thinking about it, being in the city and being able to see beyond thirty or forty miles away cannot be said to be a spectacle, and moreover, climbing does not require much effort, and there is also the glory of rattan chairs and clear tea. This time I remember it was just after the snow, the green cypress and pine were covered with white powder, the distant mountains were wearing residual snow, especially setting off the azure sky, the air was so clear, I only heard the sound of foraging sparrows, breaking the silence, I then leisurely cherish the constraints of all things in life, which are never relaxed in the ruthless years. Although winter is a state of stillness, who knows that it is hiding the struggling hearts?

Several female students with accents from other places at the tea seat next door also seemed to be echoing each other, sighing at the scenery. One of them looked at me several times, and suddenly, when I was not paying attention, walked over to my side and very respectfully said to me: "When Mr. Guang Sheng gave a lecture at the ×× training center, do you still remember me, this student?"

I was stunned and could not answer.

She continued to tell me euphemistically: She was a poor woman from a certain city in eastern Beijing. She had finally managed to graduate from university, and she had thought that she could rely on her own ability to find a job to support her old mother. Who knew that the career in her hometown had always been controlled by a group of advanced people from the hometown. The newly emerged people always said that they were not qualified enough. Even if they reluctantly embarrassed people and did not object, they would always set the salary extremely low, making it really impossible for people to continue working. As a result, they said that young people were not qualified and only knew how to take money. She saw through this trick and knew that a weak woman was not worthy of fighting with them. So she swallowed her anger and did a little work. After that, she wanted to take the opportunity of being recommended to this "certain training center" to get a qualification and find a place to stay in a big city.

Speaking of this, I interjected and said: "I remember that the major you studied has a relatively narrow outlet, is it easy to find a job in Beijing?"

She also told me that what she studied had nothing to do with the difficulty of finding a job. Anyway, finding a job requires connections. Where is there really choosing people for the job? My difficulty is not in this, but in the fact that people嫌弃 my accent from other places is too strong, and they feel that I am not one of their group. The ridicule and cold looks I have received are also difficult to describe. I also know that Heaven will not arrange a satisfactory environment for me, so I try my best to tolerate it, and I try my best to be the same as everyone else to avoid being isolated. I accommodate everything and seek immediate peace; but with my meager income, I have to re-dress myself completely to cater to the ears and eyes of the times, and I am afraid that my old mother will have to endure more hunger and cold. The sad expression in her words made it unbearable to look up at her. I had no choice but to try my best to think of a few words of comfort and promised to pay attention to her and find a way to help her, which added another layer of melancholy in this bleak and declining year.

After some time, I was strolling in the market when I suddenly met her walking towards me. She seemed very flustered and said: "Mr. Guang Sheng, can you lend me a place for ten minutes of conversation?" I nodded and walked into a small restaurant with her. After she sat down, the first thing she said was: "I am already a motherless person." I said: "No wonder you are sad, but this pain in life is unavoidable. Is there anything you need me to help you with?" She then sobbed and told me: "Their ancestors were originally a noble family in a certain city. Because of an unfortunate accident in the family, her mother only had three dilapidated houses left, and she and her sisters lived a lonely life for more than twenty years. Unfortunately, her sister died when she was about to become an adult. Since she went to school and even worked, there were really few days with her mother, and her mother hoped that she would become famous and establish a family to support her for the rest of her life for more than twenty years. In her old age, her fantasy became more and more intense, but she was getting further and further away from the facts. Apart from bringing a little delicious food to comfort her old mother during the holidays, she never made her smile happily for a day; throughout the year, her mother looked forward to her daughter's return, and her daughter missed her mother but could not return. The contradiction of human affairs has exhausted the limited flesh and blood. The suffering of life is endless, where to complain in the vast world? She wanted to erect a monument in front of her mother’s grave, venting all her suppressed emotions, or gaining a tear of sympathy from those who had the same experience."

I said: "You might as well write it out yourself, I can revise it for you."

A few days later, she indeed sent a manuscript. The love between the mother and daughter described in it was so sincere and moving, and the situation was so real that I felt I couldn't change a single word, so I wrote it for her. I think there is probably still this mournful tombstone in the public cemetery of a certain city. Whenever the weather is cold and it is about to snow, I always think of her sad tone.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 152 Ye Jingfeng

"Fear of urgently correcting," He Jian heard someone shouting like this, and he also agreed like this. As he agreed, he had already discovered that behind Konoe's low bed, someone was standing, and looking at it in the shadows, it really looked like "half a pagoda."

"[He Jian Wang, according to the head's order, fear of urgently correcting..." He Jian explained his intention according to the way of the society.

"The allies are all outside," the character who "hmph" said, "those who want to fulfill their duties, jump out of this window!" Bushido's words have always been in this kind of tone of eating raw rice.

Isn't there a big screen behind that low bed? There are several large windows behind that screen. He Jian, after being led by him, ran behind the screen; looking at it, the lattice windows were all closed. Opening the Yu lattice, there was another layer of glass lattice outside. As soon as the glass lattice was opened, he immediately heard the clanging sound of knives, mixed with the shouting of fighting.

As soon as He Jian jumped down from the window, he heard a bang, which was the sound of a very small pistol firing. With a chi sound, the bullet passed over his head.

He Jian did not pay attention to this, so he did not have time to lean over to avoid it. He understood in his heart that this was just a "greeting" expression, because the characters that appear on this kind of scene either do not carry a pistol, but if they do carry a gun, they must be a master who never misses a shot. How could they let the bullet pass over someone's head! "Greeting" is also a warning; to let the visitor understand in his heart whether he is an enemy or a friend, and quickly make a clear expression. However, sometimes it is oneself, fearing that the visitor does not know the danger of the scene, and shoots him a shot in advance to let him know.

As soon as He Jian heard the bullet fly over, he immediately shouted "Fear of urgently correcting"! Expressing his

### Lawyers' Association to Organize a Public Legal Aid Society

The local court of this city, in view of the fact that common people often do not understand litigation procedures or are unable to afford legal counsel when they encounter legal disputes, resulting in their inability to obtain legal protection and suffering in silence, which is truly pitiful, has specially requested the city's Lawyers' Association to organize a Public Legal Aid Society in accordance with the provisions of the "General Outline of Implementation Measures for Public Legal Aid by Lawyers' Associations" promulgated by the Judicial Yuan: "Common people may request the Lawyers' Association to handle civil and criminal litigation cases and non-litigation matters, and to answer legal questions," in order to provide legal protection for the common people without charging fees. The detailed implementation measures are currently being drafted by the city's Lawyers' Association.

### Reader Consultation: Medical and Health

(1) Laryngeal Tuberculosis

Liu Yisheng asks: I am 46 years old, male. I suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis and had air injections for half a year. Later, I stopped due to pleurisy and rested at home. Recently, I have been suffering from a sore throat (slight redness and swelling of the larynx, pain when swallowing in the afternoon, and a slightly hoarse voice, with bacterial evidence), and the otolaryngologist said it is laryngeal tuberculosis. I would like to ask: (1) Because I have had pleurisy, the pleura and rib pleura are adhered and cannot be injected with air again. Are there any other ways to treat pulmonary tuberculosis? (2) How should laryngeal tuberculosis be treated? (3) I plan to be hospitalized for treatment. Which hospital has better equipment?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) Nerve resection and rib resection can be performed. Please consult a pulmonary surgery specialist. (2) Consult a specialized otolaryngologist. (3) Ruishijiusi of the Red Cross Society on Haige Road, Gongji Hospital, and various municipal hospitals may offer reduced fees for treatment.

(2) Persistent Asthma

Shen Dimin asks: I am 21 years old and have had a cough since childhood. I developed asthma due to a cold in the autumn of my thirteenth year, and it has recurred intermittently since then. Because I live in a rural town, it is inconvenient to see a doctor, so I have not been treated. Now, eight years later, I have several questions to ask: (1) Is it a lung disease? What are the harms to the body? (2) Are there any special effective medicines, and other nutritional methods? (3) Can this disease be cured?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) What you described is bronchial asthma, not pulmonary tuberculosis. Frequent attacks can affect the circulatory system. (2) Ephedrine and adrenaline are particularly effective, or go to another place for treatment. (3) It is very difficult to cure.

### President Song Convenes Relevant People to Discuss Export Promotion Strategies to Promote Exports and Earn Foreign Exchange

[Our Report] Since the government promulgated the revised Interim Measures for Import and Export Trade on November 19 last year, a comprehensive licensing system has been adopted for imports. A temporary import management committee was established under the Supreme Economic Council to be responsible for handling import licensing matters. In order to cooperate with the above-mentioned import licensing policy, the government has decided to establish an export promotion committee under the Supreme Economic Council to promote export trade. All the details have been reported in this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on January 8. It is now learned that President Song of the Executive Yuan specially convened Bei Zuyi, Liu Gongyun, Qin Fen, Shu Zhen, Lin Fengbao, Yang Xiren, and Central Bank advisors Rogers and Mike at the Executive Yuan office in the Bank of China Building on the Bund at 11:00 AM yesterday. Song first expressed the government's decision to promote export trade, and then sought the opinions of all the people present. The meeting ended at 12:30 PM. It is understood that the focus of yesterday's meeting was to study how to promote the export of general commodities under conditions that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Raw silk, tea, tung oil, hog bristles, and eggs occupy an important position in my country's export commodities. However, the future promotion plan will also encourage other exportable commodities, so as to earn foreign exchange resources for the country and seek to balance my country's international balance of payments. It is heard that the Export Promotion Committee will be chaired by President Song, and Wang Wuwu, Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Zhou Yichun, Bei Zuyi, and Qian Changzhao will serve as members. An executive committee will also be set up under the committee. It is rumored that the chairman will be Bei Zuyi, and other executive committee members include Liu Gongyun and Chen Changtong. Detailed information will be officially announced in the coming days.

### Gold Price Just Stabilized, Then Driven Up by Rumors Again

The price of gold remained stable yesterday. It opened at 3.69 million in the morning, then hovered around 3.7 million. After the high price of 3.71 million, it continued to be pressured down, and soon fell back to 3.68 million before stabilizing. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 207 gold bars at a price of 3.7 million. The supply of gold bars gradually stabilized, but there were not many transactions, and it once rose to 3.72 million, but it was difficult to sustain. At noon, it fell back to around 3.69 million again. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly arose about the issuance of large Central Bank gold notes, and same-day delivery once soared to 3.78 million. The price fell back after the Central Bank supplied 1,000 gold bars. As a result, it closed up 25,000 compared to the previous day. Gold ornaments were listed at 394,000. Silver dollars were stable, and the black market money market was tight, with interest rates remaining at around 15%.

The foreign exchange market remained mediocre yesterday, with even fewer transactions. The black market price of US dollars hovered between 6,500 yuan and 6,600 yuan. In the afternoon, stimulated by the large denomination notes, the gold market rose, and the foreign exchange market rose slightly as a result. As a result, it closed up 150 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars remained unchanged, and there were no gains or losses. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 1,240 yuan, with a slight turnover. The Indian exchange rate was 1,490 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,500 yuan, both with little demand and a market without transactions.

### Securities Firms Absorb, Government Bonds Close Up

The government bond market became gradually uncertain yesterday. Large securities firms suddenly came to favor it, and the market became profitable near the close. After the close, prices were shouted even higher. The Tongbing bond opened at 2,100 yuan in the morning with demand. Rooms 550 and 604 had sales. It fell to around 1,900 yuan. Rooms 552 and 503 made purchases, and it continued to rise to around 2,300 yuan. Before the close, it had fallen back to 2,150 yuan. Afterwards, with large securities firms intending to absorb, it rose again after the close. As a result, A and B bonds closed up 50 yuan, C bonds rose 70 yuan, and Tongding and Tongwu fell 50 yuan. The turnover was approximately 3 million yuan.

### Textile Control Commission Approves Quality Standards for Cotton Yarn

[Our Report] The Textile Control Commission held a routine meeting today. It is heard that the meeting will approve the quality standards and grades for cotton yarns of various counts, so as to provide a basis for inspection and to determine the prices of cotton yarns of various counts. In addition, the selection of the person in charge of the sales agency of the Textile Construction Company will also be approved at today's meeting. After the selection of the person in charge, the sales agency will be deployed and established.

### Sentiment Improves in the Yarn Market

The trend of falling prices in the yarn market has stopped yesterday. The morning opening continued the previous day's weakness, falling by 230,000. Then, with buyers arriving, the price of 10-count yarn gradually rose, and the people's sentiment improved. The trend of falling prices disappeared. As a result, 20-count and 32-count yarns rose by 230,000, while 42-count knitting yarn was relatively sluggish due to fixed prices and fell by 100,000. Textile Construction announced its prices at 11:00 AM. The price of 10-count Lanen Shuiyue was 100,000 lower than the previous period, and the price of 42-count yarn was 4.45 million yuan, which was a huge decrease of 400,000 compared to the previous period. However, the number of applications to purchase was not as enthusiastic as before, because the goods allocated in the previous period had already suffered losses, and with the end of the year approaching, they dared not try easily.
