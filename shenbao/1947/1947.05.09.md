I have no other mission; because my last meeting with Mr. Zhang was as far back as my trip to Guizhou last April. However, the fact that the Central Government has approved my visit is enough to show the government's concern for Zhang.

### Zhang Boling Arrives in Beijing from Ping; Immediately Visits the Office to Transfer to the Capital to Attend the Political Consultative Conference; And Negotiates with the Ministry of Education to Expand Nankai University

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, arrived in Ping from Tianjin this morning and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 10th and then proceed to the capital on the 15th to attend the Political Consultative Conference. According to Zhang, Nankai's rehabilitation work is now fully in place. The enemy's occupation of Tianjin caused the most severe damage to Nankai, but the buildings that could be used have been repaired. The biggest shortage is in books and instruments, but the library of the Institute of Economic Research fortunately escaped damage and has been transported from the south to Tianjin. This year, the Ministry of Education allocated 1 billion yuan for expansion and improvement, but the amount for adding equipment is still small, and more professors are urgently needed, as well as fundraising for construction. The current plan is to use 800 million yuan to build seven large buildings for use as a library and auditorium. The foundation of the engineering college is already in place, with departments in chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. This time, negotiations will be held with the Ministry of Education to formally establish the engineering college. Zhang continued that with soaring prices, public and educational personnel are barely "not starving to death," and the Political Consultative Conference should study this issue in detail. However, the severity of the price increases has not yet reached the point of economic collapse. The country's future is very bright because: (1) there is no international oppression, and (2) there is a wise leader leading the country towards democracy. Zhang spoke about the lives of professors, saying, "We must be patient to find a way out, as the country is paying a great deal in education expenses."

### The Executive Yuan Will Hold a Special Meeting Today; Jiang Yuntian Will Propose Abolishing Foreign Exchange Controls

[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] Jiang Yuntian, a political affairs committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, will suggest to the Executive Yuan on the 9th that it reform China's current economic policies, including abolishing foreign exchange controls, using excessive profits from basic commodity transactions to subscribe to public bonds and treasury bills, and restricting loans from government banks. Jiang declined to predict how the Executive Yuan would consider this plan or what chance it would have of being adopted, saying only that he had discussed the plan with other political affairs committee members, who did not express an opinion but suggested that he submit it to the Executive Yuan in writing. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold a special meeting on the 9th to discuss the current economic crisis. The proposal to abolish foreign exchange controls does not change the current measures regarding the use of foreign exchange. Jiang believes that the current foreign exchange controls are not only useless but also harmful to the government. The drawbacks are that while they may encourage imports, they hinder exports and overseas remittances, both of which cause the government to lose a large amount of foreign exchange. Jiang believes that abolishing foreign exchange controls and having the Central Bank post daily rates based on market conditions will revive export trade and encourage the inflow of overseas remittances. Jiang acknowledged that this move would have the opposite effect on imports but insisted that what China urgently needs is foreign exchange, not foreign goods. Regarding the second point of his proposal, the aim is to absorb idle funds. Jiang said that the past gold policy had failed and that the results of public bond sales were also poor. To encourage subscription to bonds and treasury bills and absorb idle funds, he suggested using excessive profits from basic commodities, such as rice, flour, cooking oil, etc., to subscribe to bonds. Profits refer to what remains after deducting costs, transportation, and taxes. A certain percentage of these profits would be used to purchase bonds. He advocated that 50 percent of the profits be considered excessive profits, but this figure does not necessarily have to be discussed by the Executive Yuan. Regarding the third point, Jiang believes that whether government or private banks should only grant loans to productive enterprises, and their products should only be major commodities to which the excessive profit rule can be applied. The government can thus easily control the production of goods and the use of loans. Jiang believes that the current sharp rise in prices is not just a matter of supply and demand but is caused by idle funds. He also said that during the civil war, even stopping the printing of new banknotes would not control speculation.

Song will fly to the United States in the coming days, but whether he will request an extension of the loan can only be decided after arriving in the capital.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] It is rumored that Song Ziwen will go to the United States as a special representative of Chairman Chiang to negotiate the $500 million loan designated for China by the Export-Import Bank. This news has not yet been confirmed by senior authorities here.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Marshall stated that he believes the recent expansion of the Chinese government is a step towards accepting the conditions for American financial assistance. He cautiously added that the effectiveness of the reorganization remains to be seen. Marshall said at a press conference that he knew most people had suggested forming a coalition government and that Premier Zhang Qun was a friend he greatly admired. He hoped that the reorganized Chinese government would do its best in its constructive work to move towards a truly representative government. Marshall also announced that the State Department has approved several plans for the Export-Import Bank loan, but so far, he has not been successful in handling the necessary credit loans. The following plans have been approved: (1) repairing the Canton-Hankou Railway, (2) developing the Tanggu port facilities; (3) small cotton loans, (4) rebuilding the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Marshall continued that even before he left China, he had hoped to obtain some funds to complete the above construction projects and other similar projects that he considered extremely important for the recovery of the Chinese economy. He emphasized that he had requested to witness China begin its construction plans. When a reporter asked him whether the application period for the $500 million loan designated by the Export-Import Bank would be extended beyond the June 30 deadline, he said that this issue would be decided by the National Foreign Loan Advisory Committee, of which the State Department is also a member.

### The Rice Crisis Affects the Beijing Area; The Social Affairs Bureau Rushes to Transport Flour to Beijing and Ping for Sale

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The rice crisis has spread to the Beijing area. The first rice looting occurred in Pukou Town, a suburb of Beijing, on the 7th. In the afternoon of the 7th, there was another rush to buy flour at the Confucius Temple. On the morning of the 8th, there was another rice looting in Xiaguan, but fortunately, it did not materialize. The Beijing Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Food took emergency measures and worked through the night to handle the situation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has now reported to the Ministry of Food for instructions. However, the rice market in Beijing announced a shutdown on the 8th. Only 120 dan of imported rice entered the market for the entire day, with only one rice boat. According to Social Affairs Bureau Director Xie Zhengfu, Beijing rice merchants do not lack rice in storage, and the negotiated price is 140,000 yuan per dan, with a daily supply of 1,000 dan. However, when rice merchants from Wuhu came to negotiate today, they stated that if the price is still 140,000 yuan, the rice supply will be cut off. Therefore, Xie is requesting instructions from the Ministry of Food. According to general observations, there are three reasons for this rice crisis. First, the negotiated price limit is too low compared to the black market, so merchants are unwilling to sell. At the same time, merchants are hoarding rice and taking a wait-and-see attitude. On the other hand, although the government stipulates that 1,000 dan of negotiated-price rice should be sold, the actual amount sold cannot be counted at any time, so there is inevitably a tendency to underreport. The small amount of negotiated-price rice is not enough to supply the market, leading to a looting spree.

[Another dispatch] After the rush to buy flour in Beijing on the 7th, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau quickly worked overnight to transport 6,000 bags of flour from Sanwenhe on the 8th, which is being distributed to city merchants. The flour problem has been resolved.

Wuxi Establishes a Fair Price Sales Office

[This newspaper, Wuxi, 8th] Regarding the rice looting case, Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong replied to the Chamber of Commerce, Qian Sunqing, saying that he had ordered the county to quickly stabilize the market, work with the garrison to maintain public order, and persuade grain merchants to supply grain from storage so that the people would not lack food and their hearts would be at peace. He also sent telegrams to comfort the industrial and commercial sectors. Representatives of the grain, rice milling, and warehouse industries held a meeting at the county chamber of commerce and decided that the chamber of commerce would report the issue of responsibility for the rice looting to the county government and request relief from the authorities for the looted materials. In addition, the authorities have set up 12 fair price sales offices inside and outside the city, which will be implemented from today.

The Suzhou Rice Market Improves

[This newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] The Suzhou County Government convened an emergency meeting on the morning of the 6th with representatives of relevant agencies and the Grain Association to handle the hoarding of grain and provide relief to the people. It was decided to first distribute 700 shi of high-quality white rice stored in the Zhongnan Factory at a fair price of 180,000 yuan in various parts of the city and countryside. The market situation improved today. The price of brown rice was 210,000 yuan, and the price of high-quality white rice was 240,000 yuan, with a total of more than 700 shi traded. Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director Wang Gongyu visited Suzhou on the evening of the 7th and summoned County Magistrate Shen Chenglong on the 8th. He inquired about the food issue and encouraged him not to follow in the footsteps of Hangzhou and Wuxi.

Nanchang Banned Grain Exports

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Grain prices here have skyrocketed, and the situation is serious. After the ban on rice sales last night, medium-ripe rice reached 123,000, and even brown rice reached 90,000 (per shi), endangering people's livelihoods. The municipal government has decided to take necessary measures to address the grain price issue, stipulating that grain from this city is not allowed to be exported, and rice shops must report their grain reserves within ten days, otherwise they will be sealed. At the same time, group grain purchases will be organized, and funds will be borrowed from banks to make up for any shortfall. In addition, Yixiang Rice Store here was selling brown rice at high prices, and the municipal government has detained its manager for five days as a warning.

[This newspaper, Nanchang, 8th] The situation in Nanchang is still chaotic. Xin Zhou cotton in the cotton market is 890,000, and 20-count battleship yarn is 8,980,000, an increase of one million compared to the previous day. Transactions are scarce, and grain prices are still rising. Indica rice is 120,000, and the price of grain is also rising sharply, at 56,000.

Changchun Opens a Grain Price Meeting

[This newspaper, Changchun, 8th] Prices in Changchun have risen sharply, with rice at 200 yuan per catty and sorghum rising to 100 yuan (Liutong coupons). In January of this year, sorghum only sold for 15 yuan per catty. It has now been just over four months, but it has risen sevenfold, seriously threatening the lives of ordinary people. Xiong Shihui planned to go to Andong, but this has been terminated. Yesterday, he summoned Jilin Chairman Liang Huasheng, Changchun Mayor Zhao Junmai, and Liaobei Chairman Liu Handong to hold an emergency meeting on grain prices.

### The Death of Lin Keyou, Former Overseas Chinese Representative in Batavia, Is Confirmed

Indonesian Soldiers Threw the Body into the Sea

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 7th] According to today's Tiansheng Daily: It has now been confirmed that Lin Keyou, the former Overseas Chinese representative in Batavia, was murdered by soldiers of the Indonesian Republic shortly after he returned from Batavia in early 1946. Lin's movements (he met with Consul General Jiang Jiadong at the time) led the Republic soldiers to suspect that he was cooperating with the Dutch, and Lin was later kidnapped and disappeared. After the Dutch occupied Klender in January of this year, the investigation continued and proved that Lin was strangled to death, then put in a sack with stones, and thrown into the sea, making it impossible to rescue him. Although the Chinese Consulate General made many efforts, it was ultimately unable to save his life.

### Zhang Fakui Meets with Reporters to Report That the Banditry in Guangdong and Guangxi Is Not a Cause for Concern; The Military Police, Public Security, and Civilian Self-Defense Forces Are Very Strong

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] Director Zhang Fakui recently met with reporters in the Xingyuan Conference Hall to report on the general situation of public security and pacification in Guangdong and Guangxi. According to him: the current number of bandits in the jurisdiction is approximately 14,000, distributed as follows: (1) the Han River area of Fujian and Guangdong, approximately 1,000 people, which have been dispersed through searches and suppressions. (2) the Dongjiang and northern Guangdong area, approximately 3,500 people, due to the remnants of the former Zeng Sheng department of the Dongjiang Column returning. (3) the Six Counties area, approximately 500 people, after searches and suppressions of the original 2,000-plus bandits. (4) the Southern Route area, the most rampant area for bandits, with approximately 3,000 people in Fu Chunmao's so-called People's Liberation Army. (5) approximately 5,000 people in Feng Baiju's department on Hainan Island. (6) Approximately 100 people in the so-called Democratic Allied Army, headed by Huang Weiruo, in Rong County, Guangxi, which have been defeated. Scattered bandits in Guiping, Nanning, and the border areas total approximately 1,300 people. Zhang continued: He never sugarcoats the truth, nor does he exaggerate to create alarm. Before March, the jurisdiction was indeed quite stable. Banditry only became rampant after a part of the National Army was transferred north, especially in the Southern Route area. However, they are definitely not Communist troops or just bandits colluding with Communist troops. They are a disorganized mob and not a cause for concern. Currently, Guangdong Province has more than 40,000 security police officers, plus tens of thousands of civilian guns. The strength of our forces is far greater than that of the bandits. The main reasons for the delay in suppressing them are unclear governance and lax military discipline. Therefore, the only solution at present is to clarify governance and rectify military discipline. Then, suppressing the banditry will not be difficult. However, before that is accomplished, the people will suffer greatly from the bandits. He himself feels very uneasy about the banditry.

Editorial

### Facing the Current Education Crisis

Today, with the problems of prices and the economic crisis intensifying, we are also facing serious educational problems. Originally, the educational problems at this stage are inseparably linked to China's general socio-economic and political problems after the war. Problems reflected in education are mostly a political and economic issue. The meager salaries of educators and the financial difficulties of schools are not purely educational issues, but are closely related to China's current socio-economic and even political problems. From a broader perspective, these problems are almost impossible to solve without addressing the overarching political and economic situation. But this does not mean that the educational authorities should be able to evade responsibility for these problems. Since the meager salaries of educators and the financial difficulties of schools fall within the scope of education, the authorities in charge of education should quickly devise appropriate countermeasures. However, the core of the current educational problem is not here: the current educational problem is not just an economic or financial problem, but also includes policy issues and discipline issues. As for whether the system of schools at all levels is suitable for the current national conditions, that is another issue regarding the educational system and curriculum. It can be seen that the scope involved in the so-called educational problem is indeed extensive.

In terms of finance or economics, we have seen appeals from the presidents and professors of various national universities. Some university professors have even issued declarations, arguing that the highest salary for civil servants is 800 yuan, while the highest salary for professors is only 600 yuan, which seems unfair. We sympathize with the appeals of university professors, and we understand the difficult lives of university professors, so we hope that the salaries of university professors can be increased, but at the same time, we cannot help but appeal for the salaries of middle school and primary school teachers. The highest salary for university professors is still 600 yuan, and there is also research funding. May we ask how much a middle school or primary school teacher earns? What is the maximum salary they can receive? What is the difference between the living needs of university professors and those of middle school and primary school teachers? Although the government's finances are currently extremely difficult, we hope that the government can adjust the salaries of teachers at all levels of schools so that they can live their difficult lives and devote themselves to their cause of cultivating people.

However, the core of the current educational problem is not a financial problem, but a policy problem. We do not understand what our education policy is. We will not discuss the problem of the educational system now. What we do not understand is the policy. For example, in Zhejiang, there is already National Zhejiang University (as for whether Zhejiang should have a national university, that is another issue that we will not discuss for now), and there is also National Yingshi University. We know that Chen Yingshi was a founding father of the party-state, and he was from Zhejiang. If we want to establish a national university to commemorate him, it is not without reason; but what we do not understand is why Yingshi University should be located in Jinhua, which has nothing to do with Mr. Yingshi's life? Mr. Yingshi was from Huzhou, and he was also the Military Governor of Shanghai, and he died in Shanghai. If we want to establish Yingshi University, it should be located in Huzhou, or it should be located in Shanghai; we do not understand why it is located in Jinhua. This is a policy problem, unrelated to the country's political and economic situation. Now the students of Yingshi University are causing a stir, requesting the relocation of the school. Their behavior may be somewhat excessive, but what we want to point out is that if the education authorities had made a proper decision, this turmoil would not have been caused. The education authorities cannot shirk this responsibility.

In addition, there is also the problem of the middle school graduation examination in various places. The education authorities have decided to restore the middle school graduation examination this year, giving the reason that it will improve the level of middle schools. Once this news was announced, students in various places expressed unease and requested exemption. When this news was published in the newspapers, it was reported that the Director of Secondary Education of the Ministry of Education stated: "Students in Nanjing and Shanghai no longer oppose the examination," seemingly indicating that the middle school graduation examination will still be held. There may be various reasons for the opposition of middle school students in various places, which we need not elaborate on. What we want to ask is: On what policy is the decision to have a middle school graduation examination based? Theoretically speaking, the adoption of the current middle school graduation examination system is untenable. Whether the level of middle school education meets the prescribed standards can be noted by the educational authorities through the inspectors at any time. If the implementation of the examination system is hoped to improve the level of middle school education, this seems to conflict with the purpose of setting up inspectors and other personnel. If, after the examination, students can voluntarily enter university, then the so-called examination is tantamount to a kind of university entrance examination; however, the nature of the middle school graduation examination under the current system is different from this. After the examination, there will inevitably be a university entrance examination. Then there is a problem with the adoption of this examination system in principle. This system should not have been adopted in the first place, and now it is to be restored. What policy is this? This is tantamount to the education authorities denying themselves. Whether the students oppose it or not is another matter, which we will not discuss.

Because the measures of the education authorities themselves lack consideration, they have aroused turmoil in various places. The overstepping of student behavior is not right; for example, the current turmoil of Yingshi University students petitioning in Nanjing, according to reports, has also affected the railway traffic between Shanghai and Hangzhou. If the rumors are true, we regret this lawless behavior for the reputation of Chinese university students. However, the improper handling by the education authorities is also difficult to blame. In addition, regarding the issue of overseas students and the issue of co-education, what exactly is the policy adopted by the education authorities, and it is also not without doubt that education is for the future life of the nation, and we cannot let it be eroded, and we cannot let bureaucracy run rampant in the sacred cause of education. We hope that the education authorities can make wise decisions on educational decisions.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall announced to the press today that the U.S. government would soon submit a plan to Congress to revive Korea. Other sources say that this move may specify an initial budget of $75 million. Marshall added that details of the plan are not yet fully finalized. Once Congress has made a final vote on the aid bill for Greece and Turkey, this case can be submitted for discussion. According to current plans, $75 million must be spent in the U.S.-occupied zone of Korea within one year, starting on June 30th of this year, to supplement the more than $135 million in regular occupation costs. This funding will be mainly used to restore industries lost during the war. Korea's industrial production capacity is currently only 20%. The US-Soviet Joint Commission is scheduled to resume negotiations on the unification of Korea on the 20th of this month. If an agreement can be reached at that time, the funding for rebuilding power plants and railways may be revised. Whether this aid plan will extend beyond one year depends on the economic self-reliance of the 10 million residents of southern Korea. In addition, a three-year plan to revive Korea, costing $500 million to $600 million, is being drafted.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall also made the following statement at a press conference today: (1) When and how to proceed with preparations for the peace conference with Japan are now under careful consideration. I believe that the State Department should take over the administrative affairs of Japan, Korea, and the German occupied territories from the War Department. Whether the transfer will be handled immediately is not to be stated at present. Former Secretary of State Byrnes opposed this proposal. (2) The House Appropriations Committee's recommendation to reduce funding by 22% is a current problem for the State Department. The committee's recommendation to cancel funding for overseas broadcasting is extremely important. (3) The United States is not currently considering providing special assistance to France after the Ramadier cabinet expelled the communist cabinet members. Marshall met with the French ambassador to the United States today to discuss coal, wheat, international bank loans, and labor exchange issues between the French army in Germany and the US and British military occupation zones.

### Soviets Make Additional Demands on Hungary

[Reuters, London, 7th] Reliable sources here say that the Soviet Union and Hungary are currently conducting compensation negotiations. The Soviets have made additional demands on Hungary totaling $200 million. According to the armistice agreement and the peace treaty, Hungary should pay the Soviet Union $200 million in reparations. The armistice agreement stipulates that Hungary should pay it off within six years, while the peace treaty extends the period to eight years. Therefore, the Soviet Union's new demands are equal to the amount of compensation that Hungary should pay to the Soviet Union. The content of these new demands can be divided into three categories: (1) The Soviet Union demands that Hungary cede all German assets within Hungary. According to Article 28 of the peace treaty with Hungary and the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union has the right to obtain this property, the value of which is about half of the total demand; (2) The Soviet Union demands that Hungary pay the Soviet Union all the debts that Hungary owed to Germany at the end of the war; (3) The Soviet Union demands that Hungary fulfill the debts owed to the Soviet Union for the following reasons: (A) the Hungarian currency advanced by the Soviet Union to the Hungarian provisional government at the end of the war; (B) the expenses of equipping the Hungarian army by the Soviet Union. It is reported that the main point of contention in the current Soviet-Hungarian negotiations is the aforementioned second item. Hungary believes that although Hungary owed debts to Germany at the end of the war, Germany also owed debts to Hungary, so they should be offset first. Although the British government does not intend to intervene at this stage, it is known that the British government's position is that the debts owed by Germany to that country should be taken into account when calculating the debts owed to Germany.

### U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill: House of Representatives Engaged in Heated Debate; Final Vote Expected Today

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Today is the day for the House of Representatives to make a final decision on the $400 million aid bill to Greece and Turkey. After debating this anti-communist measure for nine days, the House of Representatives began today to engage in fierce debate on amendments to restrict the bill or amendments to cancel the bill. Most of the members who are strongly opposed to the bill are pinning their hopes on an amendment to entrust the Greek and Turkish problem to the United Nations for handling. This amendment would stipulate that if the United Nations fails to take action within 60 days, the aid plan will be transferred to the House Armed Services Committee for handling. Democratic and Republican members who support the bill admit that they are most concerned about this amendment. They say that its impact will doom the measures that Marshall considers urgent. Representative Bender, a strong opponent of the bill, is prepared to propose six amendments, one of which is to remove Turkey from the aid plan, and another is that Greece must abolish the monarchy and hold general elections to elect a new ruling body. A total of more than ten amendments are aimed at the bill. Although the leaders of the House of Representatives are eager to have the bill put to a final vote tonight, there is little hope of reaching this stage, and it will have to wait until tomorrow to be decided. The supporters say that this bill will eliminate another war, while the opponents say that this bill will be the beginning of another war.

MacArthur continued: "Before the peace treaty with Japan is signed, Japan's security is the responsibility of the United Nations and is entrusted to the occupying forces for implementation. After the peace treaty is signed, Japan's security depends on the terms of the peace treaty. Due to Japan's strategic position in terms of agency and its relationship with Pacific defense, the United States may pay special attention to this issue."

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] Although MacArthur denied guaranteeing the Emperor of Japan that he would defend Japan, the rumors are not without foundation, which was inadvertently revealed by Okamura, the director of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Information Bureau.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] Following the National Committee of the Socialist Party's resolution to support the continued leadership of the Ramadier Cabinet, a communiqué was issued stating that the Party deeply regrets the Communist Party's refusal to support the government's policy of curbing inflation. However, the Socialist Party believes that some people want to use anti-communism as a smokescreen in an attempt to organize a united cabinet, which would incite hostility between these two left-wing parties and split the national workforce into two factions, so it cannot approve of this. We also wish to solemnly declare that if the government is based on a reactionary majority, the Socialist Party will not be able to continue to participate in the government for long. In the future, the Ramadier Cabinet should maintain close contact with trade unions. Therefore, the Communist Party's withdrawal from the cabinet does not mean that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party are parting ways.

### Rice Merchants Throughout the City Suspend Business to Petition: Gather a Crowd to Make Trouble and Destroy Radio Station; Paint Shops, Theaters, Tobacco Shops, and Many Other Places Also Affected

[Our Paper's Report] Rice prices in the city have been rising for days, causing public anxiety. Mayor Wu, in order to encourage rice merchants to transport rice to Shanghai, has already permitted free trading, but the supply has not yet surged, and prices have not fallen. The common people are even more panicked, and unfortunate incidents such as attacking shops and robbing rice have also occurred. Rice merchants in the city believe that the high price of rice is not their fault, and now they have been subjected to violent robbery, which has caused them great unease. Therefore, they announced yesterday that they would voluntarily suspend business. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, more than 300 retail rice merchants went to the city government to petition. They elected seven representatives, including Zhang Yimao, Gu Yarong, and Shen Zai, to meet with Mayor Wu and present two points: (1) Please earnestly dispatch police to protect against recent incidents of robbing rice and attacking shops. (2) Please find a way to stop the insults in the broadcasts of various radio stations. Mayor Wu replied, stating in brief: Regarding the first point, if any lawless citizens take the opportunity to disrupt rice shops, they will be arrested and sent to court for strict punishment, and the police bureau has been ordered to comply and the garrison commander has been asked to send personnel to assist in maintaining order. As for radio stations that deliberately spread rumors and slander, they can be sued in court. Wu continued, hoping that the rice merchants would sell their stored rice at a legitimate profit. He also said that the government's improved plan for allocating and selling rice has been submitted to the central government for approval.

Making Trouble En Route, Two Shops Suffer

After the petitioning rice merchants left the city government at about 12:00 noon, they then went to the Huaxing Radio Station at 19 Qingdao Road to make trouble. The reason was that a comedian named Zhu Liang, known professionally as Xiao Kuaile, who performs on the radio station, has been scolding unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate on rice prices as "rice weevils" due to the soaring rice prices and the difficulty in purchasing rice. This angered some rice merchants, who had previously warned him by telephone that if he did not change his attitude, there would be unfavorable consequences. Xiao did not pay attention to it. After the petitioning rice merchants left the city government and went to the Huaxing Radio Station, they intended to find Xiao to question him. On the way, when they passed the Fuxing Chang Paint Shop at 458 Jiujiang Road, they suddenly heard someone shout, "The rice weevils are coming!" They were furious and immediately started a fight, destroying nine-tenths of the Fuxing Chang Paint Shop. Various colors of paint were scattered all over the ground, and the thugs left satisfied. Then, upon hearing the sound of "rice weevils" on Guling Road, they smashed a large piece of glass in the Dazhongyuan Tobacco Shop at 124 Guling Road, and also destroyed a door of the clinic of Dr. Shi Zhifen at 6 Lane 51.

Huaxing Radio Station Suddenly Destroyed

At 1:20 p.m., the rice merchants and others arrived at Qingdao Road and broke into the "Huaxing" Radio Station. Xiao Kuaile's broadcast time on the radio station was from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day, so he had not arrived at that time. The rice merchants started smashing from the repair department downstairs of the radio station, and smashed up to the broadcasting room on the third floor. All the machines were destroyed. The rice merchants could not find Xiao Kuaile and thought he had escaped to the Mingxing Theater across from "Huaxing," so they went to the theater to cause trouble and destroyed the iron gate. At this point, the Xincheng Police Sub-Bureau and the Fengyang Road Military Police Team had already received the news and dispatched police and military police to suppress the situation. The disturbance subsided at about 3:00 p.m.

Six Thugs Arrested on the Spot

It is reported that the entire case will be submitted to the General Bureau and then transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The Fuxing Chang Paint Shop and Huaxing Radio Station, which were destroyed, have reported the damage to the police bureau and are said to be suing the court for compensation. The names of the six rice merchant thugs arrested at the time are listed below: (1) He Youxing, 42 years old, from Shaoxing, resident of 77 Shanyin Road, owner of Fuhe Rice Shop.

Xiao Kuaile's Family: Wife and Daughter Beaten

At about 5:30 p.m., the rice merchants were still not satisfied because they had not caught Xiao Kuaile. Later, they learned that his residence was on the upper floor of the Guanghua Laundry Shop at 239 Yunnan Road, so they hired two trucks with about 50 or 60 people and drove to the vicinity of the above location. After stopping the car, seven or eight people jumped down first and went to the third floor. They searched for Xiao Kuaile but he was not there, so they slapped his wife, Zhu Chuanmeiyun (28 years old, from Nanjing), and then slapped Xiao's young daughter, Xia Yun (7 years old), in the face. Then they used wooden sticks to destroy dressing tables, mirror frames, hot water bottles, glass clothes trees, air pumps, bowls, and other items, and scattered in a commotion. Later, the Lao Zha Police Bureau received a report and Director Jiang immediately led a large number of police officers to rush to the scene, but the rice merchants had already left. They summoned Chuanmeiyun to the bureau to inquire about the damage and District Chief Shi ordered two police officers to escort her back to her residence.

(3) The rice shops that were destroyed should be compensated for all losses by the authorities. Mayor Wu replied as follows: (1) The arrest of Gong Wenqi is a legal issue and does not fall within the scope of the city government. It should be resolved through legal channels. (2) The destruction of the Huaxing Radio Station is a judicial issue. Those who violate the criminal law will be strictly punished according to the law, and the city government cannot help. (3) It is impossible to ask the city government to compensate for the losses, but the government will definitely severely punish the perpetrators. Qu Zhenhua said that he was willing to be responsible for conveying the mayor's opinion to his colleagues, but he could not guarantee that the rice shops could all resume business today.

Briefed Reporters on Three Points

Mayor Wu also hosted reporters in the city government conference room at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, reporting the following measures for handling the food problem and preventing accidents: (1) Mayor Wu was very angry about the prevalence of disturbances. He said: The common people certainly feel that their food supply is insufficient, but since the rationing system has been implemented, there should be no more acts of disturbance. Moreover, attacking rice shops will not make rice prices fall. On the contrary, if rice merchants close their doors and stop selling as a result, the majority of citizens will be affected. In order to prevent such illegal actions, the mayor has telegraphed the garrison commander and ordered the police bureau to protect the rice shops. Those citizens who overstep the line will be severely punished. (2) The method of allocating rice has been improved. In addition to civil servants and teachers who have allocated rice, students and workers will also implement direct allocation of rice. In addition, for the problem of civilian rice, some rice shops will be designated as public rice shops for civilians. (3) Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian went to Beijing last night to discuss with the Ministry of Food to improve the method of allocating and selling food rice. In principle, it was decided to completely directly allocate to various agencies, without going through the hands of rice merchants.

### More Than 10,000 Silk Weaving Workers Stop Work to Petition and Parade; Demand Unconditional Unfreezing of the Cost of Living Index; Mayor Wu Persuades to Wait for a Reasonable Solution

[Our Paper's Report] More than 10,000 silk weaving workers throughout the city, in order to demand the immediate and unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index, specially stopped work for half a day yesterday afternoon and marched in a team to the city government and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Along the way, they shouted slogans, distributed declarations, and posted slogans. These more than 10,000 people belonged to more than 400 units affiliated with the First, Second, Third, and Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Unions, including workers from state-owned Zhongcan, privately-owned Meiya, and Dacheng factories. After gathering at the Bund at 2:30 p.m., they went to the city government. Four representatives were sent to meet with Mayor Wu, demanding the immediate and unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index and curbing prices. Mayor Wu agreed to forward it to the central government, but said: The central government has agreed in principle to unfreeze the index, and is currently studying the details. There is no need to petition again. He hoped that there would be no more large-scale parades in the future. If there are any problems, representatives can be sent to discuss them. He also said that the current industrial and commercial sectors are in an unstable and depressed state, and everyone should think about the overall situation and not make their own plans. Moreover, this unfreezing is planned by the central government, and I hope you will wait for a reasonable solution. The petitioning crowd then turned to the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu happened to be away on official business, and the representatives left a petition and then left. The workers from each district then returned to their respective factories.

### Fuxing Ship Runs Aground in the Sea Near Xiamen

### Exploring the Reasons for the Rise in Kerosene Prices

[Our Paper's Report] The Fuel Group of the Price Review Council held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon and decided that manufacturers should first calculate the cost of coal, coal balls, firewood, and kerosene and submit tables for verification. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged on the reasons for the recent soaring kerosene prices. It was believed that it was due to the expiration of the Import Management Committee and the failure to open foreign exchange. Due to the failure to settle foreign exchange, the incoming goods were sealed by the customs, and the company had not allocated them for two months, resulting in soaring market prices. It was decided that the Social Affairs Bureau would send a letter to the Import Management Committee requesting the release of foreign exchange on schedule.

### Female Spy Brings Child to Court; Confession is Very Absurd; Han Youjie's Trial Concluded Yesterday

[Our Paper's Report] Han Youjie, female, was originally Japanese, but later obtained Chinese nationality after marrying Han Jingtang. She was accused of serving as an enemy spy. The trial was held in the High Court yesterday. The defendant was short and fat, wearing a blue silk cheongsam, a yellow velvet jacket, glasses, and a bun. Her face was slightly swollen, and she wore light makeup, holding a one or two-year-old baby in her arms, who was babbling. Han was accused of serving as a "trustee" in the staff headquarters of Chief Benjo Shigeru after the "September 18th" Incident, and as the dean of the Fengtian Shanlin Women's Middle School, etc.

Enslaving Our Soldiers and Civilians

After the "July 7th" Incident, she served as a "trustee" in the Pingdi Gendarmerie and the Army Special Service Agency, responsible for contacting the puppet local maintenance committees, and also served as the head of the women's comfort team under the Beizhina Area Army Temple, using the name of comforting refugees and prisoners to secretly carry out the enslavement of our soldiers and civilians. Later, she served in the "comfort" work of Yamashita Tomoyuki's department, was promoted to major general and served as a military advisor, and "recruited" many bandits and guerrillas for the enemy. Then, she was dispatched to "North Manchuria" to investigate the Soviet army. Later, at the invitation of Ono, the commander of the Nanjing Enemy Gendarmerie, and Shao Wen'kai, the governor of the puppet Henan Province, she went to Henan and Shandong provinces to lure our guerrillas, and more than 70,000 of them were incorporated by her. In addition, the defendant went to "Manchukuo" in "Showa 15" to visit the puppet emperor "Puyi" and had dealings with Matsuoka Yosuke and Zhang Jinghui. She was captured by the relevant authorities after the victory.

Arguing Endlessly

After repeated questioning by Judge Xiao yesterday, the defendant still argued endlessly. Her confession was extremely absurd. She even said that she was "the nanny of the Chinese people." During the war, she repeatedly provided relief to Chinese troops and refugees, and said: "Now that my father is back, is the nanny no longer needed?" The defendant's Mandarin was quite fluent, and she pleaded tearfully, but her nerves seemed to be stimulated, so her words were incoherent. The court did not pay attention because the defendant had written a book called "A 20-Year Active Career in China" as evidence. The court announced that the trial of the case was concluded and the verdict would be pronounced on the morning of the 15th. The defendant held the baby in her arms with tears in her eyes and was returned to the women's prison.

[Our Report] The late Liu Shangqing, former Vice President of the Control Yuan, sought medical treatment in the United States on February 15th of last year due to esophageal cancer and unfortunately passed away on February 26th of this year in the United States.

Yu Youren, Mo Dehui, Yan Zhuang, Cheng Cangbo, Ding Guitang, Chen Guoguang, and Zhang Bide, the representative of Mayor Wu, along with over 300 relatives and friends of Mr. Liu, all went to the wharf to greet the coffin. After the ship arrived, Madam Liu was first assisted ashore by her eldest daughter-in-law, crying uncontrollably and covering her face with a handkerchief. People rushed forward to comfort her. When reporters approached to inquire about Mr. Liu's medical treatment in the United States, Madam Liu was unable to answer due to her sobbing. At 11:00, the coffin was unloaded from the ship by crane, amidst the sound of firecrackers and mournful music. The coffin was made of yellow teak and was covered with the national flag upon landing. Mr. Yu Youren then led the greeters in a simple memorial ceremony, with Madam Liu, her son Zhiyuan, and grandson Huacheng kneeling to express their gratitude. The coffin was then moved to the China Funeral Home for temporary storage. At 5:00 PM, Mr. Yu held a grand memorial ceremony, with people from all walks of life coming to pay their respects in an endless stream. It is reported that Mr. Liu's coffin will be temporarily stored in Shanghai and will be transported back to his hometown in the Northeast for burial after the situation stabilizes.

### Ministry of Education Specifies Review Standards for Applying to Study Abroad with Foreign Scholarships

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 8th] Regarding publicly and privately funded students studying abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once suspended the issuance of passports after the announcement of the emergency economic measures plan, and the Ministry of Education immediately suspended review. It is now heard that students who have obtained foreign scholarships and do not need to apply for foreign exchange are still allowed to be issued passports.

A reporter specifically inquired with the person in charge of the Ministry of Education about the review standards for applications to study abroad for those who have obtained foreign scholarships. It is said that there are four standards: (1) The scholarship obtained includes tuition and room and board fees.

(3) Invited to serve as an intern physician abroad, with all expenses provided by the hiring party. (4) Invited to teach or lecture abroad, with a salary of at least 150 US dollars per month.

### The Restoration and Improvement of the Joint Exam

— Chen Dongyuan

The high school graduation joint exam has been implemented in China for over a decade. Even during the War of Resistance, we held it as usual except in the real war zones. In the summer of 1945, due to repatriation, the Ministry of Education ordered all schools in the rear to close early at the end of May to prepare for repatriation, and the graduation joint exam was also temporarily suspended. This year, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to restore the joint exam, which is a natural thing. However, students always feel that one less thing is better than one more thing, so there are expressions of requesting a temporary postponement of the restoration, and the public opinion circles have also responded to it. There are even those who say that "since the students are calling for the cessation of the exam, the education authorities should adopt public opinion and change the method." Whether the joint exam should be restored can be studied. If there is a reason to restore the joint exam, it should be restored. If it is to be answered simply because the students have a request, this is not in line with the principles of education.

The high school graduation joint exam is a kind of system in education. In developed countries in education, such as England, France, and Germany, high school graduates must go through a joint exam presided over by people outside the school, and they must go through two joint exams. The first exam is one or two years before high school graduation, and the second exam is at the time of high school graduation. Those who pass the exam can also freely continue their studies, becoming a kind of system. China has held graduation joint exams for more than ten years and has also formed a kind of system. Although the current situation is not good and various aspects of society are not stable, we always hope that various aspects can return to normal as soon as possible. The restoration of the system is a kind of force to help restore the normal state, which is not allowed to be opposed, and it does not seem that it should be opposed.

Some people think that the purpose of the joint exam is to improve the level of students, and they feel that the level of middle school students cultivated during the war is undeniably low. Why use the joint exam to improve it in a short period of time? Most people who oppose the joint exam use this as a strong reason, saying that this is "forcing growth." This kind of argument misreads the premise. The purpose of the joint exam is not to improve the level, but to regulate the level. The current problem of middle schools is not that the level needs to be improved, but that the level is not uniform enough. If it is necessary to improve the level, attention should be paid when revising the curriculum standards. However, the current problem of middle schools is definitely not here. On the contrary, when revising the curriculum standards, everyone agreed to simplify it and not to increase the burden on students. This shows that we do not hope to improve the level of middle schools. However, we always hope that the already stipulated curriculum standards can be achieved. And, to determine whether the school's teaching is conscientious and whether the students' level can meet the established standards, there must be a system to check and supervise. With this system, the school cannot help but be conscientious about teaching, and lazy students cannot help but work hard, and the entire middle school education can reach a minimum level. This is the purpose of the joint exam. Although the level of students during the war was low, it is still necessary to investigate what it was low to. Because it is low, there is no need for a joint exam. Isn't it like opposing a physical examination because the body is not good?

Fearing difficulty and seeking temporary ease is human nature, and selfishness is also a common problem of human beings. After the joint exam has been suspended for two years, the students graduating this year will inevitably have the hope of another year of suspension. However, this is precisely the cowardly and selfish psychology, which is not allowed in education. If the school authorities are afraid that the joint exam results of their own school's graduates will not be good, which will affect the school's status, thereby encouraging students to oppose the joint exam, or using the joint exam opportunity to eliminate students in advance to show off, this all loses the attitude that educators should have. It must be known that students have the opportunity to participate in exams at any time after leaving school, and they must be prepared to be tested by others at any time. Educators should urge students to review their lessons before graduating. Excellent teachers should guide students to make a systematic overview of the review of their lessons, learn a kind of order, understand the essence of the subject, and avoid mechanical memorization. Such review is very beneficial to young people. So we should make good use of the joint exam and not reject it.

We also don't need to think of the joint exam as too difficult. According to the experience of the past ten years, although it cannot be said that 100% can pass the joint exam held in various provinces and cities, in fact, the students who pass are always above 90%. At the time of the initial restoration of the joint exam, the intention of the education authorities was nothing more than to maintain this system and not to embarrass students. It will definitely not be more difficult than the joint exam before the war. Furthermore, for the students, if they finally fall into the minority of those who fail to pass after exerting their own strength, then it must be that their own grades do have problems. Rather than graduating reluctantly and deceiving others and deceiving oneself, it is better to settle down and study in high school for another year and lay a solid foundation, which is only beneficial and not harmful to the individual's future.

There is only one problem that everyone is dissatisfied with the Chinese joint exam system. That is, the joint exam can only obtain graduation qualifications and cannot replace the entrance exam for universities. As a result, students have to participate in several exams in the summer of graduation, which is not only too hard for the students, but also not very consistent with reason. Therefore, some people advocate that the joint exam should be held jointly with the university entrance exam. This makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, there are still many obstacles in fact that cannot be done immediately. Fortunately, this year's joint exam has paid attention to this issue. The notice of the Ministry of Education has stipulated that the students with the best results in the joint exam can be recommended to study at the universities they want to. This is already a step forward. And the universities in Shanghai have recently planned to admit a part of the students directly based on the joint exam results in addition to the recommended places stipulated by the Ministry of Education. This is the best thing to do. It is hoped that universities in other places can have this kind of practice, so that they can gradually achieve the goal of being able to continue their studies with the pass of the joint exam in the future, so as to complete a perfect system.

### Items for Participation in Next Year's World Games to be Determined Based on This Year's National Games Results

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Eighth Dispatch] The 14th World Games will be held in England next year. The selection committee for the Chinese delegation has decided to select four items: "Football," "Basketball," "Track and Field," and "Swimming." A decision on participation in "Race Walking," "Cycling," and "Baseball" has not yet been made. According to the Secretary-General of the Sports Association, Dong Shouyi: The number of representatives and competitive performance items at the last World Games was larger. For example, the participation of martial arts personnel was specially funded by Mr. Shang Jing Shang Zhen to go abroad. The remaining expenses were all raised by the association. Currently, due to the initial post-war recovery, association funds are difficult and still being raised. In addition, due to foreign exchange relations and factual issues, the number of items to be participated in this time must be smaller. It depends on the results of this year's National Games. If there are any special discoveries and they are recognized by the selection committee, other items besides the four decided items can also be added depending on the availability of funds.

### The Decline of Chinese Stocks Continues: Although There Was a Rebound in the Morning, It Was Ultimately Suppressed; Panic Spread, and Rui Di, Yong Sha Both Reached Limit Down

Chinese stocks experienced another disastrous sell-off yesterday before the close. There was a brief glimmer of hope in the morning. Yong Sha, with a substantial interest rate of around four corners, eventually proved unsustainable after reaching a high point. Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone and Telegraph rose, and news of loans spread, leading to a collapse in the afternoon. Yong Sha fell more than one hundred yuan below the limit. With the exception of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, which reached limit up, eight or nine out of ten stocks hit limit down.

In arbitrage trading, Yong Sha swap rates started at 330 yuan, with the buy-side eagerly posting offers. The banks' supply of chips was limited, and prices were driven up all the way, reaching high prices of 550 yuan and 580 yuan near noon. Xin He ranged between 200 yuan and 250 yuan. Small stocks ranged from 8 yuan to 15 yuan. The combined daily interest rate ranged from about 2 corners to 3 corners and 5 points. With a little calculation, one could earn about 4 corners. In the afternoon, Yong Sha's price dropped from the 180s to the 152s, then to 370 yuan, with a combined interest rate of just over 2 and a half corners.

At the morning opening, Mei Ya was still at limit down, while other stocks appeared relatively stable. Rui Di and Yong Sha entered the market, with both buy and sell sides engaging in swap transactions, forming a consolidation. Prices hovered between 6520 yuan and 6650 yuan, then declined slightly due to supply from numbers 35, 218, and 152. Numbers 75, 237, 76, 102, 223, 97, 232, and 129 all entered the market, and Rui Di and Yong Sha rose again to 6780 yuan. Numbers 152, 153, and 155 took profits at the high, and prices retreated to 6640 yuan. Numbers 145, 207, 142, 35, 16, 224, 154, 22, and 82 entered the market, and buying momentum became intense. Mei Ya rebounded from limit down, and Wu He and Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank reached limit up. Rumors spread that the exchange rate would be changed to 40,000 yuan, and Rui Di and Yong Sha reached a high price of 6900 yuan. Numbers 94, 83, 8, 4, 65, 102, 112, and 97 sold off, and floor traders and young speculators suppressed the price. Near noon, China Silk and Cement fell to the limit, and Rui Di and Yong Sha retreated to the morning's initial low price. However, outside investors and banks absorbed the supply, and numbers 70, 142, 231, and 65 took advantage of the low price to absorb the supply. The noon close was still stable. After the close, spot Yong Sha was bid up to 6100 yuan, and Rui Di and Yong Sha reached 6680 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha, Xin He, Qin Xing, Jing Fu, and Xin Hua each fell by slightly more than 5%, Xin Guang rose slightly, Mei Ya hit limit down, and Yong Gong fell by slightly less than 10%. In deferred delivery trading, there was only half a day of trading the previous day, with Mei Ya at limit down, and Yong Sha, Xin He, Xin Guang, Shui Gong, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing each up by about 10%. Cold stocks Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank and Wu He reached limit up. Cement briefly rebounded after hitting limit down, and the decline was reduced to slightly less than 5%. China Textile, Tong Yi, and Jing Lun each fell by between 10% and slightly less than 15%, China Silk hit limit down, Matches was flat, and the rest declined slightly to varying degrees of up to 5%.

In the afternoon, Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone and Telegraph was seen to rise, and sentiment was poor. Stocks opened lower and immediately proved unsustainable. Mei Ya and China Silk were the first to hit limit down, while Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank rose to limit up due to buying from number 31. Rui Di and Yong Sha were sold off together by numbers 145, 223, 133, 224, 183, 65, 117, 36, and 231. Evening news reported news of loans, and prices fell further to 6080 yuan. Numbers 152, 129, and 30 took advantage of the low price to enter the market, and prices rebounded to 6250 yuan. Later, Da Tong, Matches, Yong Gong, China Textile, Cement, and spot Yong Sha all hit limit down. Panic had already set in, and numbers 117, 153, 160, 16, 237, 68, and 223 shorted again. Rui Di and Yong Sha fell to 5800 yuan. Numbers 231, 183, 152, 231, and 76 took advantage of the low price to absorb the supply again, and prices rebounded to 5930 yuan. Xin Ya also hit limit down, and numbers 223, 94, 232, and 16 cut their losses. At the close, Rui Di and Yong Sha also hit limit down. After the close, prices continued to fall to 5650 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha, Xin He, Mei Ya, and Yong Gong hit limit down. Qin Xing briefly rebounded after hitting limit down, and Xin Guang and Jing Fu each fell by slightly more than 10%, and Xin Hua fell by slightly less than 5%. In deferred delivery trading, Yong Sha, Mei Ya, and Yong Gong hit limit down, Xin He fell by slightly more than 5%, and Xin Guang, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing fell slightly. Cold stock Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank rose to limit up alone, and Wu He rose to limit up and then declined slightly. Jing Lun fell by 10%, and the rest of the stocks all hit limit down.

### National Bonds Rise

National bonds rose yesterday as the date for the decision on the repayment of pre-war deposits at a multiple was approaching, which improved sentiment slightly. Unified Class C bonds opened at 16,700 yuan, and rooms 119, 408, and 555 absorbed the supply, and prices rose to 18,300 yuan. Rooms 550, 251, and 360 took profits at the high, and prices eventually hovered around 17,500 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds rose by 1,000 yuan, Unified Class C bonds rose by 1,800 yuan, Class D bonds rose by 2,100 yuan, and Class E bonds also rose by 1,600 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 7 to 8 million.

### City Councilors Pay Attention to Stock Exchange Dynamics

City councilors such as Chen Gongda proposed to the City Council yesterday to abolish the Stock Exchange in order to stabilize public sentiment. Dozens of people co-signed the proposal. It is said that some councilors believe that abolishing the exchange may not be necessary, but deferred delivery must be stopped because buying and selling short is too speculative and is not suitable for the current environment.

### Textile Control Committee to Hold Regular Meeting Today to Discuss Cotton Yarn Purchase Price

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Control Committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting at the Municipal Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM. The main agenda item is still to discuss the new price for cotton yarn. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the central authorities for approval before implementation.

The purchase price and free trade price for cotton yarn in April have not yet been agreed upon by the price negotiation group of the Shanghai Six District Cotton Textile Association, so the central authorities have temporarily decided that the price of 20-count standard yarn is 4.6 million yuan per piece. After this price was announced, various factories believed that it was still far from sufficient based on the current cotton prices. In order to maintain the prospects of the factories' reproduction, some advocated negotiating the price based on the reproduction cost. Therefore, although the price negotiation group has not officially convened meetings in recent days, it is reported that the private yarn factories have reached a new price negotiation plan after several consultations. Based on the 20-count standard yarn, each piece of yarn requires three and a half dan of raw cotton, with a cost of 1.6 million yuan per dan, and a processing fee of 1.8 million yuan per piece, plus a 20% legal profit. Therefore, the cost of each 20-count standard yarn is more than 7.5 million yuan. It is reported that the production cost of 20-count yarn at the China Textile Construction Corporation is about 1 million yuan per unit of raw cotton, based on the company's current cotton usage, one-third of which is foreign cotton and two-thirds is domestic cotton. The processing fee is 1.2 million yuan per piece, plus a 20% legal profit, and the cost of each 20-count yarn is more than 5.6 million yuan. Therefore, the cost price is closely related to the price of raw cotton used and the processing fee standard. Related parties predict that the new price will inevitably find a suitable and reasonable standard in these two cost prices.

### Yarn Market Turns Upward, Fabric Sales Remain Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded and rose, mainly because the China Textile Construction Corporation opened yarn, and the number of allocations was not large, and only once a week. With the slight easing of credit, buyers resumed their activities, leading to higher prices. The final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 12.8 million yuan, up 600,000 yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse was 7.1 million yuan, also up 600,000 yuan. Other 20-count and 16-count yarns also rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan.

At the opening of the cotton fabric market in the morning, retail investors made up for Si Jun Zi and Jin Yin Piji, and various parties also had a strong buying interest, with prices at 5,500 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth declined by 5,000 yuan to 9,000 yuan, except for Wu Fu. Fu Chou and Bleached Cloth sales were sluggish, and prices all declined by about 5,000 yuan. The China Textile Construction Corporation supplied more than 30 types of cloth as usual, with fine Long Tou cloth priced at 2.67 million yuan. Printed Fu Chou and Ramie yarn were limited to applications from retail stores, and the number of applications from various fabric stores was not large.

### Rayon Rises, Mill-made Silk Goods are Weak

The price of rayon remains firm due to the pending allocation. The market opened flat yesterday. Number 120, Gao Shan You Guang, first bid to buy at 7.5 million yuan and sold at 7.8 million yuan, then rose again, reaching a maximum of 8.8 to 8.9 million yuan, and closed at 8.4 million yuan. In the afternoon, it gradually softened as the mill-made market declined again, and finally closed at 8 million yuan, up 600,000 yuan from the previous day. Number 75, semi-glossy cone yarn, was traded at 25 million yuan.

Mill-made prices were 400,000 to 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day. There were ten bales traded yesterday. Grade E was priced at 18.65 million yuan. There were no transactions for grades ABCD.

The silk goods market remained weak yesterday. Da Cheng bedspreads opened at 8.5 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from the previous day. Ge Zi Chou had a minimum price of 30,500 yuan, a maximum price of 2,500 yuan, and a final bid to sell at 1,500 yuan, down 1,500 yuan from the previous day.

### Hankou Merchants Arbitrage Shanghai Remittances

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from Hankou, a large number of banknotes are flowing out of Hankou every day to Guangzhou to arbitrage Shanghai remittances. 780 yuan is paid in Guangzhou, and 1,000 yuan can be drawn in Shanghai. Therefore, a profit of 22.2 million yuan can be made for every 100 million. It is said that the round-trip travel expenses for flying to Shanghai to withdraw cash are only 2 million yuan. As a result, the number of people engaged in this arbitrage is increasing daily.

### The People's Food Problem Needs to Be Resolved Urgently: The Rice Market Is Stalled Invisibly

[Our Newspaper's Report] Director of the Social Bureau Wu Kaixian went to Beijing yesterday to negotiate with the Ministry of Food about the people's food problem in this city and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on Monday. New decisions can be expected at that time.

The source of rice has not been smooth, and the amount of goods arriving yesterday was still scarce. Due to the recent rush to buy rice, rice merchants are afraid to buy rice. Yesterday, they also went to the municipal government to petition, so market transactions were invisibly stalled, and many rice stores were also closed. Yesterday, a total of 2,146 shi of goods arrived at the north and south markets. High-quality white japonica rice was priced at 298,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 290,000. High-quality Bo Dao rice was priced at 297,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 290,000. High-quality early rice was priced at 290,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 285,000. High-quality Yang Xian rice was priced at 290,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 280,000. High-quality milled Xian rice was priced at 270,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 260,000, and inferior rice was priced at 245,000. High-quality Bai Yuan rice was priced at 305,000, medium-quality rice was priced at 295,000, and inferior rice was priced at 290,000. Medium-quality Yin Yuan rice was priced at 295,000.

The authorities allocated 9,000 bags of rice, which were originally scheduled to be sold in the North Market yesterday, but the allocation was temporarily suspended because all the rice merchants went to the Municipal Government to petition.

There were slight fluctuations in the flour market. Western flour was flat, and unified flour fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and the factories were holding firm. Bran sales were active, but prices remained stable. Soybean sales were normal, high prices were fixed and inferior prices were reduced, and medium and low prices fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Green beans had little inflow or outflow, and high-quality goods still rose by 3,000 yuan, and medium and inferior transactions were sluggish. Broad beans were very popular due to the transition between new and old crops, and prices soared by 10,000 yuan. Corn, alcohol, and sandy products were cold and sluggish, and prices plummeted by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Red sorghum also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had weak demand from both local and foreign sources, and prices fell by 10,000 yuan. Sesame had little spirit and lacked transactions. The oil market's demand from stores turned stronger, and the factory's supply was also abundant, creating a situation of strong supply and demand. Raw oil and soybean oil rose by 10,000 yuan, sesame oil also rose by 10,000 yuan, but medium and inferior raw soybean oil remained mediocre, and rapeseed oil was flat.

### The Tea Market Is Quiet Again

Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw sellers of various export teas unwilling to sell lightly, and they all took a wait-and-see attitude, making the market even quieter. As for the flavored teas that are exclusively for domestic sale, in addition to jasmine, da fang, and slightly baked green teas, which were still favored by the Tianjin merchants, the rest only had sporadic transactions. As the supply and demand of the process became balanced, the ups and downs were less than before. According to people in the industry: Currently, Yingkou, Tianjin, and other places have a strong demand for last year's Huizhou baked green tea. At the same time, the Qingdao merchants also favor the 35-year Bailin black tea, but the inventory in the market is rare.

### Sugar Rises After Falling

The sugar market initially softened yesterday because the Taiwan Sugar Company had begun to resume distribution. Peruvian fine sand fell to 358,000 yuan, and then returned to 385,000 yuan. No. 24 coarse white fell by 25,000 yuan, No. 20 medium sand fell by 40,000 yuan, half-car white fell to less than 370,000 yuan at the lowest, three-quarter car white was only 360,000 yuan, Xinghua white was 360,000 yuan to 380,000 yuan, also down 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, Xing red was 280,000 to 290,000 yuan, down 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, Taiwan red was 290,000 yuan, down 20,000 yuan, Huizhou green was 240,000 to 50,000 yuan, and Diao green was bid at 240,000 yuan, but no transactions were made. In the afternoon, news came that the Taiwan Company's distribution volume could not be increased, so Peruvian fine sand rose again, exceeding the 400,000 yuan mark, and the market may not be easy to loosen.

### Retail Kerosene to Be Calculated by Volume

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Measurement and Inspection has stipulated that all kerosene retailers in the city must switch to calculating kerosene by volume instead of weight in order to avoid fraud and ensure uniformity. Each can will be 30 catties, and the volume for retail sales will be one liter, which is 500 CC. The deadline for replacing the measuring equipment is the end of May. All kerosene retail stores must complete the replacement procedures within the deadline. The bureau will conduct inspections from June onwards, and those who deliberately violate or delay compliance will be punished according to regulations.

### Dodge Trucks Surge in Price

[Our Newspaper's Report] The price of Dodge (DODGE) three-and-a-half-ton trucks has also risen with the surge in black market foreign exchange. The current price is more than 50 million yuan per vehicle.

### Securities Firms Fully Selling Off Foreign Stocks: Consistent Decline Yesterday

Foreign stocks declined consistently yesterday due to the rebound of Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone and Telegraph and the deterioration of the stock market. The absorption by the northern traders and retail buyers could not resist the full sell-off by securities firms. Qian Dui Ye initially entered and then exited. Yi Sha opened at 84,000 yuan and gradually declined from 85,200. In the afternoon, it ended at a low price of 65,000 yuan. With the exception of Ye Guang, which did not decline significantly, almost all stocks fell sharply. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shipping fell by 25%, Yi Sha, Ying Lian Paper, and Steel each fell by 20%, Ye Guang declined slightly, and the rest all fell by slightly more than 10%.

### How to Allocate Civilian Coal: The Allocated Amount Is Too Far From the Applied Amount

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Civilian Coal Allocation Committee held its first meeting at the Bank of China Building yesterday afternoon. Representatives from nine units, including the Fuel Management Committee, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Guidance, the Garrison Command, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the Coal Industry Association, and the Machine-made Coal Ball Industry Association, attended the meeting, which was chaired by Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee. It is reported that the Fuel Management Committee can allocate 20,000 tons of bituminous coal and 9,000 tons of white coal for civilian use this month. The allocation method for bituminous coal has been determined to be 15,000 tons for private factories and 5,000 tons for the Coal Industry Association. The allocation method for white coal has been determined to be 6,000 tons for the Coal Ball Industry Association and 3,000 tons for the Coal Industry Association. However, the amount applied for by each industry far exceeds this number. For example, the monthly application amount of the Industrial Association is as high as 80,000 tons. Therefore, the meeting openly discussed the allocation method for the amount of coal that can be allocated for civilian use this month and decided on the allocation method.

### Statistics on National Bank and Exchange Reserves in March

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the comparative table of the total amount of deposits and reserves of banks and exchanges across the country released by the Audit Department of the Central Bank, the total amount of deposits in March was 1,126,429,909,844.03 yuan, a sharp increase of one time compared to the 613,889,490,595.50 yuan in January. It increased by almost one-third compared to the 754,092,690,405.98 yuan in February. Among the total amount of deposits in March, demand deposits accounted for 1,008,866,319,590.73 yuan, and time deposits accounted for 117,563,590,253.36 yuan. The reserves paid for these deposits were 163,316,477,831.16 yuan.

### Raw Material Market Turns Firm

[Our Newspaper's Report] The raw material market softened briefly the day before yesterday. Yesterday, as the Hong Kong exchange rate rose again, it stimulated a return to firmness. There were few sellers, and prices were still difficult to lower. Vaseline and some unpopular raw materials had strong demand from Shantou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other merchants, and prices rose sharply again.

### Three Principles Agreed Upon for the Allocation of Raw Material Foreign Exchange for Vulcanization

The Chemical Raw Materials Industry Association sent representatives Wang Shouheng and seven others to discuss with the Provisional Management Committee for Imports the foreign exchange allocation method for raw materials for vulcanization in the second quarter. The representatives immediately presented (1) the foreign exchange to be allocated will be given to vulcanization manufacturers, and the association will provide certification and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Guidance will supervise the reasonable allocation according to the actual production situation of each factory. (2) Importers and foreign raw material factories can jointly bid with the vulcanization manufacturers, the association, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to determine the price. (3) The vulcanization produced by each factory can be supervised by the association and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and supplied to the dyeing and weaving industry and the members of each industry association in a reasonable manner, but must not be sold to hoarders. The above three principles will be submitted to the Advisory Committee for Import Management for review.

### Knitwear Industry Reduces Work: Currently in the Off-Season

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to people in the knitwear industry: The industry has recently been affected by: (1) The sharp rise in black market yarn prices, which has led to raw materials being more expensive than finished products, affecting the industry's production. (2) The amount of yarn allocated by the China Textile Construction Corporation is only one-third of the industry's actual needs. (3) The season has entered the off-season, and only undershirts are still in season. For this reason, since April, half of the industry has been reducing work, with a production volume of about 60% to 70% of the original production volume. It is reported that hosiery is the largest part of the knitwear industry. Recently, due to the general price increase, the price of ordinary 32-count plain medium-length socks is about 60,000 yuan per dozen, which is only the highest price in mid-February (peak season). According to past practice, the peak season for socks gradually declines after Qingming, when the farming season begins, and the recent firm market is actually driven by the general price increase. As for the export business of the industry, a few people are still engaged in operations, but it is said that most of them are starting with barter trade. Otherwise, with the current official exchange rate and the black market price difference widening day by day, it is more difficult to expect export trade to develop.

### Paper Merchants Hold Goods and Do Not Sell: Newspaper Prices Gradually Rise

[Our Newspaper's Report] The price of newsprint has continued to rise sharply recently. Canadian newsprint has reached 4,500 yuan per pound, and a double-sized sheet is also priced at between 230,000 and 240,000 yuan per ream. According to people in the industry, in order to maintain the capital of the paper in stock, general paper merchants will first replenish their stock if they sell it during this period of price fluctuations. As it is currently difficult to replenish stock, most of them hold goods and do not sell. Moreover, the black market foreign exchange has continued to rise sharply, so paper prices have also gradually risen.

### Pharmaceutical Industry Raw Material Allocation Should Be Handled by the Association

The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that the amount of raw materials approved by the Ministry of Railways and Transportation is only 600,000 yuan, which is far from the actual needs. Therefore, a standing committee meeting was held the day before yesterday, chaired by Chairman Gu Kemin, and it was resolved to submit to the relevant agencies that all raw material allocation and raw material designation matters should be handled by the association in order to avoid exploitation and encroachment by middlemen and merchants. Representatives will be sent to meet with the authorities to state the difficulties.

### Oils and Waxes Rise Together

[Our Newspaper's Report] Industrial oils and fats are rising every day, sales are increasing, and the price of incoming goods is high. Yesterday, the price of asphalt rose again due to the fact that the Hankou remittance fee was 83% off. He Ben was bid at 850,000 yuan, Jing Bai was bid at 680,000 yuan, and Ma Cheng was bid at 660,000 yuan. The cargo owners firmly refused to sell, which was one and a half times higher than the previous month. The cargo owners of butter are firmly confident, and yesterday the market bid at 1 million yuan outside the customs, and there were no goods to buy. Coconut oil was 1.2 million yuan, and there were some transactions, which was twice the price of 420,000 yuan last month. Sichuan wax became a ball-like commodity, and retail investors' purchases and sales were erratic. Yesterday, the market soared to extreme levels, and the price of Mi Xin Da Bing had risen to 6 million yuan per unit.

### On the Question of Instilling Common Medical Knowledge (Part 1)

— Fan Shouyuan

Before discussing the question of how to instill common medical knowledge, we must first clarify the significance of instilling such knowledge.

Why should we undertake this task of instilling common medical knowledge? What is the significance of this work? Simply put, the main significance of instilling common medical knowledge is nothing more than the following points: (1) To popularize the various aspects of new scientific medicine that the public should understand, so that they understand the value of new medicine and are more likely to accept its treatment, and thus enjoy the benefits of new medical care. (2) To correct non-scientific medical concepts, making them aware that the theories of past traditional medicine are mostly unscientific, and the methods of treatment are even more outdated; in this new era of the 20th century, traditional medicine not only fails to fully assume the responsibility of medical treatment, but also cannot even be considered capable of fulfilling the great task of preventing disease and promoting health for the people. (3) To enable the general public, who have always lacked common medical and hygiene knowledge, to acquire the necessary daily hygiene and medical knowledge, so that they can take preventive measures before becoming ill, and know how to deal with and recuperate after becoming ill, in order to improve personal health and prolong the average lifespan of the population.

These points are the reasons why we should undertake the work of instilling common medical knowledge.

However, in order to achieve the goal of this great work and obtain its desired effects, we must have appropriate methods, in order to have the hope of achieving it and the possibility of obtaining it.

Therefore, we cannot avoid discussing the question of how to instill common medical knowledge.

Whether the method of instilling this common medical knowledge is appropriate or not is the key to whether we can achieve the great goal of instilling common medical knowledge, and the crux of whether we can obtain the satisfactory effects of instilling common medical knowledge.

Indeed, there is no absolutely fixed method for instilling common medical knowledge; however, in general or in principle, there should be a rough method.

The so-called instilling common medical knowledge refers to the general public outside the medical field; in other words, the target of our instilling work is the masses, the general public who lack medical knowledge, not medical practitioners within the medical field. Therefore, when we are doing the instilling work, we must never forget that we are speaking to the public; that is, the topics we propose for instilling medical knowledge must be aimed at the public; they must not only be needed by the public, but also be considered understandable and digestible by the general public!

Such medical knowledge topics that are both needed by the general public and can be understood and digested by the public can be regarded as methods that comply with the principles of instilling medical knowledge. Only by applying such methods that comply with the principles of instilling medical knowledge can we achieve the purpose of instilling and obtain the effects of instilling.

Otherwise, if you use words intended for the medical field itself, or specialized medical topics to speak to the public, or as instilling topics for the general public, on the one hand, they will not only not be needed by the public, but also will not be easily understood and digested by the public. As a result, not only will the writer waste effort, but the reading public will also waste time. This is called futile and unrewarding, making great efforts but not achieving good results. Wouldn't this be inconsistent with our original purpose? Of course, there is no hope of achieving the original purpose of instilling medical knowledge.

Not long ago, I wrote an article in this publication entitled "Medical Newspaper Articles and Magazine Articles." The meaning of that article was that all medical articles can be roughly divided into two categories: one category is written for people in the medical field themselves, and is academic writing of a specialized nature. These types of writings are mostly published in specialized medical magazines. I assumed a name for them, calling them "magazine articles"; the other category is written for the general public outside the medical field. This type of popular writing for the public is more suitable for publication in newspaper supplements, so I gave it another name, calling it "newspaper articles."

Magazines, of course, do not necessarily have to be entirely dedicated to specialized academic articles, and can certainly be used for popular medical knowledge articles; however, medical articles in newspapers should only be suitable for popular medical knowledge articles. If specialized academic articles are published, then they are somewhat inappropriate.

The textual method of instilling common medical knowledge mentioned here is, needless to say, belongs to the category of popular newspaper articles. Because the so-called newspaper articles are popular articles written for the general public who lack medical knowledge, and their purpose does not go beyond the six characters of "instilling common medical knowledge."

Regarding the writing style or work goal of instilling common medical knowledge, the public should be the target, and it must be suitable for the public's taste in order to reap the benefits of the instilling work; otherwise, if medical articles discussed by the medical field itself, or academic articles used for self-study, are used to publicize to the public and instill them to the masses, it will only be a waste of effort and futile. This has already been said above.

### Talking About Infantile Spasms

— Xu Shuping

Infantile Spasms, also known as "Slow Spleen Wind," is a disease name defined by traditional medicine. Almost everyone knows this term because it is a formidable enemy of children. Every year, no less than tens of millions die from this disease! No wonder traditional doctors are disheartened when they see it. According to traditional theories, it is believed that prolonged diarrhea can lead to this disease, because the internal damage is already severe, and the stomach qi is weak, leading to this condition. Traditional doctors mainly focus on tonifying the spleen for this disease, and are generally at a loss for effective treatments. In fact, the occurrence of this disease is entirely due to the excessive loss of water and minerals in the body. In all cases where the body fluid is reduced due to vomiting, diarrhea or other reasons, new medicine defines it as dehydration. This dehydration is infantile spasm. The clinical symptoms of dehydration are most obvious in infants. Its symptoms are: (1) dry skin, losing elasticity, more obvious in the skin of the abdomen; (2) sunken eyes, sunken fontanelle; decreased urination; (4) mental confusion, with stiff neck and convulsions and other symptoms; (5) deep and long breathing, like a sigh, which is a sign of acidosis; (6) the skin, lips, or fingernails are cyanotic; (7) body temperature can rise to about 40 degrees; (8) rapid weight loss, etc. Regarding the principle of dehydration, because it belongs to the scope of pathology, and not the scope of common sense, it would be a long story to tell, so I will omit it for the time being. The most important principle of treatment is nothing more than providing fluids to restore the body's blood volume to normal, blood circulation can be improved, urine output increases, so that excessive acidic radicals in the body can combine with alkali and be excreted in the urine, which can avoid the occurrence of acidosis. The treatment of the pathogens of dehydration, such as the elimination of infectious diseases, is indeed the key point for doctors to treat diseases.

### A Word to the China Medical Association

— Yu Zhengxing

The 7th Annual Meeting of the China Medical Association will open in Nanjing on May 5th. This is the first conference of the association since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Undoubtedly, this is also an epoch-making annual meeting. Therefore, the focus of the annual meeting is on how to cooperate with the course of national construction, give play to the function of medicine, and enable the Republic of China to embark on a smooth road to prosperity, strength, and happiness. The mission and task of this annual meeting are themselves arduous and significant. Because in the history of Chinese medicine, and in the basic national policy, the brilliant deeds of the "public medical system" should be written in the future, and no longer the "transaction behavior" of private doctors. Therefore, how can the medical community itself overcome the shackles of the past? How to promote the success of the public medical system? How to devote oneself to the national health cause? This is certainly the main topic for discussion at the Medical Association, and at the same time, it determines what to abandon and what to follow. Now, I sincerely wish the 7th Annual Meeting of the China Medical Association a success, so that it can actively promote the early realization of the "public medical system" in China.

Writing about this made me recall the Joint Annual Meeting of National Educational and Academic Groups in the summer of 1945, held in Beibei, Chongqing. At the closing ceremony, someone proposed: "Resolutions of the annual meeting submitted to the Ministry of Education for reference and implementation should be reported on the degree of implementation at the next annual meeting." After the proposal was put forward, the entire body unanimously supported and passed it, and it was immediately approved for execution by Minister Chen Lifu, who attended the meeting, maintaining a close relationship with each other.

After this incident happened, I felt that this proposal was not surprising. Minister Chen's willingness to accept this proposal was also not surprising, but it was surprising that this proposal could be "unanimously supported and passed." In the past, many academic groups in China repeatedly claimed that they would not interfere in politics, and only engage in "academic pursuit" for the sake of academic pursuit. If this idea cannot be regarded as closing oneself off from the outside world, nor can it be regarded as reinventing the wheel, it will always have a taste of "protecting oneself by being wise," that is, "not interfering with each other." Whether this kind of thinking can still exist in the current society is indeed worth questioning. The more advanced the society, the more complex, closer, more difficult to divide, and more difficult to isolate the relationship between people. The United States, which watched the First World War from across the ocean, actively cooperated with the Allied countries in the Second World War to fight against the Nazi and Japanese bandits. The United Kingdom is now in a leading position for world security and peace, which proves that the style and thinking of "Shangri-La" and "security is a blessing" no longer conform to the current social situation. When Hitler was the dictator of Germany, German scholars were unwilling to be tools of Nazi crimes. Scholars were safe, but ambitious people were restless. "Academic pursuit for the sake of academic pursuit" is still an illusion!

At the same time, the country's academic administration of this academic group should not be observed, but should be worked hard together. Because if politicians control the administration related to academics, they will inevitably use it as a tool for political struggle, and failure is inevitable. We naturally attribute this to the shamelessness of politicians, but we should also attribute it to the people who engage in this kind of academic work, who are perfunctory, careless, and do not actively strive for the initiative to take responsibility. Instead, they sing the high tune of academic pursuit, but let academics be torn to pieces in the hands of demons. At this time, we are sad for academics, especially for the academics who are "walking dead"!

Although the above view is general and has no specific target, according to this view, it proves that its thinking violates the times and has no need to exist. It can also be used as a reference for the present. Therefore, it is hoped that at the 7th Annual Meeting of the China Medical Association, it should practically take responsibility for issues related to health administration, and the medical community must actively shoulder the mission of national health. This is not an interference with the promotion of the cause, but a more practical assistance to the promotion of the cause. From the current situation in China, the future Minister of Health must be a layman. Regardless of his ability, if he is allowed to act "self-righteously", after thousands of years, the health cause will not only not achieve success, but the chronic deterioration may even lead to the extinction of the species. The "public medical system" is undoubtedly a promissory note, but the only way is that the medical community should wake up and take the initiative, and should stand at the forefront of the health cause.

At present, China is a society ruled by people, not a society ruled by law. To promote the cause on the right track, reasonably and effectively, a kind of power is of course needed; this kind of power is the people. To give play to this kind of power, it is more of a collective behavior. The stipulations on health policies in the constitution are mostly inappropriate. During the constitutional period, health construction will still be allowed to be carried out arbitrarily, and it may not be as ideal. What's more, my country's public health cause has no foundation, lacks talents, and has poor equipment. Especially, the general public regards health as unimportant, and believes that medical and health care is nothing more than cleaning and treating diseases. This kind of base concept is often held by those in power. This kind of erroneous concept is actually the current enemy of the health cause, and should not continue to exist. The Medical Association should stand on its own position and use collective action to solve the health problems of the Chinese people. The China Medical Association should shoulder this arduous responsibility.

There is no distinction between scholarship and practice. Develop practice in scholarship and strive for scholarship in practice. Therefore, the scholarship of practice is practical and great. If you simply move foreign things into China, it will only add to the spectacle, and will not be of any benefit to the Chinese people. The best way is for Chinese medicine to cooperate with China's health cause, and advance side by side, study China's medical and health problems, and the needs and applications of technology. Only then will there be hope for health construction, and Chinese medicine will make progress. Otherwise, Chinese medicine will not be the tail of the United Kingdom and the United States, but the echo of Germany and Japan. Therefore, it is hoped that scholarship will not be divorced from the actual health cause, but will need close and harmonious steps.

In order to maintain and promote the health of the entire nation, and in order to promote the independence of Chinese medicine, I ask the China Medical Association to have a new decision and a new style, to actively connect with practical matters, and to unhesitatingly believe that health construction is a part of its own responsibility. The health administration authority is only an agent, and the main body is still in the medical community. Therefore, we must urge, lead, and supervise the health administration authority, and call on them to be based on the spirit and purpose of "public medicine" so that all Chinese people can enjoy the benefits of medical and health care, and do not let them "become officials" and "get rich". The China Medical Association should do this, and only in this way can it be worthy of people's praise. Otherwise, the usual meetings, resolutions, and declarations will still be met with people's scorn and contempt.

This small suggestion is issued from the depths of my heart. Of course, the wording may be inappropriate, but I am indeed full of good intentions, hoping that the Chinese medical community will flourish and that the Chinese people will be healthy and strong!

### A Brief Discussion on Rabies (Continued)

— Chen Jindou

Since we already know that rabies is an infectious disease, does that mean that after being bitten by a rabid dog (should be collectively called a diseased animal), it will immediately develop the disease? No, after being bitten, before the official onset of the disease, there is a silent period in between, called the incubation period (Incubationszeit). The length of this period is quite uncertain. According to general statistics, the shortest is at least two or three weeks, and the longer ones can be half a year or more than two or three years, with an average of about fifty or sixty days. When bitten by a rabid dog, if it is not infected by his saliva, it will not cause the disease; or if the bitten area does not invade the nerves, it is unlikely to cause the disease, because the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels are not its main transmission routes; the chance of developing the disease is greatly reduced if the bite is through clothing or socks. The length of the incubation period also varies depending on the type of diseased animal and the location of the bite; if bitten by a diseased animal of a carnivorous animal (such as dogs, wolves, foxes, and cats), it will develop the disease faster and more severely, especially wolf bites are more serious than dog bites, which may be related to the size and depth of the wound. If bitten by the same diseased animal and get sick, then the incubation period of being bitten in the arm will be shorter than that of being bitten in the foot and leg, and the incubation period of being bitten in the head and face will be even shorter, meaning that the closer the bite wound is to the central nervous system, the faster the disease will develop. As for the strength of one's own resistance, it can of course affect the length of the incubation period. (To be continued)

### Thoughts on Reading the Medical Practitioner Law

— Song Guobin, Record by Song Enhao

In recent years, I have been living in seclusion in my hometown, not seeking fame and fortune, preserving my life, and reading books behind closed doors. Yesterday, the Shanghai Medical Practitioner Association sent me a copy of the current Medical Practitioner Law, which I received and read; I bowed again and said: "Alas, is this the Medical Practitioner Law that we have been running around calling for day and night for the past twenty years? How disappointing it is!" Please explain it in detail:

(1) Violating the Simplified Law: According to foreign countries, anyone who graduates from a formal medical school and holds a national diploma can request a license from the local health authority to practice medicine, and the procedures are very simple. However, this is not the case in our country. According to the Medical Practitioner Law:

(1) After graduation, with the graduation diploma, first apply to the Examination Yuan for an examination or review, and issue a certificate of passing.

(2) With the certificate of passing from the Examination Yuan, apply to the Ministry of Health for a medical practitioner certificate.

(3) With the medical practitioner certificate, apply to the local county or city government for registration and issue a business license.

The complexity of the procedures sets a precedent that has never been seen in any country in the world—now that the government is promoting the simplification of laws, is this not going against it? This should be discussed.

(2) The law does not investigate the past: This Medical Practitioner Law was promulgated and implemented on September 21, 1943. Therefore, before this date, all doctors who have been recognized by the government for their qualifications and hold a medical practitioner certificate do not need to go through the examination or review of the Examination Yuan again. Because under the same government, once it has been recognized in the past, it cannot go back on its word in the future, breaking faith with the people. Now this Medical Practitioner Law does not have a clear provision. Is this not the meaning of the law not investigating the past? This should be discussed.

(3) Creating divergent medical practitioners: There are two sources of new doctors in our country: one is the formal doctors who graduated from school, and the other is the divergent doctors who did not graduate from school; however, this is only a temporary transitional phenomenon, and divergent doctors should not continue to be produced. Now Article 1 of this Medical Practitioner Law states: "Citizens of the Republic of China who pass the medical practitioner examination may serve as medical practitioners." Then, no matter who they are, they do not need to go through the school stage to serve as medical practitioners. Isn't this allowing divergent doctors to continue to be produced in an endless stream? This should be discussed.

(4) Unequal treatment for new and old doctors: This Medical Practitioner Law applies to both new and old doctors, but the treatment seems to be unequal. Article 3, Paragraph 1: "Chinese medicine practitioners who have obtained a certificate of qualification or a license to practice medicine from the central competent authority or the provincial or municipal government" or Paragraph 3: "Those who have practiced Chinese medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputation" may apply for a medical practitioner review. However, there are many people in the new medical community who have these two qualifications, but they must go through the medical practitioner examination. There is this contradiction in the same Medical Practitioner Law. This should be discussed.

(5) Medical rights protection issues: In recent years, medical litigation cases have been heard from time to time, and business disputes have emerged one after another. What we hope for in the Medical Practitioner Law is to protect medical rights and reduce medical litigation. Although this law lists the rights to practice and organize associations, the provisions on medical rights: such as the use of anesthetic drugs, performing surgery, terminating pregnancy, dissecting corpses, identifying diseases and injuries, and the protection of final medical consultation fees and other issues, should be listed item by item and clearly stipulated. This should be discussed.

In summary, except for the fifth point, the rest are related to the medical practitioner examination issue. In fact, if the Examination Yuan wants to extend its authority to the medical community, it is not impossible; when the public medical system is implemented in the future, the appointment of doctors in each hospital at all levels, and the appointment of civil servants in local health institutions, must rely on the Examination Yuan. Because on the one hand, it can prevent private connections, and on the other hand, it can avoid the manipulation of one faction, which is a very good law. As for the examination for idle jobs, it seems to be a bit superfluous and unnecessary, and the examination is held regularly every year. Before the examination, one cannot practice medicine, or it is said that a temporary license can be used for relief, but the issuance of a temporary license also has intermittent characteristics. If it is not the right time, it is not easy to obtain. Alas! It is just a matter of starting a business, but it is so difficult. If it is not the fault of the Medical Practitioner Law, who else should be blamed?

### Memories of the Moscow Little Theatre

— Translated by Zhao Jingshen

At a corner of Gorky Street, between Pushkin Square and Mayakovsky Square, there is a place often referred to as Mamonovsky Lane. Now it is called Sadovsky Lane. This is how Moscow respects the home of our actors, the Sadovsky lineage—(my grandfather Prov Mikhailovich, my father Mikhail Provich, and my mother Olga Asafovna, were all artists in the Moscow Little Theatre, which is the oldest and most famous in Russia.

I spent my childhood in my grandfather's old house in Mamonovsky Lane. In fact, the place we often went out to play from this lane was Petrovsky Park, just outside the city, where we had a small house. Our Sadovsky family was Muscovite to the core, and we were reluctant to leave Moscow even for a short trip to St. Petersburg, for example. There was no way to drag us out of Moscow. Only in times of hardship would my mother travel.

We were reluctant to leave Moscow, our strange and lovely city, where everyone knows everyone. I often drove to the Little Theatre for rehearsals or performances, constantly raising my hat, until my arm ached.

Everything in Moscow was lovely and familiar, and so were the people, who lived an old life with habits that were so delightful. Every year, it was customary to go to Maiden's Field to hold a carnival. There, grass huts were built, and variety shows were performed. Once, I saw a very sublime dramatic performance in this outdoor theatre. It was called "1812, or the Great Fire of Moscow". I remember a person imitating Napoleon's special personality and attitude. He wore green clothes and a grey tricorn hat, walking back and forth on the stage. Above his riding boots, something bulged, suggesting breeches. He put one hand in his waistcoat and the other behind his back. He uttered a sentence: "Am I going to Moscow?" After answering his own question with the word "Forward!", he quickly walked off the stage. Then blue fireworks were set off, representing the Great Fire of Moscow. That was the whole performance. But it didn't matter, the audience still flocked to this open-air theatre, longing for it very much.

Later, as an actor, I often remembered that performance and the audience—people eagerly longing for art, only able to satisfy themselves mostly with such substitutes.

The Little Theatre is only a stone's throw from Moscow University. We actors often thought of this proximity as symbolic. Aren't the ideas of the great humanists, which inspire the best and most progressive qualities of Moscow's professors and students, similar to ours?

Our great teacher, Ostrovsky, had already written about the need for genuine people's art in the 1880s. I also remember that one evening in February 1911, it suddenly seemed as if a dream had come true, or, more truly, as if people suddenly understood what a people's theatre should be like. At a concert, Ermolova recited a poem by Maikov. I wanted to know which poem she was reciting and was very surprised by her choice.

I asked, "Maria Nikolayevna, do you really want to recite that poem? It won't be effective when reciting it. Why do you want to do this?"

Ermolova just smiled and didn't answer.

She slowly walked towards the audience. "Look, a faint light is shining in that small grass hut..." She began to describe this scene with a moving and affectionate voice. We immediately had a vision before our eyes, as if a small peasant girl walked to the school gate, the first in her family to enter school to receive education and culture, which must be universal for the masses.

From the first word, the audience was as if bewitched. Every line of poetry increased the sighing and sincerity. Later, this artist reached the last two lines:

'Brothers, believe me, this is only the first step

Into the land of thought, where perpetual light shines.'

These words shook out, as if calling us to serve the people with art. The audience roared enthusiastically, and I was among them. I was shaken to the depths of my soul.

I thought: 'Yes, my dear, that is the great talent you have shown—as a warrior of the people.'

The most famous singer Chaliapin could become an actor in the people's theatre, in the broadest and most democratic sense of the term. This genius artist, whose glorious voice was united with profound acting skills, abandoned all traditions and trivial details, the dross often found in these operas. From his lips, even the most clichéd songs sounded like the expression of original emotion. This was in Russia, his homeland, and he knew and shared the tastes of these audiences, so he was able to reach the greatest and best heights. His emigration surprised us all. Once he left his homeland, which had made his art powerful and rich, he could no longer be the great Chaliapin.

Under Soviet power, we have been given golden opportunities to realize the desire to serve the people with art. New masses are coming to us. This brings its problems.

The playbill of the Royal Theatre, the decision-makers and managers, all knew exactly what the masses wanted and liked when they gathered in the gallery and the stalls to watch matinees on Sundays, and when they filled the square to watch grass-roots plays during carnivals. Actors know that a play that is successful for one type of audience may be a failure for another.

The audiences in Moscow and Leningrad reflect differently. We all know this. When we performed, a small group of democratic theatregoers wanted to seek the mission of art in the theatre, and listened eagerly to the great dramatists. But most of the audience who supported us did not care about the greatness and courage of thought, but only looked for entertainment in the theatre.

The new era has changed all this. Democratic audiences, filled with hope and anticipation, filled the theatre—the stalls, boxes, and galleries. The audience, with a receptive mind and a clear understanding of life, came to the theatre wanting to see something important. How should we cater to them? What kind of theatre would interest them?

Ilyich said to Clara Zetkin: 'Our workers and peasants have the right to demand something higher than the circus. They have the right to demand true art.'

We decided that the repertoire would be classical plays, excluding everything that was false and superficial. Soon after, we performed modern plays, and in 1918, we naturally found Gorky, whom we were often looking for. We chose one of his plays called 'The Old Man'.

On the first night, I was sitting in the actors' room when our old servant Vasily rushed to the curtain to tell me that a man and a woman had come in, followed by a soldier in a leather jacket. They put down their things and went straight to the director's office. Not knowing what was going on, the performer Platon and I went out. Sure enough, a soldier was standing in the front room.

We asked him, 'Who is here?'

'Ilyich and Krupskaya.'

We looked into the box. Sure enough, Ilyich and his wife were sitting in the back row. The front row had already been occupied by people approved by Platon. Platon walked up to Ilyich. Ilyich said, 'It seems we are sitting in the wrong place.'

Platon said, 'Ilyich, your seats are over there.' He pointed to the best box. Ilyich leaned forward slightly, looked at the box, and said, 'No, we want to be here. We are very comfortable here.'

Platon asked, 'Shall we ask the people sitting in front of you to move to another box?'

'No, why? There is no need. Don't worry about it. We are very comfortable here.'

Moscow has been rebuilt more beautifully. Sometimes, old Muscovites like me are reluctant to leave the narrow, winding streets and houses, because they hold so many memories. But I did not shed a tear at leaving the legacy of the old world, the forerunners of old Moscow, which is slumbering. I saw that the great plan to rebuild the capital had come to life again.

I am not far from the truth when I say that today's Moscow has become a holy place for theatre. During banquets, guests from all over the country come to us. Artists from almost every country come to visit us.

For a period of time, the Bourgeois Theatre let its stage to our guests, displaying strange oriental costumes, and resonating with unknown instruments from the distant Caucasus and the plains of Outer Mongolia.

In those times, we listened to 'Azerbaijan' in the Uzbek language, and saw the life given to the characters, without needing words to understand them. This sublime primitive culture enriches our art, what a great exchange it is, and how enthusiastically our audience accepts it!

Near the Little Theatre, a monument to the great Russian dramatist Ostrovsky has been erected. He sits in an armchair, close to our stage, as if quietly listening to the murmur of the great city, the music of the new era, stirring thoughts in his heart. Every time I walk into the theatre, I always tip my hat to the bronze Ostrovsky, as if he were still alive.

How surprised he must be to see the line of cars passing before him! It turns out we are setting out on a journey across the country. I imagine him there thinking:

'How far will my Little Theatre develop endlessly? Where will it expand to?'

I tell him: 'To the Palace of Culture in Leningrad—to Kiev, to Odessa, to Dnepropetrovsk, to Kharkov, with the entire troupe, and all the scenery, and your golden words, dear Alexander Nikolayevich!' (By Prov Sadovsky, USSR)

### Distant Mountains in Twilight (Watercolor)

### Crow and Two Other Topics

— Xu Xiaohua

Pastoral

Do you believe that there is a utopia in the world now? And enchanting peach blossoms in brilliant red? That's a dream, an illusory dream that won't come true.

Times are different, it is progressing: the escape of the fisherman of Wuling is a combination of decline, withering, hesitation, and sorrow!

'After the war, the countryside is desolate,' unfortunately, what is there to praise except the flames of war and hunger? Many people die under the dual threats, and some people carry gold in piles of skulls; however, the proportion is too disparate...

The overflowing river water, the blood-red artillery shells, the empty granaries, the rubble of tiles... in the vast sandstorm beyond the pass, the sorghum is full of fields (but unfortunately, most of the land is empty!), in the Jiangnan where the grass grows and the orioles fly... no one can escape the doom of war or hunger.

I ask you: Where is the utopia?

Lamenter

Sorrow, indignation, loud protests, interwoven with a lonely and stubborn soul.

'Suicide is a sign of weakness,' I weep for the dead, and I place infinite expectations on the living. Don't sneer at it as a cliché, the truth is in it!

The old and reactionary will surely sink and decline, but it has not been completely destroyed, the new and progressive will surely rise, but it has not happily arrived in the world.

This is the darkness before dawn, the labor pains of the mother before the birth of a new life!

Loggers cut down the seedlings in the forest one by one, and this forest is about to become flat;

One by one, lives that are not full enough, given to the legacy of jackals, are devoured in the fourth watch, I am sad and indignant, but even more strengthen my firm belief.

—Strengthen the weak into the strong, and sow the seeds of new life before the light.

Crow

It's getting dark, and crows are circling above the city.

'Caw caw caw,' this is a threatening cry to the kind, the sparrows fly away far away when they hear it, and they laugh triumphantly.

'We have won, you little guys!'

Is the sky really as black as crows? No: beyond their circling sky, there is still a vast expanse of azure.

The sun is hiding behind the mountains, and the crows, one by one, timidly fly back to their old home in the dark night.

Tomorrow will be a sunny day.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 504

— Ye Jingfeng

All these problems, of course, are like a tangled mess of silk, accumulating in Tsurumi's mind. Although he now has so many people helping him, it is a hundred times more secure than when he and Masao Iwato were alone, groping around like headless flies. Moreover, there is now some hope about Pingzi's whereabouts; someone has also promised to try to interpret that mysterious letter, so Tsurumi can certainly rest easier. However, even so, can Pingzi really be rescued from the bandit's den? Is it certain that Pingzi must be in one of these three "dens"? In other words, is it absolutely impossible for the other side to put Pingzi anywhere outside the three "dens"? Moreover, according to the representative of the Korean side, the other side's "警戒綫" is very solid, and if we send people to rescue her, a fierce battle will be unavoidable. The combined front going together from all sides will certainly be able to fight the other side, but the problem is, if the enemy fails, and given the base psychology of the Japanese, they might just kill Pingzi with a single shot. What then?

Moreover, if Pingzi cannot be rescued after midnight, even if the old man with the "覺T" can interpret the secret order, will Tsurumi be able to carry it out alone according to the order? Isn't that a big problem too? That is to say, without Pingzi, can Tsurumi himself bear the responsibility of executing the order alone? Even if there are three other parties willing to help with all their might, their abilities are certainly extremely strong, but they are definitely not the kind of ability that Pingzi has. It can be said for certain that even if all three parties are willing to sacrifice everything and take a gamble, if their methods are wrong and they can't muster their strength, wouldn't it be a waste?

Therefore, although Tsurumi felt half relieved after receiving the phone calls from all sides, he still couldn't feel completely at ease because of these two or three worrisome problems. At this time, Tsurumi was alone in his room in the large hotel, and there were only two major things to do: one, according to his old habit, he started pacing back and forth in the empty room; two, as he paced back and forth, he would look at the phone on the wall by the door almost every step of the way, hoping that a call would come in from outside.

Just as Tsurumi was feeling so anxious, he suddenly heard two soft knocks on the door, as light as a small woodpecker pecking at the door. Tsurumi stopped immediately when he heard the knocks. Because he hadn't heard clearly if someone was really knocking, and before he could answer, there were four more knocks. These four knocks were divided into two times, two knocks followed by a pause, and then two more knocks.

"Who is it?" Tsurumi asked, feeling strange: If it were a waiter from the hotel with something to enter the room, they would definitely not peck at the door like that. If it were one of the people who had already come, like Shouyi, they would probably push the door open without waiting for an answer from inside; in any case, they would never knock so lightly and so mysteriously. First two knocks, then another two knocks, sounding like some kind of agreed-upon code. Furthermore, if the person knocking was a stranger, the hotel would definitely send a waiter to lead them upstairs as usual, and there would be a phone call beforehand to ask if he was willing to see them. This kind of knocking method didn't seem to fall within any of these three categories; so Tsurumi asked again, feeling even stranger, "Who is it?"

Peck peck... peck peck... peck!

### A Marriage Advertisement

— Bu Shu

A certain fourth-year student at National Central University recently published an advertisement in the Dagan Daily seeking a widow as a wife, regardless of anything else, but hoping to receive tuition fees.

This is the ebb and flow under the glamorous phenomenon of the city, stirred up by the "high prices" of the past year or two, and thus floated to the surface, appearing publicly as a "social problem" in a solemn manner. Some say this is a perversion of male prostitution, the incarnation of a pitiful worm kneeling before money and begging for life. Although the words are harsh, they reveal a bit of truth.

It is easy to imagine that upon seeing this advertisement, moralists will shake their heads and sigh, but there are too many things to sigh about these days, and there are too many news stories that deserve the feverish writing of "experts on yellow news." One day, because of "entering a room of orchids, one does not smell their fragrance after a long time," all strange and bizarre things will lose their infectiousness.

In universities, there are indeed many people who wear suits and leather shoes and spend money very lavishly, but there are many more poor students who wear patched long gowns year after year. This situation also reflects the face of the entire society, which is very common, but in this money-worshipping society, what is so strange about "seeking a widow as a wife"? What is strange is the purpose of his search—"only to provide tuition." Someone who has already submitted to money worship, someone who has succumbed to the cruelty of reality, someone who attempts to obtain tuition fees through marriage, still wants to continue his studies, which is too tragic.

The French writer André Gide could imagine the experiences and misfortunes of an old man walking along the road with his head down. Does anyone dare to imagine the experiences of the poor university student who published this advertisement? Hidden behind this advertisement may also be a great tragedy, a great pain.

—This is one of the money-worshipping scenes in a society where money worship is rampant. Good men and women may as well take a close look!

### Sugar and Tobacco

— Yi Quan

Mr. Bu Shu talked about how Americans spent more than 500 million yuan on candy in the past ten months. I don't think this cost is very high. We can break it down: The US population is about 100 million, and the average person spends 5 yuan on candy in ten months, which means that each person spends 5 jiao on candy each month, equivalent to 6,000 yuan in legal tender. I don't think anyone would say that a basic Shanghai citizen wastes money by spending 6,000 yuan on candy each month. Indeed, Americans are more frugal than Chinese. Looking back at Shanghai, the high-class Chinese who spend millions of gold coins at a time, if we were to calculate their monthly expenses, it would be staggering! Why ask people to sweeten their mouths less, and let our own people spend millions of gold coins at a time? Furthermore, if we put aside candy, Mr. Bu Shu, if you have time, you might as well calculate the monthly consumption of cigarettes in Shanghai: Assuming that 500,000 of the 3.5 million people in Shanghai smoke, and each person consumes 20 cigarettes a day, with each 20 cigarettes averaging 2,500 yuan, the number would probably not be small! Moreover, 99% of the candy consumed by Americans is produced in their own country, and more than half of the cigarettes consumed by the Chinese are foreign goods, and most of the Chinese goods are produced by foreign factories in China. Alas! What more can I say!

### Second Symphony Concert

— Ni Qiuping

The second Municipal Symphony Concert was performed publicly at the Lyceum Theatre on May 11th. This time there was a very good program - it opened with Bach-Abert's Praeludium, Choral and Puga…Bach-Abert. The second was Purcell's Suite for strings only. Third, Haydn's Symphony No. 4 in D major (The Clock). Haydn was an important figure in the Classical period, and he made great contributions to later symphonies. His works are known for their elegance and fluency. He also has excellent works on sonatas and string quartets. But the most are symphonies, said to be more than one hundred and several types, the most famous are only twelve kinds. The fourth program is Saint-Saëns's Cello Concerto: First Concerto for Cello with Orchestra. The cello soloist is Shevtzoff. Saint-Saëns is also good at instrumental works, he is a famous modern French composer. The advantage of the concerto is that there is a solo to listen to, and there is also an orchestra to listen to, which is equally important for both parties. The fifth is Liadov's Eight Russian Folk-songs: Liadow: Eight Russian Folk-songs: (1) Sacred Song, (2) Koliada (Christmas Carol) (3) Lament, (4) Comic Song: I Have Dancek with a Gnat, (5) The Legend of the Birds, (6) Luilaby, (7) Round Dance, (8) Dancing Chorus. This is like eight small paintings.

This program includes several types of music; large ones include symphonies, small ones include folk songs. In terms of performance, there are solos, string ensembles, and orchestras; it is a very good concert. The program arrangement and conductor is the Italian Professor Arigo Foa.

Last time it was full and many people who arrived late were turned away, so this time it is better to go buy tickets in advance.

### New Medical Techniques for Transforming Personality

— Jianhua

Medicine, like other natural sciences, is changing with each passing day and making significant progress. According to recent research, a person's personality can be transformed in essence using medical techniques, leading humanity towards evolution.

It is an undeniable fact that endocrine glands are related to the structure of the human body. It has also recently been confirmed by the medical community that the degree of development of the endocrine glands causes different personalities in each individual. For example, people with abnormally developed thyroid glands must have high nasal bridges and white skin, and they do not tire easily. For example, people with developed B-glands are bound to have calm minds and be scheming. In this experiment, new medicine can often determine a person's personality from how the endocrine glands develop.

However, new medical techniques can correct bad personalities. If the endocrine glands are overdeveloped, a type of light can be used to shrink them; if the endocrine glands are underdeveloped, a needle made from the endocrine glands can be used to supplement them. Therefore, Americans, based on this understanding of transforming personality, are planning to improve the evil nature of vicious criminals. It is said that among Japanese criminals, one-fifth belong to the "thymus lymphatic constitution." This constitution is because the thymus, which exists in the chest at birth, does not disappear at maturity (the thymus of ordinary people must disappear at maturity). It remains in the body, causing people to often have abnormal sexual desires, especially when they have various ambitions, are prone to suicide, and dare to kill. For this kind of inferiority, education is powerless other than new medical techniques.

### The Thief is Actually an Expert

— Several Stems

The Hongkou Police Department of this city recently arrested a car thief, and upon investigation, it turned out he was a mechanical expert. He possessed extraordinary skills, had returned from overseas, and became a petty thief due to temporary difficulty in finding a job. Those who have read this news probably cannot help but feel regret.

We do not believe that there is already a surplus of such people in society, causing him to be unable to find a job. This may be possible in the United States, where there are too many experts, but it is definitely not the case in China. The reason why this person cannot find a job lies in the fact that our social organization is not rigorous enough, causing a useful person to be unable to go to a position that suits him and needs him. Now we do have several groups responsible for job placement, but most factories, businesses, and institutions still do not know how to utilize them, and they overlook the importance of this kind of introduction. However, their methods of hiring personnel have not deviated from the stage of introduction. However, this kind of introduction is only a narrow range of private introductions. From the perspective of talent acquisition, there is a great difference.

If not using introduction, then the method of examination should be used. This is a better way to employ people than introduction. Some people still appreciate the beauty of the Chinese imperial examination system, which is the role of talent selection in the examination. It gives those without connections in the court an opportunity to be promoted. Nowadays, the number of institutions that adopt the examination system to employ people is gradually increasing, but it is still not many. As a result, an unemployed person with ability cannot help but feel the pain of having no way to turn to. Under the pressure of life, those with weaker wills become indiscriminate. This car thief expert is an example.

We cannot deny that this person himself also has shortcomings. As the report says, he "usually frequents brothels" and "does not seek advancement," which is the root of his depravity. The ancients said, "Without desire, one is firm." This young man, going in and out of the brothel, naturally cannot stand up straight and has to succumb to the dark forces. However, when we think about the fact that he is "only twenty-seven years old" and probably did not receive much education in the decade before and after the Anti-Japanese War, his knowledge and cultivation may have always remained at the age of seventeen, or even regressed compared to that teenager, we should see that society really bears a considerable responsibility for him. Fortunately, he was arrested this time. We hope that in addition to bringing him to justice, we can make up for the education that society owes him, which would not only benefit him alone.

### Arts and Literature Scene

The literary and artistic circles in Xi'an have been quite lonely recently. The "Camel Literature Series" literary monthly has been suspended due to economic reasons. The young writer Qingmiao has left Xi'an for Beiping, and Zheng Boqi, although in Xi'an, is also quite silent. However, several young artists and writers recently pooled their resources to publish a 16-page monthly journal, "New Literature and Art."

### The Age of Forty

— Hua

Man A: Strange, foreigners respect women's rights, so why not elect a woman as president?

Man B: Only people over forty are qualified to be elected president, and the person must be a great leader. You and I both understand, what people over forty would follow a woman?

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

A batch of military vehicles from the ×× War Zone Command—five three-and-a-half-ton trucks—did not leave as usual yesterday. The vehicles on the highway, which are said to leave tomorrow, will at least leave the day after tomorrow. This is the formula; although fleeing is important these days, the old habits cannot be changed. Anyway, it is a waste of running back and forth, and the unlucky ones are the passengers, but it will not delay the affairs of their Quartermaster Masters.

It was originally said that the vehicles would stop on Huanxiang East Road, but one or two hundred passengers waited from five or six o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock noon, without even seeing a wheel.

"The vehicles have not been repaired today and will leave tomorrow!" After much anticipation, two people who looked like drivers, wearing khaki-colored khaki Hawaiian shirts and matching trousers, came and said these two understated sentences.

"Will it leave early tomorrow?" "Where are the vehicles parked?" "Is it still here?" The guests asked their usual questions, but the two people just arrogantly replied:

"You just need to come and wait earlier tomorrow!"

When they wanted to ask further, they had already left without stepping on the ground; a few clever people hurried to catch up, offering cigarettes, and those who wanted to invite them to dinner quickly contacted them.

"Damn it! These bastards!" Zhang Chang and several young actors could not help but curse like this, but what could they do if the vehicles did not come? In the end, they could only carry their boxes and luggage like others and walk back dejectedly. Lao Zhu was the leader, and after returning, he certainly could not just curse like others; he had to bite the bullet and go to Director Xiong of the Transportation Department again. After half a day of negotiations, he was able to ask about the departure time and parking location the next night.

Today is the eve of the second emergency evacuation order announced by the authorities. Panicked crowds ran back and forth on the streets, pushing and shoving; even the native Guangxi people who did not intend to leave were frightened by the rapidly deteriorating situation. The two banks of the Xiang River were so crowded with them that they were like human walls, all wanting to take wooden boats to escape to the mountainous areas of Guishan.

The entire crew of the New China Theater Troupe arrived at the gate of the airport outside the South Gate before dawn. Five military vehicles were already waiting there, and two soldiers wearing extremely dirty military uniforms were guarding them, like subordinates of the drivers. Zhu Zhaonian handed them the boarding pass issued by the Transportation Department, thinking that there might be further difficulties, but the two soldiers did not even look at it, only nodded, and then lay on the ground, continuing to cook their breakfast with the picked-up dry branches. (Six or seven)
