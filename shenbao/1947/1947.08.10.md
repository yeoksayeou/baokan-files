### Communist Bandits Force Miners to Fight

Two Thousand Sacrificed in the Battle of Siping

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] According to news from Jilin, more than a thousand workers at the Naiyushan coal mine in the Communist bandit area of eastern Jilin launched an armed resistance movement at the beginning of the month because they were dissatisfied with the Communist bandits forcing them to join the army, killing six Communist bandit miners and foremen. Except for some of the miners who were detained and killed, most of the others escaped to the government area. It is reported that when the Communist bandits attacked Siping fiercely a month ago, they drove more than 2,000 miners from the Xi'an coal mine, giving each of them two hand grenades and forcing them to act as the vanguard. This group of good miners were completely sacrificed in the battle of Siping. This tragic fact has now spread throughout all mining areas in the Northeast.

[Another Telegram] The Changchun District Corps of the Youth League launched a "Hundred-Day Voluntary Donation Campaign" to raise funds through the group to provide relief to Siping.

### Fushun Situation Improves, Coal Production Increases

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 9th] The reporter went to Fushun with Special Envoy Wedemeyer on the morning of the 6th to inspect and deeply felt that Fushun has made significant progress compared with three months ago. Some streets have been gradually repaired and the city appearance is gradually becoming cleaner. Fushun's coal production has been affected by the war. The daily output in June and July was about 2,000 tons. It has now recovered to 4,000 tons per day. If the power supply is sufficient, production will continue to increase. Twenty oil refining furnaces are currently in operation, and expansion plans are also being gradually implemented. Since the Communist bandits' five offensives destroyed the Fengman transmission line to Shenyang, the Fushun Power Plant has become the only source of power for Shenyang, Anshan, Benxi, and other places. The original equipment could generate 290,000 kilowatts, but the Soviet army dismantled 210,000 kilowatts of machinery and equipment, leaving only 80,000 kilowatts of power generation capacity. Moreover, due to the old machinery and insufficient parts, the power generation last year was less than 20,000 kilowatts. It has now increased to 43,000 kilowatts. After the new machines are installed, the power supply problem in southern Northeast will be largely solved.

### Spokesperson of the Ministry of Communications Discusses the Overview of Our International Air Transport

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Regarding the overview of our country's international air transport, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Communications:

(1) The allied countries that have signed international air transport agreements with our country: A. The Sino-US Air Transport Agreement was signed last December. Both sides have successfully carried out trial flights. The US side has officially opened the route, and our side will also officially open the route soon. B. The Sino-British Air Transport Agreement was signed on July 23rd. Trial flights to Nanyang, Singapore, and Batavia are being planned. C. Draft Sino-Dutch and Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreements have been signed by representatives of both sides and are being submitted to the government for review. D. The Sino-French Provisional Agreement on Air Transport between Vietnam and China originally expired at the end of June this year, but has been extended to the end of this year with the consent of both parties. E. The Sino-Philippine Provisional Air Transport Agreement has expired and is being re-negotiated into a formal agreement. F. The Sino-Indian Air Transport Agreement was signed during the war and is being re-negotiated into a formal agreement.

(2) International routes currently flown by Chinese passenger planes: A. The Sino-US route: Shanghai to San Francisco. B. The Sino-Philippine route: Shanghai to Manila. C. Shanghai to Saigon. D. Kunming to Calcutta. There are currently not many passenger cars on each route.

(3) The Central Aviation Corporation currently does not have enough long-range aircraft. It originally planned to purchase two Constellation aircraft, but has not been able to purchase them due to the lack of foreign exchange approval. The China National Aviation Corporation only has six large passenger planes that can fly international routes, so in fact, it currently does not have enough capacity to operate all international routes. If the foreign exchange problem can be resolved quickly and new aircraft are added, the prospects for the prosperity of the international air transport routes operated by our country can be seen before us.

### The People's Constitutional Party Also Splits

Key Figures such as Li Shengce and Hong Shaozhi Advocate Continued Cooperation with Zhang Junmai

[Central News Agency, This City] The Democratic Constitutional Party and the National Socialist Party merged in August last year to form the Democratic Socialist Party. Less than a year later, it is recalled that the People's Constitutional Party declared its separation from the Democratic Socialist Party, which is chaired by Mr. Zhang Junmai, and split. According to Wu Xianzi, the person in charge of the People's Constitutional Party: "Although the People's Constitutional Party has withdrawn from Mr. Zhang Junmai's Democratic Socialist Party, it does not intend to restore the People's Constitutional Party's independence, but has decided to cooperate with the Reform Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party and continue to carry out legitimate activities in the name of the Democratic Socialist Party." He said: "The People's Constitutional Party no longer cooperates with Mr. Zhang Junmai because of various problems and disagreements within the party, and not because it intends to oppose the government. We are determined to contribute to national affairs in an opposition position in the future." When asked whether he intended to serve as the leader of another Democratic Socialist Party, he said, "If the National Congress convened by the Reform Committee makes this decision, he will be happy to consider it." There are also many within the People's Constitutional Party who oppose separation from Zhang Junmai. Other responsible persons of the party, such as Li Shengce and Hong Shaozhi, have stated that they will continue to cooperate with Zhang Junqin. Mr. Li is the President of the American Overseas Chinese Anliang Hall and the Supervisor of the Zhi Gong Tang, and his strength is sufficient to be regarded as important. Therefore, it is generally believed that the People's Constitutional Party has also split due to Wu Xianzi's decision, and that the party's strength has been greatly weakened by the fact that the party's strongmen do not act in concert with Wu.

[Our Newspaper] Cui Xin, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, recently commented on the announcement of the separation by the Democratic Constitutional Party, saying: "The People's Constitutional Party issued a joint statement with the Reform Committee in Shanghai in the name of the overseas branches of the Democratic Socialist Party. In terms of its actions, it is like there are two People's Constitutional Parties, one made in the United States and one made in China." When asked whether Wu Xianzi can represent the overseas members of the Democratic Socialist Party, Cui replied: "Wu Xianzi absolutely cannot represent the overseas members. Zhi Daming can only rely on the overseas members to make himself important. It has aroused the anger of the representatives of the overseas members."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A spokesman for the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee said: The amount of merchant tonnage that our country can receive as compensation is still under discussion in the Far East Commission because the tonnage of merchant ships that Japan can retain is still under discussion in the Far East Commission, so it has not been decided.

### Tianjin Circles Discuss Propositions on Trade with Japan, Advocate Prohibiting Imports of Textiles, and Demand Dismantling and Transporting Japanese Industrial Equipment as Compensation

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] After the government decided to open trade with Japan, all sectors of Tianjin have launched in-depth discussions. The Civil Governance Promotion Association, composed of famous figures from the cultural circles of Pingjin, invited the business community in Tianjin on the 9th to review the issue of trade with Japan. The heads of the Industrial Cooperation Association branch, the Import and Export Business Association, and the Textile Industry Association were invited to attend. Lu Yuwen, the business committee member of the Loan Committee who recently arrived in Tianjin, was also invited in his personal capacity. After President Zhang Bodai explained the significance of convening the meeting, Mr. Lu Yuwen spoke first, believing that from an economic point of view, trade with Japan should not be opened. However, from a political point of view, our country has no reason to continue to close its doors to Japan. What we should devote ourselves to at present is to prove to the world that once China is invaded, it will have a major impact on world security, in order to win international aid and develop our country's economy to achieve the goal of freedom and independence. After the resumption of trade with Japan, the biggest conflict of interest between China and Japan will be in the textile industry, because Japan's main exports are textiles, which will inevitably affect our textile industry. Therefore, when opening trade with Japan, it should not be allowed to import its textiles. Yang Yizhou, manager of Zhongfang Tianjin, emphasized that once China's textile industry is attacked, the entire national economy will not be able to develop. He advocated that trade with Japan should be carried out on a barter basis according to our country's needs. The chairman of the Tianjin Industrial Cooperation Association branch put forward his thorough proposition:

Chinese people have the right to demand the dismantling and transportation of Japanese factories for Chinese needs as compensation. Since Japan has surplus textile machines to export, how can we dismantle and transport its textile equipment? Since Japan needs China to supply sea salt, how can we dismantle and transport its alkali factories? Taking the alkali industry as an example, China's annual production before the war was 120,000 tons. At that time, Yongli's daily output was 200 tons. Now, due to the Japanese brutal use of the equipment for eight years, the daily output has been reduced to 80 tons, and there is a possibility of danger at any time. Once Yongli collapses, the entire national chemical industry will be in dire straits. In this situation, dismantling and transporting Japanese equipment is the best policy." Wang Ruiji, deputy manager of Zhongfang Tianjin, said that textiles account for 75 percent of Japan's export plan to our country, and this amount will directly manipulate the prosperity and decline of our national economy. Chen Yihou, chairman of the Bankers Association, said that before the war, Japanese yarn was dumped in China, which once made our country's cotton price higher than the yarn price. This past situation is thought-provoking. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to send a telegram to the central government, prohibiting the import of Japanese products that endanger our country's industry, and demanding the dismantling and transportation of Japanese factory equipment. Tianjin should have a considerable number of people on the business inspection delegation to Japan.

Japan Can Export a Total of 207 Kinds of Goods

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Marshal MacArthur announced today that when Japan's foreign trade resumes on August 15, the United States, Britain, and Canada can jointly send 137 traders to trade with Japan.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Miyamizu Changsaburo said that the preparations for the residence of foreign business representatives after the resumption of Japan's private international trade can be completed before the 15th. Trade Minister Nagai Kotaro declared in the parliament that Japan's free international trade will be restored after the signing of the peace treaty. After the restoration, Japan may still need to restrict the import of foreign goods. The Japanese government today notified importers and exporters that they are not allowed to enter into contracts privately without government permission.

As a result of the discussion, it was decided to send a telegram to the central government, prohibiting the import of Japanese products that endanger our country's industry, and demanding the dismantling and transporting of Japanese factory equipment. Tianjin should have a considerable number of people on the business inspection delegation to Japan.

### Soviet Union Continues to Occupy Dalian; US to Lodge Another Protest

[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The State Department is deeply angered by the Soviet Union's prohibition of American naval vessels from entering Dalian and is currently considering lodging another written protest with Moscow. (Note: The first note was submitted on January 6th of this year).

Disregarding the Sino-Soviet Treaty's stipulation that China should regain sovereignty and despite objections from both China and the United States, the Soviet Union continues to occupy Dalian for two years. In the notes delivered to Moscow and Nanjing in mid-January, the United States pointed out that "there is no reason why Dalian cannot be immediately placed under Chinese administration and open to international trade." It also stated that the Soviet Union's continued occupation is an "abnormal situation" and demanded that Americans should be able to visit or reside in Dalian.

The second protest will be of the same nature but worded more strongly.

The Chinese government has also lodged a strong protest with the Soviet Union, demanding the establishment of a Chinese administrative organ in Dalian. The Soviet Union replied that until a peace treaty with Japan is concluded, the state of war with Japan has not ended and therefore must continue to be under Soviet surveillance. The State Department revealed that since March of this year, the Soviet authorities have notified the U.S. that Dalian is a closed port under military control, refusing regular visits to the port by unarmed American ships. American diplomatic mail and supplies are delivered to U.S. Consul General Benninghoff by Soviet ships. To date, the Consul can still communicate with U.S. authorities by telegram, but it must also go through the Soviets.

### Outer Mongolia Issues Communiqué

Claims Chinese Troops Invaded Mongolian Territory

[Associated Press, Moscow, 9th] TASS quoted a communiqué issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia, stating that this year Chinese troops have invaded the territory of the Mongolian Republic seven times, five of which occurred in June and July, with each incursion involving approximately 500 people. It also stated that the Chinese government never takes steps to stop such incidents. Regarding the border issue, the Mongolian government can use maps to prove that the Mongolian border is demarcated along the peaks of the Bitik Bogdo mountain range, which is the point of contention with the Chinese government.

### Special Envoy Group Studies Northern Data; Wedemeyer Avoids Meeting with Sun Fo; Lengthy Two-Hour Discussion Covered a Wide Range of Topics

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The U.S. Embassy announced that on the 9th, Wedemeyer only received one Chinese guest, Xi Enshui, the Chief of Transportation of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, and made one visit, meeting with Vice President Sun Fo at his Wuyi Road residence. In addition to discussions with American officials at the embassy in the morning, the rest of his time was spent at Ambassador Stuart's residence, studying the data obtained from North and Northeast China and the documents received during his absence from Nanjing. This study will occupy most of the attention of the entire mission until at least the 10th. According to current plans, the mission will depart on the 11th for trips to Taiwan and Guangzhou.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Wedemeyer received General Xi Enshui, his West Point classmate, at around 9 AM on the 9th for about an hour. According to Xi, he later said that it was just a friendly meeting. After Xi left, Wedemeyer, accompanied by translator Captain Wu Hanmin, visited Vice President Sun Fo for the first time, having a long talk of about two hours, which reportedly covered a wide range of topics.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] General Wedemeyer and his entire team were very busy on the 9th, sorting through a large amount of data and documents brought back from North and Northeast China. All items had to be opened, their nature examined, and categorized and summarized for registration. According to a member of the mission who spoke with reporters, a large portion of the letters from the Northeast and North China were written by homeless refugees, some of whom were illiterate and had asked others to write on their behalf. The mission was deeply impressed by the vast and untapped potential of the Fushun mines. It is estimated that if given ten years, it will surpass Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, the team also discovered some real difficulties and generally poor conditions and has paid attention to the contradictory situation in the Northeast. The data obtained by the mission in China will be systematically organized in Nanjing and Washington. Both locations have excellent translators. It is expected that they will return to the U.S. ten days after leaving China, and this work can be completed en route via Hawaii. The mission's achievements in China have reached the peak of what they could achieve, and the results are quite satisfactory.

[United Press International, Nanjing, 9th] The Wedemeyer Special Envoy Mission will depart for Taiwan on Monday to investigate the situation there, as reports indicate that China's takeover of Taiwan from Japan after the victory has led to a significant reduction in economic efficiency due to mismanagement. Reliable sources told UPI that Wedemeyer was deeply impressed by the deteriorating conditions of the four years of war, economic collapse, transportation breakdown, and factories stripped bare by the Soviet Union.

All strongholds along the Yellow River are now under the control of the National Army, and it is impossible for Liu's bandits to flee north.

[Another dispatch] The great annihilation war against the remaining 40,000-plus communist bandits in western Shandong is in full swing. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's five columns previously attempted to cross the Yellow River north through Lukou, Linpuji, and Youcheng, but were severely attacked by the National Army, and they fled back south. They are now surrounded separately by the National Army near Yuncheng, northeast of Juye city, west of the city, and south of Juye, and are being annihilated. The communist bandits in western Shandong have become turtles in a jar. The National Army is flexibly using tactics of interception, pursuit, and encirclement to annihilate them within the encirclement. The complete annihilation of the communist bandits is only a matter of time.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 9th] The remaining six columns of communist bandits in central Shandong suffered losses of up to 60,000 in the battles of Nanma and Linqu.

### Water Recedes Slightly in Northern Jiangsu Disaster Area; Epidemics Break Out in Rural Areas of Pixiao and Other Counties; Various Circles in the Provincial Capital Send Telegrams Requesting Repair of the Shu and Yi Rivers

[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] In the flooded areas of Northern Jiangsu's Xuhai Huai, the accumulated water only began to recede after more than twenty days. In addition, the weather in the disaster area is unpredictable, with sudden cold and heat. In various villages in Pixiao and other counties, diseases are rampant among the disaster victims, with a large number suffering from typhoid fever and dysentery. The authorities are planning to rush medical personnel to provide aid. Furthermore, fellow villagers from Jiangsu Province residing in various places in Beijing and Shanghai, recognizing the severity of the disaster situation in their hometowns and the dire need for assistance among the disaster victims, have been sending telegrams to party, government, and public opinion organs daily, urging emergency relief for the flood disaster and offering the authorities methods for preventing the Yellow River and controlling the Huai River, hoping to implement both temporary and permanent measures to permanently eliminate flood disasters.

[Another dispatch] Leaders from various circles in Jiangsu Province believe that the downstream siltation of the Yi and Shu Rivers has been blocking and hindering drainage, causing harm to Xuhai for a long time. In order to seek fundamental prevention and control measures, they recently sent telegrams to the Ministry of Water Resources and the Huai River Guidance Committee, requesting the establishment of a Xuhai Yongli institution to comprehensively manage the water conservancy of the Shu and Yi Rivers to prevent future disasters. In addition, the Grand Canal Embankment Restoration Engineering Bureau has dispatched engineer Wang Zuelie to conduct on-site surveys and collect data to study a fundamental plan for the comprehensive study of the Xuzhou, Huai, and Hai River floods.

[This newspaper, Taixian, 9th] The floods between the Huai and Hai Rivers have attracted the attention of people in Taixian, Dongtai, and Taixing. Although there is currently no danger in the Huainan Canal, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is rising daily, which will affect the flow of the canal into the Yangtze River in the future. To prevent problems before they occur, some people advocate that the gates of the canal leading to the Yangtze River should be opened first to free up the capacity of Hongze Lake and provide a regulating effect.

[This newspaper, Bengbu, 9th] Here, the Huai River has risen again to 17.4 meters. However, the embankments of the Huai River are strong, and if there are no changes in the future, it will not suffer from flooding again.

Simplification of Provincial and County Organizations and Personnel

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 9th] Chairman Shen, after returning to Hangzhou, has been slightly ill for several days. Today, at 7 PM, he received reporters despite his illness and answered various questions: (1) The division of powers between the central and local authorities has been decided to strengthen and increase the powers of the provincial and county local organizations. (2) Simplify the provincial and county organizations and personnel. The provincial level will be decided by the central government, and the county level will be decided by the provincial government.

(4) Local security will continue to be tightened in accordance with the plans of the Pacification Conference to thoroughly suppress the communist bandits within the territory. It is not true that a garrison headquarters will be established, but the Security Commander can lift martial law when necessary. (5) This major adjustment of county-level personnel is the result of multiple evaluations over the past year, aimed at improving local politics. It has now been completed, and there will be no more large-scale adjustments in the future.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] National Government decree of the 9th: Yu Zailin, Director of the Beipiao Coal Mine Works Department of the Resources Commission, studied coal washing and coking in his early years, with specialized skills and a widely acclaimed reputation. During the War of Resistance, he presided over coal mine coking production to supply the military needs of the rear, making significant contributions. In recent years, he has been in charge of the Beipiao Baking Mine and has devoted his efforts. Because of his dedication to duty and loyalty, he was killed by communist bandits. At a time when the industry needs talent, he was unable to fulfill his potential, which is truly regrettable. He should be commended by a clear decree, and the Executive Yuan should grant special preferential treatment to commend his achievements and comfort his loyal soul. This decree.

### Zhu Shaoliang Leaves Xikang for Yunnan; Various Circles in Ya'an Held a Grand Welcome Meeting; Zhu Praised the Achievements of Xikang's Construction

[This newspaper, Ya'an, 8th] Today, various circles of the party, government, army, and people in Xikang held a grand welcome meeting in Ya'an to welcome Director Zhu Shaoliang of the Chongqing Executive Headquarters to inspect Xikang. Director Zhu said in his speech: (1) Chairman Chiang is unable to come to Xikang due to the complexity of national affairs and instructed me to come here to express my condolences to the elders of Xikang. (2) Since the victory, the government and the people have been eager for stability, but the Communist Party has disregarded public opinion, undermined unity, and plunged the people into deep suffering. The central government launched the suppression of the rebellion with unavoidable difficulties, and I hope that the compatriots in the southwest will make more contributions. (3) The Communist Party is intent on destruction, causing the nation's economy, construction, transportation, etc., to be unable to achieve the ideal, and the central government has made decisions on this matter to stabilize the economy and promote construction in order to achieve stability. (4) Xikang has made many contributions during the war. Since Chairman Liu took charge of Xikang, he has overcome all difficulties, and it is not easy for a poor border province to achieve such results. This is the result of the integration of the people and the government. Furthermore, Chairman Liu's management of Xikang's administration and his plans for Tibet are unique and are in line with Chairman Chiang's nation-building plan. I hope that the compatriots in Kang Province will work harder under the leadership of Chairman Liu.

[This newspaper, Ya'an, 9th] Director Zhu Shaoliang has completed a stage of his inspection in Xikang. Today at 7 AM, he led his entourage from Ya'an to Leshan, Yibin, Luxian, and other places to inspect the Kunming and Guiyang areas. Before his departure, Zhu said that he had been in charge of the northwest border administration for many years and was very clear about all the special and difficult situations in the border provinces. The difficulty of governing them cannot be compared to the interior provinces. Therefore, the observation of the border provinces cannot be viewed from the perspective of the prosperity of the major cities in Beijing and Shanghai. The establishment of Xikang Province in these short eight years has seen the construction of highways, the establishment of factories, the development of industry and mining, and other modern constructions, which is truly not easy. Furthermore, Xikang is quiet and safe during the recent student and rice riots, which also shows the result of the integration of the people and the government, which is especially commendable.

### Kawashima Yoshiko Retracts Confession; Hebei High Court Held Investigative Hearing Yesterday; Kawashima Stubbornly Denies Evidence

[This newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The Hebei High Court held a hearing on the afternoon of the 8th to investigate the crimes of international female spy Kawashima Yoshiko. Kawashima wore prison clothes and was fatter than before. Due to dental problems, her speech was unclear. She completely overturned her previous confession at the Military Intelligence Bureau. Regarding being called Commander Jin, she explained that she received enemy bushido training since she was young. Because her father was a commander, people called her Little Commander, which made her feel very happy. This was misreported until now. The court presented her with a photo of her wearing a general's uniform and asked what it meant. She replied that she wore it for fun. The so-called promotion to general in Showa 15 of Japan did not happen, and she denied having served as the female officer of the Empress of Manchukuo and the supervisor of students studying in Japan, saying that there was no such official system. She admitted to knowing Tada Shun and Matsuoka Yosuke because the two were friends of Kawashima Naniwa. The wife of Kawashima Naniwa was related to the Japanese Empress, and Naniwa and Prince Su were sworn brothers, so she recognized Naniwa as her adoptive father. Naniwa had served as an advisor to the Qing Dynasty. The name Jin Bihui was given by the Manchukuo royal family. When asked about her rank with Puyi, she did not answer, only saying that when Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands to China at the age of sixteen, Jin was scolded by aristocratic classmates as not being Japanese, so she returned to China in anger. Due to hardship in life, she was taken to Changchun by her brother Jin Bidong. She replied that she did not know the details of the establishment of Manchukuo, saying that the outside world's reports were reporters' fabrications. When asked about going to Beijing to testify, she said that she was deceived by Director Zou, and all the confessions were written by Zou and she did not meet Takahashi. She also claimed that she loved the country the most and had rescued underground Jiang personnel. In short, for all unfavorable parts, she claimed ignorance and searched for all kinds of favorable parts.

Weekly Forum

### Upholding the Spirit of the Potsdam Declaration

— Fang Qiushi

From August 15, 1945, when Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered unconditionally, to August 15 of this year, exactly two years have passed. What is the essence of the Potsdam Declaration, and what is the spirit it embodies? What is its connection to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan? I would like to offer a simple analysis.

The Potsdam Declaration was a document issued on July 26, 1945, by the leaders of the United States, China, and Great Britain to Japan, urging its immediate unconditional surrender. The document listed thirteen articles. Articles one through five warned Japan to recognize the outcome of Germany's ineffective and senseless resistance (Germany surrendered unconditionally on May 7, 1945), accept the conditions, and not persist obstinately, thereby falling into a state of utter destruction. Articles six through thirteen contained the conditions, which were roughly as follows:

"6. We insist that the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated, for we hold that a new order of peace, security and justice is impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.

7. Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed, points in Japanese territory to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.

8. The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine. (Note: The Cairo Declaration of November 22, 1943, stated: The purpose of the three countries is to deprive Japan of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China. Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed.)

9. The Japanese military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.

10. We do not intend to enslave the Japanese as a race or to destroy them as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners.

The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.

11. Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Japan shall be permitted eventually to participate in world trade relations.

12. The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government.

13. We call upon the Government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction."

Initially, Japan, with a "better to be a shattered jewel than an intact tile" attitude, refused to accept the Potsdam Declaration, and prepared to negotiate a peaceful armistice through the "neutral" relationship with the Soviet Union. However, on August 5, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, demonstrating the Allied forces' ability to bring about "prompt and utter destruction" to Japan. Subsequently, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the United States dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki. In order to avoid the calamity of complete destruction, Japan had no choice but to surrender. On August 10, the Japanese government formally issued a surrender note, requesting the governments of Switzerland and Sweden to forward it to the United States, China, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union, accepting the terms listed in the Potsdam Declaration. However, it attached an understanding, stating: "The above declaration does not include any stipulations that would prejudice the prerogatives of His Majesty as Sovereign Ruler." On August 11, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes presented a reply from the four powers accepting Japan's surrender, agreeing to Japan's above-mentioned "understanding" while explaining: "From the moment of surrender the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers who will take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms. ... The ultimate form of government of Japan shall, in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, be determined by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people. The armed forces of the Allied Powers will remain in Japan until the purposes set forth in the Potsdam Declaration are achieved."

On August 15, the Emperor of Japan read the surrender rescript, and Prime Minister Suzuki also issued a statement accepting the Potsdam Declaration. This day marked the moment of Japan's surrender, and the thirteen articles of the Potsdam Declaration took effect from that moment.

No matter what kind of war it is, it cannot last forever; it must eventually return to a normal state of peace. The complete conquest of one belligerent party, or the cessation of military action by both belligerent parties, is only the end of fighting behavior on the battlefield. The true disappearance of the state of war and the restoration of normal peaceful relations depend on the conclusion of a peace treaty. A peace treaty is the necessary path to ending a war. For example, in the First World War, the Armistice Treaty was signed on November 11, 1918, and the fighting behavior between the Allied Powers and Germany ended, with no actual war existing. However, the state of war did not end until the Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 29, 1919.

Two years have passed since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration. The fighting behavior has ended, but the state of war between the belligerent parties still exists and awaits the conclusion of a peace treaty to finally restore normal peaceful relations. However, Japan's unconditional surrender is different from the armistice situation of Germany in the past. The Armistice Treaty of November 11, 1918, saw the German army lay down its weapons and cease fighting. The nature of the armistice treaty was similar to what is known in international law as a capitulation agreement, which is the surrender of armies, warships, fortresses, etc. The Potsdam Declaration, however, contains the conditions for peace between the belligerents, which are pre-announced to the enemy. If the enemy is willing to accept the terms of the declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, before the formal conclusion of a peace treaty, is what is known in international law as a preliminary peace treaty.

A preliminary peace treaty is itself a treaty that is binding on both parties and has gone through legitimate recognition procedures. Japan's surrender and acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, the exchange of documents, the issuance of statements, and the requested understanding, and the Allied Powers' acceptance of Japan's understanding, all went through legitimate recognition procedures by both parties. Japan accepted the terms listed in the Potsdam Declaration, with the understanding that "the above declaration does not include any stipulations that would prejudice the prerogatives of His Majesty as Sovereign Ruler," and Byrnes' statement that "the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers," can be regarded as reservations and declarations by both parties, and should be interpreted as additional articles to the preliminary peace treaty, which are equally binding on both parties and, like the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, form the basis for the conclusion of a formal peace treaty.

In practice, a preliminary peace treaty is often the basis for the conclusion of a formal peace treaty. Inevitably, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan must be based on the Potsdam Declaration, which cannot be changed or distorted in any way. Now, many people are discussing a peace treaty with Japan, and even legal circles in Japan are discussing a peace treaty, but everyone avoids talking about the essence and spirit of the sacred Potsdam Declaration, which is very inappropriate. I believe that the Potsdam Declaration is a preliminary peace treaty. This preliminary peace treaty was established on July 26, 1945, when the United States, China, and Great Britain announced it. On August 15, 1945, Japan recognized and accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and this preliminary peace treaty became effective.

The validity of the Potsdam Declaration is immutable. The spirit of Articles 6 to 13 should be fully incorporated into the future formal peace treaty, without any compromise. Originally "the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking upon world conquests" referred to the Emperor of Japan and the imperial power. The Allies accepted the existence of the "Emperor" but not the existence of the Emperor's power, because the power of supreme rule is the beginning of militarism and should not exist and must be permanently eliminated.

After the formal peace treaty is concluded, it does not mean that "the occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan immediately." First, "until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed," a period of control and surveillance is still needed. Second, it is possible to designate the occupation of Japanese territory, not the complete occupation of the entire country, just as after the peace treaty of the last war, the Allied forces were stationed on the banks of the Rhine River, "until the purposes set forth in the Potsdam Declaration are achieved." Third, "the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers" is a statement that exists following the Emperor's reservation. Naturally, this is the essence of the formal peace treaty, and the future Supreme Commander, whether it is a governor-general system or a collegial system of a management committee, should be discussed at the peace conference and listed as a formal clause in the peace treaty; otherwise, it will lose the spirit of the preliminary peace treaty and its additional articles.

In conclusion, the Potsdam Declaration is immutable. It is hoped that the Allied Powers will deeply study the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration as the basis for a formal peace treaty.

### Indonesia and the Netherlands Blame Each Other for Violating the Ceasefire Order. The Java War Turns Fierce. Indonesia Threatens to Re-adopt the Scorched Earth Policy

[United Press, Batavia, 9th] Indonesian and Dutch reports on the 9th stated: The most fierce war since the ceasefire has occurred between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Netherlands accused 300 Indonesian soldiers of attacking Dagaki near Surabaya within the ceasefire zone. Another group of Indonesian troops attacked Kongba near Sambo. Indonesian reports accused Dutch troops of occupying Tobocha in East Java on the 8th. It is claimed that Dutch troops retreated after killing a few Indonesian soldiers. The Indonesian side has warned that they will resume the scorched earth policy unless the Dutch offensive stops. The Dutch reports said that Indonesian troops are still looting and burning. It is claimed that Jiabanjiaxi village, 40 miles south of Miannan, was destroyed by Indonesian troops, and several villages and towns on Sumatra Island were also looted.

[Reuters, Batavia, 9th] After consultation with the Indian government and the interim government of Pakistan, the Indian military headquarters in New Delhi has ordered a ban on the shipment of all military supplies and equipment originally scheduled to be transferred to the Netherlands from Indian ports.

[United Press, New York, 8th] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Shari arrived here on the evening of the 8th. In addition to claiming that "this trip is to present Indonesia's case to the United Nations," Shari refused to make further comments.

[United Press, Jiayi, 9th] Indonesian President Sukarno made a brief stop here today and issued a written statement to reporters, calling on the American people to support Indonesia's demand for the withdrawal of Dutch troops. It is claimed that the Dutch troops were equipped by the Allies for the war against Japan, not to engage in a full-scale colonial war against Indonesia. If full assurances can be given that Indonesia's freedom already obtained will not be deprived, the Indonesian government is still willing to cooperate with all countries, including the Netherlands.

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 8th] Philippine representative to the United Nations, Romulo, said that he would re-apply to participate in the Security Council's debate on the Indonesian issue. His request had been rejected. He has asked the Security Council to reconsider its decision, because he "believes that the developments in the Indonesian situation have a great impact on the Philippines."

### Indonesian Prime Minister Calls for an End to the Mistreatment of Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 8th] Indonesian Prime Minister Shari Futing recently called on his people not to mistreat overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Acts of massacre and destruction violate the policies of the Indonesian government and must not happen again. Shari mentioned that some overseas Chinese had been used by the Dutch, but he strongly condemned all actions that harmed the entire overseas Chinese community in retaliation for the actions of a few.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 8th] The Batavia Chinese General Association today appealed to Xia Jinlin, the representative of the United Nations, stating that no matter what steps the Security Council takes, it must ensure the safety of the lives of minorities. We can no longer trust the promises and guarantees made by the Republican government, so we can only appeal to the Security Council in the name of humanity and justice. Please take the protection of overseas Chinese as the first prerequisite when resolving the Indonesian issue.

### British Economic Bill to be Debated for the Third Reading on Monday

Can Become Law Before Parliament Adjourns

[Reuters, London, 8th] The British Labor government has achieved victory in the first stage of its struggle to implement emergency measures to overcome the economic crisis. The Labor government today secured the passage of its emergency program in the House of Commons' second reading process by a majority of 102 votes. Labor official Blackman, representative of the Birmingham Norden district, a center of the automobile manufacturing industry, voted against it along with the Conservatives, Liberals, and Liberal National Party. Although the government only obtained 251 votes, almost all Labor MPs present in the House of Commons voted in favor. As today is Friday, and fewer MPs are present according to custom, the government could have obtained a majority of 200 votes, but only obtained a majority of 102 votes. The Conservatives will attack the bill next Monday, and the government will then request a third reading debate, so that the bill can be passed by the House of Lords and become law before Parliament adjourns on Wednesday. The Labor MPs are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss the bill. After the meeting, Blackman, who participated in the opposition party's vote against the bill today, may be subjected to disciplinary action according to party rules.

### Britain and the Soviet Union Agree to Resume Trade Negotiations

[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources here say: Both the British and Soviet governments have begun to act to resume trade negotiations that have recently reached a stalemate. British chief negotiator Wilson, Minister for Overseas Trade, said that Britain has taken the initiative to resume negotiations. He denied that Britain was forced by pressure from the United States to refuse negotiations with the Soviet Union. Although both Britain and the Soviet Union have expressed their willingness to continue negotiations, the date of resumption has not yet been decided.

### Amid the Increasingly Urgent Economic Crisis, a Reshuffle of the British Cabinet is Possible. Attlee will Still Serve as Prime Minister and Will Not Change.

[Reuters, London, 9th] British political figures here expect that the British cabinet may be fully reshuffled in the coming days to strengthen the leadership of Britain's struggle against economic collapse. With the exception of Prime Minister Attlee's position, which seems unlikely to change, it is rumored that Foreign Minister Bevin will be responsible for Britain's industrial and human resources situation. Because Bevin has close relations with the industrial class and served as Minister of Labor during the war, he is the most ideal person to deal with the current crisis. However, on the other hand, it is said that Bevin would never transfer to another position unless he was willing. He himself would like to continue to serve in the Foreign Office, at least until the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference ends in November. As for the rumors that Bevin will be transferred to become Chancellor of the Exchequer, opinions are still divided. Although Bevin did serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer briefly at the beginning of the Labor Party's administration, it only lasted for twelve hours. As for Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, he has long had the intention of becoming Foreign Minister, so if Bevin is willing to give up the position of Foreign Minister, the exchange of positions between the two is very likely. But the position of Minister of Production is still undecided. The most likely candidate for this position is the current Minister of Trade Cripps. Some Labor Party figures have pointed out today that the austerity measures demanded by the Conservative Party today are exactly what Cripps tried to promote a year ago, which the Conservative Party criticized. Therefore, Cripps' position today is less vulnerable to attack than any other cabinet member, so the leader of the anti-crisis battle may be none other than Cripps.

### In Opposition to the British Government's Profit Tax, American Films Stop Entering. British Cinemas are Forced to Close

[United Press, New York, 8th] The American Film Export Association decided today to immediately stop shipping films, both short and long, to Great Britain. This resolution was caused by British Chancellor Dalton's announcement that American films shown in Britain would be subject to a 75 percent tax on profits. American films generate profits of between 50 million and 70 million U.S. dollars annually in Britain. According to Association President Johnston, the resumption date after the suspension has not been determined. At the same time, according to a London dispatch, Fowler, Secretary-General of the British Film Institute, claimed that if American film producers decide to stop exporting, a total of 4,500 cinemas across Britain will be forced to close within a year, and British film producers will also be unable to screen domestic films. Currently, Britain produces about 45 films annually, accounting for about 10 percent of the total number of films screened and 20 percent of the total time. American films account for about 405 films screened in Britain, accounting for 80 percent of the total time.

[United Press, London, 9th] Curtin, a representative of Universal Pictures, stated at a press conference here today that the heavy tax imposed by Britain on films imported from the United States has sown the seeds of discord between Britain and the United States.

### Indian Ambassador Visits Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister

[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mrs. Pandit, visited the Soviet Foreign Ministry this afternoon and was received by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky for a sincere talk.

### American Public and Private Institutions Concentrate Their Efforts to Review the Marshall Plan. Sixteen European Countries Will Submit Proposals to the United States

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Due to the proposals to be submitted by sixteen European countries, the American Marshall Aid Plan, the government and private organizations here are rushing to prepare technically so that they can take action quickly. Some Latin American countries with US dollar exchange crises hope that the consequences of the aid zone will produce a "small-scale Marshall Aid Plan" that can be applied to Pan-American countries. The diplomatic community's attention to economic issues at the Bogota Conference in January clearly exceeds the security issues to be discussed at the upcoming meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The needs for reconstruction in Japan, the Philippines, and other Far Eastern countries are still enormous. As a result, the experts studying this issue must keep in mind at the same time countries that are not within the scope of the Marshall Plan as well as Western European countries when drafting this plan. The basic reasons for this situation are as follows: (1) American production, in terms of steel and industrial products, is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of the whole world. (2) Appropriations from the US Congress can only provide financial assistance. Since various types of non-financial problems are involved in the reconstruction issue, it will be insufficient to solve the problem of Western Europe. (3) There is no consensus among the countries discussing the Marshall Plan on the extent to which German industrial reconstruction should be encouraged. American experts studying the Marshall Plan may also have the following basic issues to be resolved when the plans submitted by the European countries are submitted to the United States: (1) To what extent are European countries prepared to utilize their resources, for example, coal mining. (2) To what extent will American economic aid to Western European countries not lead to new problems in the United States and the world outside of parts of Europe. (3) To what extent will the US Congress and domestic public opinion allow aid to Europe.

### Major General Brown Issues a Statement Explaining the Anti-Trusteeship Movement in Korea

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 9th] The opinions submitted by the "Countermeasures Committee for the Provisional Government" organized by five groups in Korea to Major General Brown have aroused fierce debates among the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union in the Joint Committee. Major General Brown issued a special statement today explaining this matter again, stating that the Soviet representative argued that any group that does not support the Moscow Declaration should not participate in the agreement.

However, in the exchange of letters between the commanders of the US and Soviet garrison troops in North and South Korea on December 24, 1942, the United States modified the issue of whether to exclude anti-trusteeship groups. At that time, the Soviet side accepted this principle before the agreement began. Also, in the agreement between Foreign Minister Marshall and Molotov, there was no objection to this. The Korean people are eagerly awaiting the early realization of independence. After suffering 40 years of rule, they are naturally worried about the re-infringement of their national sovereignty. The Soviet side intends to completely deny this point, and believes that the Korean people's anti-trusteeship is opposition to the Moscow resolution. In fact, the Soviet side has repeatedly encouraged the Korean people's patriotic movement. When the Korean people expressed their patriotic intentions, they advocated canceling their qualifications for negotiating to establish a provisional government. The Moscow Resolution entrusts Korea to the trusteeship of the four countries. However, the Korean people are worried whether this kind of politics is the trusteeship that Japan once implemented on Korea. This is also a normal human feeling. The United States has always been concerned about the Korean people, wanting to complete the task of establishing an independent government that the Korean people desire. I hope that the Korean people and all countries in the world understand this claim of the American representative.

### Unlawful American Soldiers Stationed in Japan Sentenced to Death by Hanging

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Eighth US Army's Foreign Affairs Bureau announced: On October 13 last year, Private First Class Hughes of the Eighth US Army broke into the residence of Japanese Asanuma in Yokohama City and committed violence against Asanuma's wife and daughter. After the Eighth Army's military court completed the trial, he was sentenced to death by hanging.

### The Athens Monetary Market Reflects Changes in the Situation

[United Press, Athens, 8th] The price of gold here soared today. The Athens monetary market has always been a barometer of politics. Observers predict that if the Communist Party attempts to establish an independent state in the north, civil unrest may develop into war.

### Seemingly a Detective Novel: Using Ultraviolet Light to Identify Bloodstains; Truth Revealed in Yu Shengxiao Case; Soil Sample from Marais's Boots Matches Blood-Stained Location; Chali to Be Remanded Tomorrow on Charges of Robbery and Murder

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of the Westerner Chali shooting and killing black market gold dealer Yu Shengxiao, yesterday, the police bureau adopted scientific investigation methods and collected various pieces of evidence, leaving the cunning criminal speechless. The truth of the entire case has now been revealed. The twists and turns of the process and the complexity of the case are comparable to a Sherlock Holmes detective story.

The success of this case is due to the meticulous investigation. For example, using ultraviolet light to detect bloodstains that had seeped into the leather seats of the car, and using chemical analysis to prove that the bloodstains left on the socks of the murderer, Marais, were of the same blood type. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the yellow soil accumulated on Marais's leather shoes was the same as the soil composition at the scene of the incident. Based on the above evidence, Chali was unable to argue any further and revealed the details of what had happened.

The deceased, Yu Shengxiao, a native of Ningbo, was 31 years old. He started his business by setting up a stall selling American goods in front of the Fada Western Clothing Store at 451 Sichuan Road. After accumulating some savings, he switched to trading black market gold and foreign currency, through which he met the "scalper," Englishman Chali. On the morning of August 1st, an American military officer named Marais contacted Chali to purchase five gold bars, agreeing on a price of $585 USD per bar, with delivery scheduled for 3:00 PM that afternoon. Chali, claiming to have no inventory, consulted with Yu, and they quickly reached an agreement to meet at the Fada Western Clothing Store. Yu arrived punctually at 1:00 PM but waited until after 3:00 PM without seeing Chali. Yu told people in the store that if the deal went through, he could make a profit of two million yuan. He also expressed concern that Chali's delay might mean the deal would fall through. People in the store saw him showing the five gold bars to others, with an anxious expression on his face. While they were talking, Chali suddenly arrived, circled outside the door, and whistled as a signal. Yu heard the sound and rushed out. After a brief conversation on the roadside, Yu returned to the Western Clothing Store, as Chali had rescheduled the meeting for 5:00 PM that afternoon. When the time came, Yu left the store without informing anyone and disappeared.

Villagers Witness the Murder

Around 6:00 PM, a shooting was reported in Wujiaxiang, Qinghu Highway. The victim turned out to be Yu Shengxiao. Initially, Zhu Yifang and Sun Bing, villagers residing in the Second Jia of the Seventh Bao in Wujiaxiang, were chatting while enjoying the cool air at the border of Qingpu and Shanghai. They were surprised by the sudden sound of a car speeding from the east. Just two minutes later, they saw a car speeding away in the same direction. They witnessed the driver as a robust Westerner with a small mustache. Another Westerner was in the car, seemingly wiping something. By chance, Zhu's wife passed by the scene of the incident and saw an injured person lying in a pool of blood by the roadside. She initially assumed the person had been injured by a car, but upon approaching and inquiring, the injured person said he had been shot. She rushed to tell her husband, and together they reported the incident to the Self-Defense Corps of nearby Qibao Town. When Jiang Zhigen, the leader of the First Squad, arrived to investigate, the injured person was barely breathing and only managed to say his name was Yu Shengxiao, residing at 623 Tiantong Road, and that the shooter was an Englishman named Chali. He then lost consciousness and died en route to the Red Cross Hospital.

Twelve Hours of Exhaustive Interrogation

That evening, the municipal police... Initially, they learned from Yu's wife, Yu Lu, that Chali was a "scalper" dealing in black market gold in the Central Road area but did not know his address. After inquiring with colleagues, they only knew that Chali had an Italian friend who knew his address. The police then checked the address of the friend at the Household Registration Department and, with his cooperation, apprehended Chali at the entrance of 16, Lane 186, South Shaanxi Road the next afternoon at 6:00 PM. When Chali was first arrested, he was sharp-tongued and deceitful, due to his past experience as a patrolman in the Shanghai Municipal Council, and vehemently denied the charges. However, after the police summoned people from the Fada Western Clothing Store to identify him, and on the morning of the 3rd, took Chali to the scene of the incident, where the two villagers who had witnessed the event confirmed that Chali was the driver, the police realized that the case was on the right track and began using "exhaustive interrogation" tactics, lasting twelve hours. During the repeated interrogations, Chali inadvertently revealed that the person who killed Yu Shengxiao was an American military officer named Marais, a sergeant at the Army Hospital in the Broadway Mansions. He also claimed that the car was borrowed from another friend. Upon receiving this information, the police immediately notified the Criminal Investigation Department of the U.S. Military Police Headquarters, who detained Marais. Meanwhile, officers were dispatched to Broadway Mansions, where they found a pair of pants and socks stained with blood in Marais's room. They also found a layer of yellow mud on his leather shoes, which, after comparing it with the soil at the scene of the incident, was found to be identical in composition. At this point, the U.S. military requested the police to escort Chali to the U.S. Military Police Headquarters for a face-to-face identification. Chali's Russian wife also went for questioning. The U.S. military specially selected over ten people who resembled Marais and lined them up for Chali and his wife to identify. They correctly identified Marais, providing further proof that the two were accomplices. Furthermore, Chali's wife admitted that Marais had visited their home one evening and washed his hands in the bathroom.

Origin of the Car

Chali further confessed to the police that the car they used was borrowed from his Russian friend, Pavelov, who resided at the Cathay Hotel, and the license plate number was 53922. The police then summoned Pavelov, who stated that Chali had come to his residence one afternoon at 4:00 PM, saying he was going on a long trip and wanted to borrow the car. He agreed. Chali returned at 8:00 PM, with another person in the car. They rested at the Cathay for a long time. Around 10:00 PM, Chali asked Pavelov to drive them. They first dropped off Marais at Broadway Mansions, then Chali back at South Shaanxi Road.

Upon receiving this information, the U.S. military police again requested the police to invite Pavelov to identify him, using the same method as before. He was immediately picked out from over ten people.

At the same time, the police impounded the car for detailed inspection. The brown leather seat cushion resembled bloodstains and could not be detected by the naked eye. However, using ultraviolet light, the location of the bloodstains was identified, and chemical analysis was used to compare them with the bloodstains on the socks, confirming that they were of the same blood type.

The Conspiracy

At this point, Chali could no longer deny the charges and confessed to the conspiracy with Marais, stating that he met Marais one morning and they wanted to buy five gold bars, and agreed with Yu Shengxiao to deliver the goods at 5 o'clock. Marais instructed him to borrow a car to Hongqiao Airport. At that time, Yu Shengxiao and Marais were sitting in the car. He drove to Wujiaxiang, when a gunshot was suddenly heard. Marais shouted "STOP" immediately. After applying the brakes. Marais opened the car door and kicked the injured Yu Shengxiao out of the car and onto the road. At this point, Marais ordered him to turn around and flee eastward. After driving into Shanghai city, he first went to Marais' residence for a short rest. After Marais washed his hands, they went to the Cathay Hotel together, it was eight o'clock.

The police investigation revealed the truth, and it was decided that Chali would be transferred to the local court tomorrow on suspicion of "robbery and murder". The officers involved in the investigation of this case, including Detective Chief, Chief Tao Rong of the Foreign Affairs Section, Section Member Xu Guoji, and officers Chen Shukan, Zhang Jinkui, and Police Officer Chen Yongzhong, spent eight days investigating and solving the case, which was reportedly praised by the authorities.

The car Yu Shengxiao was riding in when he was murdered was driven back to the scene to re-enact the crime. Bloodstained pants and socks and yellow soil-covered leather shoes found at Marais's residence.

### Huan Lin, on the Verge of Death, Explained; More Than Twenty People Killed Him; Zheng Xikang Suspected of Perjury and Ordered to Be Detained

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Qiu Tonghuan, an inspector at the Gaoshiman Dance Hall, being hacked to death in front of the Atlantic Vegetable Society on the evening of June 1, involved fourteen suspects, including Xiang Yinquan, who were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office on charges of murder. The case was heard for the first time in the Criminal Court No. 9 of the District Court yesterday by Judge Cao Zuwei. The witnesses summoned were Zheng Xikang, a tea server at the Zhonghua New Hotel, Yan Hongsheng, a bookkeeper at the Jincheng Guide Agency, Pan Xingrong, a tourist, Fan Jinrong, Lu Kanlin, a tea server at the Central Vegetable Society, and Qiu Chen Aizhu, the wife of the deceased. Yan pointed out in court that Sheng Shugen and Bao Yongfa had gone to Mao Qingyun's room at the Zhonghua New Hotel on June 1st. Zheng's testimony differed from his statement to the police, raising suspicions of perjury, and the court ordered him to be detained. Qiu Chen stated, "Qiu told me before he died that the people who killed him were Sheng Shugen, Feng Renyi (at large), Bao Yongfa, Chuan Qifu, Ma Caide, and over twenty others." The defendants were then questioned individually.

Xiang Yinquan

Claimed, "I am originally a rickshaw puller. On May 30th, Xiao Laili asked me to help with a fight. We gathered in Room 16 of the Zhongjun New Hotel for three days. As a result, on June 1st, I was waiting at the Atlantic Vegetable Society. Before I could go up and fight, I was shot and injured. Mao Qingyun helped me into a rickshaw to seek treatment at the Sino-American Hospital."

Sheng Shugen

Claimed, "I run a soy sauce business and received secondary education. People say I have a position among the gangsters, which is completely wrong. My family used to be well-off, but recently my business has failed, and it is difficult to maintain my family's livelihood.

Mao Qingyun

Claimed, "Bai Dianli asked me to open a room in the Zhonghua New Hotel for backup. Later, I found out it was for a fight. Bai told me that there were also many people on the other side, but he told me not to be afraid, saying that he had called two strongmen. We waited for Qiu for three days, and I went every day. I didn't bring a knife, only two wooden sticks and a few iron bars. On the day of the fight, I was acting as a lookout at the entrance of the Steel Pen Company. Later, I saw Xiang was injured and helped him into a rickshaw."

### On the Verge of Death, He Still Spoke Absurdly; Su Chengde Executed by Firing Squad; Martyr Zhang Can Finally Rest in Peace

[Report from Our Newspaper] The traitor Su Chengde, the deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, was sentenced to death by the High Court on August 28 last year. Yesterday afternoon at about 12:00 PM, he was executed by firing squad in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, becoming the fourth person to be executed in a traitor case in this city. Zhang Xiaotong, a member of the former municipal party committee, was arrested and refused to yield, and was eventually strangled to death by Su's men. Now that Su has been brought to justice, Martyr Zhang's spirit can finally rest in peace.

At 11:40 AM yesterday afternoon, Yang Shouchang, the prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, and Xu Chongwen, the warden, ascended to the first courtroom of the Special Criminal Court and ordered Su to be brought to court. Su was bald, burly, wearing a beige khaki Hong Kong shirt and shorts, white openwork short socks, and openwork light yellow leather shoes. Knowing that his death was imminent, his face was pale. However, he tried to remain calm, biting his lower lip, and sweat beads oozed from his forehead. As soon as he entered the court, he said in a sarcastic tone, "I only see darkness in front of me, please turn on the lights." At that time, the sunlight was strong and dazzling, and the prosecutor, knowing his sarcasm, ignored him. He then stated, "I am 47 years old, from Jining, Shandong, residing at 514 Haig Road, and I was the former director of the Puppet Shanghai Rural Affairs Bureau and the deputy director of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau," etc.

Unrepentant Until Death

The prosecutor then asked, "Did you receive the ruling from the Supreme Court rejecting the appeal?" He replied, "I received it two hours ago." The prosecutor asked, "Do you know that the court is ordered to execute you today?" He replied, "I only know because you told me." The prosecutor asked, "Do you have any last words?" He replied, "Losing my integrity and siding with the enemy was for the people in the occupied areas, and I have no regrets in my heart. What I regret is that I didn't blacken my conscience in the beginning, which has led to the current financial difficulties for my family. If I had known this, I would have blackened my heart earlier." The court, seeing that he had no last words, ordered the execution. Su requested that the handcuffs be loosened, saying, "I am a Christian and want to say a prayer before I die." He then made a "cross" on his chest and muttered words.

Execution by Firing Squad

After the prayer, he was handcuffed again. He requested to have the handcuffs removed, but it was not approved. The bailiff then escorted Su to the execution ground of the Shanghai Prison and sat him on a wooden chair with his neck placed. Bailiff Weng Yunquan used a box cannon and fired a shot at the back of his head. With a bang, the bullet entered from the left brain and exited from the nose. Su fell to the ground with the sound, bleeding profusely, his eyes open, seemingly unable to close them. At 2:00 PM, his wife, Su Xia, arrived and transported the body to the China Funeral Parlor for burial.

### Ambassador Davis Praises Jinan City Highly

### Night Visit to Ambassador Stuart

[Special Correspondent Litian, Jinan, 5th] U.S. Ambassador Stuart and Canadian Ambassador Davis, along with their staff and secretaries, visited Jinan on the 4th of this month. Although they only stayed in Jinan for two days, they brought the warmest friendship to every person in Jinan and left the deepest impression. In Jinan, Ambassador Stuart delivered speeches twice at banquets, once at a symposium, gave a talk to the Jinan press, gave two public lectures to all sectors of Jinan, and had a long and private conversation with our newspaper reporter in his busy schedule. In many talks, Stuart's view on China's national affairs is this:

A large population, a long history, and endowed with unique (heavenly) conditions and abundant products (geographical advantages) are the most favorable conditions for building a strong country, and China already possesses these many conditions. Even from a historical perspective: some ancient civilizations have mostly moved towards death, while China has a unique character and stands unscathed. At the same time, according to the world's rise and fall route, from the Near East to Western Europe to the United States and so on, China will also reach a stage of prosperity. Looking at the current world environment, the East also needs a strong country to lay the foundation for lasting peace, so from all aspects, China is hopeful.

The only difficulty China currently encounters is "personnel." China has no foreign troubles at present, and even if there are, they are relatively small. The problem is entirely "internal worries," that is, what is called only heavenly conditions and geographical advantages but lacking harmony among people. Today, China has begun to implement constitutional government, which is also the most important year in Chinese history. Last year the government formulated the constitution, and this year the constitution is being implemented. In this stage, young people have the best opportunity to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. In a democratic system, people not only have rights but also responsibilities. Democracy is different from autocracy. An autocratic regime does not allow people the freedom to organize and express their opinions.

### Special Note on Welcoming the Ambassadors: Wang Yaowu Sits in a Jeep and Bumps All the Way to Jinan

As soon as Chairman Wang Yaowu heard that the American and Canadian ambassadors had arrived in Jinan, he specially took a Jeep from the Feng'an Command Post, more than fifty kilometers away, and bumped all the way to Jinan. Ambassador Davis expressed his deep gratitude for this, saying that even if he himself were walking on the ground, it would be difficult to overcome this. (Litian from Jinan)

### Knowledgeable Youth Should Act as Pioneers, Leading a New Revolutionary Movement

He believes that today's China is a democratic polity. He hopes that China's knowledgeable youth will become greatly aware and act as pioneers of the people, leading a new revolutionary movement. It is the responsibility of today's knowledgeable youth to give people the freedom to organize and express themselves and to exercise all the rights under a democratic political system.

The so-called new revolutionary movement is not the revolutionary movement of the past. The revolutionary movement of the past only talked about destruction and only talked about overthrowing. Today's revolutionary movement is a constructive revolutionary movement. China is now facing a stage of bankruptcy, so there should be a new slogan: All destruction is treason and betrayal of the country, and patriotism should be constructive. Anti-ignorance, anti-poverty, anti-corruption, anti-selfishness, anti-disturbance, anti-destruction. The new revolutionary movement should be cooperative, united, progressive, and improving.

Young people often express dissatisfaction with the status quo, but this does not call for pessimism, hesitation, self-interest, or selfishness. Instead, it calls for people to risk all difficulties and work hard for the country and the people. In this way, China will not be pessimistic and will not be disappointed. There is a Chinese proverb that I agree with very much: "Where there is a will, there is a way." If Chinese youth embrace this hope, I believe they will be able to make a greater and more complete contribution than before.

### Construction Work: Small Units, Small Plans Are Easy to Start

At 10:50 PM on the 4th, Stuart and Ambassador Davis responded to a separate request from our newspaper reporter and made another individual visit. Stuart told the reporter the following valuable opinion: "The focus of China's post-war construction work is on organization, so that people can be strongly organized, and there must be an agency to express opinions so that people's opinions can be expressed, and collective opinions can be transformed into a force, and with this force, everything can be built. At the same time, civic education is also very important, so as to improve the people's patriotic sentiment. Since China's victory, there have been many construction plans, most of which are national in scope, but unfortunately, the content is too large and unrealistic, so most of them cannot be implemented. Therefore, it is far better to start from small places and improve each small group, doing it slowly step by step. Small units and small plans are easy to start, easy to carry out, and easy to achieve results, from cities and then expand to the countryside. For example, some people in Pingjin who work in civil education have been diligently cultivating for more than ten years, and have expanded from one to today's twenty-nine civil education groups, and have a hundred times more people than at the beginning."

At 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, when the reporter sent off the two ambassadors who were leaving Jinan and returning to Beijing, Ambassador Stuart, speaking fluent Chinese, repeatedly and solemnly urged the reporter: "Most Chinese people seem to be pessimistic and disappointed about the current national affairs, but in fact, China's suffering will surely end. Be patient, as long as everyone can organize, be patient, and do it step by step, whatever the people want, they will surely get it, and the future of the Chinese people is sure to be optimistic!"

### New Nursery Rhyme Appears After the Recapture of Hao County: "General with Grass Head Settles Jiangdong, China United, Fortune is Endless"

Many people in the folk regard it as a new "Tui Bei Tu," saying that the next year will be Wu, and the year after that will be Zi, and the annihilation of the communist bandits is not far away.

"The Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District's Flour Presentation No. 214 of May 16th of this year, and the Jihao telegram, have been received. After this year's wheat harvest, the production of the factories under your association has increased. To ensure that the flour supply in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places is adequate, and to allow food-deficient areas such as Pingjin to be supplied, the Ministry has drafted a partial opening plan, which is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. After approval is obtained, flour from Shanghai and other cities can be re-exported in accordance with the regulations. The request to completely lift the ban on flour re-exports from Shanghai is not approved. Regarding the application for loans from various flour factories, your association has previously submitted a request to the Ministry, which has been separately approved and recorded. Please comply accordingly."

The first order was for 300,000 bags, of which 110,000 bags were shipped by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships a few days ago. The remaining 190,000 bags have been arranged with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and will be shipped within the next week.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Running Single-Handedly Urgently Needs Funds Robbed by Bandits, All Belongings Lost Double Misfortunes Never Come Singly

Dear Editor: I used to work in the education field. In 1943, I could not make a living due to the enemy occupation. I had no choice but to borrow money to run a single-handed business with a friend. Because I was a layman, I suffered huge losses, so I mortgaged my ancestral property (the registration certificate is in my name), 14 mu of low-lying paddy fields and 8 mu of high-lying paddy fields, for 40,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes. At that time, the other party was afraid that the currency system would change, and refused to specify the amount of money. I, in my haste and carelessness, signed a promissory note for 80 dan of rice (at that time, the price of rice was 500 yuan per dan in counterfeit banknotes), and used 3.6 dou of rent grain for each crop season of the 8 mu of high-lying paddy fields, and 14 shi of rice per year for the low-lying paddy fields, to offset the interest on the loan. I knew that the contract was obviously unfair at the time, but I hoped that if I could make a small profit the following year, I could prepare the money to redeem the fields. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of the following year, I was robbed while transporting goods to Taixian, Subei, and lost everything. The hope of redemption was gone, so I planned to sell the fields to the creditors. They took the opportunity to devalue the fields again, and if I sold them to someone else, the creditors would not budge on the principal (i.e., 80 shi of rice). I am really unwilling, and plan to file a lawsuit, but I do not know the legal procedures. Please advise. Reader Cao Yiping.

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] During the occupied period, voluntarily mortgaging farmland to others, the contract is of course legally valid, and cannot be overturned on the grounds that it was obviously unfair at the time. For now, the only option is to request redemption in accordance with the law, and to fulfill the contents of the contract until you are willing to sell it to the creditor or a third party, subject to the autonomy of the party concerned.

### South China Smuggling

— Sea Breeze

You must admit that smugglers are "omnipresent." As long as a "black market" exists, "smuggling" cannot be eliminated. During the war, gold smuggling was rampant. At that time, gold in the Southeast was much cheaper than in Chongqing, and cases of smuggling gold by air became commonplace.

Now, the smugglers in Hong Kong and Shanghai are even more resourceful. No matter what kind of blockade line it is, they can open it with "gold bricks" and "legal tender." Can you say that there is no smuggling in Hong Kong and Shanghai? Wholesale, large-scale, and small-scale, there are people specializing in this industry.

The 150 million legal tender's worth of smuggling from Hong Kong and Shanghai reported in this newspaper is just one example of smuggling that was accidentally discovered.

You must admit that "Hong Kong," the "tiny piece of land" that should be returned to China, has become a base for "smuggling" in South China. According to the open declaration of the Hong Kong Customs Superintendent:

"This year, we have seized 500 smuggling cases. We believe that this large-scale smuggling must have a strong and powerful organization behind it. Hong Kong does not want to become a smuggling base, which would hinder China's economy."

According to two recent smuggling cases, there are the Xinjiang Wheel smuggling case and the Foshan Wheel smuggling case; the latter is particularly large-scale and is a very organized action. Hong Kong and Guangdong are very close, but due to import controls, Hong Kong goods are smuggled into Guangzhou in large quantities.

"The only way to cure smuggling is to stabilize prices and currency values. If currency values and prices are unstable, "South China smuggling" will not be eliminated for a while.

"Hong Kong" - the basic reason why it has become a "darling" on the smuggling "honey seat" is precisely this.

For example, a large amount of Philippine funds are being smuggled into Macau. This is related to the fluctuation of China's legal tender.

A United Press report from Manila on the 2nd clearly pointed this out, saying:

"The amount of gold exports to China has increased dramatically since the value of Chinese currency began to fluctuate in February of this year, which has attracted the attention of the Philippine government."

How to stop the so-called "South China smuggling" that is rampant in Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, and Guangdong? If we only use passive methods to stop it, it may be difficult to achieve results in a short period of time.

### We Can Really—Fly with Wings

— Translated by Ming Sen

Tie yourself into the seat of the latest small helicopter, the "Hoppicopter," start the rotor above your head, grab the "joystick," and you can take off from your yard for a two-hundred-mile flight!

The "Hoppicopter" can be said to be a miniature helicopter, small, safe, and easy to operate, and seems to have all the conditions to become a tool for ordinary men and women to fly alone at will. It weighs only one hundred and twenty-five pounds, and each one costs about seven hundred and fifty dollars (US dollars) - if produced in large quantities, the price can probably be reduced somewhat. Horace Pentecost, chairman of the "Hoppicopter Company" in Yatu, said, "The function and comfort of this small helicopter can be compared to a good kick bike."

Mr. Pentecost has written a booklet called "The Economics of the Solo Helicopter," which explains that this aircraft is actually easier to use than most other travel tools. Turn yourself into the seat - with three lifting wheels under the seat - the engine is behind your shoulders, and the rotor is above your head. All you need to take care of is a "joystick," the handle of which is right in front of you.

This joystick is a tube-like strong rough sample, about two and a half feet long. It can be pushed up and down, forward or backward, and it can be turned. This way, you can descend or ascend, move forward or backward, or hover in the air - without having to take care of a large number of driving mechanisms at the same time.

The "Hoppicopter" is not a toy. It can rise to a height of about 12,000 feet and has a speed of 90 miles per hour. Under normal circumstances, if the load does not exceed two hundred and fifty catties, it can continue to fly for two hundred miles.

Most importantly, this aircraft is safe. If the engine of a "Hoppicopter" malfunctions, it can hover quietly and land safely.

Of all the flying tools, only the "Hoppicopter" may be economically comparable to other modes of transportation. Its selling price is only slightly higher than a top-of-the-line new machine road car. Seven "pints" of fuel can fill its fuel tank, and it does not require a special field for it to land or take off. You can use your own backyard or a nearby open space.

You don't need a hangar to store your "Hoppicopter," because your existing garage can be used. Moreover, according to one of the creators and west of the aircraft, the shipping cost of this aircraft will not be very large, because it is very easy to disassemble it and pack it into several boxes of convenient sizes.

The cost of using and maintaining it is so low that it cannot be compared with existing aircraft, so it can be afforded by ordinary middle-class families.

As soon as the news about the "Hoppicopter" came out, millions of people from all over the world wrote to inquire about its evaluation. "Everyone seems to be in particular need of safe, cheap and independently controlled flights," Pentecost said in his booklet "The Economics of the Solo Helicopter": "Missionaries in the interior of Africa see in this aircraft a tool that saves them from spending weeks cutting a path only a few sips long in the primeval jungle. Explorers in South America see it as a key that can open up all insurmountable or impassable mountains, dense forests, and swamps. Large-scale pastoralists see it as a substitute for "old horses" to patrol their vast pastures. Prospectors want to use it to find "the vein that was almost found last time," but most people, including myself, just want it as a simple and cheap means of transportation, to take us to a place one or two hundred miles away whenever we are happy!"

Family Reunion in Prison

Wang Zhenyang, a farmer from Guangxi, lost contact with his wife and daughter during the retreat of the national army in Guangxi during the war. He searched everywhere but could not find them and wandered to Qian, where he became a vagrant. At the end of last month, in Zhenfeng County, he was so poor that he stole a book from a shop, was arrested by the shop owner, and was sent to the county government for interrogation, where he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Unexpectedly, after Wang was imprisoned, he suddenly found his wife and daughter, who had been separated for three years, also in prison. Surprise, joy, hatred, and sorrow all surged into his heart. It turned out that his wife and daughter were addicted to opium and wandered around after being separated. They came to the county a month ago and were arrested by the police in an opium den. They did not expect to celebrate a family reunion in prison!

Missing the Point

A civics teacher at a girls' school in Shenyang, who is the younger brother of the principal and quite fat, gave the following three questions for the civics exam this semester: (1) What is the relationship between democracy and making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of land? (2) Why can dictatorship cause peasant revolutions? (3) What is the impact of international affairs on civil wars? The students scratched their heads and handed in blank papers. After the exam, some students went home and asked their fathers and brothers, who all said it was nonsense.

### Prohibition of Night Tours

(Recorded on July 13, Guangxu 22nd Year)

West of the New World, along Jing'an Temple Road, fifty years ago, there were mostly foreign merchants' residences. In the depths of summer, carriages would travel to the Jing'an Temple area for evening breezes, the sound of hooves ceaseless, disturbing people's dreams. The consul then convened with the Shanghai County Magistrate to issue an announcement:

"Regarding the investigation and announcement of matters: It is noted that the Jing'an Temple area has tea houses and gardens, where people can rest. The number of vehicles and horses coming and going is increasing day by day, night after night, with constant clamor, disturbing the ears. Not only can the nearby residents not rest, but also local hooligans and bandits take advantage of this to seize things and cause trouble, which is a concern for the local area. Every summer, tourists seek coolness, only seeking temporary comfort, but the deep night wind and dew peel the skin and invade the muscles, those who suffer from it deeply and those who develop it quickly. The increase in summer and autumn epidemics is not due to this. It must be known that working during the day and resting at night is an ancient precept, how can we forget the harm in greed for pleasure and be unrestricted. The former prefect and the county magistrate have already issued an announcement, and now that summer is approaching, we will conduct another investigation and announcement for this purpose: Let the tea houses and tourists in the Jing'an Temple area know. After this announcement, the night tea market will be limited to 11 o'clock, and all activities will be stopped. All gardeners must prevent people from entering the garden at 11 o'clock every night, and those tourists who have already arrived at the garden must be urged to leave the garden. No delay is allowed, and if anyone dares to violate this, the matter will be reported and investigated, and no leniency will be given. In addition to ordering the dispatch of police officers and cooperative security guards to investigate and prohibit, this county magistrate and prefect will take measures to maintain local peace and order. Therefore, everyone must comply and not violate this, and this special announcement is made."

The Shanghai night market has a long history, and is even more so today. The roaring sound of cars continues all night, which is even more disturbing than the sound of carriages in the past. This is because there are more versions every day, and cold drinks are sold at night, often using radio as a means of promotion, often lasting until dawn. Recently, the North-China Daily News wrote an editorial, expressing dissatisfaction with the city's noisy habits. If you read it in conjunction with the above text, you can know that this trend did not start today. (Compiled by the newspaper's data room)

### A Week in the Film World

— Li Zhen

A New Type of Detective Film "Remember the Old Days"

When those cliché detective films no longer arouse the interest of the audience, the screenwriters of Hollywood are exploring other avenues. This "Remember the Old Days" takes a relatively fresh form. Naturally, this so-called freshness is just that no detectives or hounds are used to solve the case. The whole play uses a detective novelist who inadvertently hears about a bizarre assassination case, and the deceased happens to be a famous thief, which arouses his curiosity. He tries to trace the life of the thief, so he encounters many twists and turns and difficulties. Also, due to the novelist's search for materials everywhere, the whole story is connected. The original intention of the screenwriter in using this form to compile the script is to focus on the description of criminal psychology, but in "Remember the Old Days", this point is written very superficially, and in fact, the more important social causes of crime are completely ignored in the script.

The director's handling of this is indeed superior to the writing of the play, and he cleverly and humorously uses a strong human touch, especially the scenes of the naval officer being deceived into entering the gambling field for the first time and selling the map, which are the most brilliant parts of the play.

Peter Lawler's novelist is humorous and humorous, and his performance is just right. The male protagonist Chai Kare Shi Xie Tuo of "The Murderer" plays very cleanly. Shani Green Li's Beid is stable and more than enough, but has no special achievements.

Technically, this film can be considered above the level.

Vaudeville Dance Film "Peach and Plum Fragrance"

"Peach and Plum Fragrance" is a vaudeville-style dance film. What the whole film wants to express is this pair of comical dance stars, Joan Davis and Jack Haley, plus American drum king Chin Crowber and electric organ female musician Wu Yisou'er Smith. Therefore, the story in the script does not occupy an important position, and the love story between Jill and Tom is only a foil, and even a bit out of place in some places. Naturally, it is difficult to demand that the story of such a miscellaneous dance film be complete and rationalized.

But even if we take a step back, this "Peach and Plum Fragrance" can only belong to a third-rate dance film. The director's handling of the play fails to grasp the overall development, especially dividing it into parts.

As entertainment, you can only find the value in the gimmicks of the pair of comical stars Joan Davis and Feike Haley.

Goebbels' Love Story "Women's Enemy"

Obviously, this is a failed work. Regardless of the screenwriter, director, or even the actors, the whole play is bland and dull, and it is simply impossible to find any highlights.

The script uses Goebbels' deeds to form this story, trying to expose the tragic life of the German people under the Nazi system. But from the film's point of view, it is also extremely weak. Especially for a character like Goebbels, the fleeting description gives the audience a blurred impression instead.

In the performance, Paul Ando's Goebbels is a failure. Whether in modeling or characterization, he has not grasped this character. Claudia Helank's Mary is only slightly better in one or two places, and Donald Hughes' Hans is still stable.

The director should bear the greatest responsibility for the failure of this play.
