[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The National Army in Siping has now begun its offensive.

Currently, the most threatened area is the Dahushan to Xinmin section of the Beining Line. Xinlitun is connected to Xinmin in the east, and connects to Gaotaizi in the north, which is called the Gao-Xin Line. Gaotaizi is a station between Xinmin and Juliuhe on the Beining Line.

The main force of the Second and Third Columns of the bandit Nie Rongzhen's troops, more than 20,000 men, launched a full-scale attack on the National Army strongholds in Beihedian and Baoding Wen from 7:00 PM yesterday.

### De Wang Re-emerging: No Such Possibility at Present

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Regarding the report by United Press a few days ago that De Wang might re-emerge, reporters inquired from all sides and all said that there was no such thing, and there is no such tendency or possibility at present. This is likely the speculation of sensitive reporters after Chairman Chiang summoned and met with Wang in Beiping. When Chairman Chiang met with De Wang in Beiping a few days ago, he expressed his support for the implementation of local autonomy. De Wang briefly stated his opinion that "the Inner Mongolia issue is not a local issue, but an ethnic issue." Apart from this, the conversation did not involve any specific issues. When De Wang met with reporters today, he spoke freely for an hour, advocating convening a second Mongolian conference to solve the Inner Mongolia issue. (Continued on page 2, column 3)

### Wu Chunlin Speaks in Nanjing: Advocates Retaining the Taiwan Dollar System

The old man's name is Lin Wuwu. It is said that all of his forest property was robbed by the deputy head of the township and others, and he had no way to appeal, so he specially blocked the car to make his case.

[This Newspaper Report] According to a senior member of the Democratic Socialist Party, the negotiations on the general election among the three parties are still underway in Nanjing. Apart from the number of representatives, all other issues have been agreed upon, and it is expected that the negotiations can be successfully concluded this month. In terms of the number of representatives, both parties advocate a distribution ratio of 3:1:1:1, but the Kuomintang's proposal is far lower than this number, so everything still needs to be further negotiated.

### Foreign Minister Wang Will Meet with MacArthur to Discuss the Peace Treaty with Japan and the Occupation Issue

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A Chinese delegation official here stated that Foreign Minister Wang will return home at the end of the month after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He will stop here for a few days to discuss the peace treaty with Japan and the occupation issue with MacArthur and other officials of the Supreme Command.

[United Press, New York, 12th] China and the United States are consulting here and in Washington on eliminating the points of disagreement between the two countries on how to handle the Japanese peace treaty. The biggest problem between China and the United States is the number of merchant ships that Japan can have. China hopes to limit it to a much smaller number than the United States advocates. It is generally believed that China will make good use of its position and delay the treaty as much as possible. If the United States is willing to make some concessions, China will agree to give up its veto power and have eleven countries draft the treaty. The Chinese representative was quite pleased when the Soviet Union severely criticized the United States' policy toward Japan, which was building up Japan to re-invade. Although China does not agree with the United States' support for Japan as a springboard for imperialist conspiracies, China deeply feels that the Soviet Union's opposition to Japan's military build-up is well-intentioned.

[United Press, Beiping, 12th] Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union William Bullitt proposed in Life Magazine that the United States should help China with 1.35 billion US dollars to prevent the Soviet Union from conquering China. This plan has hardly caused any waves in North China. Political circles believe that this plan is too theoretical and has little chance of being realized, and even if it is passed, its conditions will be very harsh.

### We Should Take a Calm Attitude Towards American Statements on Aiding China; Xi Yushu Comments on Bullitt's Proposal

[This Newspaper Report] Xi Yushu recently commented on Bullitt's emergency aid proposal, saying in essence: Bullitt's intention is very good, but it is too idealized, because Bullitt's publication of this article is completely from the standpoint of the masses, and his identity is the representative of Luce's Life Magazine. In actual politics, I am afraid that it may not have much impact. The whole question is that the United States' attitude towards China is not clear. People in the country should take a calm attitude towards the words of such friendly countries, and do not need to be sad or happy about it. If we think about it with common sense, in the entire Second World War, China's contribution was very great, and it was almost on the verge of danger, but the United States still adopted the Europe First policy, and the lease assistance to China was very small. At this time, China is mired in difficulties again, and the United States should provide a large amount of assistance without haggling. In fact, today's problems in China cannot be solved by hundreds of millions of dollars.

[This Newspaper Report] Political Committee Member Jiang Yuntian recently commented on Bullitt's emergency aid proposal, saying: This proposal is very timely, but MacArthur may not be willing to come to China to take office. What our country needs now is large-scale unconditional assistance, including military supplies, materials, financial assistance, and the dispatch of engineers and technicians. As for whether MacArthur comes to China or not, it doesn't matter much. The most important thing is that the United States' policy towards China can no longer be a business calculation, otherwise China will suffer deeply and the United States will regret it one day.

Editorial

### Reflections on Reading Mr. Phelphs' "Impressions of a Visit to China" - A Re-examination of Sino-American Relations -

Mr. Phelphs, the former U.S. Ambassador to France and the Soviet Union, published a lengthy report entitled "Impressions of a Visit to China" in "Life" magazine, advocating for emergency U.S. aid to China and suggesting the selection of General MacArthur to oversee the $1.35 billion aid plan. This article has attracted considerable attention from both Chinese and American figures. During Mr. Phelphs' stay in China, we had the opportunity to converse and frankly exchange opinions. He also traveled extensively throughout China, engaging with various people. Therefore, I firmly believe that Mr. Phelphs' observations are based on reliable and practical materials.

Mr. Phelphs' intention is to use American aid to prevent China from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. However, the "Ta Mei Evening News" editorial even stated that some Americans would rather keep the $1.35 billion than let the Soviet Union control China. Regardless of who is right or wrong in their opinions, we must first clarify that China is, and always will be, China, standing firm and unshaken. Whether the United States provides aid or not, China will always fight to the end for the integrity of its national territorial sovereignty, and will never willingly fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, nor will it necessarily be content to be an appendage of the United States. However, we must remind some American friends that it was the American authorities who betrayed China and signed the Yalta Agreement. China has not done anything to wrong the United States.

We would like to take the opportunity of the publication of Mr. Phelphs' "Impressions of a Visit to China" to present our views on Sino-American relations for discussion by those concerned about this issue.

The problems between China and the United States can be summarized into the following points:

First, is the American understanding of China. China is obviously behind the United States in every aspect, far from the current standards of the United States. This is a fact; it cannot be denied or evaded. However, one point we must all pay attention to is that China, in some important aspects, is no different from the United States. Whatever is not applicable in the United States, such as communism, will certainly not be applicable in China. Whatever Americans value, such as "purge movements" within the government and the preservation of national and ethnic interests, China values equally. Moreover, because China's national strength is not as strong as that of the United States, and the foundation of its government is not as stable, it can even be said that the Chinese people's emphasis on the above two points must exceed that of the Americans. "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." The United States itself rejects communism, but as Mr. Phelphs pointed out, it believes that "the Chinese Communist Party is only a land reformist," so it may as well promote communism in China; the U.S. government itself adopts a "purge policy," but believes that China, to "progress," must adopt a "united government" that accommodates the Communists. This is somewhat inconsiderate on the part of the United States.

Second, is the issue of American understanding of the Chinese government. Anyone who pays a little attention to American public opinion knows that American public opinion's criticism of our government is extremely harsh. Although Mr. Phelphs believes that "Chairman Chiang's vision and wisdom are unmatched by any politician in history," Americans always believe that the Chinese government is too inefficient and incompetent, especially after General Wedemeyer's scathing criticism of "corruption and incompetence." But we would like to remind our American friends: please put themselves in the position of the Chinese government and think about it. In today's situation, with diplomatic and domestic affairs constrained everywhere, and no policy able to be implemented freely, after eight years of war against Japan, and now facing an unprecedented communist insurgency, I am afraid that no government would have a panacea that can cure everything with a single dose. Recently, the labor unrest in Shanghai was quickly quelled due to the joint efforts of various party, government, and military agencies, and the communist conspiracy was unable to succeed. Westerners in Shanghai believe that the government's ability far exceeds that of European and American countries. This is indeed a fair assessment. Today, China is riddled with holes, and there is almost a sense of helplessness. The government wants to engage in salvaging efforts, but often feels that if it supports the east, the west will collapse again. Mr. Phelphs sees this very clearly. This is because he is a writer for "Life" and "Fortune" magazines, and he has the freedom to easily approach the broad and simple Chinese people.

Third, is American aid to China. When it comes to this issue, we should pay attention to the following two points: First, is the view on aid. Second, is the effectiveness of this aid. First, let's talk about the view. We must know that if any two countries talk about aid, it must involve mutual benefit. One-sided beneficial aid is only relief in nature, and it cannot be sustained. American aid to China, simply put, should be a matter of mutual benefit. Unfortunately, some Americans see this as a one-sided benefit for China. In other words, they mistakenly believe that this is just charitable relief, which has affected the firm implementation of American policy and presented a phenomenon of wavering and fluctuation. Second, is the effect of relief. American rhetoric has recently tended to believe that China is a "bottomless pit" and that the effect of American aid is minimal. The source of this view is partly due to American people's lack of understanding of the intrinsic meaning of the Chinese problem, and partly due to a small number of American businessmen in China who may still be unable to forget the old days, and thus criticize Chinese affairs from a die-hard and narrow perspective, which has also affected the policies of the American government to some extent. To answer this question, we only need to compare the small amount of American aid to China during the war of resistance against Japan with the greatness of China's achievements to get the answer. Honestly speaking, there is no other country in the world that uses foreign materials as carefully as China. We have never used any American aid to us for any sinister and harmful plans against the United States. Please let Americans compare how the Soviet Union used American aid.

Fourth, having clarified the above three points, we can then review American policy. American policy is indeed contradictory. Leaving aside the above-mentioned different treatment of the Communist Party in China and in the United States, let's focus on the general American policy towards China. It can be said that it is sometimes active, sometimes passive, sometimes praising China to the heavens, and sometimes suppressing China to the ground. For example, Marshal Marshall's visit to China, how enthusiastic was the American policy towards China before his arrival, and how cold and indifferent did it become after Marshall left. We sympathize deeply with the difficulties Marshall encountered in his mission in China, and the fact that the Chinese Communists ultimately failed to embark on the path of peaceful cooperation with the government must be an indelible regret in Marshall's heart. However, do American people know what kind of painful experience China has suffered under this wavering policy of the United States? The Chinese people deeply know that the intention of friendly countries is pure, and deeply feel that it is also truly admirable, so they do not hesitate to compromise in order to seek perfection, knowing that it is impossible, but still doing it. However, the policy adopted by the United States towards China in the past stage was a dead end, a blind alley, and its inevitable change of course was destined. Today, as the United States looks back on the past, it should replace hesitation with firmness, and passivity with activity, in order to help itself and its friends. Mr. Phelphs probably sees this more clearly.

Fifth, there is one more point we would like to make to supplement Mr. Phelphs' paper, which is that to understand China, one must look at it from a historical perspective. From a historical perspective, there are two points that should be noted: One is why is China so poor today? The other is how did China extricate itself when it encountered difficulties in history? First, let's talk about the first point. Everything in China today is the accumulation of history. Two hundred and eighty years of alien rule, a hundred years of the constraints of unequal treaties, twenty years of warlords playing with soldiers, twenty years of communist national disaster, and eight years of bloody war against Japan have exhausted China's national strength and people's strength to this point. Today's government is a struggler under this historical accumulation. Its efforts may not be exhaustive, but to put this heavy burden on its shoulders and say that this is all the fault of the current government is illogical and unfair. Second, China has encountered crises in its five thousand years of history that are ten or a hundred times greater than today, and they are too numerous to count. The Chinese people have always broken through and revived by their own strength. The Chinese people have never had the mentality of relying solely on foreign aid. That is why it has continued for five thousand years and still stands tall in the world. Today, although China welcomes foreign aid, it has no intention of begging for mercy! The Chinese people especially do not want to use "extortion" to obtain human aid. The Chinese are loyal friends, but they are friends.

In a nutshell, today's increase in Sino-American friendship and the clarification of the dark and turbid air between the two countries is extremely important, and the way to achieve it is very easy. As long as we measure from mutual understanding to mutual trust, and from mutual trust to mutual respect, the bright and open path will surely be in front of the people of both countries!

### Zhu Jia Yi Talks About the Communist International

"The emergence of a new organization of the Communist International is less a resurrection of the Third International and more a consistent trick of the Third International to exploit international contradictions, because the Communist Party's strategy has always been untrustworthy and not bound by treaty obligations. It takes advantage of changes in the international situation at any time to seek advancement. As for its organizational form, whether it is hidden or visible, it does not hinder the expansion of its international policies. Therefore, the announcement in Moscow in 1943 to abolish the Third International organization was a complete farce, only a strategy to exchange for Allied assistance. In fact, in the past four years, the Communist Party's actions in our country, as in other parts of the world, especially in Eastern European countries, have all been based on its international policies. According to the principles of the United Nations Charter, all countries should respect each other's national interests and have the freedom to choose their own political system. Now, with the accumulation of actions of the Communist International, this principle has already been directly undermined, and human justice and morality have also been greatly threatened and are trending towards collapse. Because of its universal implementation of international policies, all non-communist countries and people are facing a critical moment of life and death. All democratic countries should be wary. Therefore, we should not regard the resurgence of the Communist International as merely a diplomatic action against the European Recovery Program and the United States. All countries that uphold the United Nations should cooperate closely, seek political and economic stability together, eradicate the source of chaos, strengthen the organization of the United Nations, and establish peace for the sake of their own independent survival, because only collective action can achieve collective security and enable all nations in the world to coexist independently and eliminate the threat of the Red International.

### Please Uphold the Cooperation Movement

(Continued from page one) Credit cooperatives are cooperatives that engage in lending and deposit-taking. They are established in accordance with the provisions of the Cooperative Law, which is what Dr. Sun Yat-sen referred to as "banking cooperation" in his teachings. The Ministry of Finance believes that those who are not in the banking business do not even know what the word "credit" means, so what is the "credit cooperative" business? Since credit cooperatives are mainly engaged in lending and deposit-taking, allowing them to withdraw funds by check is a natural result of business in order to facilitate borrowing and deposit-taking by members. The government should encourage and promote this. Credit cooperatives are civilian financial institutions. A study of credit cooperatives in various countries shows that not only are they not prohibited from using checks, but they are also promoted and encouraged by their respective governments. Credit cooperatives are civilian financial institutions recognized by economists around the world. Dr. Sun Yat-sen called them "cooperative banks" and advocated their widespread establishment. Moreover, the basic national policy chapter of the Constitution clearly stipulates that "cooperative enterprises shall be encouraged and assisted by the state," and the Ministry of Finance should not discriminate against them. The date the Ministry of Finance issued the order was September 27, which was two days before the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, which was the time when all industries and residents settled their accounts. Financial institutions are the hub for all industries to settle their accounts. It is suspected that they deliberately tried to destroy civilian financial institutions. We request the National Government to revoke the order issued by the Ministry of Finance on September 27 prohibiting the acceptance of checks with credit cooperatives as payers, and to recognize checks with credit cooperatives as payers as legal instruments.

### Wu Chunlin Makes a Speech in Nanjing

(Continued from page one) The purpose of this trip is that the Taiwanese people have been separated from the mainland for too long, and I hope to use this trip to understand the actual situation and examine the actual implementation of policies as a reference for local autonomy in Taiwan. During this trip to Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, every plant and tree felt worthy of cherishing, especially the atmosphere of revitalization in Nanjing, which is gratifying to the Taiwanese people. The "February 28 Incident" has become a thing of the past, but the facts are definitely not as serious as rumored. If there are any statements against the Taiwanese people, they are deliberately destructive. If Taiwan had not been ceded to Japan that year, the Taiwanese people could have worked hard and sacrificed for the war against Japan just like their compatriots in the mainland during the war of resistance. In terms of education, all schools use textbooks in Mandarin Chinese and teach in Mandarin Chinese. Two-thirds of the factories are now operating, compared to the total number of factories taken over. Wu et al. also put forward several hopes: The handling of the "February 28 Incident" has not yet ended. As of now, four city councilors are still in prison and four are missing. The central government issued eight handling guidelines at the beginning of the incident, but they have not yet been completed, and we are very concerned about this. Politically, to date, the public opinion organs in Taiwan Province cannot fully express public opinion, and private newspapers have not yet been restored, which is a shortcoming of democratic politics. Economically, I hope that the domestic economic community can assist in the construction of Taiwan Province so that it can recover quickly. Wu et al. finally stated: I deeply hope that people from the mainland can visit Taiwan, especially those in the press are more welcome.

### De Wang Speaks in Beiping

(Continued from page one) De Wang believes that the most terrible phenomenon in China today is not political corruption or economic disorder, but the failure of education. He strongly advocates the development of healthy rural education to strengthen the foundation of the country. He also said that the extreme development of world science and the current international political situation may lead mankind to destruction. If it is fortunate enough not to be completely destroyed, then Chinese Confucian philosophy and Indian philosophy may still be valued by people all over the world and used as a tool to save mankind from crisis. De Wang flew south alone after Japan surrendered. His wife and four sons were taken to Kulun by the Outer Mongolian army. His only property in Beiping, No. 6, Lane 47, Dongsi, was sold for 40 million yuan this March. He now lives in the home of Mr. Han, a fellow Mongolian villager, and leads a Puritan-style life.

### Overseas Chinese in Indonesia Send a Telegram to the Chairman, Requesting Protection

[Central News Agency, Batavia, November 11] The United Office of the Indonesian Chinese General Association today sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting the chairman to personally come forward to protect the overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra. The original text of the telegram is as follows: Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Indonesia are constantly in extreme danger, and many overseas Chinese are killed every day. After the Republican army was defeated by the Dutch army, it retaliated with innocent neutral overseas Chinese. They kill overseas Chinese as if they were killing beasts. The glory and prestige of China have been destroyed by leaders who claim to be fighting for national freedom. We sincerely hope that the chairman can seek international guarantees to prevent the Indonesian Republican army in Java and Sumatra from repeatedly killing overseas Chinese by mistake. At the same time, when necessary, provide international military occupation to areas where continued accidental killings and abductions occur until the government can prove that it can maintain law and order and guarantee the safety of life and property. We sincerely ask the chairman to personally come forward to protect us. The office also took the opportunity of the Double Tenth National Day to pay tribute to Chairman Chiang on behalf of more than one million overseas Chinese in Indonesia and congratulate him on the National Day.

### Kuang Bingshun Dies of Illness

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, November 11] National Senator and San Francisco Overseas Chinese leader, Di Bingshun, recently passed away here due to heart disease.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 12] After the news of the death of Wanjinshan Overseas Chinese leader Kuang Bingshun in the United States on the 11th reached here, friends of Kuang during his lifetime expressed their condolences. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng sent a telegram to Kuang's family on the 12th to express his condolences. Kuang was 65 years old, from Taishan, Guangdong, and graduated from Stanford University in the United States. He served as the chairman of the San Francisco Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Standing Committee of the American General Branch of the Kuomintang, a national senator, and a representative of the National Assembly. During the war of resistance against Japan, he called on overseas Chinese in the Americas to donate generously and represented the government in raising and selling public bonds in the United States, making many contributions to wartime finance. In September 1944, he founded the China Aircraft Company in San Francisco and cooperated with Douglas to manufacture bombers.

### The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Air Transport Team Adjusts Ticket Prices on Various Routes

The passenger ticket price for the Shanghai route is 2,515,000 yuan, and the freight rate is 7,610,000 yuan per ton. The passenger ticket price for the Linfen route is 625,000 yuan. The above-mentioned routes are the team's exclusive routes.

### Military Traitors in Beiping Secretly Gamble in Prison, Using Steamed Buns to Make Dominoes

[This newspaper, Beiping, November 12] Northern military traitors detained in the Beiping Army Prison are unwilling to be lonely and have come up with ingenious ideas. They use the cornmeal steamed buns of the prisoners' rations to make dominoes, mahjong tiles, dice, etc. They secretly gamble every day. The Japanese military found out about this yesterday. It is certified that most of them are heads of puppet troops. Their families send food every day, and they have enough money to use. Among them, Huang Nanjuan, the puppet police commander, is moody and often beats his fellow prisoners.

### Prostitutes in Beiping Disrupt School, Female Brothel Inmates Collectively Enter the Police Station

[This newspaper, Beiping, November 12] Disputes occurred between prostitutes in Beiping who were attending classes and receiving training in the past two days. The prostitutes protested against the words of the instructors and even engaged in mutual beatings. Both sides were injured. The authorities decided to change the training method. The first and second-class prostitutes have completed their training, and the training of the third-class will begin tomorrow.

[Associated Press, Beiping, November 12] The first week of classes and training for the daughters of Beiping Kang has come to an end. The police officers and their peach and plum students opened a full-fledged fight as a farewell gift. It turned out that when the hygiene instructor was lecturing, he drew pictures on the blackboard to increase the sound and color. The selling smiles mistakenly understood the meaning of the pictures, and were ashamed to look at them, and asked to erase them. In the end, they all rioted and attacked him. The instructor could not explain himself, and hurriedly fled the classroom. These instructors, in order to maintain the dignity of the teacher, came in droves to quell the public anger. As soon as they entered the classroom, they saw a flock of phoenixes and swallows, with green smoke curling up. They were smoking cigarettes. The solemn school rules were once again violated. The teachers and students first blamed each other with colloquial language, followed by "three iron roosters," and finally the unteachable prostitutes were collectively led into the police station, where a senior diplomat personally solved the matter.

### Three Newspaper Offices in Kaifeng Destroyed by Female Students, Authorities Have Promised Compensation and Punishment of the Perpetrators

[This newspaper, Kaifeng, November 12] In the government's three orders and five assurances of guaranteeing freedom of the press, the offices of the Dahe Daily, Zhongzhou Evening News, and Northwest News Agency in this city were tragically destroyed by students from Kaifeng Girls' High School at around 8 o'clock the night before last, with losses of more than 500 million. It turned out that the Zhongzhou Evening News had published a news item the day before yesterday about the principal of the school, Ma Ziqi, embezzling, and at the same time, it also carried a news item about a female student from a certain girls' school giving birth. That night, the principal, out of shame and anger, incited students to go to the newspaper office to destroy it on the grounds that the newspaper insulted the female students. At that time, teachers and staff of the school led more than 600 students into the newspaper office. The Dahe Daily and the Northwest News Agency, because they were in the same courtyard as the newspaper office, were all destroyed. All machine rooms, typesetting rooms, editorial departments, president's office, and other departments were completely smashed. The damage was severe and could not be restored in the short term. All sectors of the city were extremely angry about this riot at the school and demanded that the authorities severely investigate the person in charge of the school and compensate for the losses. The Journalists Association immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss steps to deal with the matter. After negotiations with the authorities, the authorities accepted the conditions of compensating for the losses, investigating Principal Ma and the perpetrators, and having the school formally apologize to the newspaper office. A storm was quelled.

### Puley's Impressions of His Visit to China. See Yesterday's Fifth Edition

General Marshall arrived in China's wartime capital, Chongqing, on December 22, 1945. He was highly respected and managed to get the Chinese government and the Communist Party to sign an agreement on January 10, 1946, to cease conflict and restore transportation. Secondly, before he returned to Washington on March 13, 1946, he seemed to have opened up possible avenues for achieving a ceasefire in the Northeast. On the surface, it appeared that Marshall had achieved considerable success in mediating a cessation of conflict within China in less than three months.

This surface appearance was deceptive. The Soviet government's objectives were different from General Marshall's. On the day of Japan's surrender, there were no Communist troops in the Northeast. The Soviet plan was to take advantage of the ceasefire mediated by Marshall

to transport as many Communist troops as possible from North China to the Northeast, and to equip the Communist troops with a large number of weapons received from the Japanese army in the Northeast. Taking advantage of the ceasefire period, the Soviet army would then withdraw after the Communist troops were fully equipped. This plan was fully realized.

Three days after General Marshall left China and returned to the United States, the Soviet army withdrew from Siping, and the Communist army immediately attacked. Sipingjie is a strategic city between Shenyang and Changchun, and is the intersection of railways in all directions. After the Soviet army withdrew from Changchun on April 14, the Communist army immediately attacked the city. General Marshall went to China again on April 17, and Changchun was captured by the Communist Party the next day.

General Marshall continued his mission with his usual determination and dignity. In reality, he never had a chance of success from the beginning. The Communist Party was loyal to Moscow, and the Nationalist Party was loyal to its country. It was impossible for the two to truly cooperate, just as water and oil cannot mix. This is true in China, and it is true in any country in the world. Therefore, the final conclusion of Marshall's work in China is: never has such a distinguished military man been sent to carry out such a hopeless and unwise political mission.

After the failure of the Marshall mission, the United States' China policy fell into a state of weary indifference, adopting a nonchalant tendency to "let China sort itself out." This was a particularly dangerous policy because it sought to force the Chinese government to accept our one-sided and erroneous idea that the Soviet Union was a "peace-loving democracy" and that the Chinese Communist Party was merely a land reformer, which was necessary to join the Chinese government (a view that the current U.S. government has completely abandoned), and therefore, aid to the Chinese government was cut off. The 500 million dollar loan that had been allocated to China was

held back. The "Eighth and One-Third Air Force Plan," which was approved by the U.S. government and initiated by Chennault in July 1946, was unilaterally terminated by us in September 1946. According to that plan, the United States agreed to equip China with an eighth and one-third air force team and provide maintenance parts. Secondly, the contract signed in the spring of 1946 for the supply of parts for the old vehicles we left in China was also not fulfilled.

And the most serious thing was that we equipped some divisions and some parts of the troops in China with American guns, American machine guns, and rifles, and promised to continue to supply ammunition, but then we withheld the export licenses for ammunition. As a result, this American-equipped army ran out of ammunition and faced the newly equipped Communist army, which was heavily armed by the Soviet Union with Japanese weapons. The U.S. government intended to force the Chinese government to adopt a policy that we now know to be wrong, which was tantamount to disarming our friends, while the Soviet Union, on the other hand, equipped our enemies. It was not until this spring that the situation became clear. Unless we can recognize the importance of national interests and take corresponding actions, it will not be "letting China sort itself out," but the Soviet Union will sort it out. Therefore, General Wei was sent to China to investigate the situation. What exactly is the situation?

Today, the Chinese government firmly controls China, reaching the north. Small groups of bandits, some claiming to be Communists, are entrenched in remote areas south of the Yangtze River, but the people of Shanghai call the area south of the Yangtze River the "peaceful construction area," which is correct. From North China to the Soviet border is a war zone.

However, the situation of the war is completely different from the combat experience of the American army in the European theater in the two world wars. The Communist army uses guerrilla tactics, acting quickly, attacking at night, and hiding and resting during the day. If an observer were to sit in an airplane and fly low for hundreds of miles in the area where the Communist guerrillas are scattered in North China or the Northeast, he would not see a single soldier or any signs of troop movement. When it gets dark, the Communist army concentrates and quickly advances towards the target of attack, often traveling twenty miles a night, implementing a night raid. The Communist Party's desire to

overthrow the government does not lie in defeating the National Army, but in destroying the country's economic life. Therefore, they do not hesitate to burn towns, destroy railways, telegraphs, telephone lines, destroy factory machinery, and blow up industrial equipment such as power plants, anything they cannot take away.

The National Army intends to protect the towns, so most of them are constrained in fixed places. They move slower than the Communist army, and often when they attack, they find that the Communist army has already fled secretly at night. In theory, the Communist army must protect the Red Capital Yan'an for the sake of face, and when the National Army launches a fierce attack on the city, it must annihilate its largest main force. But in fact, the government captured the city, but did not annihilate its army. They had already fled to Shanxi Province, a neighboring province. Currently, the National Army is clearing the Communist army in Shandong, but a large number of Communist troops have already fled to Henan, leaving only a desolate land. This is the situation of the war in North China.

The situation in the Northeast is different. Except for Dalian and Lushun, which are occupied by the Soviet army, the National Army controls most of the southern part of the Northeast. The Communist army occupies the rest of the Northeast, except for a narrow strip of land in the middle from Shenyang to Jilin, which runs along the railway, which passes through Sipingjie and Changchun. This railway is no longer a railway. All the bridges north of thirty miles south of Sipingjie have been destroyed by the Communist army, most of the sleepers have been burned, and many rails have also been distorted by burning.

Therefore, the city of Changchun, which is now in the hands of the government, has been completely cut off from railway transportation. Changchun, which was once the capital of Manchukuo, has wide streets, magnificent buildings, and nearly one million residents, and is similar to Washington, D.C. in many aspects. The Changchun area has fertile soil and beautiful scenery, similar to the Skagit River Valley in Washington State. The countryside around Changchun is very prosperous, so the city still has sufficient food, and most of the grain is transported by ox carts. But Changchun has no heating. And the winter in the Northeast is as cold as the Arctic, so every tree that can be chopped down, even doors, windows, floors, and beams, are used as firewood for heating.

Changchun is currently defended by the New First Army. This army can be said to be the elite of the National Army. They were trained and equipped by General Stilwell in Burma. General Stilwell believed that Chinese soldiers, as long as they are well trained, clothed, fed, equipped, and commanded, are equal to the soldiers of any strong country in the world. The demeanor of the New First Army is still

very dignified, which proves that General Stilwell's belief is correct. The soldiers of the New First Army enthusiastically remember the Americans, and when any American passes by on the street, they smile and greet them loudly. But behind their brave demeanor, the strength they had when they were under the command of the U.S. Army has disappeared. They only have American equipment. They have been using those weapons since they fought alongside our army in Burma, but now they are old. Forty percent of the rifles are inaccurate because they have been used for too long. Their American machine guns need new barrels. Although they have excellent American artillery, they cannot even practice firing because they lack ammunition. Most of their trucks are old and broken, and because our country has not complied with the contract and has not delivered the parts to them, they cannot repair them. They do not even have airplanes, so they cannot even scout. This is entirely because we have not fulfilled our promise to implement the "Eighth and One-Third Air Force Plan." We first encouraged the Chinese government to adopt American equipment, and then refused to issue export permits for ammunition, thus pushing the Chinese soldiers to the brink of despair. A large number of Communist troops in the east and west are expected to launch another offensive in September. (Continued on the fourth page)

### New U.S. Proposal on the Korean Question China and the U.K. Express Approval in Principle I Advocate for a Short-Term U.N. Trusteeship

[United Press, New York, 12th] Authoritative sources revealed on the 12th that China and the U.K. have, "in principle," endorsed the U.S. proposal on Korea, which is to be submitted to the U.N. within days. The U.S. proposal requests that the U.N. monitor general elections in Korea and the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops. China has also advised the U.S. delegation that China is determined to request that the General Assembly recommend a U.N. trusteeship for Korea for a certain period. The U.S., however, does not intend to include this point in its proposal. The U.S. position includes the following: If the U.N. passes the U.S. proposal and establishes an agency, the U.N. should be responsible for deciding how to administer South Korea during the transition period. The U.S. has informed China that if China wishes to recommend a trusteeship, China should raise this issue directly when the U.N. deals with this matter. At the same time, it is understood that the Soviet delegation will oppose the U.S. proposal, believing that it undermines the Moscow Agreement. However, the combined opinion of the majority of national delegations is that the Soviet Union's position has been weakened since its suggestion last month for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to withdraw together and leave the Korean people to solve their own problems. Liu Yuwan, Chinese Consul-General in Seoul, flew from Korea to New York, indicating that China is extremely interested in this matter. He is currently reporting the latest situation in Korea to Dr. Gu Weijun and other representatives.

[United Press, London, 12th] Moscow Radio broadcasted last night that Molotov had written to Secretary Marshall, stating, "The attitude of the U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission in Seoul clearly shows that the U.S. delegation has no intention of continuing the work of the Joint Commission to reach an agreement to resolve the issue of establishing a provisional democratic government in Korea in accordance with the Moscow Agreement. The U.S. delegation violated the Moscow Agreement and the agreement reached between the U.S. and Soviet governments in May 1947, insisting that not only should democratic parties and organizations in North and South Korea that declare their support for the Moscow Agreement and faithfully fulfill its conditions be allowed to participate in the provisional government, but even reactionary groups that have not signed the declaration and continue to be part of the 'Anti-Trusteeship Committee' should also be included. The Soviet delegation is determined to uphold the Moscow Agreement and cannot agree to this. The attitude of the U.S. delegation has made it impossible to establish a provisional democratic government in Korea in accordance with the Moscow Agreement and is hindering the establishment of a unified and democratic government in Korea. Therefore, the Soviet Union has instructed its delegation in Seoul to submit a new proposal to give the Korean people a chance to establish their own government without U.S. and Soviet participation, and U.S. and Soviet troops should also withdraw from Korea." However, the U.S. has not yet responded.

### U.N. Political Committee Passes Amendment on the Greek Question Gu Weijun Refutes Soviet Statements Involving China

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] After the U.S. submitted an amendment on the Greek question, arguing that the U.N. "record" the assistance of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania to Greek guerrillas and urge the three countries to stop this aid, the U.N. General Assembly finally passed the amendment on the 11th with 36 votes in favor, 6 votes against, and 10 abstentions.

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] The U.S. previously demanded that the U.N. condemn Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania for creating unrest in the Balkans. On the 11th, the U.S. suddenly retreated, but still insisted that the General Assembly should order the three countries to no longer support the Greek guerrillas in the future. Due to the increasing opposition, U.S. representative Johnson finally agreed to the Anglo-French amendment, which urged the General Assembly to pay attention to the majority judgment of the Balkan Investigation Team that Greek guerrillas had been aided by neighboring border countries.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky immediately stood up to oppose the Anglo-French supplementary proposal, calling it a "pair of jackals" with the original U.S. proposal. Vyshinsky forcefully stated, "The current situation in Greece is due to the domestic situation and foreign interference. Greece is like this, China is like this, and Indonesia is also like this. Wherever foreign interference goes, they all follow in the footsteps of Greece."

Chinese representative Gu Weijun retorted, saying, "I have no intention of conflicting with Vyshinsky, but I cannot remain silent and allow this erroneous view to exist. China, like other countries, has many difficulties due to long-term struggles. However, as for whether China has been subjected to foreign interference, you should agree that China knows this best. If China has been subjected to interference, it will be the first to raise and oppose it. Surface phenomena are often not the truth, and things that happen in secret are the most serious. If there is any possibility of interference, the Chinese government will immediately challenge it and bring it to the United Nations." Regarding the Anglo-French amendment, Gu believed that it was not necessary to directly or indirectly point out the faults of the three countries. "If it is not mentioned, it will make it easier for other parts of the proposal to pass, then this is necessary." The Chinese delegation has no opinion on the facts of this case, and the Chinese representative on the investigation team will vote in favor of the majority report, "But if omitting a section can increase broader cooperation, then it is worth considering. Assigning responsibility is secondary. What we should do is to strengthen cooperation and promote peace and tranquility in the Balkans."

### Colonial Countries Should Submit Information Trusteeship Council Passes Indian-Soviet Proposal

[Reuters, Lake Success, 12th] The U.N. Trusteeship Council yesterday passed the resolution on colonial information proposed by India with 23 votes to 19. The resolution stipulated that the General Assembly should establish a special committee to meet three weeks before each General Assembly meeting to review reports submitted by colonial powers regarding their administered non-self-governing territories. The Soviet Union strongly supported this resolution, but colonial powers such as the U.K., France, Belgium, and the Netherlands firmly opposed it, believing that it exceeded the scope of the Charter. Another resolution proposed by the Soviet Union, which requested that powers administering non-self-governing territories provide information on the participation of indigenous people in local institutions, was also passed with 24 votes to 19.

### Four Powers Fail to Reach Agreement on Austrian Treaty Treaty Committee Declares End of Work

[Reuters, Vienna, 11th] The four-power representatives of the Four-Power Austrian Treaty Committee jointly signed the final report that the committee should submit to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the morning of the 11th. Although the work of the Four-Power Committee has come to an end, its mission has not been completed. According to a statement issued by the British representative, the committee was unable to reach an agreement on all points regarding the Austrian treaty, and there was little progress even in narrowing the differences of opinion. The main stumbling block remains the issue of German assets. At the beginning of the meeting, it was originally expected that a committee of experts would study the specific facts related to German assets to undertake the important work of the Four-Power Committee, but because the Soviet Union did not see the expert committee as having independence in its work from the beginning, this expectation was not realized.

### U.S. Supports Partition Plan for the Holy Land Different Reactions from Arabs and Jews Arab Troop Concentration Is Exaggerated

[Reuters, New York, 11th] The delegation of six Arab nations attending the U.N. General Assembly issued a statement today expressing surprise at the United States' support for the Palestine partition plan. The declaration stated that if this U.S. policy is implemented, it will undermine the traditional peaceful intentions of the United States. The Arab delegation sincerely hopes that the United States will not take a course of action that is not based on wisdom and justice. It is puzzling that the United States, as a strong nation, has proposed a method that it knows cannot be implemented and will inevitably cause turmoil. The Near East will not be at peace until the Zionist faction abandons its ambitions.

The Arab delegation believes that a peaceful solution is necessary and possible, but the prerequisite is that the United States must advise the Zionist faction that their plan is unworkable and that those who seek a peaceful solution must intensify their efforts. The Arab delegation is confident that the General Assembly will act in accordance with the Charter and will not propose a resolution that would cause conflict.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 11th] According to a London report, Cohen, Secretary-General of the World Zionist Organization, expressed gratitude for the United States' willingness to support partition, and he also advocated that an international army should maintain order in the Holy Land before the establishment of both Arab and Jewish states. Volunteers could be supplied by U.N. member states.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 11th] As a result of a 300-mile aerial inspection by a United Press reporter along the Syrian, Lebanese, and Transjordanian borders today, only four Arab military units were found within 20 miles of the Palestinian border from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea. Two units guarded King Abdullah of Transjordan's winter palace, and two units were stationed on the Allenby Bridge over the Jordan River. Unless they were hidden in caves or disguised as camel caravans, they would not number more than 1,000 men. There are also no signs of troop movements or concentrations in Palestine or abroad, and the border villages and towns are as peaceful as ever.

### Security Council Fails to Reach Agreement on Defining Indonesian Boundary Line Summary of Report Submitted by Consular Corps

[Reuters, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations Security Council failed today to reach a resolution on the suggestion to define the boundary line in Indonesia. After the Soviet representative's suggestion that both sides withdraw to their positions before the conflict was rejected, Australia suggested that the new boundary line should be stipulated as five kilometers behind the positions of both sides when a ceasefire order is issued. British representative Cadogan expressed opposition, and suggested that the Tripartite Mediation Committee and the consular states should stipulate a temporary boundary line as soon as possible. Representatives from France and Belgium expressed their support, and the Netherlands also stated that it did not oppose it. The Council then rescheduled the meeting for Tuesday.

[United Press, Batavia, 11th] The six-nation consular corps held a special meeting today and decided to telegraph the summary and conclusions of its six weeks of investigation to the Security Council before nightfall.

### Communist International Threatens World Peace France Did Not Participate Bidault Declares at People's Republican Movement Congress

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] French Foreign Minister Bidault said in his address to the People's Republican Movement Congress that the reorganization of the old Communist International, regardless of what name it is using, is another threat to peace. A few people in France also participated, but France did not participate. Bidault also said that the Marshall Plan represents a great event of political wisdom and moral generosity. During my talks in Washington this time, no one had any intention of giving up independence. Some European countries that oppose the Marshall Plan choose poverty, but we will join the Marshall Plan and choose happiness. Bidault expressed France's gratitude to the American people for their voluntary food rationing to aid Europe.

The United States should automatically arm itself as the basis for all considerations. The resurgence of the Communist International is a defensive posture against the Marshall Plan. "The Soviet Union is following in the footsteps of organizing an axis, and is clearly stating that it will not abandon its imperialistic goals, but will openly restore the Communist International and attempt to expand it."

### Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Other Countries May Form a United Anti-Communist Front; Chile Discloses Secret Letters of Southern Country Personnel

[Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 11th (Associated Press)] Diplomatic circles here say that Argentina, Brazil, and Chile may soon form a united front to resist international communism. The catalyst for this move is the rupture in diplomatic relations between Yugoslavia and Chile. Uruguay is also expected to join this front.

[Reuters, Chilean Capital, 11th] Two Southern Country diplomats are suspected of inciting coal mine strikes. After being expelled from Chile, the Southern Country government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Chile.

Newspapers here today published on the front page letters seized from Jia Kaishe's luggage. One letter, dated October 7th, from Jia Kaishe's residence in the Chilean capital to a person in the Argentine capital, stated: "The strike is continuing according to the MT plan.

### Opposition Between Left and Right Factions in Japanese Miners' Union

General Federation Faction Withdraws from Union

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The National Federation of Coal Miners' Unions, representing 370,000 miners in Japan, split into two factions today. Representatives of unions leaning towards the government said that they could not cooperate with the Federation (non-democratic leaders) related to the Sanbetsu Kaigi [Congress of Industrial Unions] under Communist control. Therefore, the labor union alliance under the control of the Socialist Party and the miners' unions related to the neutral General Federation of Labor and the Japan Miners' Union, including 220,000 miners, withdrew from the Federation. As a result, only 150,000 anti-government and neutral miners remain in the Federation. Today is the third day of the Federation's national conference. This split was caused by the election of new personnel. The General Federation and the Alliance failed and then withdrew.

### Poles Firmly Believe in Religion; 95 Percent of the Population are Catholics; Communist Party Members Also Bow Their Heads to God - "A Trip to Poland," Sixth Letter by Our Correspondent Mao Shuqing

[Our Newspaper, Warsaw, September 29th (Airmail)] Foreign journalists in Poland often like to ask Poles if they are Communists. I asked a female staff member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and she said charmingly, "Many American journalists say that my thoughts and actions are very red; in fact, I frankly tell them that I am pink, because I am a member of the Polish Democratic Party. Although the Democratic Party also participates in the Communist Party's coalition government, it is not a Communist Party after all!"

She said: The main reason why many Poles are reluctant to join the Communist Party is for religious beliefs. Of the 23 million people in Poland, 95 percent are Catholics belonging to the Vatican, 4 percent belong to the "Greek Orthodox Church," and 1 percent are Muslim, Buddhist, and others. According to Poland's traditional religious beliefs, babies are "baptized" on behalf of their parents, and from then on, they are destined to be Catholics for life. That female secretary has a very "advanced" mind, she said: "This kind of belief is unfair, because the baby itself is ignorant!"

However, most Poles are still devout "good men and women" of the Vatican Catholic Church. I visited a Catholic church called "Alexander" in Warsaw. The altar and prayer hall of the church were destroyed in the street fighting in 1944 and have not been repaired to this day. However, those devout believers still perform "Mass" as usual on Sundays. They kneel and pray in the remaining cellar. The cellar is small, and many people stand in line outside the door.

In such a country with a devout religious force, the ideas and doctrines of the Communist Party are not easy to cater to the psychology of the people.

In Warsaw, there is such a story: On February 1st this year, the first session of the National Assembly after the restoration of Poland was officially opened. On that day, the Communist Party leader Piłsudski was elected as the President of the Republic of Poland, and the presidential oath and ceremony were discussed. Some deputies advocated abolishing the phrase "Obey the will of Almighty God" in the presidential oath. He said: "God is false and illusory. The president must be loyal to the country and serve the people. There is no need for God!" At that time, many Communist Party and Socialist Party deputies applauded in agreement. This angered a Catholic deputy who was non-partisan. He stood up with a flushed face and said, "Ninety-five percent of the people in Poland believe in God. The democratically elected president cannot run counter to the will of the people and cannot disappoint the people!" He also said: "Relying on God is harmless to the country, beneficial to the people, and beneficial to the government." He spoke for more than half an hour, which made many Communist Party deputies admire him. During the vote, it is said that except for some members of the Socialist Party who opposed God, all the Communists and many other small parties agreed to retain the "Almighty God" sentence. Therefore, President Piłsudski, as an old Communist, still solemnly swore on the day of his inauguration: "Obey the will of God."

It is said that on the day the National Assembly was held, Minz, the Minister of Industry, one of the Communist Party giants, and Gomółka, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee, sat in the front row in the left corner of the venue. Minz was not interested in the discussion of the "God case" at all and fell asleep. When the vote was taken, Gomółka woke him up severely and said to him, "You guy, you have committed so many sins in your life, why don't you hurry up and raise your hand to ask for God's forgiveness?" Therefore, Minz also raised his hand in his sleep, adding one vote to "retain the God case"!

If it is said that agricultural society will inevitably produce strong religious beliefs, then the attitude of compromise between the Polish Communist Party and Catholicism is not only realistic, but also wise. At the garden party at the Prime Minister's residence on Poland's National Day, I met a young Mrs. Skulsky, whose name is "Christian." She is the chairman of the Polish National Cooperative Business Association, a member of the National Assembly, and the chief representative of Poland at the London World Cooperative Conference, a female Communist Party member in her thirties. I asked her why she didn't change her name? She laughed loudly: "What does it matter, the Communist Party and Catholicism can coexist without conflict!"

She said: They are now working hard to build a new Poland, and the country's political and economic policies should gradually be transferred to the hands of 30-year-olds. She said: More than 3 million people have become members of cooperative societies led by her. She has also heard that China's cooperative business is booming, and she very much hopes to have the opportunity to visit China. (To be continued)

### Amazing Revenue from Commodity Tax; Exceeds One Trillion in Two Years; New and Old Directors Will Soon Hand Over

Fang Dong, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, has been ordered to be transferred to the Director of the Finance Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, and is currently preparing to hand over his duties. Fang was the first Director of the Commodity Tax Bureau in this city after the victory, serving a full two years. In his remarks on the collection of taxes in Shanghai over the past two years, he said: The intellectual level of Shanghai manufacturers is extremely high, and government officials are often inferior to them.

Among the taxed goods, cotton yarn and cigarettes account for the largest number, followed by sugar, and then beer, beverages, and fur. The future of commodity tax revenue in Shanghai is absolutely optimistic, as long as the manufacturers' raw materials are not scarce, there are no labor wage disputes, and tax revenue will definitely be prosperous.

### The People Invented a Machine Tricycle with a Very Satisfactory Test Run; Few Expenses, Many Advantages; The Cost of Assembling One is More Than Ten Million

[Our Newspaper News] Wang Wentao, a special correspondent in Europe for the Catholic Cultural Association, officially test-drove his recently successfully modified machine tricycle at the Zhongming Factory on Dihua South Road yesterday afternoon. The results were exceptionally satisfactory. The car will be the first machine tricycle to appear in this city.

Mr. Wang once stayed in Europe for more than ten years, and had close contacts with the Italian industrial community. He usually studied various machine industries with great care and gained a lot of experience. After returning to China recently, he felt that most Chinese people lacked understanding of "manufacturing industry." In order to increase the interest of all parties in studying industry, he specially used the small engine he designed and modified in Italy to first modify a tricycle. This engine weighs only seven kilograms and has the same performance as an ordinary car engine, and has many advantages: Very low fuel consumption, one gallon of gasoline can travel more than one hundred miles. It has one and a half horsepower and can carry about four or five passengers. Driving is extremely easy, with only two brakes, fast and slow, and the speed and climbing power are the same as ordinary cars. It is suitable for installation on any existing tricycle without the need for additional modifications. This engine is currently worth 50 US dollars. If it is installed on a 10 million yuan tricycle, the cost is more affordable than a machine bicycle. The above points were observed on-site by Jue Zhonglian, a technician from the Zhongming Factory, during the test run yesterday, and it was considered that all met the standards.

The Zhongming Factory, which assembles the car, is run by Fan Zhengbo. Fan is very enthusiastic about researching industrial construction. The factory can now manufacture engines by itself, but it never sells them. The products produced are only for research and improvement. Wang plans to cooperate with the factory in Shanghai in the future to manufacture this small engine for assembling tricycles. According to industrial figures, the engine is manufactured in this country with excellent technology and the price is low. It can not only earn a large amount of foreign exchange, but the chaotic traffic situation in this city will gradually improve as motorized vehicles gradually replace human-powered vehicles. [The attached picture is the machine tricycle that was test-driven, photographed by our newspaper]

Another Invention by Wang Wentao: Dubbing Foreign Films in Mandarin

In addition to the machine tricycle, Wang also has the work of dubbing foreign films in Mandarin, and the test has also been completed. This dubbing is different from the simple explanation of the plot in the "free translation style", but all the sounds, dialogues and actions in the film are dubbed in Mandarin. The Mandarin-dubbed film "A Night to Remember" that Wang brought back from Italy is scheduled to be shown to the public at the Grand Shanghai Theater at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. He plans to integrate opinions from all parties and mass-produce foreign films with rich educational awareness in Mandarin in the future, so as to promote the progress of China's electrified education.

### Observations on Visiting China by Prentiss - Continued from Second Edition

The only means of transportation available to them to communicate with the south is a dilapidated railway, with Communist forces lurking and threatening within mere miles on either side of the road. Their situation is so perilous that it would keep any European or American soldier on edge, unable to sleep soundly. Yet, they remain calm, firmly believing they can repel any Communist attacks on Changchun. Even if their connection to the south is entirely severed, they are confident they can hold their ground and await reinforcements.

Regardless of the outcome of the war, the Chinese government must not retreat from the Northeast, and

Regardless of the Price, They Must Strive to Dispatch Troops to Reinforce Northeast China. Should the Northeast be abandoned or seized by the Communist forces, a series of misfortunes for China will follow.

It is not difficult for us to foresee that the Communist Party will immediately declare the "independence" of the "Northeast People's Republic," or that this "republic" will be recognized by the "Independent Republic of Outer Mongolia," as it is entirely under Soviet control. Subsequently, the two "independent republics" will sign a "mutual assistance treaty." We can also easily imagine Molotov inviting the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union and politely reminding him that the Soviet Union has a mutual assistance treaty with the "People's Republic of Outer Mongolia." Therefore, should the Chinese government attempt to recover the Nine Eastern Provinces by force, Outer Mongolia will come to the aid of the "Northeast People's Republic," and the Soviet Union, based on its treaty relationship with Outer Mongolia, will have no choice but to use force to prevent the Chinese government from attacking the Outer Mongolian army. The Chinese government, intimidated by Soviet intervention, will not dare to attempt to recover the Nine Eastern Provinces. Thus, Stalin's work at Yalta will achieve ultimate success.

He will firmly control the entire Northeast, which is the most fertile territory in Asia. Its area is as large as France and Germany combined. Within its mountains lies an agricultural region as fertile as any in the world, producing large quantities of wheat, corn, soybeans, and all other northern crops. It has rich deposits of coal, iron, and even gold, as well as vast resources of developed and undeveloped water power and forests. Before the war, it accounted for seventy percent of China's total industry, but its population is only forty million, offering a tremendous opportunity for the relocation of surplus Chinese farmers. Therefore, the Northeast is of exceptional importance to China's future development.

The government's troops in the Northeast, due to their American-style equipment, are currently

Lacking Ammunition. This need is extremely urgent and cannot be delayed. Action must be taken immediately. In terms of timing and importance, this issue should be resolved before any effective general assistance to China. Holding the southern part of the Northeast is a prerequisite for any future offensive. We must not prevent the Chinese government from purchasing and transporting ammunition from the United States to meet the needs of its American-style equipment – as a means of coercing

President Chiang to abide by certain constraints, which we now recognize as a grave error. Given the severe shortage of ammunition among the Nationalist forces in the Northeast due to our unwise actions, and given the dire consequences for China—and ultimately for ourselves—of Stalin's control of the Northeast, merely lifting the American embargo on arms to China is not enough. President Truman should take swift action, as President Roosevelt did when Britain and France faced a severe shortage of guns and ammunition after the Dunkirk evacuation. At that time, President Roosevelt deemed some American ammunition to be obsolete, meaning that he declared it no longer suitable for use by the American military. This allowed it to be sold legally, and large quantities of ammunition were sold to Britain for one dime on the dollar. We now have hundreds of thousands of tons of stockpiled ammunition lying unused around the world, rotting and rusting; there are 70,000 tons in the Philippines, even more in Okinawa, and even more in the Aleutian Islands, and a larger quantity in Japan, as well as in the United States. The ammunition from this stockpile that can be used in the Northeast should be declared obsolete and sold to China immediately, and its transport expedited.

President Truman has the power to take this action immediately; he does not need to wait for Congress to reconvene. He can still act in time to prevent the Northeast from falling into Soviet hands. If he does not act, then one of the first steps Congress should take upon reconvening is to investigate our China policy. Such an investigation could at least determine the responsibility and reveal the names of those in our government and overseas personnel who have failed to uphold the vital interests of the American people. If we

Act in Time, we can still prevent the Northeast from falling into Soviet hands, thereby ensuring the territorial integrity of China. But this action, although crucial, is not enough. We must not only maintain China as a free nation, but also ensure that it becomes a whole and powerful nation—capable of acting as a genuine force against Soviet imperialism in the Far East when the time is right. For China to be strong, it must first achieve internal stability, and to achieve internal stability, it must first achieve financial stability.

Today, China has fallen into a vicious cycle, a situation that Europeans became all too familiar with after World War I. China has been at war since 1937. The Japanese occupied almost all of the major cities, financial centers, and industrial areas. All of her financial resources fell into Japanese hands. As a result, she could not support the war effort by issuing bonds, and its tax revenues could only cover a small portion of the war expenses. Consequently, the only way she could pay for the war was to issue paper money.

The government's increased printing of paper money gradually devalued the currency. Prices rose accordingly. All those on fixed incomes began to suffer greatly. Government bonds, savings, insurance policies, and all other forms of wealth except for productive farmland depreciated in value. The savings of the middle class gradually dwindled. In reality, the heavy burden of wartime finance fell on the shoulders of the middle class, leading to a decline in the living standards of soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and those who lived off the fixed interest income from securities. The current situation in China is far less dire than in Germany after World War I, but it is bad enough. According to the current value of the Chinese currency, the present cost of living is about 30,000 times what it was before the Japanese invasion of China in 1936. The wages of urban workers have increased in line with the increase in the cost of living. In Shanghai, thanks to the strength of the labor unions, the living standards of workers are actually two-thirds higher than before the war. However, a person who earned 3,000 yuan in interest income from government bonds in 1936 now has purchasing power equivalent to one dime in 1936. The middle class has been bankrupted, and currently,

Suppressing the Communist rebellion still accounts for about 70 percent of the government's total expenditures, and about two-thirds of the government's expenditures are still financed by printing paper money. As a result, the cost of living continues to rise.

In an effort to reduce war-related expenditures, the government has not increased the salaries of officers and soldiers. A soldier's monthly pay is equivalent to only one and a half US dollars. A major general's monthly income is equivalent to seventeen US dollars. With such meager amounts, they clearly cannot support their families. Therefore, to boost morale and for other reasons, it would be very reasonable to increase the pay of officers and soldiers fourfold. However, with more than four million army personnel, a fourfold increase in salaries would greatly increase government spending, which could only be offset by printing more paper money, which would, in turn, accelerate the current rise in the cost of living.

As for the treatment of civil servants, from political commissioners to tax collectors, it remains at astonishingly low levels. In times of national crisis, it is appropriate for the government to ask all civil and military officials to make sacrifices and contribute to the country. However, the meager treatment of Chinese civil servants has exceeded the limits of human endurance and is producing extremely adverse consequences. The extremely low pay of soldiers constantly reminds them of the growing poverty of their families, which seriously affects their morale. As for officers who cannot support their wives and children on their salaries, if they are virtuous and patriotic, they must sell all their possessions to support their families. But when they have nothing left to sell, they are forced to watch their children go hungry, or to use their positions to engage in corruption, or to commit suicide. In the past, many chose to commit suicide rather than tarnish their reputations, but many officers have also turned to corruption. (Continued on Fifth Edition)

### Dr. Ting Hui-k'ang Invited to Speak on "American Customs and Climate"; City Hospitals in Los Angeles and Schools are Free

[Our Dispatch] This newspaper held its 28th special Sunday broadcast at the Cooperative Radio Station yesterday, inviting Dr. Ting Hui-k'ang, the Director of Hongqiao Sanatorium, who had just returned from a trip to Italy, to speak on "American Customs and Climate." A summary of his speech is recorded below:

America has been praised by the world after World War II. In fact, the victory was not accidental. From a single bullet to artificial plasma, everything was the result of the entire nation tightening their belts and saving every penny. Americans say that the victor only knows blood and tears, which is not an exaggeration. This trip covered more than 30,000 miles, and what I am about to describe is only a fraction of what I saw. When our ship arrived in San Francisco, the first thing that caught our eye was the Golden Gate Bridge, standing majestically in the sea, beyond description. Beyond this is the Bay Bridge, the longest bridge in the world, spanning seven miles and wide enough for six cars to drive abreast. The scale of the project is unimaginable. However, the cost of building the bridge was raised by merchants, with the government only playing a supervisory role. In the past, each car crossing the bridge had to pay a dollar. Since its completion nine years ago, half of the construction costs have been recovered, and now the toll has been reduced to fifty cents each time. Up to 100,000 vehicles travel daily, saving people time and enabling countless individuals to engage in social construction. Therefore, although the construction cost of the bridge is enormous, the intangible benefits to the nation are immeasurable. This is an example of cooperation between the government and the people in that country.

Evergreen with Flowers Blooming

San Francisco did not exist initially. It was built by clearing mountains. The slope of its roads often reaches over forty degrees. A hundred years ago, it suffered a major fire, destroying most of the city. However, its facilities today are more advanced, and it has become a hub for east-west traffic. Los Angeles, which was originally a desolate fishing village a hundred years ago, is now known as the world's largest city! Located about five hundred miles south of San Francisco, it sits majestically on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. Although the area is sandy and arid, it is evergreen all year round, free from the encroachment of severe cold and frost. When we visited the area in January of this year, the flowers were blooming like in the height of spring. Therefore, there are indeed many who choose to build villas here, mainly because its excellent climate is rare. Hollywood, the birthplace of the American film industry and one of the eight major industries in the United States, is located in the northern part of Los Angeles. Its residential areas are clean, tidy, and beautiful, creating an urbanized park. Los Angeles is surrounded by mountains, and the nearby seaside hot springs and other scenic spots are must-see destinations for tourists.

Almost Every Resident Owns a Car

Although Los Angeles is vast in area, it is newly developed. The population is only about three million, but there are over 1.5 million cars. Almost every resident owns a car. This not only shows the average wealth but also the general development of knowledge, physical strength, and the convenience of transportation. Parents of school-age children who do not attend school will be punished. All municipal elementary and secondary schools are free of charge. Not only that, but even tram tickets and book expenses are also waived. In Los Angeles, there are 4,000 municipal elementary and secondary schools. In addition to books, the curriculum includes practical skills such as woodworking, pottery making, typesetting, and printing. Mr. Hu Shih once said that if all specialized academic positions must be learned from foreign countries, then our country's school education has clearly not succeeded. Therefore, there is a proposal to reform our country's university system, which can be said to be a profound statement. I have visited the Universities of California, Harvard, Cornell, Columbia, and Boston, observing the history of their evolution, the ebb and flow of various departments, which are not achieved in a day or two. As for the magnificent architecture, it is just a bonus.

Splendid and Grand, Like a Palace

Los Angeles City Hospital can accommodate three thousand patients. The entire building was completed only eight years ago. It is splendid and grand, resembling a palace. Its inscriptions read: "Maintaining health is the true joy of life"; and "Public health is the true wealth of society." From this, we can see that it spends a large amount of money to build hospitals entirely for the benefit of the people. Looking at the entire hospital, there are no privileged wards; all are ordinary wards. Its magnificent architecture makes it known as the world's number one municipal hospital. Most people in the United States can live and work in peace and enjoy free access to hospitals, receiving accurate diagnoses and early treatment, so that they can recover their health and engage in production. This benefits both the family and the country. On this trip abroad, there were several students from St. John's University. Although they were all wealthy, their physiques were far inferior to others, most being sallow and thin. Half a year later, when we met again, the students' faces were rosy and they had gained a lot of weight. Our Chinese cuisine is known as the best in the world, but the nutrition of our diet has been a complete failure. This proves it.

Constantly Striving for Perfection and Innovation

The so-called new medical scholars can be summed up in one sentence: "Examination medicine." A hospital often has more than a dozen X-ray machines and more than ten operating rooms. Diagnosis is widespread and advanced, so it can be innovated every day and every month. For example, the direction of blood circulation in the heart can now be obtained through X-ray photography. Also, diseases such as lung cancer and tuberculosis, which were once thought to be hopeless, can now be accurately diagnosed through precise examinations. Any lobe of the lung can be completely removed surgically. Once the virus is gone, health can be restored. The surgical department of the New York Seaside Sanatorium has performed complete lung lobe removal surgery on more than forty people, with excellent results.

Rapid Progress is Not Accidental

Before my departure, I specially visited General Chief of Staff Ho Ying-chin and his wife at Long Island in New York. After lunch, we continued with tea and conversation. Mrs. Ho said: "Why do American doctors repeatedly introduce me to different doctors, and the doctors do not prescribe any medicine to treat my illness?" I replied: "Does the motto of Great China University not say 'Public and Sincere'? American doctors are openly researching and sincerely serving Mrs. Ho's illness, and that is all!" Looking at the rapid progress of construction in America, it is not accidental. It is all based on profound science, sound physical fitness, unity, and dedication. The people are the atoms of the country. If the atoms are on the verge of extinction, then where does the construction of the country come from? Now that our country has won the war against Japan, it is an urgent task to fight disease and save our weak nation. I sincerely hope that all sages at home and abroad will rise up together to pursue this goal.

### Gospel for Wandering Jewish People; Large Organization Undertakes Relief Efforts

[Our Dispatch] Jewish people wandering in our country will no longer have to worry about not having a stable life, thanks to the assistance of American Jews. Because American Jews here have organized a large-scale organization to help their Jewish compatriots, they are finding ways to solve various problems for Jewish people who have nowhere to go. After proper coordination with the American government authorities, the association plans to spend US$9 million to send 15,000 Jewish people to live in the United States by the end of next year. At the same time, if they cannot make a living after going to the United States, the association will introduce them to jobs. Since its organization a few months ago, the association has sent more than 1,000 Jewish people. Any Jewish person in need of relief can register, and it is not limited to American Jews.

### All US President Liners Equipped with Radar; Actively Replenishing Pacific Liner Routes

[Our Dispatch] Shanghai News from the American President Lines: The headquarters, Kylian, has appointed five important officials to form a committee to specialize in studying the company's business expansion plan and provide opinions so as to submit them to the company's executive committee as soon as possible. The company's ships were requisitioned by the government during the war, but only two ships, the President Buck and the President Monroe, have been returned. Currently, in addition to the above two ships, the company also has six new-style cargo ships and the passenger liners President Cleveland and President Wilson of the Hualiang Line. The two passenger liners are under construction at the Bethleham Alameda Shipyard. Since the end of the war, the demand for shipping services in the Pacific region has been increasing day by day. In order to adapt to this demand, the company is making every effort to replenish the passenger liners that were requisitioned and have not been returned. According to Mr. Cockerley, the company's business manager, all of the company's "President" liners have been equipped with the latest radar equipment, which guarantees passenger safety even in the worst weather conditions. The equipment is being installed by the United Engineering Company and supervised by the Mackay Wireless Company.

### Impressions of China from Mr. Bullitt - Continued from Page 4

(IV)

The meager salaries paid to civil servants are the main cause of corruption in China today. This corruption is so widespread that it cannot escape the notice of impartial observers. In the military, there are many forms of corruption, the simplest being the practice of drawing pay for nonexistent soldiers. A general can falsely report 25 percent more soldiers than he actually has, collect their pay and rations, sell the rations, and pocket the money, sharing it with his trusted officers. The actual number of soldiers in the Chinese army may not exceed 70 percent of what is listed on the payroll. The efficiency and integrity of Chinese customs officials were among the best in the world before 1937, but now corruption is also prevalent. There are still many who

keep themselves clean,

but most are just waiting for the opportunity to "skim the cream." Tax collectors of all kinds are mostly corrupt. An honest Chinese businessman should pay the government 10,000 yuan in taxes. If he pays the full amount without haggling, his position is very precarious. The collector insists on extorting money, putting 5,000 yuan into his own pocket and paying 2,500 yuan to the government. However, if the businessman does not bribe him, the collector will report him, falsely accusing him of falsifying accounts and owing 30,000 yuan in taxes. This will cause the businessman to lose his reputation and spend money on lengthy lawsuits. Although Chinese judges are paid very little and have difficulty making a living, they generally endure hardship and keep themselves clean. However, there are also corrupt judges; no small matter is free from the taint of corruption. In China, middle school and university diplomas must go through a registration process, so the registration staff comes up with all sorts of excuses to delay registration until they have skimmed a little off each diploma.

Most of these people live corrupt lives. The only possible way to stop this corruption now is to give all civil and military officials a salary that allows them to make a living, and execute all those who continue to be corrupt.

But raising the salaries of government officials will increase inflation.

Inflation

will raise the cost of living, and the rising cost of living will quickly render salary increases ineffective, and corruption will still be difficult to avoid—in the end, no one will benefit. How can China break this vicious cycle?

There is only one final answer to this problem, and that is to end the war. But if the vicious cycle prevents China from waging an effective war, then how can victory be achieved?

This is where the United States needs to step in and help. We can break this vicious cycle from several angles, and the price we pay, measured by the benefits we gain in security, will still be small.

At present, the most surprising fact in China is not in the realm of war or politics, but in the realm of finance. The amount of money spent by the Chinese government, when converted into US dollars at the current exchange rate, is simply negligible. The Chinese government governs a population of 450 million people in an area one-third larger than the United States, and bears all the costs of war, but its annual expenditure is only the same as that of the New York City government.

The total expenditure of the Chinese government in 1947, calculated at the current exchange rate, is approximately one billion US dollars. This is a fact. Theoretically, trillions of Chinese legal tender can be completely recovered with only 250 million US dollars at the current exchange rate. This is also a fact. In other words, if we were willing to bear the entire annual expenditure of the Chinese government—of course we would not do that, but theoretically it is possible—it would only increase our expenditure by one billion US dollars. If we were willing to recover all the newly issued banknotes in China with gold and silver—of course we would not do that, theoretically but not practically, we could do it—it would be to lend China gold or silver worth 250 million US dollars. The importance of these figures lies in only one reason, which is that they prove that

effective aid to China

is within our capabilities. We are capable of breaking the vicious cycle of inflation in China without bankrupting ourselves.

Before we continue to discuss the issue of aid, let us remember that war cannot be won by force alone; it also depends on the spirit of fighting, patriotic fervor, and great political leadership to awaken all the material and spiritual strength of the country. What is the current political leadership in China like? Does it have the ability to mobilize the exhausted and hungry people of the country to engage in new self-sacrifice?

The people who led China in great construction between 1928 and 1937, and who led China in the heroic War of Resistance, are the leaders of China today. Few now doubt the integrity, patriotic zeal, and good intentions of the government ministers, or the outstanding talents of some ministers—like Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei. But general criticism of the government is very common. Why is this?

In today's world, no people are as deeply disappointed as the Chinese. The Chinese people were confident that once the Japanese were driven out, they would have peace. They never expected that after Japan's defeat, the Soviet Union would immediately attempt to use the Chinese Communists to destroy their country's independence and enslave them. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, the Chinese Communists seemed to be only a very weak band of bandits, confined to a corner of Shaanxi Province. At that time, the Communist army only had 30,000 men, and they rarely fought the Japanese army, except for shouting slogans and propaganda. Most of their troops were used to attack the rear of the National Army and seize their weapons, so their behavior in the spring of 1945 was very hateful.

But as a result, the Communist army gained enormous benefits during the War of Resistance against Japan. While the National Army was fighting the Japanese army, they were expanding their forces, so when Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, they had about 300,000 armed guerrillas distributed throughout North China. At that time, there was not a single Communist soldier in Northeast China. However, after the Soviet government occupied Northeast China after Japan's surrender, it began to rush Communist personnel into Northeast China and armed them with Japanese weapons. In Northeast China, the Communist army not only recruited local farmers, but also recruited Koreans. Now their strength is close to 350,000 men. They have about 400,000 troops scattered throughout North China, forming small guerrilla units. Now the exhausted, weary, and peace-loving Chinese people have received war, heavy taxes, and ever-rising living expenses and death. They desire peace. Because they cannot get peace, they blame the government. When people in various countries find that their original hopes have been dashed after the end of a major war, they often turn against their

wartime leaders

—the opposition to Churchill and De Gaulle are recent examples. Therefore, in the current situation in China, no government can satisfy the public. The corruption and incompetence of the administrative staff further undermine the government's reputation. However, apart from Communists and their fellow travelers, even the most vehement critics of the government have never said anything bad about President Chiang Kai-shek personally. They acknowledge his contributions to the country, which are unparalleled by anyone in modern history except for Dr. Sun Yat-sen. They acknowledge his personal integrity, honesty, and single-minded devotion to the country. But they also say that his knowledge is limited, that he does not understand the current state of the country, that he listens too much to the old men who helped him twenty years ago, that he has been in high office for too long, so no one dares to speak frankly with him anymore, that his habits and attitudes have been fixed, and that he cannot change his policies or replace his close advisors, so he cannot cope with the terrible new problems facing China today. But "who should replace him?" The answer to this question is always the same: "No one can replace him."

Those who love China earnestly hope that President Chiang Kai-shek can implement the following

reforms:

1.  Retire half of the army generals and one-third of the officers below the rank of general. These are the people who are considered corrupt or incompetent, or both.

2.  Reduce the number of army personnel by half. First, eliminate all nonexistent soldiers in the army. Second, eliminate the lowest-quality units.

3.  Increase the salaries of the remaining officers and soldiers by four times and double their rations.

4.  After the officers and soldiers receive salaries sufficient to make a living, execute all those who continue to be corrupt.

5.  Abolish all redundant and useless institutions in the government and dismiss all unnecessary civil servants. It is generally estimated that this measure can reduce the number of existing civil servants by one-third.

6.  Give the remaining civil servants a salary that allows them to make a living, and execute all officials who are corrupt thereafter.

7.  The government should stop operating industrial and commercial enterprises, because state-owned enterprises will inevitably lead to nepotism, inefficiency, and corruption. Sell the state's existing industries to the highest bidder and truly encourage private enterprise.

8.  Welcome foreign investment—be consistent in word and deed.

9.  Decentralize the power of the central government. Within the entire area south of the Yangtze River, reduce the number of armed forces and the power of military institutions to the minimum extent that does not harm national security. Reassign power to civilian provincial governors, allow provincial governments to directly collect at least 25 percent of land taxes for their own use, and allow them to decide on local plans for their respective provinces.

10. Reform land taxes and all other taxes, stipulate severe penalties, and demand absolute integrity from tax collectors.

11. Hire foreign experts to guide the reform of the tax system, tax collection, the revision of financial policies, and the proposal of industrial problems.

12. Force all people with

foreign deposits

or gold to surrender their foreign exchange and gold to the national treasury. Arrest and imprison all wealthy people who attempt to evade this measure or who refuse to pay all of their taxes.

13. Strictly implement the conscription law. The sons of wealthy families should be treated the same as farmers.

14. Abolish student deferments. Immediately draft all students who work for the Communists in the war against the Communists—the Communists and their fellow travelers, who now account for about 5 percent of the total number of students—and give them re-education before sending them to the front lines. Allow patriotic students to hold speeches criticizing the government and organize demonstrations.

15. In the administrative institutions of Northeast China, employ as many Northeasterners as possible.

16. Publicize the facts of the Soviet Red Army's atrocities in Northeast China, such as rape and looting. The government has been forbidding the publication of these facts in the past out of fear of the Soviet Union. And publicize the many pieces of evidence in the government's possession about the Chinese Communists' obedience to Moscow.

17. Publicize the facts of smuggling from Hong Kong to China, which is greatly reducing customs revenue.

18. Hold national elections in October and December. After the implementation of the democratic constitution, end, in practice and in name, the Kuomintang's "tutelage period" established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924.

(V)

This plan would undoubtedly win the support of all the Chinese people, and if the United States could provide some assistance, this plan would definitely be implemented.

The new democratic constitution of the Republic of China, passed by the National Assembly on December 25, 1946, will be implemented on Christmas Day this year. The Kuomintang (the ruling party) will undoubtedly win the majority of votes, and President Chiang Kai-shek will certainly be re-elected as the President of the Republic of China. Therefore, without interrupting the continuity of the government, the

US government

can now coordinate with President Chiang Kai-shek's plan to end the war and restore China's ancient culture to a peaceful and modern path. How should we proceed? Neither China undertaking internal reforms without US assistance, nor the US providing assistance without China undertaking internal reforms, can solve the problem of safeguarding important US interests, nor can it solve the problem of China's survival. The US government and the Chinese government must work together simultaneously to solve this problem.

We must immediately address this problem in three areas: (1) economy and finance; (2) military affairs; and (3) politics. Given that the essence of the problem is to drive every armed Communist out of Chinese territory, we can only base a sensible plan on an estimate of the time required to end the war. US military experts believe that, given the difficulty of encircling and suppressing guerrillas in vast mountainous areas, it will take three years to end the war. The Chinese people are more optimistic. But let us agree with the US estimate for the sake of argument and present an outline of a three-year plan, while estimating the cost of this plan.

(1) China's gold and foreign exchange reserves have been greatly reduced, so it must retain its existing reserves for the most urgent needs. In the next three years, China will need to import large quantities of American cotton, tobacco, wheat, oil, gasoline, and large quantities of machinery such as locomotives, rails, and truck parts.

The amount of money China needs to import the above items will far exceed the total amount of foreign exchange earned from its exports and the assistance of the World Grain Organization. Therefore, it will need to obtain

credit loans

to purchase food, raw materials, and machinery. According to estimates by Chinese and American economic experts, the maximum amount of these necessary loans is usually 250 million US dollars per year—this is a small portion of the economic assistance needed by European countries. Let us reduce this figure to 200 million US dollars for the sake of argument, so the budget for this entire three-year plan should be 600 million US dollars in credit loans for China to purchase goods from the US from this year to the fall of 1950.

If China sells the food, raw materials, and machinery it obtains in this way on the market, it will help curb the trend of inflation. After the military and civil service have been reduced in size, the remaining civil and military officials can receive four times their current salaries without causing a direct increase in inflation. This is essential to curbing corruption. Since it is the common task of the Chinese and American governments to prevent Stalin from dominating China, there is no reason why the use of these credit loans should not be jointly managed by the Chinese and American governments. The Chinese side should sign the application, and a representative of the US government should co-sign it, in order to use the credit loans.

Since General Wedemeyer made a public statement criticizing corruption in China, the decline in the

value of Chinese legal tender

has become even more severe, because people mistakenly believe that General Wedemeyer's statement indicates that the US government no longer cares about China. It is obvious that unless the US government can quickly express its intention to not tolerate Stalin's occupation of China with actions and words, inflation will soon run wild like a runaway horse. If China wants to curb inflation, it currently needs a portion of the loan we have been considering, about 75 million US dollars. The remaining amount of the 200 million US dollars (i.e., the amount to be used in the first year of the three-year plan) can wait for Congress to decide. This 75 million US dollars, whether it is spent from the US Foreign Aid Program, from the Export-Import Bank, or from other sources, must be lent to China within the next thirty days. Otherwise, we will have to deal with an even greater vicious inflation problem in China next spring. In order to solve inflation during the three-year plan, in order to curb speculators, and to maintain China's balance of international payments, another sum of money is needed in addition to the above. But this sum of money must also be jointly managed by China and the US. Before deciding on this sum, we must insist on a condition that a certain corrupt atmosphere that encourages inflation must end.

For example, the central bank provides funds and credit loans to some other banks, and these banks re-lend the funds to private individuals for seemingly legitimate commercial purposes. Many of these people use the loans to buy goods, gold bars, or US dollars on the black market, and then take the opportunity to sell them when the legal tender depreciates, earning legal tender. Then they use a portion of the money they sell to repay the loan, and keep the rest for themselves. Those in power become rich as a result, while the general public in China suffers greatly.

If the Chinese government is determined to severely punish and completely prohibit the

speculative behavior

of the few bankers and many borrowers who specialize in this kind of activity, then formulating an exchange equalization fund will be beneficial. The use of this fund must be co-signed by a representative of the US government, and this fund should not be established until speculative behavior has been curbed. Let us assume that the Chinese government will definitely take immediate and effective measures against speculative merchants, then it is planned to allocate 150 million US dollars for the exchange equalization fund in the entire three-year plan.

Now let us talk about military affairs. We must remember that before Congress can begin to consider the issue of aid to China, the President should declare the abandonment of a portion of munitions and immediately supply this abandoned munitions to the

Northeast National Army

because their American equipment is severely lacking in the supply of munitions. This action cannot be delayed any longer. If it is delayed, next spring we may find that the Northeast has become a vassal state of the Soviet Union, and that the Communists are poised to occupy an area that before the war contained 70 percent of China's industrial strength, as a base for conquering the rest of China.

According to estimates by authoritative military experts from China and the US, in order to drive out the 350,000 Communist troops in the Northeast, we need not only to re-equip several divisions of troops that have used up their US weapons, but also to train and equip ten new divisions of US-style troops. In addition, it is very important to thoroughly streamline the supply system in the Northeast, from the supply centers to the soldiers fighting on the front lines. Dalian, an important port in the Northeast, can no longer be used, because it is currently occupied by the Soviet army due to the Yalta Agreement. Therefore, the improvement of the ports of Huludao and Qinhuangdao, and the restoration of at least one railway, will be crucial. As we demonstrated in France in 1944, a few hundred people can handle this problem with high efficiency. China lacks this kind of talent, and it would be a waste to transfer US supplies to the Chinese-run supply system before corruption in the Chinese army has been eliminated. Americans cannot overstep their authority and command the Chinese army, but American soldiers can and should manage the supply affairs of the Northeast.

The North China problem

is a problem of guerrilla warfare, because the Communists in that area do not occupy large cities, but are mainly saboteurs. Dealing with this situation requires lightly equipped, lightning-fast units, equipped with Jeeps, small trucks, small arms, machine guns, and 75 mm mortars. According to authoritative military experts from China and the US who have studied this problem, 20 divisions so equipped, properly trained, supplied, and commanded, would definitely be able to clear up the entire North China situation.

Even a minimal air force will be of enormous help in military operations in North China and Northeast China. We have thousands of abandoned aircraft and aircraft parts, which are considered useless from the perspective of our air force, but which are excellent materials in China's eyes. Declaring these materials abandoned and then allocating them to China does not cost our country a penny, but is merely a bookkeeping entry. If we sell them to China at a value of five cents for every dollar of original cost, we have already made money, because these materials are worthless to us.

One thing is clear: the total cost to the US for the military aspect of the three-year plan will depend on how we dispose of abandoned materials. Abandoned weapons and munitions are worthless except as scrap metal. If we want the Chinese to pay five cents or ten cents for every dollar of original cost, and estimate the total value of military assistance on that basis, then the total cost is very low. But it will cost a considerable price in terms of transporting oil, gasoline, food, the compensation of American transport personnel, and the training and advice during combat. We cannot estimate this until the entire plan is finalized, and even a rough estimate is impossible. But if the method of disposing of abandoned materials is implemented, then the annual cost will not exceed 200 million US dollars, and the total cost for the entire three-year plan will not exceed 600 million US dollars.

Adding the 600 million US dollars in credit loans and the 150 million US dollars for the currency stabilization fund, our total cost in the three-year plan will be 1.35 billion US dollars, i.e., an annual cost of 450 million US dollars for the next three years. If we use this money as the price to prevent Stalin from

dominating China

and using China's resources and manpower to oppose us, then the cost is not too high.

But unless the Chinese can not only win on the battlefield, but also revitalize their political life, inspire a new spirit throughout the country, and raise the morale of the army, all the above assistance will have no effect. Can we help them do this? Will our suggestions be regarded as impolite? They will not be regarded as impolite as long as these suggestions are formulated by appropriate people in an appropriate manner. If these suggestions are fair and equitable, then just as the British government was happy to accept our suggestions before the Pearl Harbor incident, the Chinese government will certainly be equally happy to accept them. Many Americans appear arrogant. When they arrive in China, they mix American power, might, strength, and dominance with their own personalities, and they look down on the Chinese everywhere. However, in terms of true human standing, the Chinese are far superior to them. Historically speaking, President Chiang Kai-shek is greater than any American alive today. Future generations will remember that President Chiang Kai-shek and Churchill were both courageous leaders who were able to unite their countries in the darkest times, and China's dark times were even darker than Britain's. If we want to safeguard important US interests and defend the life of China, there must be the closest cooperation between Americans and Chinese. But which American has the military knowledge, political talent, and great personality to engage in this kind of cooperation?

Today we have a general of authority in the Far East who possesses all these qualities. If President Truman could send General MacArthur, in addition to his existing duties and powers, with the title of Personal Representative of the President with the rank of Ambassador, to China to formulate a

joint plan

with President Chiang Kai-shek to prevent the Soviet Union from conquering China, then the entire Far East would be filled with hope and appear bright. General MacArthur does not have to abandon his work in Japan. He can travel between Tokyo and Nanjing. His suggestions on military, economic, and political matters may be similar to those presented in this report. He will certainly quickly connect with President Chiang Kai-shek and become two comrades on the same front. They will be able to work together like brothers for their common goal.

This goal is a common goal. If China falls into Stalin's grasp, then all of Asia, including Japan, will sooner or later be swallowed by him. By that time, Stalin will mobilize Asian manpower and resources to deal with us. American independence will certainly not last longer than Chinese independence by an era. (End of full text)

### Annual Meeting of the Chinese Physical Society Closed Yesterday; Air Force Demonstrates Radar; Ge Zhengquan Lectures on "Applications of Radar"

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the annual meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region of the Chinese Physical Society. At 9 AM, a public lecture was held at the Central Research Institute on Yueyang Road. Dr. Ge Zhengquan, Director of the First Department of the Sixth [illegible] of the Ministry of National Defense, lectured on "Applications of Radar." Before 9 AM, association members had already arrived. Shi Ruwei, chairman of the public lecture, delivered a speech, stating that the Physical Society not only researches and develops physics, but also deeply combines the meaning of popularizing science. Then, Dr. Ge gave a lecture, explaining in detail the principles of radar, the main structural components, and how it is applied in the military. The word "Radar" is a transliteration from English, and its meaning is an abbreviation of the first letters of the words "a radio method to measure distance and azimuth," so its function is to use radio to detect direction and distance. To make it easier for the audience to understand, he showed slides with detailed explanations. Dr. Ge also said that after the victory, the government has received 150 Japanese radar sets in Taiwan and more than 10 sets in Beijing. Currently, 60 to 70 sets have been repaired and can be used. In the future, the Chinese people's research on radar is just beginning. At the same time, the Chinese Air Force set up a radar set on the roof of the Research Institute to demonstrate its actual application, and sent a plane to fly around the city. The radar was able to "capture" the plane's trajectory at any time and report its distance and azimuth. If a distant plane is detected, the green cathode on the "rangefinder" in the darkroom will pulsate strongly, and a white dot will appear on the plane azimuth meter, showing the number of planes, distance, azimuth, etc. If the azimuth measured per minute is recorded and plotted, the trajectory can be fully understood. At noon, the Municipal Government held a public banquet at the Police Social Center on Shaoxing Road. At 2 PM in the afternoon, they visited the radar equipment on the Taiping warship. At 7 PM in the evening, the annual banquet was held at the Sino-British Cultural Association on the fourth floor of HSBC. The annual meeting of the Physics Society, which was a great success, was declared closed after the lunch banquet.

Discussing Physics Education

[Another report] The annual meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region of the Chinese Physical Society held a symposium at the Chinese Science Society on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 11th) to discuss Chinese physics education and physics research. The opinions of various parties were summarized as follows: (A) Regarding general physics in universities, four points: 1. It is not necessary to rigidly stipulate that general physics in universities should be studied for one or two years. 2. University physics experiments must have middle school physics experiment preparation, so it is appropriate to follow the example of the Shanghai Science Museum and set up experimental halls in each county. 3. Middle school physics education has a close relationship with the study of physics in universities, so middle school physics textbooks should be carefully selected. 4. University physics courses should focus on in-depth reading rather than reading too much. (B) Regarding the popularization of physics education, three points: 1. Please invite experts to give more public and popular lectures and publish popular articles. 2. Mass-produce simple teaching aids for public demonstrations. 3. Massively utilize movies to deeply and widely instill knowledge in the masses. (C) Regarding physics research, six points: 1. The work of Chinese physicists in the last fifty years should be compiled into a detailed table for reference. 2. Independent research and group research should communicate with each other. 3. Use the existing institutions with better equipment to first restore small-scale research, and then gradually promote it to industrialize research. 4. First seek life stability and ask the government and society to pay attention. 5. Request subsidies from the National Defense Science Committee and the Materials Supply Committee. 6. Raise a large research fund.

### Peking University Students Support Those Arrested; Surround Hu Shi's Residence; Suddenly Realize the Truth After Explaining the Case

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th] Hu Shi, President of Peking University, is scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 12th to attend the meeting of the Research Institute. A small number of students at Peking University, in order to support Meng Xian gong and Li Mu Shi, students of the school who were arrested for breaking up a critical Communist agency in the city, gathered over a hundred students around 7 PM on the afternoon of the 10th to surround Hu's residence to make demands. Hu was discussing school affairs with the deans of the Law and Science faculties and the three directors of Peking University. He indicated to the students who came to see him: "Such gathering and making demands is an illegal act. No matter how long you surround me, I will not say a single word or receive any student representatives." After Zheng, the Secretary-General of Peking University, went outside to explain Hu's solemn attitude to the students, the students elected seven representatives, and the rest dispersed. Hu, seeing that the majority of the students had dispersed and were no longer engaging in threatening behavior, received the student representatives. First, he informed them that his trip to Beijing had been scheduled long ago. Second, he said that the case of the arrested students at the school was serious and explained the details of the case. Finally, he stated that the school authorities had already released those arrested students who could be released, and those who could not be released would be asked to be treated favorably by the arresting authorities and provided with defense lawyers or legal counsel during the trial. After learning the details, the student representatives suddenly realized the truth and left. The entire process lasted for over two hours. After hearing the news, all parties expressed their concern and admiration for President Hu.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] The United Student Association of Peking University held a meeting at 5 PM today to rescue the arrested students and have launched a strike. Yesterday, the Peking University administration issued a notice stating that this strike was initiated by a small number of people, and that the strike had affected negotiations with the administration. It also considered the strike illegal, so it was treated as an absence from class. Hu Shi's departure from Beiping has brought the matter to a standstill.

### Shanghai Military Training Student Model Brigade Organizes Alumni Association, Inaugural Meeting Scheduled for the 15th

[Central News Agency] Ten years ago, during the "August 13th" Songhu War of Resistance, General Wang Jingjiu, commander of the 71st Army, was ordered by the highest military authority to gather military training students from various sessions to form the "Shanghai Military Training Student Model Brigade." At that time, more than 400 students participated, including more than 40 female students. The brigade was directly commanded by General Wang Jingjiu and participated in the defense of Shanghai alongside various military training brigades of the Special Operations Detachment. They fought fiercely amidst gunfire and bullets on the front lines of Dachang, Zhabei, Suzhou Creek, and Nanshi, with considerable casualties. As the National Army retreated westward and the battle lines shifted, the students retreated with the army. While passing through Hangzhou on the eve of its fall, General Xuan Tiewu, then the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, strongly urged them to stay and, with the consent of General Wang Jingjiu, reorganized them into a "Cadre Training Class" jointly run by the department and the 10th Reserve Division, the predecessor of the 10th Army, providing military officer education. After graduation, they were assigned to various units and subsequently participated in battles in Fuyang, Xindeng, protecting Jiujiang, counterattacking Nanchang, protecting Guangzhou, the Changsha Campaign, the India-Burma Expeditionary Force, and protecting Hengyang. More than 40 were killed or wounded in action. Among the brigade's students were those who pursued studies in the air force, cavalry, artillery, infantry, engineering, and chemical warfare schools, or those who returned to their original university studies after demobilization, and those who were about to go abroad for further studies. There were many talented individuals. Those who serve in education, youth, culture, and business have also made considerable achievements. Recently, feeling a close connection with comrades who fought side by side in the past, students initiated the "Shanghai Student Model Brigade and Zhejiang Provincial Security Department Cadre Training Class Alumni Association," scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on October 15th. All students who were members of the brigade or participated in Zhejiang can register to participate from now on at the following addresses: No. 299 Daming Road, Comrade Zhang Hongci; No. 406 Jiujiang Road, Gongxin Bank, Comrade Xiao Jijie; c/o Jiang Yanwu, Command Headquarters of the Songhu Garrison.

### China United Wins Fifth Match, Big Victory Over Siam United Team, 7-1 Victory Becomes One-Sided

(Bangkok, 3rd, Airmail) The Shanghai China United Football Team played its fifth match here yesterday, meeting the Siam United Team at the National Sports Ground. The audience was larger than ever, estimated at around 20,000. China United, familiar with the field after playing the Four Universities United Team, fully revealed its prowess and controlled the game. As a result, they defeated Siam United Team by a score of 7-1.

When the time came, referee Mr. Ma officiated. Siam United's center back A Tie was absent, so they played with ten men. The Siam team attacked first, fiercely battling under the China United's goal. Gao Baozheng cleared the danger with a back-heel kick. The China United team counterattacked, with all three lines advancing. Fei Chunhua kicked a corner kick with excellent placement. Baozheng headed it in, scoring the first goal. Shortly after, the China United team launched another encirclement attack. Yi Chen and Longhai missed good opportunities, but Li Kui was unwilling to give up. He made a high lob from the left corner, and the Siam goalkeeper was tricked and lost the goal, making it 2-0. Afterwards, China United's offensive slightly weakened, but the defense remained solid, and the Siam team found it difficult to recover the lost ground, ultimately falling behind 0-2 in the first half.

Changing sides to play again, China United rode the momentum and became even stronger. Longhai went on three one-on-one chances, but returned empty-handed. The Siam team launched a counterattack, seeming to have a turning point, but it was a fleeting moment and soon faded away. Longhai, Jinshun and others successively broke through and made contributions, retreating after achieving results, making it 4-0. The Siam team was at a loss and changed its strategy, shifting from attack to defense. However, despite their many tricks, Longhai and Jinshun both scored twice, making it half a dozen. The Siam team had zero, feeling both ashamed and annoyed. As expected, a surprise attack broke through the heavy encirclement, and before he could succeed, it became 6-1. One minute before the end of the game, the China United team, with a blitz-like offensive, stormed forward. Songwen tried his best to save it, but could not avoid the catastrophe. Baozheng took a shot from 30 yards out and went straight into the heart of the goal, making it 7-1. Before long, the legal time had arrived, and China United defeated the Siam United Team by a score of 7-1. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

China United

Zhang Banglun

Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang

Han Longbo Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng

Li Yao Sun Jinshun Han Longhai Li Yichen Fei Chunhua

Siam United

Songwen

Ta Gong Nai Shi

### Eight Research Institutes, Eighteen Years of Work: Report on the Commemorative Meeting of the Ping Research Institute (Conclusion)

— Li Shuhua

Now, let me briefly report on the work of the various research institutes of the Academy of Sciences over the past eighteen years:

Institute of Physics

Mr. Yan Jici, Qian Linzhao, and Chen Shangyi of the Institute of Physics have been engaged in research on optics and applied optics. During the War of Resistance, under the guidance of Mr. Yan Jici, the institute designed and manufactured more than 400 microscopes for use by specialized schools above the college level, hospitals, and factories in the rear; manufactured more than 100 sets of levels and theodolites for use by water conservancy agencies and public works bureaus; and manufactured more than 1,000 quartz oscillators for use by various radio stations, radio manufacturers, and Allied forces. It also designed and manufactured photographic heads for use in photography and radiography. Mr. Gu Gongxu engaged in geophysical research and cooperated with the Resources Committee to use physical methods to explore the reserves of important deposits such as coal, iron, steel, tin, lead, zinc, and sulfur in Yunnan and Guizhou. The institute sent personnel to measure the acceleration of gravity in various parts of China and has measured more than 230 locations.

Institute of Radium Studies

Mr. Zheng Dazhang of the Institute of Radium Studies engaged in research on radium and nuclear physics before the War of Resistance, which was the beginning of nuclear physics research in China. Unfortunately, Mr. Zheng passed away during the War of Resistance. Mr. Lu Xueshan engaged in research on X-rays and used X-rays to study the structure of metals. Mr. Zhong Shengbiao researched crystal structures and the manufacture of ultraviolet lamps. The organizational regulations of the academy promulgated by the national government last year have changed the Institute of Radium Studies to the "Institute of Atomic Studies." However, the academy must strengthen its talent and equipment before considering the change.

Institute of Chemistry

The Institute of Chemistry focuses on research in organic chemistry. Mr. Zhou Faqi, Ji Yuqing, Wang Xu, Chen Guangxu, and Jiang Mingqian are all experts in organic chemistry. During the Kunming period, the institute paid special attention to practical problems and conducted a lot of research on application.

Institute of Materia Medica

The Institute of Materia Medica uses chemical methods to extract the effective qualities of Chinese medicine, researches their physical properties, chemical properties, pharmacological properties, and physiological properties, and then finds ways to utilize them. Mr. Zhao Chengji is mainly responsible for this work. On the other hand, Mr. Zhuang Changgong uses chemical methods to engage in synthetic work.

Institute of Physiology

The Institute of Physiology has researched the relationship between nutrition and Chinese medicine and physiology. Currently, Mr. Zhu Xi's work focuses on research on issues such as re-development and cells.

Institute of Zoology

The Institute of Zoology focuses on the investigation and research of aquatic animals and insects. Mr. Zhang Xi and Shen Jiarui presided over the research of aquatic animals, and Mr. Zhu Hongfu presided over the research of insects. Before the War of Resistance, the institute paid attention to the research of marine animals, regularly sending personnel to major locations along the coast of China, such as Yantai, Chenghaiwei, Jiaozhou Bay, Xiamen, Guangdong, and the Dutch East Indies, to collect specimens and study their living distribution status on the spot. During the War of Resistance, the institute paid attention to the research of freshwater animals. Dianchi Lake, Erhai Lake, and Yangzonghai Lake in Yunnan have all been investigated.

Institute of Botany

The Institute of Botany focuses on the research of plant classification and distribution. Mr. Liu Shen'e, Lin Rong, Wang Faqing, and Zhu Yancheng are all experts in plant classification. The area that the institute has sent personnel to investigate and collect over the years is very wide, reaching Changbai Mountain in the east; the Tianshan Kunlun Mountains, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas in the west; Yunnan and Guangdong in the south; Mongolia in the north; and passing through the Taihang Mountains, the Qinling Mountains, the Funiu Mountains, the Bashan Mountains, and the Huangshan Mountains. During the War of Resistance, the institute's investigation of the Northwest and Yunnan became more detailed. The institute currently has more than 150,000 plant specimens.

The Northwest China Institute of Botany particularly focuses on the research of forest machinery.

Institute of History and Philology

The work of the Institute of History and Philology is in two aspects: archeology and history. Mr. Xu Bingchang researches ancient history, Mr. Huang Wenbi sorts out the materials obtained by the Northwest Science Expedition, and Mr. Su Bingqi sorts out the materials unearthed by the institute at the Doujihe site in Bin County, Shaanxi. Mr. Feng Jiasheng researched the history of the Liao Dynasty and the evolution of the invention of gunpowder. Mr. Wang Jingru researched the history and writing of Xixia, ancient Xinjiang, and the society of the Sui and Tang Dynasties.

Statistically, in the past eighteen years, the colleagues of the academy have published about 500 research papers and investigation reports. The academy and various research institutes have published more than 50 kinds of publications and books, such as series, collections, special reports, reports, and compilations, most of which are contributions from the period of 1929 to 1937.

Memories of the Golden Age

Looking back at the period from 1929 to 1937, it was truly the golden age of Chinese scientific work. At that time, several small research centers in the country worked hard on research, creating a strong research atmosphere. After Chinese scientists published their scientific research work done in China, they often attracted the attention of foreign scientists and were often cited by foreign scientists. Therefore, Chinese scientists have added a lot of glory to the Chinese nation. I just said that the academy's colleagues made particularly many contributions during this period, which is something we can be proud of. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, colleagues still engaged in scientific work under various unsuitable conditions in the interior, and at the same time helped solve some practical problems. After the restoration, colleagues, despite financial difficulties and hardships in life, still buried themselves in the laboratory to seek the truth, which is all worthy of praise.

Colleagues Sacrificed Heroically

From the War of Resistance to now, we have lost many colleagues. Mr. Lu Dingheng, Director of the Institute of Zoology; Mr. Zheng Dazhang, a full-time researcher at the Institute of Radium Studies; Mr. Zhong Guanguang, a researcher at the Institute of Botany; Mr. Shen Jianshi, a corresponding researcher; and Mr. Clipp, Mr. Langevand of France, Mr. An Ganxhen, the head of the Document Section, and Mr. Chen, the head of the Accounting Section, all died of illness around this period. Not long ago, Wang Hanchen, a collector from the Institute of Botany, fell into a mountain gully and died while collecting specimens in Diancang Mountain, Dali, which was particularly tragic. We are holding a memorial meeting today, so we are reminded of these gentlemen.

Before the War of Resistance, the equipment of our various research institutes was considered very good, but now it is relatively backward. Science has made great progress in the past ten years, especially the progress of nuclear physics research. The earth-shattering invention of the atomic bomb is the result of the development of nuclear physics. However, this type of research requires larger-scale equipment and a larger amount of funds. The academy has added very few books and instruments in the past ten years, and the original equipment suffered considerable losses during the War of Resistance. Therefore, our equipment is relatively backward. This is obviously the general situation of research institutions across the country. However, the academy's regular expenses are not enough to apply, the temporary expenses are far from enough, and the foreign exchange obtained is even less, so the academy feels particularly difficult. We should first add the equipment that has not been added in the past ten years and make up for the losses during the War of Resistance. Then continue to work hard, and our future achievements will definitely be better.

Future Research Work

I feel that in the future, my country's scientific research work should take on a part of the responsibility that it should bear for the progress of world science. Scientific research is the foundation of industrial construction. Scientific research is like a water source, and industrial application is like a river. Without a water source, there is no river. There is no doubt that we should make China an industrialized country, capable of mass production and mass manufacturing, so that we can survive independently in the world. However, this kind of industrial construction must be coordinated with scientific research work in order to be easily successful and have progress. (Conclusion)

### Suppressing the City's Rice Prices and Stabilizing People's Livelihood: Decision to Increase Rice Rationing by 100,000 Dan

Minister Yu Comes to Shanghai to Negotiate the Shipment of Surplus Grain from Jiangxi and Hunan; Social Affairs Bureau Calls Rice Merchants for Talks to Stabilize Market Prices

The rise in rice prices intensified yesterday, soaring endlessly. Retail prices even reached 860,000 yuan per stone, approaching the 900,000 yuan mark, causing widespread panic and unease among the people of the city. Minister of Food Yu Feipeng came to Shanghai by train the night before yesterday for this reason and arrived here at 8:00 AM yesterday, immediately meeting with Mayor Wu to discuss strategies to suppress rice prices, and expedite the shipment of surplus grain from Jiangxi and Hunan. The mayor said yesterday that in order to suppress the rising rice prices, the decision was made to increase the rice ration for the poor and workers by 100,000 dan. The rice will be shipped from Jiangxi and Henan provinces to Shanghai, and the first batch of 50,000 dan will be shipped and rationed within days.

[Another report] Regarding the rice issue, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened the persons in charge of the city's rice markets again yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM for talks. Those present included rice merchants Zhang Xichao, Hu Wenan, Yin Fuxiang, Xu Mingren, Hu Hangang, Yang Wenci, as well as Ren Xianqun, standing committee member of the Civil Food Distribution Council, and Section Chief Ji Mingxuan, etc., totaling more than ten people.

Director Wu first reported that the recent surge in rice prices not only affected the livelihood of the common people, but also caused security problems. In order to maintain social stability, grain prices must be suppressed, and so on. Then, the grain merchant Hu Wenan reported that "Shanghai's population accounts for 1% of the country's total population. The city's main rice-producing areas in the past were Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, followed by Hubei and Hunan. Now it is autumn harvest time, and new rice has already entered the market. Grain prices should be stable, but instead, they are rising sharply. The reasons for the fluctuation are:

There are seven reasons for the increase

The general rise in prices affects rice prices in the producing areas. The central government's implementation of requisition, borrowing, and purchasing in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Hunan has greatly affected grain prices. The Communists are rushing to purchase grain in the producing areas. Wuhu, Anhui, which is the distribution center of grain in Anhui Province, has recently had so-called Chongsha gangs (Communist organizations) that are buying up grain regardless of price. The Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan producing areas have transportation difficulties, which hinders the transportation of food. The food business tax for this month will soon begin to be collected. Recently, the situation of grain sales in the city has revealed that the "porter gangs" are buying rice, and their behavior seems very suspicious. Grain merchants in the city have tens of thousands of bags of grain waiting to be shipped to Shanghai, but they cannot be delivered due to transportation difficulties. Finally, Director Wu hoped that the persons in charge of each market would assist the government in stabilizing market prices and persuade merchants not to "hold on," and to prioritize the food of the people.

### Chongqing City Commodity Production Statistics

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 8th, Airmail] The recent production of commodities in this city, according to the statistics of the Commodity Tax Bureau, is listed as follows: From January to August 1946, 4,701.5 cases of cigarettes, 19,966 bales of cotton yarn, 2,915 cases of matches, 1,041 tons of iron, 31,000 quintals of non-metals, 1,178 quintals of metals, 377,970 tons of coal, 356,610 catties of native tobacco, and 12,479 supplements of native wine.

Category 4: General cargo freight rates: Chongqing to Yichang 1,383,000 yuan per ton, Chongqing to Hankou 2,074,000 yuan per ton, Chongqing to Nanjing 2,575,000 yuan per ton, Chongqing to Shanghai 2,765,000 yuan per ton.

In addition, each cargo will be charged a transshipment fee of 100,000 yuan per ton, which is said to have been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for record.

### The Authorities Decide to Take Strict Measures to Curb the Rising Prices in the City

Around National Day, prices in the city skyrocketed, and rumors about financial crises were rampant, causing panic among the people. Yesterday (the 12th), a certain person in charge said that the competent authorities have decided to take strict measures. Starting from the 13th, in addition to the full deployment of economic police to step up surveillance of various markets, all relevant agencies will work together to curb the rising prices. Economic cases will be punished more severely in the future, and those who manufacture and spread rumors will be severely punished once discovered.

### Cigarette Sales Hot, Prices Rise

Yesterday, the cigarette market started poorly due to the resale of returned goods from Beijing and Hankou, and prices were suppressed. Unexpectedly, by about 9:00 AM, demand from the industry was strong, and suppliers were reluctant to sell, and the market atmosphere rose again. Cigarettes with lower prices were particularly popular, and prices were firm.

The final ten Great Britain cigarettes rose 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, while Old Gold Hademens fell 100,000 yuan. Popular brands such as Great America, Gold Mouse, Bank, Double Axe, Cress, Million Gold, and Red Man saw prices rise. Other brands saw mixed results.

### Daily Necessities Remain Strong

In the soap market, the price of raw material caustic soda rose to 34.5 million per barrel, and glycerin rose to about 5 million. Due to increased costs, factories were silent about dispatching goods, and the market was filled with strong buying interest and sellers remained firm, leading to a positive trend. As a result, in addition to Guben leveling out, Arrow Knife Huang Xiangmao soap continued to rise by 15,000 yuan, while other brands saw slight fluctuations. The price of both Beautiful and Phoenix kerosene rose by 50,000 yuan. The candle and kerosene markets were also strong.

### Affected by the "Tongtian" Permit, Hong Kong Internal Exchange Rate Falls

[Hong Kong, 6th] Last week, the financial market was filled with a bearish atmosphere. Whether it was internal exchange rates, national currency, gold, or yellow paper, the market saw repeated lows. The bearish trend was even stronger for internal exchange rates and national currency.

In addition to the tightening and then loosening of money in the domestic market after the Mid-Autumn Festival, two factors caused the fall in the national currency exchange rate. Another factor was that domestic mobile funds began to flee abroad. The restoration of the use of the "Tongtian" permit and the sudden increase in the import of materials were the surface reasons for the increased need for foreign exchange. On the inside, a surge of domestic funds came to buy imported goods, because the difference between Hong Kong foreign goods, especially industrial raw materials and other luxury goods, and domestic market prices was generally more than one-fold profit. Even if the price of the "Tongtian" permit cost 70%, merchants were happy to operate.

### On Restricting Credit Cooperatives from Issuing Checks

— Kang Yuanshou

The lower section of last month's newspaper reported: "To crack down on illegal negotiable instruments and safeguard the interests of banks and money houses, the Ministry of Finance has issued a circular to all banks and money houses, instructing them not to accept checks issued by credit cooperatives after a certain date. It has also requested the Ministry of Social Affairs to instruct all credit cooperatives to comply with the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Law, prohibiting them from acting as the drawee of checks and ordering them to recall all checkbooks that have already been issued. At the same time, it has requested the Ministry of Judicial Administration to instruct courts at all levels not to regard checks with credit cooperatives as the drawee as legal negotiable instruments." An official from the Ministry of Finance also explained, stating, "Credit cooperatives are not financial institutions. According to the Negotiable Instruments Law, non-financial institutions are not allowed to issue checks. According to the Economic Emergency Measures, the establishment of new banks and money houses is restricted in eighteen areas, including Beijing and Shanghai," and so on. Presumably, this news is not fabricated. If the Ministry of Finance's circular is indeed issued, credit cooperatives nationwide will suffer a blow. In order to protect the development of the financial industry and promote the advancement of cooperative undertakings, I believe there are points that must be clarified in terms of both theory and legal system, in the hope of dispelling the above misunderstandings and ensuring that cooperative undertakings and the financial industry complement each other. This is the sole intention of this article.

"Cooperation" is a method of organization and management. In modern economic society, the cooperative organizational form can be said to be between the two methods of state-owned and privately-owned, or it can be said to be above the two organizations of public and private. The reasons for this can be the subject of a dedicated book, and there is no time to elaborate here. The scope of cooperative organization and management is extremely broad. At present, all kinds of public and private enterprises can be organized and managed in a cooperative manner, and we believe that this is the most rational way to organize and manage them. In modern countries, whether capitalist, socialist, or communist, they all allow the adoption of the cooperative system, which shows that the cooperative organizational method is not only applicable to the operation of various enterprises, but also universally applicable to various countries and societies. Our country has long adopted the cooperative system. The ruling Kuomintang regarded the cooperative movement as one of the seven major movements twenty years ago and vigorously promoted it. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings included agricultural cooperation, industrial cooperation, trading cooperation, banking cooperation (i.e., what is now known as "credit cooperatives"), and so on. Later, the cooperative policy of the Three Principles of the People was implemented. Over the past twenty years, various cooperative organizations have spread throughout the country. Now, we are awaiting the development of cooperative businesses to make their operations smooth and substantial, so that they can become the pillar of the new social economy and transform the old economic society. Now, any department of our government must follow the established central strategy to support the promotion of cooperative undertakings. Any individual in the country who has a desire to reform the current economic system will also make concerted efforts to develop cooperative businesses. Today, any cooperative in the country, as long as its business operations do not violate cooperative principles and cooperative laws and regulations, and there is no private gain or fraudulent activity, we have no reason to intentionally strike any blow to its business advancement. We also firmly believe that no organization or individual dares to intentionally strike any blow. We sincerely hope that those who unintentionally strike at cooperative undertakings will become aware of themselves and not fall into the old rut of the capitalist economic system, but instead turn around and become revolutionary pioneers in transforming the social economy.

Credit cooperation in cooperative undertakings is a cooperative undertaking that manages deposit and loan businesses and circulates finance among members. A credit cooperative that operates banking businesses for financial circulation, in other words, is a bank with special characteristics. This is the "banking cooperation" that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of, and it is also the people's bank that was commonly referred to in the past. Cooperative organizations were originally organizations for the economic weaker to become self-reliant. Credit cooperatives are also credit unions for the general economic weaker to help themselves, help each other, save themselves, and save others. This is the general public's own bank. Because they are economically weak, they feel the urgency of financial circulation even more, and there is even more need to organize credit cooperatives. This is enough to illustrate that credit cooperatives have a natural tendency to grow. Who has reason to say that the general public should not be self-reliant? Who can deny the credit cooperatives of the people's bank type organized by the general public? Who has reason to say that credit cooperatives are by no means engaged in businesses equivalent to banks? I don't think anyone can bear to strike a blow to a truly self-help movement of the people. As for the official from the Ministry of Finance saying that credit cooperatives are not financial institutions, it is obviously a kind of erroneous misinterpretation, which does not understand the actual content, tasks, and goals of credit cooperatives. As for the Economic Emergency Measures restricting the establishment of new banks and money houses in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, credit cooperatives were not mentioned. Moreover, the promulgation of the plan was intended to stabilize the economy and restrict general commercial banks and money houses from speculating and manipulating, while credit cooperatives are measures to stabilize the economy of the majority of the people. Today's credit cooperatives have no awareness or ability to speculate and manipulate, so they should not be included in the restrictions on establishment from the outset. So far, we have not heard of any credit cooperatives disrupting the market and undermining the economy, but instead, we have first seen the order to strike credit cooperatives.

In recent years, the number of public and private banks and money houses in the country has increased indiscriminately, credit has expanded, and business has developed, forming a trend of畸形 development, which has indeed created a torrent of financial capital, and echoes and colludes with commercial capital, land capital, and bureaucratic capital to seek personal gain, resulting in the decline of production, rising prices, economic disorder, and the crisis of social collapse. The formation of this phenomenon has many reasons, but it has little to do with the people's financial institutions that are currently budding, namely credit cooperatives. On the contrary, it is the banks and money houses that should be held more responsible. If we still use the reason of protecting the banks and money houses, and allow the existing banks and money houses to exclusively have the right to issue checks, and do not allow members of credit cooperatives to use the most convenient negotiable instruments for withdrawing deposits, forcing the general public to only deal with ordinary commercial banks and money houses, is this not unfair?

Furthermore, based on the actual business of India's industries today, and based on the facts, those who can have dealings with commercial banks and money houses are either the extremely wealthy, or the powerful merchants, or the high-ranking officials, or the influential people, or at least the general merchants who are more powerful in seeking profit. Banking business only interacts with the upper class of society, and the vast majority of the people can only look at it and not enter, especially the peasants and workers do not even know where the doors of the banks and money houses are open, how can they expect them to provide financing? This financial specialization is only a noble embellishment of society, and does not have a broad mass base. As a result, a dangerous phenomenon arises, that is, the so-called underground money houses emerge. The so-called underground money houses are just a general term for money houses that have not been registered and licensed by the government. The business they operate is also the business of financial circulation and money houses. However, upon examination, the business objects of underground money houses are purely small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the common people. The majority of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the common people suffer from the lack of institutions for financial circulation, and have no choice but to go to underground money houses to exchange what they have for what they lack. This shows that society first needs underground money houses, and then underground money houses are produced. We must diagnose the pathology of society before we can hope to have a remedy that treats the symptoms; otherwise, no matter how much we suppress and investigate underground money houses, underground money houses will continue to emerge. The Ministry of Finance may not be able to completely deny this fact. Now, credit cooperatives are allowed by national law, and are also registered by the local government, so they cannot be called underground money houses; however, the business objects of credit cooperatives are precisely the small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the general public that were previously grasped by underground money houses. However, these business objects themselves have become the masters of the credit cooperative, and the roles of owner and guest are integrated, which is very harmonious. Through the mediation of the cooperative, the problems of financial circulation and profit distribution among small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the general public can be reasonably resolved at the same time. Since small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the common people have a way to obtain financing, the reason for the existence of underground money houses can be expected to disappear accordingly. All credit cooperatives then establish normal business relationships with banks and money houses. In this way, they have guided the general public into the doors of banks and money houses, and have established indirect dealings, which means that banks and money houses have a broad mass base, absorbing the idle funds of the broad masses and channeling them into legitimate uses. The top and bottom can converge, and the broad masses and banks and money houses both benefit. Such a complete and rich harvest almost entirely relies on credit cooperatives as a mediator. Therefore, today's credit cooperatives are nothing less than a bridge between the common people and the banks. The banks and money houses must deeply understand this reason, and express their sincere desire to support credit cooperatives. Now, many enlightened people in banks and money houses have indeed understood this great truth of co-existence and co-prosperity, so how can the administrative institutions managing financial business and the Ministry of Finance not understand this great truth? Therefore, I believe that this misunderstanding can be expected to dissipate immediately, and the Ministry of Finance will change its attitude and will also support credit cooperatives.

Now, let's explain from the legal system that credit cooperatives are financial institutions and are not subject to the restrictions of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and can issue checks. Now, Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Cooperative Law stipulates: "To promote financial circulation, to provide members with the necessary funds for production or manufacturing, and to accept deposits from members." This is the basic business of credit cooperatives. Article 5 of the same law stipulates: "Cooperatives that operate the businesses in Paragraph 4 of Article 3 may, with the approval of the competent authority, accept deposits from non-members." Article 2 of the current Banking Law stipulates: "The term 'banking business' in this law refers to the following: 1. Accepting various deposits,... 3. Handling various loans or discounting negotiable instruments...." Article 16 of the same law stipulates: "Anyone who regularly accepts currency or funds, regardless of whether the method of acceptance is by giving checks or deposit books or receipts or loan certificates or promissory notes or other similar proof documents, shall be regarded as banking business." Article 123 of the current Negotiable Instruments Law stipulates: "The drawee of a check shall be a bank or money house...." Upon reviewing the current laws listed, no matter how they are interpreted in combination, credit cooperatives are all financial institutions, or at least should be in the category of "regarded as banking business." Since they are financial institutions, they can legally issue checks. Moreover, a check is a type of contractual negotiable instrument. The contractual negotiable instrument act between the credit cooperative and the depositor only needs to be approved by the parties involved to take effect, and the law does not prohibit it. The Cooperative Law, the Banking Law, and the Negotiable Instruments Law are all laws promulgated by the National Government, and the responsibility for their interpretation does not belong to the Ministry of Finance. Moreover, the competent cooperative authority in the central government is the Ministry of Social Affairs. Any changes to national cooperative affairs must be discussed and agreed upon by the Ministry of Social Affairs before being jointly implemented, so that it is appropriate. If the Ministry of Finance is concerned about preventing credit cooperatives from滥用 issuing checks, it should also promptly consult with the Ministry of Social Affairs to properly establish management measures. A unilateral circular cannot be convincing. Moreover, whether the use of checks is beneficial or not, and whether there are abuses, is a common problem for all check issuers, and is by no means a unique problem for credit cooperatives. Could it be that the Ministry of Finance can issue a circular ordering all banks and money houses to stop issuing checks altogether because a certain bank or money house's checks have some problems?

In summary, today, the Chinese government should not passively restrict or strike at the affairs of credit cooperatives, but should actively guide them to the right path. It is best for the Ministries of Social Affairs and Finance to jointly discuss strict management measures to prevent them from being exploited by criminals. The operators of current credit cooperatives should also be aware of the need to be vigilant and strive to complete their tasks.

### Mary Ma

— Shi Jimei

One

Mary Ma, is Ma Mary; calling Miss Ma's honorable name is really awkward, if you affectionately call her Mary directly, then it's no different from Liu Mary or Zhu Mary, because there are too many young ladies who use Mary as their beautiful name nowadays. Of course, she also has a foreign name, Mary Ma, but her group of friends, like-minded people, all feel that our inherent culture has a need to be preserved, therefore, a compromise solution arose, and everyone calls her Mary Ma.

However, initially we called her Ma Mary, later, how did it evolve into "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application" Mary Ma? When did that bit of "inspiration" begin? It's already hard to remember clearly, so that historic day cannot be verified.

Two

Mary Ma is in the prime of her beauty. —— Every year on April 10th (of course, the Western calendar), in the spring with fragrant flowers and singing birds, we are invited to attend her birthday party. In her exquisite and beautiful small living room, I remember I have had this honor for five years. Her walnut cake, delicious apple pudding, all kinds of clever games, the smile like a rose, the voice like singing... I remember them all clearly, what I can't figure out is her age. The year before last, she told me she was two years older than her younger sister, but this year, Eileen Ma said she was four years younger than her older sister. Anna Belle Lee said she was probably twenty-six, and Louise Zhao said she was only twenty-three. In short, although everyone knows her birthday is April 10th, her age is a mystery, which is another thing that cannot be verified.

Mary Ma is very beautiful. Our history books mention four beauties who could make fish sink, geese fall, the moon hide, and flowers feel ashamed, but Mary Ma does not look like a Chinese person. She said: "George Chen said I look like Olivia De Havilland, I don't know if it's true?" Of course, we dutifully nodded our heads vigorously, chiming in and saying she did, calling out "Olivia De Havilland" a few more times after Mary Ma. During the enemy-occupied period, Western films were banned, so several Japanese stars were popular for a while, among whom the most beautiful was Mieko Takamine. Once, Mary Ma said to me: "Someone said I look like her." I forgot to ask her if it was George Chen. A middle school student knows that if A=B, and B=C, then C=A must also be true, but I can't see any similarities between Mieko Takamine and Olivia De Havilland.

But, whether she's twenty-three or twenty-six, Mary Ma is still young. Whether she's Mieko Takamine or Olivia De Havilland, Mary Ma is always beautiful. So it is said: Mary Ma is in the prime of her youthful beauty, no one can deny this statement.

Three

Mary Ma is from Shanghai. This point cannot be verified either, but there are words to prove it, so it shouldn't be wrong.

We don't know much about her family situation: we only know that her father wears Western suits, and they are very sharp suits, her mother's hair is styled in a hair salon on a monthly basis, they don't call their parents "Aba" or "Muma", but "Daddy" and "Mommy", her eldest brother has many foreign friends, her second brother got married at the International Hotel, the officiant and introducer were all well-known celebrities, I forgot the names of the celebrities, but anyway, they were celebrities, Eileen's piano playing is outstanding, her younger brother is "kissed up to" by teachers at school... All of this was personally told by Mary Ma. It shouldn't be wrong.

In her exquisite small living room, there are fresh flowers in vases, the calendar is torn off every day; she never reads tabloids, and it is said that she doesn't read Chinese newspapers much, she always reads foreign newspapers; she always listens to Western music on the radio, she doesn't even like popular Chinese songs, let alone storytelling and Shaoxing opera. She goes to church to listen to sermons every Sunday, although they are not a Christian family, they always remember to say a "Hallelujah" before meals (Mary Ma's nanny and elder sister will also say it), every time the telephone rings, when she picks up the receiver, she never says "Wei". I have witnessed all of this with my own eyes, so of course it can't be wrong.

Four

The first time I saw her was still at school. After the winter vacation ended and school started, on the day of registration, our group had just changed from freshmen to old students, and we were quite smug, so we pointed and scrutinized those students who had just been admitted! Just like others used to do to us.

In that dim corridor, everyone's eyes lit up, it turned out a beauty was walking by. In the cold winter weather, she wore the hairstyle of the dancer named Zaza in "Dance Palace Wind and Moon", a foreign red robe, a white coat, and her high heels made a clicking sound on the ground. She walked extremely fast, we even forgot to pay attention to her face, we only felt the fragrance of powder, a kind of dignified and luxurious demeanor, sacred and inviolable. When we remembered we should take a closer look, she had already walked gracefully into the director's office.

After a while, two senior male students walked out of the director's office, they were talking, their faces showing extremely funny smiles.

"Hey, I know who she is, my sister's classmate's brother's friend's lover from a year ago..."

"Nonsense, what's her name?"

"Her name is Ma—" He scratched his head, "Ma" wouldn't come out.

"Her name is Ma?"

"Ah, her name is Ma Mary."

"Hmm, the name fits the person, she should be Ma Mary, but someone like that should study sociology, or English literature, why is she studying political science?"

"Why can't she? Your thinking is so strange? There's no such stipulation on the enrollment rate."

"Someone like her..."

"Women are natural politicians, have you forgotten? Especially a woman like Ma Mary, she is an excellent politician."

"Are you insulting politicians? Or are you satirizing Ma Mary?"

"Neither, but Ma Mary, she—"

"Oh, Mr. Wang," Mary Ma called out in surprise, coming out of the director's office, hurrying forward to shake hands, with a face full of smiles, friendly, "like meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land": "I came looking for you as soon as I arrived, and your Miss Jiang; how is your younger sister? I haven't seen her in a long time, I really miss her..."

That Mr. Wang turned his head halfway, also with a face full of smiles, but a bit awkward, unnatural.

Five

As for how I became familiar with her, it was a year after that. In order to study "Civil Law" together, I had the good fortune to sit next to Mary Ma. Our civil law professor was an old man, often in poor health and absent from class, and often busy in court and unable to come, so there were a few hours when I could avoid listening to the boring and rigid general and specific provisions of civil law, and chat with Mary Ma. From her, I learned many things I didn't know before, as well as knowledge and skills not in books, for example: what kind of face should have what kind of hairstyle, nylon stockings worn inside out are better than worn right side out if the fabric is good, which brand of leather shoes is good, which photo studio takes the best photos, the foreign female ticket taker at the Cathay Theatre is not as "interesting" as the one at the Grand Theatre, when making a cake how much flour should be added to how much water, an old men's woolen coat can be made into a pair of shoe covers for winter, don't chew gum while dancing... In the blink of an eye a year passed, my "Civil Law" earned four credits, and I also absorbed much "knowledge outside of the textbook", although I am too unfilial to be able to apply what I learned, but when I think about how I am not as ignorant as before, I remember the source of the water when drinking it, and I sincerely thank Mary Ma.

What I should especially be grateful for is that she taught me almost all of these things unconditionally. Of course, there was an exchange of mutual benefit at first, she said to me: "Your Mandarin pronunciation is pleasant, starting tomorrow, will you be my Mandarin teacher?"

I specifically bought a copy of Cao Yu's "Under a Skylight", so it would be interesting to read, but in less than three days, Mary Ma frowned: "It's difficult to read, my tongue can't roll properly." So I changed to "Tragedy on the Lake", because there were no northern dialects, Mary Ma said again, "There are ghosts inside, I'm scared, I'll have nightmares at night, I'm so afraid." I was amazed by these opinions of hers, so Mary Ma is so superficial? However, I am only her Mandarin teacher, not a Chinese teacher, what business is it of mine to meddle in these matters?

However, in the end, not even one book was finished, and our "Mandarin class" died a natural death, because she was so "short of breath", why should I be "self-indulgent"?

Mary Ma's attitude toward everything foreign is not just blind faith, it's simply passionate love, crazy passionate love. "The moon is better when it's foreign," of course, is a matter of course, in fact, even dust and ants are seen by Mary Ma as better if they are imported than domestic. Chinese film companies can't make good films, Chinese tailors can only make the same old cheongsams, the patterns of Chinese fabrics are mostly countrified, Chinese children always drag their snotty noses, Chinese old ladies hold prayer beads instead of Bibles and crucifixes, Chinese lovers can't even walk properly on the street, there are rarely one or two pairs as smart as foreigners, either the woman is coy, or the man is extremely fierce; ... In short, everything Chinese is bad, except for Mary Ma.

I heard that returned students are more Westernized than foreigners, but Mary Ma is even more Westernized than returned students; she eats sandwiches, she doesn't even look at fried dough sticks, coffee and Longjing tea both have a bit of bitterness, but the former is bitter with flavor, the latter is bitter for no reason; she never watches Chinese movies, she doesn't even watch sophisticated plays, when there are no Western films, she listens to concerts if she can't see operas, she watches even if she doesn't understand, she listens next time even if she doesn't understand; she is a loyal customer of Coty and Max Factors, if anyone uses Butterfly cream, Mary Ma's pretty face immediately puts on a cute and annoying expression; "Eww!" She usually likes to chew gum and chocolate, probably learned from American girls, the style of her coat, even foreign shops along Jing'an Temple Road rarely have it, because Mary Ma is ahead of her time, her clothes are a "crystallization" of the heroines in foreign films and the female models in foreign magazines, adopting the essence of both and custom-made.

In addition, Mary Ma also has a pet dog, the nationality of that dog is unknown, but his ancestral home is definitely not China, I can say with certainty, the dog's beautiful name is Sisi, according to Chinese rankings, Sisi should be related to Mary, but the East wind never blows to the West, then this misunderstanding will naturally not happen.

Seven

If I were writing a biography for Mary, there are three things that should not be left out.

It seems like the year we were juniors, when school had just started, when chatting, everyone talked about the courses they were taking this semester, one classmate said: "It's really hard to study this year, all the books are in the original language."

Mary Ma had a strange look on her face: "All in the original language? Then how can "Chinese Philosophy History"—"

That pretentious one said: "Indeed, "Chinese" Philosophy History is also in the "original language"."

We were all speechless. —— This is the first thing.

There is another thing that I cannot forget, at that time we had already graduated, one weekend afternoon, I accompanied Mary Ma to meet two male classmates in front of the American Church on Avenue Petain, to discuss some matters about the class reunion, Mary Ma had arranged to meet them at four o'clock, we arrived there at three fifty-five, unexpectedly those two male classmates were late, so Mary Ma was very unhappy, and pulled me to walk towards Avenue Grouchy, turning onto Route Tenant. She grumbled angrily: "How can those boys be so unreasonable? I agreed to meet at four o'clock, but they made people wait." She leisurely strolled, chatting, for half an hour, suddenly it started raining, then she called a rickshaw to the church. From afar she saw the two latecomers standing at the door, and immediately instructed me: "Look at those two people, I really want to make them suffer a bit; when we see them in a little while, don't say we've been here before." Of course, I respectfully obeyed her orders. The rickshaw stopped in front of the church, Mary Ma showed an expression adept at socializing, jumped out of the car, and said: "I'm so sorry, we had a little matter." Those two quickly said, "It's okay, just a little bit." I looked at my watch, it was quarter to five, their clothes were wet from the rain, we spent the rickshaw fare twice.

Once, Mary Ma invited us for "afternoon tea", and unexpectedly there was a Chinese snack, I happily exclaimed: "Mary Ma, this is really great, silver thread rolls are my favorite."

Mary Ma quickly brought the plate of silver thread rolls to me: "Mommy just hired a new cook, he used to be at Liang Garden."

I said, "That's right, Liang Garden, no wonder it's made so well, that's a Henan restaurant."

Mary Ma shook her head: "What Henan Hunan, I can't remember them clearly either, Chinese place names are always like that, look at foreign place names, they are so much easier to read."

I felt that the easiest thing to do was to just eat the silver thread rolls, and not bother her with chattering and causing trouble, so I didn't open my mouth. —— This is the third thing.

Eight

Recently, I haven't seen Mary Ma in a long time, I heard that she will soon marry Alexander Ding, who just returned from the United States. I haven't seen Alexander Ding, I only heard that he is not from Shanghai, I hope he is not from Henan, Hunan, Hebei, or Hubei, otherwise, since Mary Ma can't remember Chinese place names clearly, wouldn't Alexander Ding's hometown be as unverifiable as Sisi's ancestral home?

### An Inch of Rivers and Mountains, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

This honest man continued his analysis:

"Your mission number, is probably a 'seven'.........right? Or it's an agreed-upon code, - outside the door is a 'seven', and this room of yours also has a 'seven' - although it's number twenty-seven, maybe it's because of that number seven, seventeen, thirty-seven are already inhabited...... this is just my wild guess; maybe it's just a coincidence...... but......

"But, you probably don't fully understand the serious situation in Tianjin these days; besides this vicious dog of mine, who is just dabbling in it, the Japanese military, secret service, constabulary, police, mobilized thousands of people, to hunt down 'anti-Japanese' elements everywhere. That kind of thing, like the one that little comrade went to inquire about, happens at least two or three, four or five times a day; it's not uncommon. But you're still so brazen, setting up a code on the wall!...... You may have some special certainty, not taking the Japanese secret agents seriously, but I'm sweating for you......

"Regarding those few who just passed by the door, I also recognize them a bit. I know their organization, their work. But I have to say one honest word: they are really some 'newborn calves', fearless...... just now I chased after them, to give them a warning, but they bounced back, making me unable to step down; it really makes people feel a bit amused and annoyed; it fits what the literati say, 'unable to cry or laugh'.........'bittersweet'!........."

This "it" ranted on and on, talking non-stop, and throughout it all, he didn't hear Yaoqun open his mouth; not even "uh," "ah," "yell," "ah," "eh," these exclamatory symbols, were she willing to let out easily; as for affirmative terms like "yes," "no"; "correct," "incorrect," of course, she was even less willing to utter them. This inevitably seemed a bit "clumsy," or at least a bit unsociable or weakeningly calm, wasn't it? But isn't this kind of calmness also a kind of expression? This expressionless expression, from the other party, this "it's" point of view, could at least allow him to determine one, two, or three points about Yaoqun's foundation, couldn't it?

That's right, Yaoqun was always listening, always maintaining a state of tranquility. Between her eyebrows, besides a state of tranquility, only the slight furrowing of her brow revealed a trace of curiosity. Her countenance was originally a type of beauty, the contours of her face were naturally like they had been sculpted by a master. Eyes, eyebrows, mouth, nose, ears, cheeks, forehead, chin, all just met the conditions, all just in the right place. Especially the part of her lips, at this moment, under the condition of tranquility, although they were pursed, they were pursed very naturally, the corners of her mouth were slightly upturned, expressing the word "sweet", a sweetness that was extremely adorable.

### Touring Linggu Temple and Jiming Temple in the Rain in the Capital with Senior Wang Yimei

— Shi Chongpeng

The slanting wind turned to autumn overnight, touring Bai Xia in the rain; clouds and mists fill the valley, who can discern the peaks of Zijin?

Ancient trees line the road in thousands, birds sing in secluded leisure; the mountain peaks have already entered Mi Fu's brush, a natural splashed ink painting.

Today's mountain tour is not extravagant, clothes and shoes soaked and mottled; climbing the building still wants to exhaust a thousand miles, but the misty air obscures the nearby peaks.

Sparse branches, ancient temple, old flower king, simple and leisurely, the fragrance of generations; how envious of the recluse Lin Bu of Gushan, the beautiful story of plum and crane leaves a fragrant sentence. (Plum blossoms of Linggu Temple from the Song Dynasty)

Don't blame the lack of opportunity for a boat ride, leaning on a cane to climb the Jiuxiao Tower; the mountain light in the rain floats green above the city, the lotus leaves slant in the wind, the green covers the whole state.

Hearing the rooster crow in the autumn wind and autumn rain, a unique feeling arises from touching the scenery; across the bank, the willow embankment turns white waves, the lake and mountains swallow and spit out the ancient capital.

Even though not yet entered the water and cloud homeland, ten miles of misty waves spread a green canopy; the luxury of the Six Dynasties leaves regretful events, the Rouge Well water still has fragrance.

The drizzling rain evokes nostalgia, the gilded South Dynasty is infinitely sad; several rounds of temple bells ring more urgently in the cold, on the way home, I compose another travel poem.

### Is Mutation a Chemical Change?

— Hao Tianhe

In genetics, mutation is assumed to occur due to a chemical change. This change must occur in many gene units on the chromosome, or at least in one gene unit. This mutated gene is often as stable as a normal gene. Stability means it can produce the same mutated gene as itself and start a new genetic system. It is believed that without mutation, life would never evolve beyond its original starting point. However, the mechanical method of important steps is still unknown. Since H. J. Muller used artificial methods such as X-rays to induce mutations, a new avenue has been opened for the mutation problem, and many new facts about this problem have slowly begun to emerge. X-rays can break chromosomes, and when many fragments split down and reconnect, a change can occur, much like natural mutation. As for the correlation between the quality of radiation and the form and rate of mutation, it has also been discovered, and the number of ionizations required, as well as the size of the sensitive gene volume, can be estimated. However, the actual state of gene mutation and chromosome breakage is still as mysterious as before.

It is conceivable that X-rays are destructive to chromosomes, and their destructive power is considerable. If a gentler method is used to induce mutations, the steps involved may be seen more clearly. Since the discovery that ultraviolet rays can also induce mutations, there has been some progress in this area. The effective wavelengths for nucleic acids and certain protein components, although sometimes helpful in analyzing the steps of mutation, have absorption limits. Researchers in radiation genetics have pointed out that the first step in mutation is the absorption of a quantum of energy by a certain component molecule of the chromosome. However, relying solely on wavelength has not revealed very reliable effects. The differences between the effects of ultraviolet rays and shorter rays such as X-rays and gamma rays (r-ray) are not yet clear, but it may be helpful in analyzing the steps of mutation.

Chemical drugs that can cause mutations should be particularly effective as tools for exploring mutations. As we assume, mutation is due to a chemical change, so if we have sufficient knowledge of the chemical drug, we can not only understand the effect of the chemical drug itself, but also understand the nature of the gene. Moreover, during the trial process, we can hope to find some chemical mutagens that may have special effects on certain individual genes. If such a substance is discovered, it will not only arouse strong theoretical interest, but also open up a long-awaited path to produce mutations. In other words, mutation can be controlled by human power.

The work of exploring chemical mutagens has been going on for more than 20 years. For the purpose of exploration, scientists have selected a wide range of substances: such as iodine, ammonia, metal compounds, and various carcinogens [Note 1]. These are just a few of the many substances being tested. However, the results obtained are all clearly negative, that is, no significant positive results have been obtained since the experiment began in 1940. This shows that a chemical mutagen must have special properties. It must select specific substances in the gene to act on, and at the same time, it cannot destroy the cell itself containing that substance. Therefore, before finding a suitable and effective substance, we have to use many items for testing, and we are still demanding it. From the records of various studies, they are all indicating various physiological conditions, such as age, gender, hunger, and the type of factor itself, on the impact of mutation. If the chemical conditions that occur in the organism itself can affect the steps of mutation, then it is possible to obtain the same result after adding chemical substances from the outside.

Mustard gas can inhibit cell division. Based on this fact, some people use it for this type of experiment. However, mustard gas, like X-rays, will burn cells and is not easy to heal. Even if it recovers, it still has a tendency to rupture. In addition, it was found that the epidermal tissue of ovariectomized mice, after being immersed in a dilute solution of mustard gas, the lined division of cells will stop, and the stop of division will continue for several weeks. Originally, the cells in that tissue could maintain normal division if stimulated by estrogen. Everyone knows that after X-ray radiation, it can cause chromosomes to break and recombine, and at the same time inhibit the ability of cells to reproduce. The reason is half due to the mechanical disturbance of lined division and half due to cell death. Although that cell has assembled the fragments of chromosomes into new chromosomes and distributed them into daughter cells, the daughter cells did not receive a complete and normal set of chromosomes, resulting in death. Therefore, mustard gas, like X-rays, may also have a direct effect on chromosomes and prevent cell division.

In the autumn of 1940, scientists began to test whether mustard gas could produce gene mutations and chromosome reorganization. The materials they used were fruit flies. First, the fruit flies were placed in a closed room filled with mustard gas, and then placed in a container, and the air and mustard gas were extracted from it. The initial results seemed to show signs of success. Both males and females became infertile, and the degree of damage depended on the amount of medicine used. The reason for the elimination of their reproductive power can be found in two unrelated reasons. The phenomenon of sterility caused by X-rays will also have these two reasons: first, the production of gametes is prevented, so there are no eggs or sperm available for use. Second, even if the egg is fertilized and becomes a zygote, the mortality rate of the zygote is quite high. A more important result is that the mortality rate of the eggs produced after normal female fruit flies are mated with male fruit flies that have been treated with mustard gas is also very high. The most appropriate explanation is probably that after the male fruit flies have been treated, their sperm have not lost their activity, but mustard gas, like X-rays, can also cause the chromosomes of the sperm to break and reorganize.

In order to prove that mustard gas has an effect on chromosomes, genetic methods should be used to explore mutations. Male fruit flies can be mated with virgin female fruit flies, and then check whether mutations occur in their second generation. Early mutation research work, as well as recent genetic research work, have not used fruit flies to do experiments thoroughly, and have encountered difficulties in eliminating most of the artificial errors, because a trained researcher can point out several abnormalities, but this extraordinary nature is often overlooked by people with insufficient experience and inaccurate observation. In the study of fruit fly genetics, this main difficulty has been removed by the method designed by Muller. Without that method, quantitative analysis of the heredity of radiant energy would be impossible. The main point of that method is to only explore lethal mutation (Lethal mutation). This mutation can prevent the development of the individual, so to see whether there is a lethal mutation, just check the offspring of the entire group of fruit flies, whether it exists or not, it is very easy to distinguish. This method can minimize personal errors, and at the same time, can check a large number of samples without too much effort. The famous CLB test method is particularly useful for large-scale tests. That method is used to test sex-linked lethal genes. This lethal gene is located on the sex chromosome. Males have only one, while females have two. A sex-linked lethal gene on the male sex chromosome can prevent the development of males, and this gene usually does not seriously hinder the development of females. In the CLB test, each treated or controlled sex chromosome will eventually appear in the second generation of the entire group of fruit flies. If a lethal gene occurs on the sex chromosome, the entire group of fruit flies must all be female. Of course, this fact can be quickly observed even by untrained people.

The first CLB test done with mustard gas started in April 1941. The results were very impressive and unexpected. The natural occurrence rate of sex-linked lethal genes in animals raised in the laboratory is very low, only reaching 1%. However, after treatment with mustard gas, the lethal genes on the sex chromosomes reached 90 out of 1,300, which means that the mutation rate accounts for more than 7%. If mustard gas was not used, only three sex-linked lethal genes were found on the same number of chromosomes, which means that the mutation rate under normal circumstances only accounts for 0.2%. The same results have been obtained before with X-rays or other high radiant energy. Continued experiments fully prove this fact, even exceeding the first result. The lethal gene rate actually reached 24%. A higher percentage is probably unlikely to occur, because the higher the mutation rate, the more severe the extinction rate also becomes.

### Wonderful Pollen

— Sun Jia Ling

Various kinds of pollen are flying in the air around us. Although they cannot be seen with the naked eye, they all contain organic life. These male plants are riding on the wind, pursuing their coming happiness! Whether this fluttering is only a foot away, or hundreds of miles away, they have the same goal—to reach the female flower of the same species and match up.

If there were no pollen, plants would no longer bear fruit, flowers and plants would wither, and we would not be able to eat various fruits.

Although it contains unlimited vitality, these pollens are as fragile as a candle in the wind. Thirst and starvation are common occurrences. Even a drop of dew is enough to kill it, because pollen grains expand and rupture when they encounter water, and the sperm cells are directly exposed to ultraviolet rays, and they immediately lose their lives. A grain of corn pollen can survive for up to 36 hours in a natural environment. Only a very small number of pine pollen can survive for several months.

When carefully observed under a microscope, various pollens have the cleanliness of snowflakes, the form of stalactites, and surprising magnificence. These delicate fine grains, even the largest pumpkin pollen, are only one-hundredth of an inch thick, while the pollen of the forget-me-not grass growing on the Alps is one hundred times smaller!

There are no pine forests on the large island of Greenland in the isolated Arctic Ocean, but biologists have found pine pollen there (pollen of pine trees). Unexpectedly, the pine tree closest to Greenland is actually 400 miles away in Labrador. This light pine pollen can travel across the ocean and fly 400 miles away!

### New Elements

— Yu

Before discussing new elements, let us briefly describe the structure of the atom. At the beginning of the 19th century, Dalton proved by experimental methods that matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.

Later, after many years and the research of many scientists, it was found that atoms are composed of complex particles called electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are tiny particles with a negative charge. The mass is 9.035×10-28 grams. The outer shell of each elemental atom is surrounded by different numbers of electrons. Protons are tiny particles with a positive charge equal to the electric charge of electrons, and the mass is 2,000 times that of electrons. Neutrons are neutral particles formed by the tight combination of electrons and protons, and the mass is the same as that of protons. The atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. The charge it carries depends on the protons, and the mass is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, which is the mass of the atom.

We know that atoms can be divided into two categories: radioactive atoms and stable atoms. Radioactive atoms can emit LB and r rays. The L particle is the atomic nucleus of the gas atom, which is organized by two protons and neutrons. The other is an electron similar to the speed of light. B radiation is a product of the neutron turning into a proton. r radiation is a wave radiation or a high-energy photon.

At present, the production of new elements is all achieved by bombarding the atomic nucleus with L particles or neutrons. The atomic bombardment technology was first used by Rutherford to use L particles emitted by radioactive substances to bombard the atomic nucleus and emit protons. From this, it can be seen that atoms can be artificially transformed into another type of atom.

The element uranium belongs to a type of radioactive element. There is an isotope with an atomic weight of 238. If neutrons are injected into the nucleus of uranium 238, it will transform into Neptunium, with an atomic number of 93. It is sexually active, so its lifespan is very short. Neptunium becomes Plutonium through B-ray transformation, with an atomic number of 94. It was discovered in 1941 that it has the same fission characteristics as Uranium and almost the same radioactivity. It can be converted into uranium 235 and emit L particles.

The transformation of uranium into a new element is due to the injection of neutrons into the atomic nucleus. The quality of the uranium nucleus increases and becomes unstable, and a B ray is emitted. This B particle carries a negative charge and is an electron emitted when a neutron in the atomic nucleus turns into a proton. Therefore, the nucleus has one more positive charge of proton, which makes its atomic number change from 92 to 93 and 95 and so on.

However, when L particles are used to bombard the nucleus of uranium, many new elements are produced, such as Americium with atomic number 95, translated as 镅; Curium with 96, translated as 锔 in memory of Curie; and an element 97 (Berkalium), translated as 锫. In the future, as atomic physical chemistry progresses, the discovery of new elements will increase even more.

### Man-Controlled Missiles

— Chen Fu

Sensitive soldiers often have to imagine what the Third World War would be like. U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Keith McCutcheon published an article in the June-July issue of the Naval Magazine about man-controlled missiles. If the Third World War lasts for a considerable period of time, this weapon may become a major factor in victory or defeat.

McCutcheon said that when World War I was about to end, there was often at least one new weapon invented. However, it often succeeded too late to exert its power. Airplanes were only tested in World War I, and became the main weapon in World War II. Among the new weapons in World War II, the most developed were the German V-1 and V-2 rockets. (In the eyes of the military, the atomic bomb is not a perfect weapon but a high explosive. Now it has to be transported to the target by plane, and in the future it may be transported by man-controlled missiles).

Although rockets destroyed many buildings in this war, they did not win because of them. Mr. Mai said that rockets are still imperfect weapons because they have several major shortcomings, that is, they cannot be guided by humans and cannot be controlled by humans after landing. Strictly speaking, a rocket is not a man-controlled weapon, at most it is just a long-range artillery shell.

Scientists in every powerful country are now using all their minds to find ways to eliminate these shortcomings. Mr. Mai said that they are studying physical laws and finding a suitable one to guide rockets. Television, heat, light, and sound have all been considered for application. Magnetism, electricity, and gravity have also been considered. Which country solves this problem first will have the advantage.

Mr. Mai also said that power is not a problem. Before atomic energy power can be applied, various reaction engines can be used to propel rockets. The most common reaction engine is the Turboict Engine. The front of this jet engine is an air compressor. Air is drawn into the front, mixed with fuel and burned, and becomes a high-pressure mixed gas. It is ejected from the tail at a rate of one thousand miles per hour, and its reaction force causes the rocket to move forward. When the gas is set to rush out at the tail, it makes the turbine rotate, which makes the compressor continue to work.

A relatively simple and developing rocket is the flying barrel rocket, which has no moving mechanism. Whether it is a turbojet or a flying barrel, the flame cannot reach above the high-altitude air. Because missiles flying at high altitudes must have their own rocket motors and carry oxygen like V-2.

Controlled missiles equipped with jet engines or rocket motor engines (or a combination of the two) will appear in the Third World War and will be able to have speeds of thousands of miles per hour. Engineers no longer doubt this. But the problem is how to guide and control. Mr. Mai put forward several possible methods for this.

The simplest missiles are not controlled at all, just like all V-type weapons, they can be set in advance like an alarm clock for targets in the flight path. Man-controlled missiles are directed by radio waves from the ground, ship, or airplane. Along the way, it can detect whether it is following the designated route. When approaching the target, the speed is greater. If the target emits waves such as sound, light, and heat, then the missile can follow the descent without fail.

At present, there are not many man-controlled missiles that have passed the design stage (such as the Navy's "Bat" and "Flying Island"). But Mr. Mai has predicted that this type of missile can be used in the next war after considerable improvement. Some missiles have great flight power. If they are equipped with atomic bombs, any city of the enemy will be destroyed. Because this bombing does not need to be absolutely accurate. If you want to destroy a certain enemy bomber, you don't need to use an atomic bomb, just equip it with ordinary bombs. After the launching method of missiles is improved in the future, we can see a huge submarine approaching the enemy's coast with missiles rising up, like islands coming out of a knot.

Mr. Mai believes that offense is the best defense, but he knows that the United States has never learned to steal the Pearl Harbor from Japan, so he said that the United States must have a missile that can take off in a very short period of time to resist enemy missiles.

Mr. Mai finally said that the camp newspaper needs the most improvement, because the speed of missiles can be as far as three thousand miles per hour, and it approaches fifty miles every minute. Therefore, the air defense equipment must be very sensitive and cannot easily let go of every minute of the twenty-four hours.
