### Lu National Army Tightens Encirclement, Fierce Fighting in Southeastern Mountainous Areas, Tense Situation in Southern Shanxi, No Major Changes in Northern Suiyuan

[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 3rd] The National Army has launched a large-scale annihilation campaign against the communist forces in the southeastern area of the Yimeng Mountains for several days, with unprecedentedly fierce fighting. As of the 3rd, the National Army has achieved brilliant results. Following the National Army's momentum in capturing Mengyin and Xintai, remnants of the 4th, 8th, and 9th Communist Columns attempted to avoid the main force and flee back to Yishui and Ju County. However, the National Army preemptively cut off the communist forces' retreat on the west bank of the Yi River. The main force of the communist troops, approximately 50,000 men, was heavily encircled by the National Army in the triangular area of Mengyin, Yishui, and Tangtou. Over the past four days, the National Army has gradually tightened the encirclement. Although the communist forces have made three desperate attempts to break through, all have failed. According to initial reports received on the 3rd, as many as 5,000 communist troops have been annihilated north of Qingtuo Temple and east of Duozhuang alone, and the National Army is currently expanding the gains across the board.

[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 3rd] The war situation in Shandong Province has completely shifted to a favorable position for the National Army. Recently, the communist forces' feints to the east and attacks to the west, as well as their attempts to resolve the National Army's major forces in Tai'an and seize Yanzhou from Ningyang, have all failed. The various columns participating in the fighting in the Tai'an and Ningyang areas have been entirely or partially shifted to the Yimeng Mountains in recent days. On the 3rd, fighting continued in the area east of Xintai and Mengyin, where the communist forces have been pinned down and unable to escape.

[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 3rd] According to a dispatch from Xuzhou, the National Army is fighting steadily in various locations, aiming to achieve the goal of pacifying the areas in a short period. In the Yimeng Mountains, the National Army annihilated the entire 5th Division of the 2nd Communist Column in the Qingtuo Temple area on the 2nd, and decimated the 6th Division of the same column and a part of the 7th Column in the Jiehu area.

[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 3rd] The communist forces in the southwestern areas of Tai'an and Feicheng in central Shandong are currently trapped in the National Army's pocket-shaped position. The 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th Columns, and a part of the 10th Column of the communist forces have recently retreated from southwest of Tai'an and Ningyang to the east of Culaishan and the Laiwu area for reorganization. The situation in central Shandong is expected to become clear soon. Furthermore, there are no longer any traces of communist forces in the vicinity of Qidezhen, southeast of Dakou.

[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 3rd] On the morning of the 2nd, the National Army's mopping-up forces in the Yimeng Mountains captured and encircled over 10,000 men from a part of the 9th Communist Column in the Hongshan and Dushan line, six kilometers northwest of Ge Gou.

[Our Dispatch from Taiyuan, 3rd] Fierce battles have broken out on the periphery of Taiyuan to defend the city. The communist forces have entered areas more than sixty *li* away from Taiyuan. The fierce fighting is still centered on Shouyang, with the communist forces extending more than fifty *li* west of Shouyang. The main force of the National Army is concentrated around Shouyang City to defend it firmly, while dispatching strong units to counterattack and expand in multiple directions. Fierce fighting is taking place in Yangquan, Pingding, the eastern and western edges of Yangqu, and within the borders of Yuci County.

[Our Dispatch from Taiyuan, 3rd] Two columns of communist forces are besieging the National Army at Ceshipotou between Yangquan and Shouyang, with fierce fighting underway. The communist forces invading from Meng County split into two groups and moved west. One group, numbering tens of thousands, turned south towards Shouyang City and attacked, suffering over a thousand casualties and retreating to Huangdanggou after being fiercely attacked by the National Army north of the city. The other group, numbering five to six thousand, moved west and captured Lingjingzhen, posing a threat to disrupt the eastern mountains of Taiyuan.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] Pingding County, east of Shanxi, was once again captured by communist forces on the evening of the 1st. This location is 125 kilometers from Taiyuan, on the southern side of the eastern section of the Zhengtai Railway.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] The situation in southern Shanxi has become serious. The National Army is reorganizing. The bridgehead position at Maojindu is still being defended by the National Army, with the communist forces surrounding the narrow strip of land just ten *li* from the crossing. Telecommunications with Pinglu have been cut off, and the situation is unclear. Jiexian and Yuxiang are surrounded, and local forces in Ruicheng have broken through and withdrawn south across the Yellow River.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] War situation in Shanxi: (1) The communist forces captured Zhaocheng in Huo County on the morning of the 1st.

[Our Dispatch from Xi'an, 3rd] After the recapture of Suide, Peng Dehuai, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest People's Liberation Army of the Chinese Communist Party, fled east with his horses and family to Yihezhen.

[Our Dispatch from Gui Sui, 2nd] The communist forces in northwestern Shanxi originally planned to invade north in two routes, one led by He Long, attacking Suiyuan and Baotou, and the other led by Yao Zhe, attacking Datong. However, they have now changed their route and are circumventing Taiyuan. The vanguard troops coming from Xing County have been discovered within the county borders. Furthermore, the Kang Jianmin Brigade, which recently invaded west from northern Chahar, arrived at the Baiyin Bulang Yaozi Bulang area near Wulanhua at 5 PM yesterday. The National Army cavalry is tracking and pursuing them. Wulanhua is heavily defended, and there are unlikely to be major changes in the situation in northern Suiyuan.

### Tangyin in Northern Henan Falls, Sun Dianying Missing After Issuing a Brief Will, Provincial Assembly Sends Representatives to Beijing to Request Assistance

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd] Tangyin was captured by the communist forces at 7 PM on the 2nd. Since the morning of that day, the communist forces used over a hundred Japanese artillerymen to shell the city walls with heavy artillery. By about 3 PM, much of the fortifications had been destroyed, leading to fierce street fighting. By 7 PM, the city had fallen. According to reconnaissance aircraft reports, the fighting at the time was extremely fierce, with extraordinarily heavy casualties on both sides. Corpses were scattered inside and outside the city, and the city walls were stained red with blood. The city had been under siege since April 5th, for a total of 17 days. Sun Dianying, the commander of the 3rd Column of the National Army, issued a brief will at 2 PM that afternoon and has been missing ever since.

[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 3rd] Tangyin County has fallen into the hands of the communist forces, and Commander-in-Chief Sun Dianying is missing.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd] The Third Session of the First Henan Provincial Assembly dispatched eight representatives, Qu Wanshan, Li An, Niu Jifei, Liu Zengruo, Miao Chongxiu, Ding Hansan, Shen Huanan, and Wang Shoumei, from the assembly at 9:30 AM on the 3rd to Beijing to appeal to the central government. The reasons are that the communist forces under Liu Bocheng are besieging Tangyin and Anchang in northern Henan, lasting for over a month. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are gathered in both locations, without food or shelter, in a extremely miserable state. The defending troops are lacking ammunition and reinforcements, and are in imminent danger. At the same time, since important crossings such as Fenglingdu and Maojindu in southern Shanxi have fallen to the communist forces, the river defenses have suddenly become tense. Local forces are eager to defend their homes, but lack ammunition. Communist forces in the eastern flooded areas of Henan are also becoming increasingly rampant, and the situation is extremely critical, reaching a breaking point. The representatives asked the central government to quickly send a large army to relieve the siege of northern Henan, consolidate river defenses, stabilize the flood-affected areas, and quickly allocate ammunition to local forces for self-defense, and also allocate a large amount of relief funds to handle relief efforts. At 3 PM, they visited Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and Deputy Minister Qin Dechun, who expressed sympathy and promised to pay absolute attention to the requests.

[Our Dispatch from Baoding, 3rd] The National Army moving south on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section has changed its strategy from a direct assault to emphasizing search and destroy operations on both flanks against the main force of the communist forces. A part of the left-wing army group is pressing Anguo, and is still engaged in mixed battles in the surrounding areas of Boye and Anguo. Another part captured Gaoyang yesterday and is pursuing the communist forces retreating in a southeastern direction, advancing towards Hejian. On the morning of the 3rd, over 3,000 communist forces were surrounded and are resisting stubbornly in Banbidian, at the border of Renqiu and Gaoyang. The National Army has the trend of clearing the central area between the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, and opening up the Baoding-Shijiazhuang road.

[Our Dispatch from Baoding, 3rd] The National Army in Shijiazhuang has been actively counterattacking in recent days, and has expanded its offensive outwards, pressing Yecheng in the east, reaching Jingxing in the west, and crossing Liuxinzhuang in the north, sweeping in the east and west to eliminate the remnants of the communist forces along the Tuo River. Officials claim that there are no longer large groups of communist forces within forty *li* of Shimen, and that the main force of the communist forces between Zhengding and Xinle has mostly taken refuge in the Taihang Mountains.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] The communist forces have recently been harassing Xushui and Caohejian. At 8 PM on the evening of the 2nd, Ma Hui's New 4th Brigade attacked the garrison at Fangying, west of Xushui, for four hours, leaving behind two corpses and retreating west to Dadian.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] The mystery of whether or not the National Army has recovered Wanxian, Tangxian, Dingxian, and Lixian has been solved. The National Army has arrived in these areas one after another, but after completing the mopping-up tasks, they have moved to other areas to fight. Currently, there are no National Army troops stationed in the county seats of the aforementioned counties or in Gaoyang, which was recently recovered. The purpose of the National Army's operations is not to occupy strongholds, but to pursue the main force of the communist forces.

### Lingyuan Has Been Relieved

[Our Dispatch from Shenyang, 3rd] The siege of Lingyuan has been lifted. The communist forces are attempting to move troops to Chengde and Duolun. Furthermore, the communist forces on the Songhua River front are shifting towards the Fuyu area, threatening Changling and Tongliao on the right flank of the Chinese Changchun Railway.

[Our Dispatch from Shenyang, 3rd] When a reporter inquired with Commander Du Yuming about the recent rumors that the communist forces had assembled 40,000 troops in Rehe, Du replied that the force might be in the area of Chicheng outside the Great Wall, but there were no confirmed reports.

[Our Dispatch from Changchun, 3rd] The communist forces in northern Songhua are currently gathering near Fuyu, Damai, Changling, and Liaoyuan, numbering about 60,000 to 70,000 men, appearing to be planning to invade Nongan and northern Liaoning. At the same time, they are urgently repairing the railway from Damai to Wangfu. However, internal Jiangxi in the communist ranks is increasingly fierce, and the desertion rate of new recruits is extremely high. Therefore, the military authorities here believe that even if the communist forces attack, they will suffer a serious blow.

### Northern Jiangsu Salt and Yancheng Are Peaceful, Remnants of Communist Forces to be Cleared Soon

[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 3rd] According to a military official from Funing, the remnants of the communist forces are currently causing disturbances in the areas of Yancheng, Funing, Xiangtai, and Lianhai in northern Jiangsu, but their strength is limited and they are unlikely to succeed. A part of the elite National Army troops reinforcing northern Jiangsu has arrived in Dongtai, and another part is advancing north along the Grand Canal. After the deployments are complete, a large-scale mopping-up operation will be launched. Yancheng and Funing are peaceful. The rumor that they have been captured is inaccurate.

[Our Dispatch from Taixian, 3rd] The communist forces have recently designated the low-lying coastal area of several tens of *li* along the Tongyu Line, a narrow strip of land 800 *li* long from Guanyun in the north to Haiqi in the south, as the "Coastline," using it exclusively for moving north and south, and launching harassment attacks on various recovered areas at any time.

### CCP Not an Autonomous Political Party, Negotiations Therefore Unsuccessful, Mr. Tao Xisheng Discusses "Reorganizing the Government"

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd] The Central Cultural Movement Association held a cultural lecture at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, inviting Tao Xisheng to lecture on "On Reorganizing the Government." Mr. Tao raised three questions: (1) Can reorganizing the government solve the problem? (2) Why did the government not continue peace talks and why not make greater concessions to the Communist Party? (3) Can the Communist Party solve the problem? Mr. Tao pointed out that the biggest problem in reorganizing the government is to end one-party politics. Mr. Tao stated: Once transitioning from one-party politics to multi-party politics, there is no going back to one-party politics. The government almost completely accepted the Communist Party's demands from September to November last year, but there was still no peace, so the Communist Party should be fully responsible for the breakdown of the peace talks. Mr. Tao also pointed out that the Communist Party is not an autonomous political party, so it cannot solve the problem. After the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party join the government, they will surely achieve ideal development, cooperate and compete with the Kuomintang, both will progress and lead China to the road of constitutional construction.

### Zhang Jinwu, Editor of North China Daily, Arrested

Truth Not Yet Ascertained

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] Zhang Jinwu, an editor of the North China Daily here, was arrested on the 1st. Because those who carried out the arrest did not show their identities at the time, cut off the telephone lines, and fired two shots as a show of force, killing one person, it caused outside discussion. One newspaper pointed out that Zhang was taken away because it was related to the case of Yu Xing, the maid who was raped by Zhao Yunxiang, the former puppet army commander of Sun Liangcheng's troops, which was published in the newspaper. Yesterday, the Beiping Headquarters specially issued a public notice stating: "The Headquarters received a secret report that Zhang had held a puppet position and was a dangerous element, so he was arrested." All parties attach great importance to this, but because the truth is not clear, the newspapers remain silent. Several people from the local journalism community went to the Headquarters today to ask for bail but were unsuccessful. The Headquarters spokesperson stated again today that Zhang has been handed over to the military law department for strict interrogation, and the truth will soon be revealed. The authorities will not ignore the fact that the outside world and Zhang's family claim that Zhang's arrest is related to the Yu Xing case and that he has been framed, and are preparing to thoroughly investigate this point.

The people of the province are fearful and have sent telegrams to the central government, urging Director Ren to stay in Taiwan and work. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has decided to appoint the Director of the Transportation Administration soon.

Moreover, civil servants here, especially technical personnel, are leaving one after another, and more people are trying to obtain the qualifications of "redundant" or "laid-off personnel," because Governor Chen Yi has approved these personnel to enjoy three to five months of severance pay. However, this does not apply to those who resign voluntarily.

### Possible Use of Five Hundred Million Loan; US Considers Extending Deadline; Sino-American Lend-Lease Accounts to Be Cleared

[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] State Department officials informed this agency's reporter on the 2nd that the extension of the deadline for the $500 million loan to China from the Export-Import Bank is currently being considered, possibly extending it beyond the 30th of the month. They stated that Chinese officials in Washington have informally proposed a plan to use a portion of the $500 million loan, and a detailed plan will be submitted soon. Meanwhile, some members of Congress are urging that the loan be granted immediately, without requiring a detailed plan, and that only a statement of its purpose should be sufficient. However, officials formulating US policy have not yet expressed approval of Chairman Chiang's reorganized government, especially Secretary of State Marshall, who opposes lending the entire amount to China at once.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The State Department announced today that China is about to begin negotiations with the US on resolving $1.51 billion in Lend-Lease Act debts, the $500 million loan from 1942, and other wartime accounts. A precise date has not yet been decided. When the State Department made the $500 million political loan to China, the terms of its repayment and the method of converting the loan into long-term public debt were not specified. According to State Department sources, the terms for resolving this loan will not be overly harsh. The State Department stated that the terms of the agreement to resolve the Lend-Lease accounts with China will be as liberal as those with other countries, especially the United Kingdom. The UK's Lend-Lease accounts totaled $31 billion, less reverse Lend-Lease accounts and other US obligations, leaving a net repayment amount of $25 billion. The resolution method involved the UK repaying $650 million, approximately 2.5 cents on the dollar. The Sino-American negotiations will also involve other financial obligations between the two governments during the war, including the situation of unadjusted wartime surplus material transactions and other financial claims arising during the war. Last June, the two sides signed two agreements on Lend-Lease issues, one stipulating the payment of two items and the transfer of civilian oil pipelines after Japan's surrender, and the other stipulating the terms for setting limited payments for military Lend-Lease accounts within a limited period after last June. However, neither of these two articles concerned the economic matters of resolving Lend-Lease accounts in the Mutual Aid Agreement of June 2, 1942, nor the general issues related to wartime accounts. Surplus materials valued at $900 million have been sold to China for $210 million, of which $120 million has been offset by the US for the cost of maintaining US troops stationed in China, and China has agreed to pay $55 million in Chinese legal tender. Of this, $35 million will be used by the US to purchase and improve US government properties in China, and another $20 million will be used for cultural education programs.

### President Zhang's Address at the Field and Grain Conference: Grain Policy Remains Unchanged; Urges Diligent Prevention of Corruption in Grain Collection

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Field and Grain Affairs Review Conference held its third general meeting at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun and Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun attended and gave instructions one after the other. Subsequently, two cases submitted for discussion by the Review Committee on the 2nd were passed. The Review Committee continued to meet in the afternoon. The entire group of attendees will collectively visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 8:30 AM on the 4th, and the conference will close in the afternoon of the 5th.

Finance Minister Yu's remarks today were very brief, in addition to hoping that the two institutions of finance and grain would seek close cooperation in their work, he also expressed his condolences to all attendees. Premier Zhang's instructions were as follows: Compulsory grain purchase is a policy, and we hope (1) to institutionalize and systematize it; (2) that colleagues in the work can have enthusiasm and perseverance to ensure the completion of the task. At the same time, he emphasized that the wartime food policy will not be changed, and the grain administration organization will also not be changed. He also urged that the abuses of compulsory grain purchase by local governments and Baojia chiefs be effectively prevented, so as to avoid people complaining about the government. The cases passed today were (1) regarding the compulsory purchase and clearing of grain and grain funds from previous years; (2) the organization and expenses of grain collection, etc.

[Another dispatch] Shen Guojin, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry of Food, is scheduled to depart after the Field and Grain Conference to inspect and supervise grain transportation along the provinces and counties of the Yangtze River. According to Shen, the waters are now high, and the need for grain in various places is urgent, so we should take the opportunity to speed up transportation. It is also heard that Shen claimed to the attendees of the Field and Grain Conference on the 3rd that the amount of military grain payable from June 35 to April of this year reached more than 1.6 million large packages. It is estimated that about 1.5 million large packages will be needed from May to September this year, and he hopes that the provinces will quickly transport them for use.

### Adjustment of Field and Grain Institutions in Various Provinces

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] This year's field tax in various provinces, in accordance with the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, will still be collected in kind and in currency, and the practice of forced borrowing will be discontinued. Therefore, the field and grain storage and transportation institutions and their expenses in various provinces should be readjusted. The following decisions were made on this matter at the Field and Grain Affairs Review Conference: (1) The new organization will be implemented from July, and the existing institutions should be adjusted within one month from June 1. Depending on the number of counties collecting in currency, the personnel of the provincial and county offices and storage and transportation institutions will be reduced, and the severance pay will be shared by the central, provincial, and county levels. (2) The routine expenses and living allowances of the provincial field and grain offices and the county-level and lower field and grain institutions that collect in kind will be borne by the central government. The counties collecting in currency will directly deduct 5% of the field tax that should be received by the central government as collection fees. (3) The routine expenses and living allowances required by the municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan for handling field tax matters, as well as the cost of printing field tax lists and vouchers, will be shared by the central government and the municipalities according to the proportion of income. (4) The cost of printing field tax lists and vouchers for counties collecting in kind, as well as the collection operating expenses and inspection tool expenses, will all be borne by the central government. The above-mentioned expenses required by counties collecting in currency will be listed in the collection fees directly deducted. (5) Various field tax expenses, total household registration fees for each business, and field tax promotion fees will all be borne by the central government. (6) The living allowances for the staff of the field and grain departments in the counties collecting in currency will be paid according to the county standard, and the remaining staff at all levels will be paid according to the provincial (municipal) standard. (7) The various expenses for the first half of the year, from January to June, will still be shared according to the previous regulations, and the funds already advanced by the central government will be cleared and supplemented separately.

### Soaring Grain Prices in Various Places; Common People Cry Out in Misery

Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The rice and meat industries in Nanjing are both without markets, and the black market prices are shocking. The price of meat is 8,000 yuan per catty, and the price of top-quality rice is 170,000 yuan per stone. However, there are frequent disputes among citizens who buy rice and flour at government-subsidized prices. Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau, went to various districts at 7:00 AM on the 3rd to inspect the sale of rice by rice merchants, and at the same time formulated measures to avoid profiteering by unscrupulous merchants. The measures are as follows: (1) Select rice shops with good credit to sell government-subsidized rice exclusively; (2) Reserve cooperative societies distributed in various districts to sell on behalf of the government. Xie said that Nanjing has four months' worth of food rice reserves, and there should be no panic about food rice in the future. In addition, the reason for the steep rise in meat prices is that meat merchants originally requested to increase the price limit to 5,800 yuan per catty, but it was not approved by the municipal government, resulting in a situation of no market and no goods.

Jiangsu

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] Rice prices have risen sharply in recent days, with listed prices of 170,000 yuan but no market, and the black market reaching 200,000 yuan. Common people are crying out in misery. Yangzhou is slightly lower, hovering around 150,000 yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun telegraphed to Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, on the 3rd, ordering that rice and grain within the territory of Jiangsu Province and transported to Nanjing and Shanghai be allowed to circulate and not be obstructed. If it can be implemented in the near future, the rice shortage problem in Nanjing and Shanghai should be resolved immediately.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] The price limit for rice in the Suzhou rice market is 180,000 yuan, and the black market price is as high as 240,000 yuan. However, most of the rice shops in the city still refuse to sell, and the severity of the grain shortage has reached its peak. Suzhou Women's Normal School, Industrial College, Agricultural School, County High School, and other schools in Suzhou Province, unable to purchase rice, caused a dietary panic, and on the 3rd, they jointly sent personnel to the county government to petition, requesting that the Grain Association purchase rice for one month, totaling more than 1,000 stones. The county government agreed to find a way.

[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 3rd] The black market price of rice in Suzhou reached a peak of 250,000 yuan per stone today. The city defense headquarters held an emergency meeting today and decided (1) that the price of rice in Suzhou shall not exceed that of Wuxi and shall be calculated at 90% of the price limit in Shanghai; (2) that residents shall not store more than three months' worth of food per household. The Grain and Food Conference's price negotiation is in accordance with the provincial government's regulations, and it is clearly ordered that it can arrive in Suzhou on the 4th.

Anhui

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 3rd] The grain market in Bengbu was crowded on the 3rd, and rice prices went crazy, reaching 430,000 yuan per stone at the close of the market, and flour was 100,000 yuan per bag. Other prices also rose sharply, and people were panicked.

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 3rd] In the past two weeks, the price of rice here has risen from 70,000 to 160,000 yuan, and other daily necessities have also doubled in price. The spring famine in central Anhui has reached a severe stage. A few days ago, a rice merchant shipped 200 stones of cooked rice from here to Wuhu by boat, but unexpectedly, when it reached a place 20 miles away from Hefei, it was robbed by starving people. After this case occurred, rice merchants were all afraid to move forward, but the rising trend has not stopped, and the future of public security is quite worrying.

Shanxi

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 2nd] The business market in Taiyuan is chaotic, and the rising trend of grain and cloth is the most severe. The retail price of flour is 150,000 yuan per bag.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] Prices in Bing City: wheat 300,000 per stone, millet 220,000 per stone, machine flour 160,000 per bag, barley flour 1,600 per catty, sorghum flour 1,000, sesame oil 4,800 per catty, edible oil 2,800 per catty, white cloth 420,000 per bolt, mutton 3,500 per catty.

Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 3rd] The rice price in the city is 52,000 for subsidized rice and 82,000 (per stone) for government-subsidized rice. However, since large households are unwilling to sell, the afternoon market suddenly rose again, breaking the 100,000 mark, reaching 100,500, and medium-quality rice is 95,000.

### Suzhou Newspapers Resume Publication Today

Labor-Management Dispute Still Without Coordination

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] The Suzhou newspaper industry labor-management dispute deadlocked until about 5:00 PM on the 3rd, with no coordination method yet. The Suzhou city defense department and county government took emergency measures because the suspension of newspapers had a significant impact on social order. At 6:00 PM, they summoned representatives from both labor and management, ordering that the treatment issue be resolved at a meeting on the afternoon of the 4th, but that work should be resumed first, and that all newspapers must be issued as before on the 4th, and those who violate this will be severely punished. The labor side has now expressed its acceptance, and all workers resumed work on the evening of the 3rd.

### Hangzhou Grain Merchants Gather to Petition; Start from the Rice Market and Fight Along the Way; News Reporter Taking Photos is Also Beaten and Injured

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 3rd] Yesterday, rice shops in Hangzhou were beaten up until dark, and today another beating scene was staged, and even news reporters were beaten. The grain merchants who were beaten yesterday gathered more than 300 people. This morning, they held flags and marched to the city government to petition, demanding: (1) that the perpetrators who destroyed the rice shops yesterday be severely punished; (2) that the losses be investigated; (3) that the government effectively guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future. They started from the grain market, and because of emotional impulses, they beat rickshaw pullers, egg vendors, and children who were accused of stealing rice along the way, causing a noisy and chaotic scene in the streets. Later, they also smashed the doors, windows, and equipment of the China Restaurant and the China Cafe. At the Lakeside Sino-American Cafe, because they saw that the cafe had a playbill for "Rice Weevil," they became very angry, and stones and wooden sticks flew, and all the facilities were destroyed, causing heavy losses. After the beating, military police arrived and arrested 40 perpetrators. The remaining crowd gathered in front of the city government, demanding the release of all the prisoners, and persisted all day. Shan Yuyue, a reporter from the city's Industry and Commerce Newspaper, was beaten and injured for taking news photos. The rice merchants also shouted in front of the city government to beat the newspaper office, and their frenzy ignored the government and the law. Later, Mayor Zhou met with representatives and promised to release those arrested on bail. However, the grain merchants continued to clamor and did not leave.

Municipal Government Regulates People's Food and Supplies 1,000 Stones Daily

At 2:00 PM, the city government convened a people's food regulation meeting to discuss the aftermath of yesterday's incident and decided: that the provincial and municipal governments, the Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office, the local court, the procuratorate, the finance department, the field and grain department, and related agencies such as the public association, will form an investigation committee to investigate public and private losses first. In addition to the government subsidized rice that is distributed to the poor, government teachers, and workers, the city government will supply 1,000 stones daily to the general public, starting tomorrow. The purchase is limited to five liters per person. The price per stone will increase from 127,000 to 160,000, with 33,000 of the amount separately submitted as compensation for rice merchants to collect rice in the producing areas. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, but the grain merchants did not leave. Supervisory Envoy Zhu and Jin Runquan and others were forced to retreat and could not go out. At 6:45 PM, after the arrested perpetrators were released on bail, they dispersed. In addition, because there were no rice merchants or rice shops today, only a very small portion of the 2,000 stones of government subsidized rice was sold.

### Editorial: The Spirit of the May Fourth Movement

—Also a Congratulation to the Establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association—

Twenty-eight years have passed since the May Fourth Movement of 1919. Twenty-eight years is nearly a generation. The May Fourth Youth of that time now have white hair and are approaching old age! Today, as we commemorate this great movement, recalling the past, looking at the current situation, and looking forward to the future, we are filled with emotion!

The May Fourth Movement was not only a student movement and a political movement, but also a great educational movement. In the modern history of our country, it was a landmark movement. The May Fourth Movement was triggered by the Paris Peace Conference in April after World War I. On the Shandong issue of China, the Japanese representatives made deceptive promises, verbally allowing the return of military and political control of Shandong to China, but excluding economic control. American President Wilson was deceived, and the representatives of the North and South governments of China were deceived and were preparing to sign the agreement, when the young students of China roared in anger. May Fourth happened to be a Sunday. Initiated by Peking University, it united secondary schools and above to hold a rally and demonstration. The slogan was "Resist foreign powers externally and eliminate national traitors internally." Subsequently, this great movement inspired young students and workers across the country to participate in this patriotic movement, transforming it from a simple student movement into a political movement. Because there was no active political goal, it did not develop for long, and then it transformed from a political movement into a cultural movement and a new thought movement, becoming the most educationally significant and epoch-making movement in modern Chinese history.

Twenty-eight years have passed since the May Fourth Movement. Recalling the scene twenty-eight years ago, many things are quite similar to the current situation: First, twenty-eight years ago was exactly when World War I ended and our country won the war. At that time, our country could not be restored as a victorious nation, and we could not stand tall internationally, so we suffered great humiliation at the Paris Peace Conference; second, after the founding of the Republic of China, the war continued unabated, there were governments in both the North and the South, and feudalism still existed in division, leading to corrupt officials and political corruption, so students were dissatisfied with the status quo; third, students were receiving backward education, lacking the input of new ideas and scientific knowledge, so young students developed ideological depression, which led to resentment; fourth, twenty-eight years ago, Japan had a better international environment than us. Britain and France had secret agreements with her, and in diplomacy, she oppressed us in every way. Japan's intention was not only to nibble away at Shandong, but also to annex the Northeast. And today? The world has gone through another world war. We have resisted Japan for eight years. We are already in the position of a victorious nation, and Japan has surrendered unconditionally. Looking around at the current situation, our country's position seems to be very superior, and Japan has already sunk. However, looking forward to the future, there are many hidden reefs. As for the student movement, from the May Fourth to today, the nature and form of the student movement, although different, its emotions and development have always been surging and high, and even more so than in the May Fourth era.

Looking at Japan today. In form, Japan has been defeated, surrendered unconditionally, and obediently obeys the control of the United Nations. In essence, the stubborn thinking of the Japanese has not changed much. In the April elections, conservative forces remained strong. The new constitution was implemented on May 3. The surface article is democracy, but what is the real intention? It is still uncertain. The Japanese have no great affection for China. The Japanese treat MacArthur with humble etiquette, trying to please the United States everywhere. The recent decision to maintain Japan's industrial level from 1930 to 1934, restore its trade, and increase its production is enough to prove the preferential treatment of the United States towards Japan. This style of the United States clearly has other international goals: however, the revival of Japan will ultimately cause trouble in East Asia. This is not a blessing for China, nor is it a blessing for Asia and the ancient world!

Looking at today's student movement, in theory, the student movement is originally a part of the social movement, and it has the same origin as the cultural movement. It grows and supports each other with the evolution of the times. Looking at the current stage of the student movement, several patriotic movements have been earth-shattering, and compared with the May Fourth Movement, they are indeed even better. Therefore, today, we cannot but point out that the May Fourth Movement is a glorious and great undertaking created by Chinese students; although the era of the May Fourth has passed, the spirit of the May Fourth continues to this day and will shine, which is worthy of our cherishing. However, the environment of the May Fourth era still exists today, which is worthy of our vigilance.

In addition, we must solemnly point out that the essence of the May Fourth Movement is not only a political movement, but also a new cultural movement, which initially originated from the new literary movement. The Shanghai Literary Writers Association is specifically established today, which has great significance. Today, we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, and at the same time, we congratulate the establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association!

### US-Soviet Joint Commission to Reconvene This Month on the 20th to Discuss the Issue of Korean Unification; Marshall Replies, Clarifying the US Position; Copies Sent Separately to the Governments of the Two Countries in England

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] Marshall has accepted Molotov's suggestion to reconvene the US-Soviet Joint Commission in Seoul on the 20th of this month to establish a provisional Korean democratic government. However, Marshall requested the Soviet side to clarify the basis on which the Joint Commission will resume its work in the future. In his reply today, Marshall mentioned the Soviet Foreign Minister's statement that the work of the Joint Commission would be based "solely on the implementation of the Moscow Agreement regarding Korea." In order to avoid future misunderstandings regarding this statement, Marshall told Molotov that the US will not refuse any democratic parties or social groups in Korea to consult with the committee when the Joint Commission organizes the provisional government, thereby organizing the provisional government. Marshall also clarified the statement in his letter to Molotov on April 18 regarding the US's special position on Korea, saying that the Joint Commission should expedite its work in accordance with the Moscow Agreement, and that it should be based on respect for democratic rights of freedom of speech. Marshall said that no party should be rejected because of its current or past opinions on the future Korean government. Marshall asked Molotov to reply as soon as possible regarding the mutual agreement between the two countries on this point so that preparations could be made for the convening of the meeting. Marshall's letter to Molotov was copied to China and England. The State Department stated that it hopes that the meeting date of May 20 can be determined. When Marshall reviewed the three points raised by Molotov regarding the relevant part of the Moscow Agreement on Korea, he agreed that (1) the establishment of a provisional democratic government of Korea should be based on the broad participation of various democratic parties and social groups, and Korea should not be controlled by foreign forces and should be a member of the United Nations; (2) the establishment of central, provincial and local democratic government institutions should be chosen by free elections; (3) the United States' plans for Korean economic recovery, education, and political development are already under consideration, so it welcomes the Soviet Union's guarantee to restore Korea to a democratic country and to assist in the development of its economy and culture.

### After the Yoshida Cabinet's Resignation, Shidehara Will Temporarily Serve as Prime Minister; Minister of Justice and Minister of Health and Welfare Continue to be Purged

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The Yoshida Cabinet will resign after the cabinet falls on the 6th.

### Yoshida Praises the New Constitution and Calls on Japanese People to "Understand"

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida announced this morning that the new constitution has officially come into effect, and said that a new Japan has been born today, and he hopes that the people of the whole country will embrace an optimistic attitude and work together to rebuild the motherland. Yoshida said that the new constitution stipulates that Japan abandons the right to wage war and, at least in theory, deprives the Emperor of his sacred rights, so it is necessary to understand it. If the spirit of the new constitution can permeate the lives of the people of the whole country, Japan will be able to be reborn as a happy country and will make a great contribution to the progress of mankind.

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Japan implemented the new constitution today, but the celebrations were dampened by the rain.

### The Situation of the French Cabinet is Serious; The Fate of the Cabinet May be Decided Today

[United Press, Paris, 2nd] The French Parliament is scheduled to vote on the confidence motion of Prime Minister Ramadier's coalition government at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th. Tonight, there are various indications that in the midst of the serious cabinet crisis, some compromise may be reached with the Communist Party.

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] The dispute between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party over wage and price policies has not yet been resolved. Prime Minister Ramadier asked the parliament tonight to vote on a motion of confidence in his wage and price policies, and stated on the spot that if the parliament agrees with his views, he will continue to implement this policy; otherwise, he will ask someone else to take on this responsibility. He also said that the Republic is in danger, so he hopes everyone will help. Observers believe that this is nothing more than a final appeal to the Communist Party to avoid the collapse of the coalition cabinet. Communist Party members have not yet expressed their views on the confidence vote. It is expected that no matter how things develop, Communist Party cabinet members will not resign. However, if a solution is not reached before Sunday, Ramadier may have to submit the resignation of the entire cabinet. Some observers believe that the Communist Party's criticism of the government's economic policies is just an excuse. The main motive for the Communist Party's preparation to retreat into the opposition party camp is still international factors. The Communist Party has realized that the current government of France has become increasingly inclined towards Britain and the United States and is moving away from the Soviet Union.

### France Requests Sending Chinese Laborers to Vietnam, Our Government Has Already Refused

### Stalin Once Assured Stettinius That the Soviet Union Had No Intention of War Against the United States, Saying That the United States and the Soviet Union Could Coexist in Harmony

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: Stettinius, while in Moscow, had an eighty-minute conversation with Stalin on April 9, which has now been released here. In the conversation, Stalin assured that the Soviet Union had absolutely no intention of waging war against the United States. The Soviet leader also stated: "If both sides have the sincerity to cooperate, then although the economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union are different, they can still coexist in harmony. Stalin emphasized that international management of atomic energy must be established in writing, and its use for war must be prohibited." Other key points of the Soviet leader's remarks are as follows: (1) Mutual attacks through propaganda will not lead to cooperation; (2) Although there are differences regarding the atomic energy management issue, a solution will eventually be found; (3) The current tragedy in Europe is due to the scarcity of raw materials and food; (4) The United States has no need to worry at present. The United States is protected by two oceans, and its northern and southern neighbors (Canada and Mexico) are also weak countries, so its security is absolutely not threatened.

### France Plans to Establish Naval Base in the Far East, New Political Plan for Vietnam Is Being Drafted

[Reuters, Saigon, 2nd] The French authorities here are drafting a new political plan for Vietnam, intending to transfer all political power to the hands of the Annamese people as soon as possible. The Annamese people mostly belong to the residents of the two provinces of Tonkin and Annam in northern Vietnam, who are the pioneers of the Viet Minh national movement. According to the new plan, Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina, Cambodia, and Laos will all maintain separate administrative structures, and France's mission will be limited to protecting the business and personal interests of the French people. This new plan no longer refers to Vietnam as a federation, but only as a united nation of France, with which France can establish direct treaty relations. It is heard that the French government will soon sign treaties with Cambodia and Laos granting them this new political status.

[French News Agency, Saigon, 3rd] The French-language "Southern Newspaper" reported today that a new Vietnamese government has been established in Hue.

Among the refitted ships, there is also an Arctic defense submarine specifically for Arctic reconnaissance, to carry out reconnaissance aircraft operations and other secret missions.

### Analysis of the U.S. Aid to Turkey Plan

Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

Once the U.S. Congress approves President Truman's request to lend Turkey $150 million, Turkey will become a strong forward base to prevent the expansion of Soviet power into the Middle East. The main purpose of this funding is for military facilities and strategic improvements.

The Turkish national defense, which is poorly equipped, should be modernized so that a portion of the troops can be assigned to civilian jobs. Turkey's seaports, railways, highways, and airfields must be improved to cope with large-scale military operations. To make Turkey's steel and coal self-sufficient, its steel and fuel industries need better equipment.

This sweeping U.S. plan surprised even the Turkish government and the British government. No wonder officials in London and Ankara praised the U.S. proposal as a "revolutionary" measure that will certainly be effective in the Mediterranean, the Near East, and the Middle East.

Turkey Needs Spiritual Assistance

Turkey's current situation requires spiritual assistance and military equipment more urgently than money. Since the end of the European War, Turkey has been under constant pressure from the Soviet Union, forcing it to cede the privileges of the Dardanelles Strait, which connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has also applied various pressures, including: formal demands, newspaper and radio attacks on the Turkish government, and suggestions that Turkey should cede the eastern provinces of Kars and Ardahan to the Soviet Union. Turkey must maintain an army of about one million men, about four percent of the total population. Military expenditures account for almost 60 percent of Turkey's budget. Therefore, the basic improvement of Turkey's economic resources has had to be postponed.

No Communist Party Exists

Last year's election recognized an opposition party, which is an unprecedented event in modern Turkish history. However, Foreign Minister Saka remained in office, indicating that Turkey's determination to reject Soviet demands has not changed as a result of the election. There is no Communist Party in Turkey, and the activities of the left wing are virtually impossible to carry out due to strict government surveillance.

Turkey is not in as dire a financial crisis as Greece. The amount of Turkey's budget expenditures is not large and can be compensated for by internal loans. The recent devaluation of the Turkish currency has greatly increased exports. The United States is Turkey's largest customer, followed by the United Kingdom. Turkey has gold reserves and has received $40 million in loans from the United States since the outbreak of the war for the purchase of industrial equipment, surplus materials, and merchant ships.

The cessation of British aid to Turkey will not have a significant economic impact. In 1939, the United Kingdom lent Turkey $40 million under the Anglo-French-Turkish Treaty, which Turkey did not default on. The United Kingdom supplied Turkey with $100 million worth of military supplies on credit during the war. The United Kingdom has not lent money to Turkey since the war. In fact, the United Kingdom owes Turkey for not paying the gold pound difference in London? Aside from government aid, Britain's greatest contribution to Turkey after the war has been the dispatch of a military mission, which originally had 33 officers and has now increased to 60.

U.S. Aid to Turkey to Be Implemented in Stages

The U.S. aid to Turkey plan will be implemented gradually until the crisis is resolved. Not all funds will be delivered at once. According to the current plan, military equipment will be supplied to Turkey first to reduce the manpower engaged in national defense work. Turkey needs radar, anti-aircraft guns, motor vehicles, tanks, coastal patrol boats, transport aircraft, and fighter planes. Some light vessels can be modified to enhance the strength of the Turkish Navy. Airfields must be rearranged to accommodate nighttime landings and heavy bomber landings.

The training of Turkish soldiers will be carried out simultaneously with the supply of military equipment. The U.S. military mission will train Turks in military technology so that they can use modern weapons. In addition, it has been suggested that Turkey be supplied with machines to improve basic industries and transportation infrastructure.

The Improvement Plan Covers a Wide Range

Turkey had long planned to borrow $500 million from the United States, but before President Truman announced his new policy, Turkey's hope of obtaining a large loan was very slim. The Turks intend to improve the two seaports of Zonguldak and Trabzon on the Black Sea coast. They want to convert the railway from the Turkish capital Ankara to Istanbul into a double track, replace old vehicles with new ones, and extend the railway line to Iraq and Iran. They hope to increase the supply of hydropower in the Ankara, Izmir, and Adana areas and improve the machinery of coal mines and steel mills.

The U.S. steps to aid Turkey are intended to first implement the parts of the aid to Turkey plan that are most critical for national defense. If Turkey can obtain more loans, it also hopes to replace dilapidated textile machinery, build new highways, and expand irrigation areas.

Turkey Is Determined to Resist the Soviet Union

Turkey is the strongest anti-communist country on the Soviet border and deserves U.S. support as much as Greece. This is the basic strategy of the U.S. aid to Turkey plan. The Turks believe that the U.S. announcement of the aid to Turkey plan has greatly enhanced Turkey's position against the Soviet Union. Turkey hopes to demobilize a portion of its vast army as resources become available. When the entire plan is completed, Turkey will become a strong military base against future threats from the Soviet Union. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)

### The First Report of the Five-Power Military Staff Committee Is Released, Soviet Views Differ Greatly from Those of the Other Four Powers

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: The contents of the first report of the United Nations Five-Power Military Staff Committee have been released. Of the 41 articles outlining the organization of the world's peacekeeping forces, one-third were opposed by the Soviet Union. The report consists of approximately 80 pages and is the result of a month of secret discussions. France agreed with the Soviet Union on three points, while China and the United Kingdom shared the same views as the United States. The report will be discussed by the Security Council. The revelation of its contents confirms that the views of the Soviet Union and the other powers are far apart. The Soviet Union believes that there is no explicit provision in the United Nations Charter for any country to establish bases for the United Nations military forces. China, the United Kingdom, and the United States say that without such bases, the establishment of peacekeeping forces would be futile. The Soviet Union demands that all United Nations military forces return to their home territories within 30 to 90 days after completing their missions. The other powers expressed their opposition. In addition, there are several other points on which the Soviet Union's views do not coincide with those of the other countries.

[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] It was revealed here today that the five powers have agreed to allocate "the best-trained and best-equipped" armed forces as the United Nations' global police force. However, the Soviet Union and Western countries differ greatly in their views on the principles of the United Nations' peace maintenance. Complete agreement on the United Nations military force negotiations may take months, even years. These negotiations began 15 months ago at the United Nations Military Staff Committee.

### Stolen Deadly Poison, Tokyo Citizens Panic

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The theft of 36 kilograms of potassium cyanide from a factory in Saitama Prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, has caused great panic among the people of Tokyo. Police fear that the thieves may have mistakenly sold the poison as flour. 36 kilograms of potassium cyanide could poison all the citizens of Tokyo. Tokyo health authorities have mobilized to search door-to-door. At the same time, two testing stations have been set up. All flour must be sent there for testing before production. All bakers in the city must analyze the flour before making bread. To prevent thieves from pouring the poison into the river, health authorities test the river water every three hours. Although Tokyo police and health authorities have made every effort to search, the poison has not yet been found.

The Steering Committee last night voted 11-0, with the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia abstaining, that Jewish representatives should not be allowed to attend the General Assembly but only to present their views to the committee. If this recommendation is accepted by the General Assembly, it will be submitted to the 55-nation Political Committee for discussion. The Political Committee currently has only one item on its agenda, namely the organization and terms of reference of the Palestine Investigation Committee, which is expected to begin discussion tomorrow. After the investigation committee is established, it will be engaged in drafting a report, which will be submitted to the General Assembly's regular session in September for review and a decision on how to deal with it. According to Secretary-General Trygve Lie, four Jewish groups have requested to send representatives to speak.

Divergent Views Among Countries, We Support U.S. Proposal

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 2nd] The views of the four powers have diverged on the question of whether the Jewish people should be allowed to participate in the discussion of the current session of the United Nations Special General Assembly. British representative Cadogan first stated in the Steering Committee that since the Arab countries have entered into a full discussion of the Palestine issue at the Special General Assembly, Jewish representatives should be allowed to attend and present their views without conflicting with the law. U.S. representative Austin expressed his opposition. He believed that the Steering Committee should recommend to the entire General Assembly that all requests from the Jewish people be referred to the Political Committee, and that the Political Committee should find appropriate opportunities for the Jewish people to present their views. Mr. Austin further stated that the Jewish representatives should be limited to the Jewish Agency, and their representatives should not be able to present their views to the entire General Assembly. China expressed its support for the U.S. view, but Soviet representative Gromyko believed that the U.S. representative's view was unfair. He believed that not only should Jewish representatives be allowed to present their views to the entire General Assembly, but the Steering Committee should also review the requests of all Jewish groups other than the Jewish Agency. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie also joined the discussion, saying that in the past, requests from non-United Nations member states to participate in the General Assembly had all been rejected. If the Steering Committee recommends that the entire General Assembly hear the views of non-governmental organizations, it would be a violation of precedent. Representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia spoke out, both advocating that representatives of the Jewish Agency be allowed to attend the entire General Assembly and present their views. Indian representative Ali argued that not only should Jewish representatives be allowed to present their views, but representatives of the residents of Palestine should also be allowed to present their views.

### Minister Gu Takes Plan Back to Beijing, Says Cost of Living Index Freeze May Be Lifted Conditionally, Plans to Have Specific Calculation Methods for Salaries, Suggests Central Government Approve and Implement

[Our Newspaper] Minister Gu Zhengwang of the Ministry of Social Affairs returned to Beijing by train last night after completing his official duties. Minister Gu has been soliciting opinions from both labor and management in this city for several days, and after consulting with Mayor Wu and Director Wu, he has decided to recommend to the Central Government that the cost of living index freeze be lifted in principle. However, in order to reduce the burden on the industrial sector, a method will be adopted whereby the base number is calculated in full according to the index, and the percentage will be gradually reduced above that level. Multiple plans have been drafted, with attached charts for explanation, which will be carried back to Beijing by Minister Gu and presented to the Central Government for selection and decision. Minister Gu told reporters that the labor sector in this city believes that the current price increases make it impossible for workers to maintain their livelihood and demands that the cost of living index be unfrozen, or at least that the index be unfrozen conditionally. He also convened leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors today to discuss the issue, and they expressed sympathy for the workers' hardship. However, they expressed that the recession in the industrial sector itself is also very serious, and they hope that the government can pay attention to maintaining the industry and stabilizing the lives of workers, taking both into consideration. On the issue of lifting the index freeze, the opinions of labor and management have converged in principle. The technical issues after the freeze is lifted have now been studied with Mayor Wu and Director Wu, and preliminary specific measures have also been decided. However, the freezing of the index is a central government decision, and local authorities cannot change it without central approval. The Municipal Government will jointly suggest it to the Central Government within days. It is deeply believed that protecting the lives of workers is an established national policy of the government, and this suggestion will be adopted and implemented in the shortest possible time.

Small Group Meeting of Labor-Management Evaluation Committee Plans to Come Up with Multiple Specific Measures

In order to solicit opinions and formulate plans for Minister Gu to bring to the central government for reference and adoption, the Small Group Meeting of the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee on the Cost of Living Index Issue held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau Conference Room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the issue of lifting the index freeze. The specialized committee members present were Shang Xuexiang, Tian Heqing, Li Kaidi, Fan CaiKui, Xia Enlin, Zhao Banfu, Shui Xiangyun, Dong Rengui, Wang Ziyang, Zhang Zhusan, and Ye Xianggao. Fan Zhenbang, Ling Mozhen, and Xu Lin attended as observers. Director Wu served as chairman. After three hours of discussion, multiple specific measures were drafted. Director Wu Chang telegraphed the said measures to Minister Gu and Mayor Wu in advance, and Minister Gu carried them to Beijing last night to present them to the highest authorities for approval.

Base Salary Rumored to Be 30 Yuan

According to Director Wu, the small group meeting formulated a plan based on the opinions of the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Federation of Trade Unions, and decided to conditionally lift the index freeze from May. It can be announced after the central government approves it.

It is learned that the so-called "conditional" means that the base salary is actually paid according to the index if it is below the specified base number, and the portion exceeding the specified base number is actually paid at a discount according to the index. The base salary is likely to start at 30 yuan on the worker's side. The reason for this decision is to take into account the ability of some employers to bear the burden, so as not to be unable to bear the burden due to the sudden lifting of the freeze and the increase in wages.

### Shanghai West District Cotton Textile Workers' Union Petitions the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday

Director Wu Says the Matter Can Be Resolved This Month

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai West District Cotton Textile Workers' Union, representing 45,000 workers from 28 units, demanded that the indexation freeze be lifted starting from April. They threatened to strike at 2:00 PM on the 5th if their demand was not met. The union's directors and supervisors, feeling unable to control the agitated workers, convened a joint meeting of all unions at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. They immediately dispatched over ten representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, which was in session. At 7:00 PM that evening, another joint meeting was held. Zhang Zhusan, the representative of the General Labor Union who attended the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee meeting, reported that a method for lifting the freeze had been agreed upon and would be announced after approval from the central government. He urged everyone not to take rash actions.

A reporter then visited Wu, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to inquire about the workers' demand to lift the indexation freeze starting from April. Director Wu replied: "The law does not punish past actions. I am responsible for resolving this issue starting from May. If the workers insist on implementing it starting from April, then I will not be threatened," and so forth.

[Another Report] The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union also convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its headquarters yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to strive for the lifting of the indexation freeze. It was resolved to invite representatives from postal workers' unions across the country to hold a joint meeting in Beijing on the 15th to discuss the direction forward.

### The War Prisoners Management Office: Closure Is Still Pending

[Our Newspaper] The Jiangwan War Prisoners Management Office, which was originally scheduled to close at the end of June this year, will reportedly be extended because war prisoners are still being sent in successively from various locations, and the repatriation work still needs to be carried out. At the same time, the Japanese war criminals detained in the war criminals detention center, although being tried successively by military tribunals, will be difficult to complete all trials in a short time, and the War Prisoners Management Office will still be responsible for the duty of detention and guarding. As for the Japanese technical personnel remaining in China, they have now been transferred to the responsibility of the Municipal Government for unified management. Those who have no need to remain in China or have other intentions have been investigated separately and will be repatriated to their country in the short term.

### Representatives of Industry Hold Talks, Acknowledge That Difficulty in Obtaining Foreign Exchange and Raw Materials is the Crux of Rising Prices, Sympathize with the Need to Adjust Workers' Treatment

[Our Newspaper] Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in order to understand the actual situation of the current industry, convened a talk with various industrial trade associations in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. Over 40 responsible persons from the electrical equipment industry, papermaking industry, textile industry, rubber industry, and other industries attended. During the meeting, Minister Gu elaborated on three points: (1) Actively exert the power of each industry to ensure the future and seek development. (2) It is necessary to overcome economic difficulties, and the government and the people, labor and capital, and workers must cooperate to break through the difficulties. (3) The government is studying countermeasures to address labor issues in order to seek social stability. Subsequently, representatives of various industries broadly exchanged views on the current prices, wages, organization, and business. They provided very detailed descriptions of the problems of foreign exchange and import management, wage adjustments, bureaucratic capital using privileges, and destroying the economy. Most believed that the industrial sector's inability to directly obtain foreign exchange to purchase the required raw materials and materials is the biggest difficulty for the current industrial sector and the biggest crux of rising prices. Regarding the issue of workers' wages, many believed that since the indexation freeze, there has been a significant disconnect from prices, which affects work efficiency and causes social unrest, so reasonable adjustments should be made.

Minister Gu Concludes with Seven Points

Finally, Minister Gu concluded with seven points: (1) Report bureaucratic capital using privileges to illegally obtain foreign exchange. (2) Those who do not join the association should be stopped from operating in accordance with the law, and this point should be strictly enforced by the Social Affairs Bureau. (3) Protect industry and prohibit the use of violence to destroy productive enterprises. (4) Promote the spirit of democracy, implement a democratic style, to fight for their own interests and supervise officials to protect their interests with their own strength. (5) The Industrial Association Law must be based on the consistent stance in the past to complete the legislative process to meet the needs. It is especially hoped that industry and commerce will cooperate to generate a complementary effect. (6) The problem of unemployed workers should be solved by factory owners and the government cooperating to seek a solution. (7) It is very necessary for industrial groups to hold monthly meetings. Beijing and Shanghai are close at hand, and I am very willing to participate often to establish closer ties with various industrialists. The talks ended at about 1:00 PM.

### The Second Day of the District Government Symposium: The Focus of the Discussion is on Issues Such as Food, Corruption, and Rent

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's district government symposium continued to be held for the second day yesterday, still presided over by Speaker Pan. Seventeen people attended, including the chairmen of the district representatives' conferences, deputy district heads, and municipal councilors elected from the four districts of Songshan, Penglai, Luwan, and Yimiao. The focus of the discussion included the following issues:

Food Imports Should Be Considered

(1) Suppressing Prices: The representatives believed that the municipal government's measure of selling rice to suppress rice prices was not as effective as adopting a method of allocating grain based on population, which would directly benefit the common people more. Speaker Pan indicated that the authorities have also considered this. Then, Councilor Shi Zongde stood up and loudly exclaimed: "In the second quota allocation table of the Import Management Committee, the quota for rice and wheat is only 7 million US dollars, while the quota for tobacco leaves is 8 million US dollars. What is the reason for this? Is it that rice and wheat, on which the people rely for food, are not as important as tobacco?" He requested that the central government reconsider this quota policy.

Rent Standards Should Be Re-Established

(2) Housing Rent Issues: Also a central topic of discussion yesterday, it was felt that rent standards should be re-established urgently to avoid disputes, but simply setting a multiple is quite unreasonable. For example, the land prices and real estate in Huangpu District cannot be compared with the land prices in Longhua District, so following the principles of Article 97 of the Land Law is more reasonable, but its provision of a maximum amount calculated at 10% of interest is still too high, because before the war, the general real estate rent in Shanghai, calculated on an annual interest basis, did not reach 3-4%.

Privately Built Shanties Easily Cause Fires

(3) Fire Prevention: There are many shanties in Nanshi. These shanties mostly use tar paper as roofs. Once a fire breaks out, the fragments fly everywhere, forming an uncontrollable situation and making rescue difficult. Therefore, to solve the fire problem, prohibiting the private construction of shanties and suspending shanty construction licenses is an urgent priority. It was also found that after fires occur in Nanshi, the fire hydrants often cannot discharge water smoothly because the water company fails to provide a sufficient supply. This point should also be brought to the attention of the authorities.

Finally, Speaker Pan stated that he hoped that the third general meeting of the district people's representatives' conferences could be convened before the third general meeting of the council, so that councilors could attend and listen to opinions from all sides, so that they could be submitted to the council for reference.

### Former Municipal Government Chongqing Office Personnel Zhang Yuren and Others Accused of Corruption

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Yuren, the former director of the Municipal Government's Chongqing Office, deputy director Wu Jingsen, Public Works Bureau representative Zhang Baoming, Land Bureau representative Chen Zicai, and Finance Bureau representative Wu Boqi were recently accused of corruption by Tang Mingshi, the chief secretary of the Public Works Bureau. It was said that when Zhang and others hired a special ship to transport the families of municipal government personnel to Shanghai at the beginning of the victory the year before last, they took advantage of their positions to sell Mo shi tickets and deduct the cost of food on the ship, openly engaging in bribery and other actions. Yesterday morning, the District Procuratorate held a court hearing, summoning the defendants and accusers for interrogation, and all were ordered to return after the interrogation.

### Music Group Manager Accused of Abandonment, Brings Luggage to Court and Firmly Asks to Be Detained

[Our Newspaper] Deng Shiping, the manager of the Chinese Music Group, which is about to perform the "Meng Jiangnv" opera in the United States, was recently accused of abandonment by his wife, Chu Jingru, to the Women's Movement Committee of the Municipal Party Department. The case has been transferred by the Women's Movement Committee to the District Procuratorate. The presiding prosecutor summoned Deng for interrogation yesterday afternoon. Deng arrived at the court at 2:00 PM, carrying a blue cloth bundle containing bedding, underwear, and other daily necessities, saying that he was prepared to be detained in prison. After the prosecutor interrogated him, he offered to release him on bail. Deng firmly requested to be detained. After persuasion from the bailiff, he quickly left to find bail.

### New-Style Postal Booths Set Up at the Bund Racecourse

[Our Newspaper] In order to facilitate citizens' mailing, the Shanghai Postal Bureau has decided to set up two new-style postal booths recently in front of Nanjing Road, the Bund, and the Racecourse. The business includes selling tickets and receiving and sending registered mail. There will also be a telegraph operator stationed inside, dispatched by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, to facilitate citizens sending and receiving telegrams. The bureau has obtained the approval of the Public Utilities Bureau for the land occupied by these postal booths. In addition, since the bureau implemented the postal zoning delivery system last month, it has not achieved significant results because the general public is not yet accustomed to it. It has recently decided to send personnel to the major companies, shops, and newspaper offices that send the most mail to register postal codes on their behalf, and to send letters to printing companies requesting them to add postal codes when printing envelopes for various institutions and groups in order to promote the system widely.

### Shi Chunxuan Sued, Cries "Aiya" Upon Hearing the Verdict, Tested for Opium Addiction, Cries Injustice

[Our Newspaper] Shi Chunxuan, who calls himself the "King of Shenqu," was forced by six unidentified people on March 29 to go to the Yipinxian Hotel to negotiate, saying that someone had accused him of smoking opium, resulting in him being defrauded of 4 million legal tender. The police bureau learned of the matter and immediately went to Shi Chunxuan's house to search the next day. Although nothing was found, the police bureau believed that Shi was indeed suspected of drug use and sent him to the hospital for examination. The examination revealed that Shi Chunxuan was indeed addicted to opium, so he was sent to the District Court for trial as a special criminal case. Judge Shen Tianbao opened the trial yesterday and sentenced him to one year and four months in prison, with a two-month deadline to quit opium addiction. Shi cried "Aiya" upon hearing the verdict, closed his eyes tightly, and then fell backward. The bailiffs and court clerks quickly helped him up. Shi slowly woke up, jumping around with his feet, and repeatedly shouted injustice.

### High Court Reviews the Case of Meisberg, the Defendant Contends for Position in Zhu Ying Bank, Claims That 20,000 Hong Kong Dollars Was Not a Deposit

[Our Newspaper] The "Foreign Tiger" Dutchman Meisberg was detained by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and sent to the District Court for legal action on March 3 because his Ebbs Company (in the Xinfeng Company, Room 118 of the Sassoon Building on Nanjing Road) was engaged in black market foreign exchange, buying and selling foreign currency, and violating emergency economic measures. The District Court sentenced Meisberg to one year in prison on April 14. Meisberg refused to accept this and appealed to the High Court, while the District Procuratorate prosecutor Quan Dian also believed that the original trial sentence was too light and appealed to the High Court. The case was heard in the High Court at 9:00 AM yesterday. Anderson, the Deputy Consul of the US Consulate General in Shanghai, legal advisor Zhang Tiansa, and Dutch Consul General Mitterdeng all attended the hearing. Meisberg's lawyers Chen Tingrui and Cai Rudong, and Xie Chunpu, the accountant hired by the Garrison Headquarters to review the accounts, also attended the hearing. Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court, judges Wang Kequan and Han Shuzhi, and prosecutor Yang Ruicheng took their seats in the Criminal Court One, and the bailiffs brought Meisberg before the court. The court first asked Meisberg his age and origin. He replied that he was 55 years old, Dutch, residing at No. 433 Haig Road, and a foreign exchange broker. Judge Liu then informed him that today was for investigating evidence, and since you have filed an appeal, the prosecutor has also filed an appeal at the same time. First, let the prosecutor state the reasons for the appeal.

Prosecutor Yang's Argument

Prosecutor Yang Ruicheng then stood up and said: "The reasons for the appeal have been detailed in the appeal document. Now, I will briefly explain them. In February, due to the soaring prices of gold and banknotes, which affected the rising prices of goods, the government promulgated emergency measures. The defendant did not comply with the laws and continued to engage in black market foreign exchange transactions. The original trial determined that the defendant was a foreigner and did not understand Chinese law, so he was sentenced to one year in prison. However, it was found that the defendant had been doing business in Shanghai for a long time and was very familiar with the situation in China, so the determination of the original trial was inappropriate. This is the first reason for not accepting the original judgment. Also, the original trial determined that the foreign exchange operated by the defendant could not be regarded as the foreign currency referred to in the emergency economic measures and was not dealt with. However, it was found that the foreign exchange operated by the defendant was all denominated in foreign currencies, which undoubtedly belonged to the operation of foreign currency. The original trial did not deal with this, which was also inappropriate. This is the second reason for not accepting the original judgment. Based on these two reasons, this prosecutor believes that the original judgment was too light and requests the court to revoke the original judgment and make a more appropriate judgment."

The Defendant Denies Guilt

Subsequently, Meisberg said: "The original court, based on Article 7 of the emergency economic measures, determined that the appellant received 20,000 Hong Kong dollars on February 25 as a deposit, which was an act of operating a bank, and sentenced the appellant to imprisonment based on Article 7 of the plan. However, this 20,000 Hong Kong dollars was not a deposit, but a deposit for a customer to buy and sell foreign exchange with New York Lei'e Company. After the transaction was completed, it had to be returned to the original owner. The appellant was only a broker, and Ebbs Company never accepted deposits. The original trial treated it as a bank for conviction and sentencing, which was obviously inappropriate. It is requested that the court pronounce a judgment of innocence." At this point, lawyer Chen Tingrui stood up and added: "After the defendant filed an appeal, your court immediately conducted a hearing, so the statement of reasons for appeal has not yet been submitted and will be submitted later. Whether the legal provisions of the economic emergency measures cited in this case have completed the legislative procedures will be explained in detail in the appeal statement in the future. Now, I will briefly supplement the facts. The original court determined that the defendant was engaged in banking business and convicted him accordingly. It should be known that the emergency economic measures refer to formal banks, so at the end of the text, there is a statement about revoking the license. Moreover, the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars of deposit received by the defendant was a deposit for buying and selling foreign exchange with New York Lei'e Company. The original trial translation was incorrect, treating it as a deposit and convicting him accordingly, which is really difficult to accept."

Account Review Process

Subsequently, accountant Xie Chunpu stood up and reported on the account review process of Ebbs Company, saying that he received a phone call from the Garrison Headquarters on the evening of March 1 to check the accounts. After three days of effort, the report was prepared on the 6th. All the income and expenditure accounts of Ebbs Company were listed in the report. He asked Meisberg, who admitted that the report was correct. Lawyer Chen stood up and asked accountant Xie three questions: (1) Was the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars a deposit or a comfort fund? (2) Did Ebbs Company have deposits of a banking nature? (3) From an accounting point of view, what kind of company was Ebbs Company? Accountant Xie said: (1) After investigation, the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars was a deposit. (2) The company had no deposits of a banking nature. (3) The company was not registered with our government, but was registered in the United States as a draft company. Whether it is of a banking nature cannot be determined.

Testimonies are Mostly the Same

Subsequently, bookkeeper Portuguese Pabotistai, cashier Shi Jiusen, bookkeeper Shao Shunqin, assistant Portuguese Kangpaishi, and transaction officer Portuguese Baotailiya were summoned, and their testimonies were mostly the same. Finally, lawyer Chen requested a suspension of the detention. The court said that it was necessary to apply with a statement and the collegiate panel would make a ruling. It also requested that the defendant be returned to the Masnan Road Detention Center to facilitate the delivery of meals, which was approved by the court. Judge Liu said: "This case is scheduled to open an oral debate court at 9:30 AM on the 10th, and the trial will conclude then." Yesterday, the trial lasted for four hours, and the court adjourned at 1:30 PM.

### Forging Transportation Company Seals to Impersonate Bundle of Banknotes for Fraud

The police officers of the Songshan Precinct arrested a person in a room in a certain hotel in the Hongyunfang on Ninghai West Road the day before yesterday. He was seen sealing bundles of banknotes. On the table were more than ten pieces of seals of "Shanghai Public Transport Company Transportation Group Business Office" and cash of 500,000 in one bundle. The above seals were affixed on it. After the police officers opened it for inspection, the actual amount was only 250,000 yuan, and half of the intermediate was mixed with small tickets of 500 yuan. Then, a large leather wallet was searched under his bed, containing three pieces of suit material. He was immediately arrested. According to the confession, his name is Lin Mengnan, 21 years old, from Zhejiang, unemployed. He admitted that he was going to deposit the insufficient amount of banknotes into the current deposit account of the Savings Department of the Bank of China. In order to avoid the inspection by the bank staff, he affixed the seals. When asked where he bought the suit material, he replied that he also obtained it from a certain suit shop using this method, but he had forgotten the shop number, and the rest of his confession was ambiguous. Lin was wearing a suit and had a lavish demeanor. He was immediately taken to the police station along with the stolen goods for investigation, and then sent to the court for trial.

### Joint Anti-Tuberculosis Committee Launches Student Anti-Tuberculosis Fundraising

The Shanghai Joint Anti-Tuberculosis Committee held a tea party on the 2nd at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA and the Shanghai Student Relief Association, convened by Yen Hui-ching and Pan Gongzhan, to discuss student anti-tuberculosis fundraising methods. It was decided to use the more than 3,300 university students who had been aided by the Shanghai Student Relief Association as the main force, with each person responsible for inviting two enthusiastic and righteous student leaders from their classmates, forming a fundraising team of 10,000 students. Each person's goal is at least 60,000 yuan, which would yield a total of 600 million yuan. Of this amount, 30% will be donated by the Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee to the Shanghai Student Relief Association as operating expenses, and the remaining 70% will be used for anti-tuberculosis work in the city. There are three types of fundraising: paper badges at 2,000 yuan each, metal badges at 5,000 yuan each, and medical books at 10,000 yuan each. In addition to the anti-tuberculosis paper badges, which will be sold on the streets and in public places on the official fundraising day, the other two types can be sold in advance anywhere, such as homes, stores, and organizations.

### Social Services, Reader Consultation

Legal Interpretation

(1) Dissolution of Engagement

Zongcheng asks: A female relative of mine, Miss Jia, was betrothed to Mr. Yi by her parents through a matchmaker when she was seven years old. At that time, in addition to exchanging jewelry and rings, they received an engagement gift of 50 yuan. Now Miss Jia is 24 years old and studying at a university. Because she has different interests from the other party, she firmly opposes this engagement. However, she does not understand the law and has not dared to act rashly. I would like to ask the following questions and would be grateful for your answers: (1) Can she declare this engagement invalid by simply making a public statement? (2) If the other party does not agree to the dissolution, will this hinder her freedom of marriage? (3) Will the person proposing the dissolution have to compensate for any losses? (4) How should the engagement gift be returned? (5) How should she deal with illegal coercion from the other party? (6) If the other party delays and refuses to dissolve the engagement, can the woman choose another spouse, and would this be illegal? (7) What are the steps to resolve this engagement?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] An engagement made by parents for their minor children is naturally invalid and does not need to be dissolved. Therefore, (1) is yes. (2) is no hindrance. (3) In general, the party who is not at fault in dissolving an engagement may request compensation from the party who is at fault for the damages suffered as a result. (4) It can be negotiated by both parties. (5) Sue the court for a ruling. (6) Yes. (7) It is best to have someone mediate.

(2) Concealed Pregnancy

Li Zhizhong asks: I have several legal questions and respectfully request your answers: Mr. Jia is married and has children. He cohabits with a Miss Yi, who, due to her poor family background, often asks Mr. Jia for help. Over time, Miss Yi's daughter gradually developed feelings for Mr. Jia, and later a physical relationship occurred. However, the daughter is engaged to Mr. Bing (the daughter is 19 years old) and is now pregnant. Please advise (1) whether Mr. Jia's behavior constitutes the crime of interfering with a family or offending public morals? (2) Can Mr. Bing sue Mr. Jia for seduction? (3) If Mr. Jia's wife is willing for Miss Yi to cohabit with them, can the engagement between the daughter and Mr. Bing be dissolved?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] If Yi and Jia are having an affair, and it is initiated by Yi, it does not constitute abduction. If Jia did not cause Yi to leave her family or other persons with supervisory authority, it does not constitute the crime of enticing her away. Bing cannot sue Jia, except that Jia’s wife can sue him for adultery. If Jia’s wife tolerates or pardons the affair, she cannot sue either. As for the engagement between Yi and Bing, Bing may claim dissolution due to Yi's affair with Jia and may request compensation for losses. If Yi claims dissolution, Bing's consent must be obtained, but Bing may not request compulsory performance.

### High Procuratorate Returns Huang Bohui Assassination Case for Further Investigation

[Our Newspaper News] The assassination case of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Times, had been concluded by the local procuratorate, which found that the defendant Zheng Desheng had no suspicion of inciting murder and dismissed the case. The plaintiff Huang Bohui disagreed and applied to the High Procuratorate for reconsideration and provided evidence. The High Procuratorate has now completed its investigation and believes that Huang Bohui's application is justified and should be reinvestigated. The entire case file was returned to the local procuratorate yesterday. The reasons are roughly as follows: The plaintiff submitted an X-ray photograph explanation and the diagnosis of Dr. Zhang Qubing from Wuzhou Pharmacy, stating that the depressed fracture of the parietal bone on the right side of the plaintiff's head may have been caused by a gunshot wound, while the forensic examination in the original investigation stated that it was not caused by a gunshot wound. The High Procuratorate believes there is a big difference and the Prosecutor can entrust the hospital to conduct an expert determination in accordance with Article 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. At the same time, they attach great importance to the assassin identified by the plaintiff, Gai Siweituo, and the High Court prosecutor believes that Gai is indeed a major suspect. Defendant Zheng Desheng is currently in custody, and the local procuratorate will begin the reinvestigation of the case within the next week.

### Shanghai University Professors' Association Cables Executive Yuan Requesting Adjustment of Salaries

The Shanghai University Professors' Association recently sent a telegram to Executive Yuan President Zhang and Minister of Education Zhu, stating: "Recently, due to soaring prices and the depreciation of currency, the lives of professors have become increasingly difficult. According to official statistics, the price increase rate has exceeded 20,000 times, while the income of teachers has not reached 2,000 times. With this meager income, it is impossible to cope with soaring prices, and even the most basic living needs cannot be met. We, as respected teachers, bearing the heavy responsibility of education, are unable to support our parents or raise our children. We are mentally and physically exhausted and helpless. Our current lives are heartbreaking to talk about! Therefore, the Association has decided to request that the salaries of professors be reasonably adjusted immediately to alleviate our suffering. Otherwise, forced by livelihood concerns, we will inevitably seek other means of survival, or even stop teaching due to hunger. The future of education is a matter of great concern."

### Paper Shortage Leads to Book Famine, Awaiting Relief from the Ministry of Education

The national paper import allocation method is quite slow.

General publishers are struggling to maintain their business and plan to appeal to the Ministry of Education for relief and to solve the paper shortage problem quickly with effective measures to avoid an unprecedented serious book famine.

### The Municipal Teachers' College Student Riot Case Involves Inhuman Education

The classroom of the Municipal Wuben Girls' High School was destroyed by students from the Municipal Teachers' College one evening, causing the school to be forced to suspend classes from the 2nd. This matter has aroused considerable social attention. According to an editorial in a certain newspaper, the principal of the Municipal Teachers' College should be replaced to rectify the academic atmosphere. It is said that the principal of the Municipal Teachers' College is Dong Renjian. Dong usually runs the Municipal Teachers' College in a way that does not follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education, but implements his own "Inhuman Education." The so-called "Inhuman Education" is to allow students to be free and not require teachers to teach, allowing students to engage in free activities. Those who have visited the Municipal Teachers' College have often criticized this approach. The incident of students from the Municipal Teachers' College rioting in a mob is said to be the result of the lack of discipline in "Inhuman Education."

### Mayor's Cup Women's Basketball Tournament: Snow White Wins Final Victory After Three Battles with Qinglian

[Report from our newspaper] In the Mayor's Cup Women's Basketball Tournament, Snow White and Qinglian only decided the winner after their third match last night. Snow White defeated Qinglian 51-38, securing the right to the finals.

Last night's game between the two sides lacked the excitement of the previous two matches. One of the Qinglian team members even participated in two matches in one day. In the first half, Qinglian still showed teamwork, and the scores remained close. However, in the second half, they became unable to sustain the effort and showed signs of fatigue. As a result, Snow White gradually improved and finally won the victory.

Zhang Xiuli of Snow White scored the first point. Sun Fengzhu of Qinglian made two out of two free throws, tying the score at four points each. When the score was 5-4, Wang Shan replaced Zhu Jiazhen for Snow White. In the first quarter, Qinglian led by one point, 14-13. At the beginning of the second quarter, Wang Huiling tied the score at 15 points. Soon after, Snow White exceeded the score by three points at 18. Yang Jian and Sun Fengzhu quickly caught up again, bringing the score to 22-20. At halftime, Snow White led by one point, 24-23.

In the third quarter, when the score was 34-27, Guo Aizhen of Snow White was "fouled out" and replaced by Huang Ruyu. Snow White scored more points in this quarter, making the score 36-28.

In the fourth quarter, when the score was 41-28, Wang Wenzhu of Qinglian was also "fouled out" and replaced by Liu Huishan. At 47-35, Wang Xiu of Snow White was fouled out and replaced by Yao Siyuan. The final score was 51-38, and Snow White obtained the right to the finals.

### Hong Kong Charity Tennis Match: Cai Huiquan Suffers Defeat

[Report from our newspaper in Hong Kong] A charity tennis exhibition match for British flood relief, featuring our country's former Davis Cup player Cai Huiquan against Ye Guanxiong, the newly crowned Hong Kong singles champion, was held on the 28th at this court. The court was wet from rain, not completely dry, and the sky was overcast with poor lighting. This was not ideal for the veteran player. Cai Huiquan's performance was not up to par.

In the first set, after a hard-fought battle, Ye won 6-4. When the score reached 5-5 in the second set, the referee, seeing the dimming sky, announced that three more games would be played. Whoever won two games would win the set. After the score became 6-6, Ye Guanxiong won another game, thus defeating Cai Huiquan in straight sets.

In the doubles match, Cai Guanxiong and Cai Huiquan faced the Xu brothers, Wei Pei and Run Pei. When they took the court, there was a light drizzle, and many spectators were disappointed. Before the first set was decided, the heavy rain came, and everyone dispersed in disappointment.

Football: The league championships for the A and B divisions have been won by Sing Tao A and B teams, respectively. The Football Association has scheduled the awards ceremony for May 4th.

The lineup for the all-star team from both the A and B divisions has been selected. The A division players are as follows:

Que Lasi Ji

Xie Jinhong, Diya, Anderson, Chen Li, Se He, Yitu, Ganna Shi, Xiao Weilu, Zou Wenzhi, Xie Jinhe.

Basketball: The Vietnamese basketball team originally scheduled five matches in Hong Kong. After the second match against Zhongqing, due to various misunderstandings, the remaining matches against Zili, Black Cat, and Nanlai were temporarily canceled. Later, the leader of the Vietnamese team, Lin Luying, stated that the purpose of this trip was for exchange and sightseeing, and he stepped forward to mediate. The competition was then allowed to continue, and it was decided to first continue the match against Zili. The matches against Black Cat and South China will be rescheduled when the Vietnamese team returns to Hong Kong after completing their tour in Guangzhou.

Zili was originally a strong team in Hong Kong, but due to personnel issues, their performance has been declining. The forward, Lu Zhenxuan, was missing, and only Zhang Shutang was active, making it difficult to score. Although the defender, Lu Dezhang, performed well, it was difficult to reverse the situation. After halftime, the substitute was brought in, shaking up the formation. As a result, the Vietnamese team took advantage and won 40-30. The Vietnamese team's record in Hong Kong is now two wins and one loss.

### National Banks and Bureaus to Adjust Exchange Rates in Various Places Starting Tomorrow

Remittance Amount Expected to be Relaxed, Review Procedures Tightened

[Report from our newspaper] The exchange rates of remittances to various places from the city's four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury will be adjusted on a large scale starting May 5th. It is reported that this is due to the recent smuggling of large quantities of legal tender from Guangzhou to Hong Kong to obtain Hong Kong dollars and purchase foreign goods. On the other hand, some commercial firms are taking advantage of the low exchange rates of national banks and bureaus to engage in arbitrage. It is heard that the exchange rates of various commercial firms to various places are 190 yuan per 1,000 yuan to Xiamen and Quanzhou, 60 yuan to Fuzhou, 230 yuan for cash and 175 yuan for account transfer to Guangzhou. 180 yuan to 200 yuan to Shantou. 95 yuan to Hankou. 25 yuan to Chongqing. Related parties told reporters: Recently, the black market exchange rate has skyrocketed, and the difference with the official price has become increasingly large. The situation of overseas remittances escaping has also become increasingly serious, invisibly increasing the demand for huge amounts of legal tender. It is hoped that the government will seek practical solutions to the issue of overseas remittances. The purpose of the national banks and bureaus adjusting exchange rates in various places this time is to curb arbitrage by commercial firms. The current countermeasure is to tighten the review procedures, but the remittance amount will be relaxed. If commercial firms can state reasons and list facts, permission for allocation will be granted. The adjusted exchange rates for remittances to various places are listed as follows:

80 yuan per 1,000 yuan to Xiamen (originally 45 yuan), 60 yuan to Fuzhou (originally 40 yuan), 80 yuan to other places in the Fujian region (originally 45 yuan). 95 yuan to Guangzhou (originally 75 yuan), 95 yuan to Shantou (originally 80 yuan), 95 yuan to other places in the Guangdong region (originally 80 yuan). 2 yuan to Qingdao (originally 5 yuan), 5 yuan to other places in the Shandong region (originally 10 yuan). Small number of 50 yuan to the Guangxi region (originally 30 yuan).

70 yuan to Changsha (originally 55 yuan), 70 yuan to Hengyang (originally 55 yuan), 70 yuan to other places in the Hunan region (originally 55 yuan). 70 yuan to the Henan region (originally 55 yuan). 6 yuan to Nantong (originally 8 yuan). 20 yuan to Wuhu (originally 15 yuan).

65 yuan to Hankou and Wuchang (originally 50 yuan), 70 yuan to Shashi and Yichang (originally 55 yuan), 70 yuan to other places in the Hubei region (originally 55 yuan). 20 yuan to Ganzhou, Nanchang, and Jiujiang (originally 10 yuan each), 20 yuan to Jingdezhen and other places in the Jiangxi region (originally 15 yuan each). 3 yuan to Hangzhou (originally 2 yuan).

20 yuan to Chongqing (originally 2 yuan), 20 yuan to Chengdu (originally 5 yuan), 30 yuan to Xufu (originally 10 yuan), 30 yuan to Wanxian (originally 8 yuan), 20 yuan to other places in the Sichuan region (originally 10 yuan). 20 yuan to the Guizhou region (originally 5 yuan). 20 yuan to the Yunnan region (originally 5 yuan).

### Unified Bonds Still Active: Class C Rises by 3,200

Yesterday, government bonds were very active, and the psychology of upward trend prevailed again. The unified Class C opened at 16,300 yuan and gradually increased from 15,900 yuan to 19,200 yuan before turning flat. Rooms 512, 503, 251, and 550 were all active, room 360 sold first and then bought, and Baolong Runde had sales. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A, B, D, and E all rose by 1,600 and 1,800 respectively, while the unified Class C rose by 3,200 alone.

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

Foreign stocks continued to rise yesterday. Foreign merchants and Cantonese merchants bought Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco. Securities firms sold Ewo and switched to Ye Guang, causing small stocks such as Ye Guang to rise sharply. Ewo opened at 71,600 yuan in the morning and immediately rose. At noon, it was reported that Shen Dian had made a retraction and rose to 74,400 yuan before turning flat. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ye Guang, Paper Industry, and Steel Industry all rose by about 50%, and British American Tobacco, Ewo, Shipping, Reclamation Planting, and Kaiping all rose by about 10%, with the rest rising by 5%.

### Rayon Slightly Drops

Yesterday, the price of rayon in the market dropped slightly as soon as the market opened due to the shortage of funds among peers. No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang first shouted 17 million yuan, and then sold one box for 6.8 million yuan. However, because the asking price was too low, there was a time when there were buyers but no sellers. Then the asking price gradually rose again, and finally closed at 8.2 million yuan. No. 75 Jinji semi-gloss insisted on shouting prices due to lack of goods. Factory sales were limited, and yesterday's prices were all 50,000 to 60,000 yuan lower. D-grade was priced at 20 million yuan, E-grade at 19.5 million yuan, and Gan Jing Wuzu had a single order price of 16.5 million yuan. Most of the silk goods in the market were stable yesterday. Lattice crepe was first made at 34,000 yuan, and then made at 4,500 yuan. Only silk goods such as Huajin crepe and feather yarn were slightly lower by about 500 yuan yesterday due to the slight recovery of raw materials.

### Cotton Yarn Price Negotiation Team Still Collecting Information

[Report from our newspaper] The six-district cotton spinning public meeting price negotiation team held a meeting at the China Textile Building Company yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Committee members Wu Weijing, Liu Qingji, textile management committee Liu Wenteng, Wang Zijian, etc. were present. Because the private spinning mills have not been able to provide data to calculate the cost of production, the price negotiation cannot proceed. It was decided that the private spinning mills would first collect data at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning, negotiate a cost sheet, and then convene a price negotiation team meeting for discussion.

### Black Market Prices Extremely Chaotic: Rice Merchants Make Two Requests

Request to Restore Free Trade of White Rice

[Report from our newspaper] The rice problem is still extremely serious. In addition to selling rice allocated by the government, most rice shops have no goods to offer on the market. The black market prices are rumored to be varied and extremely chaotic. Citizens have nowhere to buy rice and feel quite panicked. Rice merchants find it difficult to transport rice, and petty thieves take the opportunity to extort money along the way, and there is a possibility of being robbed, so most dare not transport rice, and complaints are endless. They would rather not do business. A total of 9,040 bags arrived at the two markets yesterday, and Baiyuan was sold for 265,000 yuan. The Social Bureau still released 9,000 bags of white rice.

Mayor Reschedules Talk for Tomorrow

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu convened a meeting with representatives of rice merchants. At that time, the person in charge of the rice industry was surrounded by rice merchants in the market and could not get away. Only Hu Xiangang went, and the talk failed to materialize. Mayor Wu then rescheduled the talk to 8:30 AM on the 5th. The rice merchants gathered at the market decided to send Qu Zhenhua and others to visit the mayor at the City Hall and made two requests: (1) The rice sold by the city government should be sold at locations separately designated by the district offices in each district. (2) Restore free trade of white rice. When the representatives rushed to the City Hall, the mayor had already gone out on official business. They then went to the Social Bureau and agreed with the head of the Food Department, Ji Mingzhai, to visit Mayor Wu again at 8:30 AM on the 5th (Monday).

Fear of Performing Shop Raids, Afraid to Sell Allocated Rice

According to the representatives of the rice industry: the rice shops saw the great upsurge of rice shop raids in Hangzhou and became panicked. To avoid danger, they requested that the rice allocated by the city government be sold at locations separately designated by the district offices in each district, and the rice shops are willing to send personnel to assist voluntarily. As for the request to restore free trade, in view of the current price limit policy of the authorities, the rice shops are unwilling to sell when they have rice, and then relax one step after selling out. This depletes the source, and the capital of the rice merchants is gradually dwindling. People have no rice to buy, which creates a panic. Therefore, they requested that free trade be allowed to be restored as soon as possible.

Coarse Grains and Food Huai Hovering Situation

Flour was firm yesterday, bran was easier to move and turned smooth, rising by 2,000 yuan, sometimes up and sometimes down.

Soybean cake trading was hot again, tired and revived, rising by 2000 to 3000 yuan, also showing a sudden rise and sudden drop. The oil market shops turned prosperous, rebounding by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, also rising and falling rapidly. It is heard that Qingdao will also be opened, and oil distribution is being processed, with a hovering trend.

Soybeans were rare in both directions, with no glory or humiliation. Mung beans in Nanyang were moving but not prosperous, flat and less spiritual. Red beans in South China were digesting leisure, and the price stood still. Raw kernels were lively to remove and vigorous, advancing 10,000 yuan. Sesame seeds in Guangzhou were sluggish and dropped by more than 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was as before, and corn was traded little, with the market temporarily flat.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Loosen

The sugar market yesterday approached the date of the allocation of Taiwan sugar, but the prices were undecided, so although the trend was soft, it did not fall too much. Such as Peruvian fine sand for 420,000 yuan, small 8,000 yuan, 24 coarse white small 10,000 yuan, 20 medium sand small 120,000 yuan, four and a half car white small more than 30,000 yuan, three and a half Xuan white fell similarly. Local sugar was slightly loose, Shantou Qing 270,000 yuan, small 5,000 yuan. Huangjiang Qing 265,000 yuan, Zhang Diao Qing 260,000 to 257,000 yuan, small 3000 to 5000 yuan. Xinghua White forty, 15,000 yuan, small 15,000 yuan. The second is 400,000 yuan to 395,000 yuan, Xinghua Red 300,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan, small more than 10,000 yuan.

### Suppressing Prices

Mayor Wu Visits President Zhang

[Report from our newspaper] Mayor Wu visited President Zhang of the Central Bank at around 5:00 PM yesterday. Soon after, Xu Kan, the Director-General of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, also arrived, and they jointly held talks for two hours. It is heard that the content of the talks was related to the suppression of high prices in the city.

### The Tea Market Remains Dim

The red and green teas exclusively for domestic sales saw little change yesterday in this district and those brought by merchants from other provinces. In terms of prices, there were minimal fluctuations within the fluctuating ranges. In the foreign-firm tea market, although several exporting firms were negotiating with cargo owners for certain export varieties, the bids from both parties were difficult to reconcile, leading to continued dim trading and a lifeless market.

Another report: Sui'an in Zhejiang Province is also a bountiful tea-producing area, with considerable annual sales both domestically and internationally. According to industry insiders, the local raw tea market has now opened, with prices reported at 250,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight).

### Industrial Oils Surge

Due to dwindling stockpiles, industrial oils are being aggressively sought by soap factories, leading to further price increases. Wo-ben asphalt is quoted at 6.6 million yuan, and tallow at 8 million yuan, with some transactions occurring. Coconut oil is at 1.1 million yuan, with transactions, but in very small quantities, as oil merchants have already sold out.

### Western Medicine Prices Soar - Two Reasons Behind It

[Our Report] According to sources in the new medicine industry, the recent surge in Western medicine prices is due to two reasons: (1) The black market exchange rate is soaring, leading to merchants rushing to purchase, which further drives up prices. (2) The Import Control Committee announced a second-quarter quota of only US$600,000 for Western medicines. Furthermore, the eligibility criteria for importers are limited to those who imported Western medicines worth US$100,000 or more in the past year. For those with management rights, the import amount needs to be over US$50,000. Most of those meeting these qualifications are import/export companies. Legitimate pharmacies mostly ordered directly from major American pharmaceutical companies last year, but due to low production, the supply from these companies was limited, resulting in fewer imports by legitimate pharmacies. If the import quota for Western medicines is entirely in the hands of import/export companies, there is a deep concern that it will lead to monopolistic speculation and a shortage of goods on the market. Therefore, at the New Medicine Industry Association's general meeting on the 25th of last month, two requests were made to the Import Control Committee: (1) Revise the qualification review regulations for importing Western medicines so that professional and legitimate pharmacies are also listed as qualified Western medicine importing firms. (2) Western medicines that cannot be manufactured domestically or are produced in very small quantities should not be subject to quota systems. For other important medicines, quotas should be relaxed, which would make it easier to stabilize Western medicine prices.

### The Stock Market's Fragile Sentiment - Trends Unpredictable and Unstable

Although the Chinese stock market appeared stable yesterday, its fragile sentiment led to repeated rises and falls, creating a sense of uncertainty. The central forces controlling the market were external, leaving retail investors at a loss and making the trend even more unpredictable.

In the morning, Qin and other Gu-Gu stocks, as well as Rong Chen and others, opened lower. When Di Yong Yarn entered the market and showed strength, all the Di Jiao stocks opened higher. After the opening, stocks like 94, 253, 207, 185, 186, 218, 22, 219, and 152 all advanced. Shang Wu first reached its limit, rising to 6,200 yuan. 102, 89, 335, and 142 were selling, and 106 and 219 sold after advancing, causing the price to fall back to around 6,050 yuan. 102, 105, 77, 4, 91, 105, 94, 153, and 89 came to purchase, and Jiu Fu also nearly reached its limit, rising to 6,230 yuan. 152, 145, 23, 177, and 183 were selling, and retail investors suddenly panicked. Rong Feng hit its limit and fell back to a low price of 6,030 yuan. In addition to 178, 2, 14, and 23 advancing to 6,200 yuan, 151 also came to buy in, raising Di Yong Yarn to a high price of 6,300 yuan. 105, 185, 154, 76, and 7 still had supply, and it fell back to around 6,100 yuan. 145, 148, 4, 152, and 129 came to buy, and Mei Ya was raised by 112 to its limit and remained stable. At midday, it hovered around 6,200 yuan. After the close, 223 sold off, pushing it down to below 6,100 yuan. It was rumored that there was news of loans in the evening papers. In the end, compared to the previous close, Di Yong Yarn was unchanged, Xin He and Mei Ya Hua Feng rose by half a percent, Xin Guang Zhong Fa fell by slightly less than half a percent, Jing Fu rose slightly, Yong Gong and Qin Xing fell slightly, and Xin Hua fell by slightly less than 10%. Di Jiao, Yong Yarn, Hua Feng, and Jing Fu each rose by about half a percent, Qin Xing fell by half a percent, Yong Gong fell slightly, Xin He and Xin Guang rose slightly, and Mei Ya reached its limit. Among the unpopular stocks, Shang Wu and Jiu Fu reached their limits. Matches reached their limit and then retreated, rising by half a percent. Rong Feng hit its limit and then recovered, falling by slightly more than half a percent. Zhong Fang Tong Yi was unchanged, Da Tong rose by slightly more than 10%, Cement fell by slightly less than 10%, and the gains and losses of the remaining stocks were minimal. The rise of the off-market stocks remained strong, rising between 10% and 10%. The rise of Zhong Hua was the strongest.

### Daylily Scarce, Prices Surge

Recently, the stock of daylilies has been gradually decreasing, and production prices are tightening. Zhenjiang has risen from 470,000-80,000 yuan to 640,000 yuan. High-priced cargo in the market is sold at 750,000 yuan, with subsequent reductions, and the market appears stable.

### Jewelry Industry Representatives Request the National Bank to Allocate Raw Materials

Or Not to Impose Rigid Regulations on Purchase and Sale Prices

[Our Report] Representatives of the local jewelry industry, Wu Pengnian, Yao Guiqing, Qiu Yungen, and Feng Qing'an, visited President Zhang of the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at around 4 pm and were received by Vice President Liu on his behalf. The representatives presented two points: (1) They hope the National Bank can allocate raw materials such as gold bars and gold blocks. (2) If allocation is not possible, then rigid regulations should not be imposed on the prices at which the jewelry industry purchases and sells. Mr. Liu indicated that he would relay the message to President Zhang. However, he stated that the National Bank could not make a decision on this matter and would need to consult the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance.

According to industry insiders, the jewelry industry's past sales of gold jewelry helped regulate rural finance, as farmers often used their income to purchase gold jewelry. Now, due to the inability to purchase gold jewelry, they are flocking to buy daily necessities, which is also contributing to the price increases of daily necessities. Furthermore, the industry has decided to send letters to jewelry industries in Beijing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiujiang, Changsha, Chongqing, and other places in the near future to dispatch representatives to Shanghai to convene a national jewelry industry representatives conference to determine the industry's future direction. It is rumored that they will collectively petition the central government.

### Coal Prices Unchanged

The coal market this week has been relatively calm. There is not much supply of high-quality white coal, making the market relatively brisk. Lower-quality coal is not suitable for local sales in Shanghai, making its market sluggish. Although coal producers have been approved to purchase their own bituminous coal, the limited coal supply and the current sluggish factory sales in Shanghai mean that industry insiders still seem to have little interest, and prices have not changed much. Coke shipments from Jiangxi and Hubei are still arriving, and Shanghai's demand is also strong. The market is stable, with Pingxiang coke prices holding steady between 950,000 and 1,000,000 yuan. Firewood prices have risen slightly due to the impact of rising rice prices on production area prices.

### Soap Market Scarce, Factories Holding Back

The soap market is extremely scarce. Due to soaring soap prices in other ports, there is a rush to purchase in Shanghai. Soap factories believe that the current market prices are not sufficient to cover production costs, so they are releasing very little supply. Furthermore, the source of raw materials is limited and the inventory is low. Recently, the prices of oils, caustic soda, and pure alkali have surged by more than 150%, while soap prices have not yet doubled. If customers continue to purchase in large quantities, soap prices will rise sharply again.

### Agricultural Bank Convenes Meeting to Promote This Year's Cocoon Loans

[Our Report] The Agricultural Bank of China recently convened a meeting of responsible persons from its branches in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Hangzhou, and other places, as well as representatives from various cocoon firms, to discuss promoting this year's spring cocoon loans. It was decided that: (1) The Sericulture Production and Marketing Coordination Committee will be requested to report the approved loan amounts for each cocoon firm. After being approved by the Four Banks Joint Office, the loans will be issued. (2) The silkworm cocoons in eastern Zhejiang are on the market earlier. To avoid congestion, the Hangzhou branch of the China Sericulture Company will first borrow 2 billion yuan from the Hangzhou Agricultural Bank of China to loan to various firms. The loan will be guaranteed by the Zhejiang Construction Department and will be deducted from the total amount of spring cocoon loans in the future.

### Tung Oil Transportation Issues

The Export Promotion Committee is Working to Resolve Them

[Our Report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held its ninth meeting at the Central Bank yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Chairman Zhang Jia'ao, Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu, Committee members Liu Gongyun, Jin Shixuan, and Shen Xirui, and advisors Li Rui, Bai Yien, and Mag attended. Several important cases were resolved. It was reported that due to the lack of tonnage in ships and the lack of storage facilities in Wuhan and other places, the Committee is working hard to resolve the issue of transporting tung oil from Chongqing to Shanghai. In addition to sending a letter to the Chongqing Shipping Allocation Committee to find a solution, the Tung Oil Working Group is also conducting research. Furthermore, the smuggling of tung oil to Hong Kong is becoming increasingly serious, resulting in significant losses of foreign exchange. It was reported that the Committee has already discussed countermeasures and is submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Another report: The China Vegetable Oil Factory exported 1,700 tons of tung oil last month and sold 640 tons. From January to March, the exported portion was 3,000 tons, and the sold portion was 3,050 tons. The company's exports in Hong Kong from January to March were 7,000 tons, while other firms' exports in Hong Kong were 7,600 tons. Furthermore, it is known that there are more than a dozen other firms in Shanghai engaged in tung oil exports, such as the China Trust Bureau, Shen Yuan Lai Nanyang Company, and Yi Rui, whose export volume from January to March was 3,500 tons. Tung oil is a major export commodity for our country and occupies an important position in international trade. In recent months, the export volume has not been high. According to industry insiders, the reasons are: (1) High production area prices and transportation difficulties, with Shanghai prices at 450,000 yuan per shi dan (unit of weight), or approximately US$0.37 per pound. (2) Overseas price declines, with a price of US$0.27 per pound, resulting in losses. (3) Abundant overseas inventory. In the United States alone, the estimated total amount is sufficient for ten months of use. Furthermore, the instability of our country's currency has caused foreign merchants to be apprehensive, and producers are hoarding goods, leading to this unfavorable situation.

### Caustic Soda Prices Chaotic

Since January, the market price of caustic soda has soared from 3.5 million yuan to around 8 million yuan. Due to the recent surge in black market exchange rates and reported price increases abroad, yarn factories and soap factories are scrambling to purchase. Raw material merchants do not have much inventory, and retail investors are not only unwilling to sell but are also trying their best to buy, resulting in a lack of transactions and chaotic bidding. The number of trading chips in the market is quite depleted.

### Improving Xuchang Tobacco Leaves - Nine Out of Ten Businesses Were Banned

The Xuchang tobacco leaf improvement project has achieved significant results after being jointly promoted by the Xuchang Tobacco Leaf Improvement Field of the Tobacco Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, led by Field Director Chen, and various local authorities. Eight or nine out of ten inferior leaves have been banned. Furthermore, 34 businesses, including Cheng Defeng and others, have been banned from selling miscellaneous tobacco, totaling 9,860 pounds. Fines of 11,190,000 yuan were imposed in accordance with regulations. The funds were directly deposited by the tobacco firms into the county bank in a special account. Two organizational regulations have been drafted, including the organizational regulations of the Miscellaneous Tobacco Prohibition Committee and the service rules for inspection personnel. In the future, it is planned to establish five to seven prohibition offices in major tobacco-producing counties such as Xuchang, Xiangcheng, Yuxian, Jiaxian, Changge, Linying, and Yexian, depending on the actual circumstances. They will be established as soon as the Kunshan Shou Cuo and personnel arrangements are completed.

### Fresh Meat Prices Skyrocket

Due to continuous rainy days, the supply of pigs has decreased, and production areas are frequently raising prices. The disassembled price of fresh meat in the city yesterday rose to 550,000 yuan per 100 jin, the highest new price this year. Separately, the retail price of leg and rib meat is 7,000 yuan, and the price of strip ribs is 6,000 yuan. Another report: The prices of green vegetables, bamboo shoots, and other items have doubled compared to half a month ago.

### Wing Tai Wo Adjusts Allocation Prices

Since the authorities banned gold and banknote trading, most of the local money exchange houses have switched to the cigarette industry. They hold large amounts of capital and drag and roll cigarettes toward the market and simply regard stocks and other commodity prices as an indicator, and disregard actual sales, which in turn promoted the cigarette prices to rise, rising without limit. Now it is understood that Wing Tai Wo Tobacco Company, in order to mitigate the rising prices of the marriage market, is planning to distribute a large number of products, but the allocation price will be slightly adjusted, with Great Britain at 400 boxes per box. Huang Zhuang Xiong, (increased by 800,000 yuan), Old Knife per box is 3.2 million yuan, (increased by 600,000 yuan) but is still cheaper than the market price.

### New Tea from Taiwan Enters the Market

Taipei, 3rd. This province's new tea has been on the market successively since before and after Qingming, and the tea houses in the provincial capital are showing vitality, but the transportation to other provinces is still rare. The price of new tea leaves is slightly softer than last year, at about 10,000 yuan per 100 catties. In addition, old tea inventories are gradually decreasing, showing a state of having market but no sales.

### Printing Prices Increase - 33% Added to the Old Price

The local printing industry association officially decided to adjust printing prices from the 3rd, with all calculations based on a 33% increase over the old prices. The typesetting cost for book editions was previously 18,000 yuan per thousand characters, but is now 23,940 yuan. The printing cost for book editions was previously 38,000 yuan per thousand copies, but is now 50,540 yuan. For each additional thousand copies, the previous cost was 32,000 yuan, but is now 42,560 yuan.

### Visiting the Guangdong Xicun Cement Factory - The Only Cement Supplier in South China

— Our Special Correspondent, Liang Feng

Guangzhou, 18th (Air Dispatch)

Recently, with the introduction of a friend, I visited the Guangdong Xicun Cement Factory (Saichuen Cement Works), which is the only factory in South China that manufactures cement products. Because this also belongs to heavy industry, the machinery for manufacturing cement must be transported and assembled from abroad, so there are not many cement factories in our country at all. I remember that during the war in the Great Rear Area, there was only one Sichuan Cement Factory in Chongqing, and the scale was not large, with a daily output of only 900 barrels. After the restoration, although large-scale cement factories in North and Central China have gradually resumed work, in South China, there is still only one factory to this day, which is the Guangdong Xicun Cement Factory. The cement needed by several provinces, including Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi, all relies on its supply. Xicun is a place in the western suburbs of Guangzhou. The trees there are shady and the scenery is quite beautiful. Before the war, the Guangdong Construction Department designated that area as the first industrial zone in Guangdong, and there was a provincial industrial vocational school there. However, after several years of occupation, many of our constructions were destroyed beyond recognition by the enemy and puppet forces. Although the archway with the words "Guangdong First Industrial Zone" still stands majestically, the inside is desolate. The only decorations in this industrial zone are a beverage factory, an industrial test institute of the Construction Department, and the cement factory, among which the cement factory is the only one with a larger scale!

Historical Vicissitudes

This cement factory has always been a provincially run factory. It began preparations in August of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, and the engineer responsible for the opening and construction was Deng Hongyi. All the machinery was ordered from the Danish F.L.midth factory. It took a total of 30 months to complete the installation of the machinery and the construction of the factory, and it was officially established in March of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China. The more important machinery in the factory includes a stone crusher, a mud washing pond, a raw material mill, a clinker mill, and several parts such as a clinker kiln. They are all huge machines. The clinker kiln is magnificent. It is a large iron pipe with a diameter of more than ten feet and a length of more than 230 feet. There are three of these kilns in total. Under the operation of these machines, 3,600 barrels of cement (340 catties per barrel) can be produced every day. However, precisely because these machines were too large and bulky, they could not be dismantled and evacuated during the fall of Guangzhou, and it was too late to destroy them. As a result, they were used by the Japanese Asano Corporation to continue producing cement and supply it to the Japanese army in the occupied areas of various provinces in South China to build fortifications. This is truly an incalculable loss for us!

Restoration Process

After the restoration, the factory was taken over by the Construction Department, and Mr. Sun Man, the original director of the factory before the war, was appointed as the general manager to be responsible for the preparation of the restoration work. However, when the Japanese army surrendered, the factory was severely damaged. All the slurry ponds, stone crushers, a 2,000 kW generator, and a 4,000 kW generator were blown up. Two of the original three clinker kilns were dismantled. It has now been found that one was moved to Hainan Island, and the other was moved to Northeast China. Therefore, after more than half a year, the damaged and missing parts were slowly repaired and supplemented, and it finally resumed operation in mid-June of last year! There are now more than 400 technicians and staff in the factory, in addition to 200-300 workers who mine stone and transport it from their mines. However, because there is only one kiln now, and it is also subject to restrictions on the supply of coal and electricity, the current output is only one-third of what it was before the war, which is 1,200 barrels of cement per day.

A Glimpse Inside

After we visited the various manufacturing departments of the factory, we learned that the manufacture of cement is not very difficult and the procedures are not complicated. The most difficult thing is probably the equipment of those magnificent machines! The main raw materials for making cement are the stones (gypsum stone), mud (mountain mud and sea mud), gypsum, and water that we see every day. The manufacturing process is roughly as follows: first, crush the crushed stone in a stone crusher, and on the other hand, wash the mud in a mud washing pond to make it pure mud. Then mix the crushed stone, slurry, and water and put them into a raw material mill to grind them, which becomes stone slurry. Then put the stone slurry into the long kiln and use high heat to burn it, which becomes clinker. Add a certain amount of gypsum to this clinker, then put it into a clinker mill to grind it finely, and then weigh it, add a package, and that's the finished product!

Comparable to British Cement

In the past, most of the cement we used was supplied by imports, and "British Cement" was even more famous. However, according to Manager Sun of the factory, because they are willing to study carefully and make it meticulously, the Five Rams brand cement produced by the factory is not only the finest and most exquisite cement in the country, but is also superior in its exquisite manufacturing compared with imported products. At the same time, their pricing is also the most reasonable. According to their current wholesale price, it is 18,000 yuan per small package (85 catties), and it is handled by 21 distributors, who are required to have a profit of no more than 20%. The market price of imported products is at least 8 Hong Kong dollars per small package, which is not as cheap as ours. So their products are not only beautiful but also the cheapest!

In the current stage of construction first, cement is really the most important material for all water conservancy projects, bridges, and even the construction of houses. Therefore, it can also be regarded as a national defense industry. After we visited the Xicun Cement Factory, we felt that their contribution to the country and society is really significant. In particular, their spirit of careful research and hard work to increase production is even more admirable.

### Report on the Moscow Conference: Full Text of Mr. Marshall's Speech (Continued)

The Question of the German-Polish Border Forms a Major Dispute

Border Issues—The German border issue is a major point of contention, and it is another example of attendees quickly disagreeing over the Three-Power Declaration regarding German borders. People fleeing west of the Oder River were already present, and there were already traces of Soviet presence. At that time, Truman acknowledged this situation. Generally speaking, acknowledging the situation, the Three-Power Declaration stated: "The Three Powers hereby express their opinion: The final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement."

Now, Molotov states that the Potsdam Conference had already reached a final agreement on the German-Polish border issue, and that the above paragraph only refers to awaiting the peace settlement to finalize the border. Therefore, he believes that the only matters that should be considered now are the technical issues of demarcating the border.

The U.S. government recognizes its obligations under the Yalta Agreement to compensate Poland fairly in the west for its incorporation of territories east of the Curzon Line into the Soviet Union. If this temporary arrangement between Germany and Poland were to become permanent, Germany would lose a portion of its territory that, before the war, provided over one-fifth of the food supply for the German people. Obviously, Germany, within very limited boundaries, must not only support as many people as before the war but also provide for a large number of Germans from Eastern Europe.

This situation is unavoidable, but we must not allow it to become more serious. We do not want Poland to reduce its pre-war resources. Poland should have more resources, but giving Poland these borders will not benefit Poland. Because these borders may cause various problems in the future, borders, no matter where they are drawn, should not be barriers to trade and commerce. The happiness of Europe depends entirely on this trade and commerce. We must look forward to a future where a democratic Poland and a democratic Germany become good neighbors.

Opinions Differ Greatly on Drafting Peace Treaty with Germany

Peace Treaty Procedures—Opinions vary greatly on how the Allied countries that fought against Germany should participate in the drafting and ratification of the peace treaty with Germany. There are fifty-one countries related to this matter. Among them, in addition to the four major Allied powers, there are adult countries directly engaged in combat. Of course, the scope of combat varies in size and degree.

The U.S. government's position is that all Allied countries that fought against Germany should have the opportunity to participate in the drafting and conclusion of the peace treaty. However, we acknowledge that it would be difficult, though not impossible, for all fifty-one countries to participate in drafting a treaty. Therefore, the U.S. government is trying to encourage all parties to agree on a method that includes two different procedures, depending on whether the country in question actually participated in the fighting. However, all countries will have the opportunity to express their opinions and refute others' opinions, and all countries will attend a peace conference to pass a treaty.

Countries that have suffered from German occupation and terror and have suffered significant losses in arduous combat are reluctant to accept countries that have not suffered losses in manpower and material resources and are far from the war to participate in deciding the terms of the peace treaty. But the United States believes that all countries that fought against Germany should have a voice in resolving the German issue.

The Soviet Union Delays on the Four-Power Pact

Four-Power Pact—The proposal for a Four-Power Pact was put forward by the U.S. government a year ago. We hoped that this simple pact would be quickly accepted by all parties, guaranteeing that the United States intended to cooperate closely with other countries to prevent German rearmament before concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the German issue. The conclusion of this pact will eliminate fears of the future and facilitate a peace that meets the current and future needs of Europe, making it easier to succeed. At the same time, we also hoped that the U.S. signing this pact would alleviate the fear among European powers that the United States would repeat the steps taken after World War I. At that time, the United States first insisted on some clauses of the peace treaty and then suddenly withdrew, pushing the responsibility for implementing the treaty away completely. We believe that the Four Powers concluding a pact guaranteeing the continued disarmament of Germany would once again show the world that we have the full sincerity to seek peace and security in Europe.

However, the Soviet government proposed a series of amendments to our proposal. These amendments would be sufficient to change the nature of the entire pact, making it a complex treaty in practice. Moreover, the Soviet side included in the amendments many key points on German issues that are fundamentally difficult to agree upon. Therefore, I have to draw a conclusion: either the Soviet government is unwilling to realize this pact, or it is trying to delay it so that it will not be adopted for the time being. Whether a final agreement on this issue can be reached remains to be seen. But I believe that the United States will definitely adhere to its current position, insist on simplifying the pact, and limit it to a fundamental purpose—that is, to prevent Germany from launching another war.

Opinions Differ Greatly on Key Points of the Austrian Treaty

The Austrian Treaty Issue—Negotiations on the Austrian Treaty resulted in agreement on most issues, but several points remain unresolved, all of which are extremely important. The Soviet Union expressed its approval for paying reparations and ceding Carinthia to Yugoslavia, but the other participating countries expressed their opposition.

The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the issue of German assets in Austria. According to the Potsdam Agreement, German assets in Austria should belong to the Soviet Union. The Soviet side believes that all German assets in Austria (the other three powers believe these are assets of Austrians and Allied expatriates forcibly seized after the German army entered Austria in March 1938) should be regarded as German assets in Austria. The Soviet side refused to consider the term "forcibly seized," while the other three powers believed that the term "forcibly seized" was an important criterion for determining what exactly constituted German assets.

The Soviet Union also refused to consider any compromise solutions to resolve this dispute. All efforts to seek a compromise solution were unsuccessful. In my opinion, the United States cannot recognize this clearly unfair treaty, and this treaty will create a weak and helpless Austria, which will be a source of major danger in the future. At the last meeting of the conference, everyone agreed to appoint a committee to meet in Vienna on May 12 to reconsider our objections and to establish an expert panel to investigate German assets in Austria. If we want to fulfill our obligations, recognize Austria as a free and independent state, and lift the occupation zone's food rations, then we should of course take prompt action on the Austrian Treaty.

Summary—Although these issues are very complex, there is still a pattern to be found regarding the characteristics and control of Central Europe. The foreign ministers agreed that their task was to lay the foundation for a German central government, promote German economic unification, establish feasible borders, and establish guaranteed control through a Four-Power Pact. Austria should quickly resolve the occupation zone's food rations and be treated as a liberated and independent country.

No Agreement Could Be Reached at the Moscow Conference

It was impossible for the Moscow Conference to reach a consensus because, in our view, the Soviet Union was insisting on various proposals that would establish a central government in Germany in order to seize absolute control over this economically collapsing country. This government is destined to collapse economically because it has a small area, a large population, and will use most of its production to pay for reparations, mainly to the Soviet Union. The Soviet delegation demanded the same compensation from Austria, but in a different way.

According to the U.S. delegation, such a plan not only involves indefinite subsidies from the United States but also will only lead to the worsening of German and European economic life, which will inevitably lead to dictatorship and strife.

The freedom of reporting represented by our government must include all appeals to public opinion. But in Moscow, appealing to emotions and prejudices through propaganda seemed to replace appealing to reason and understanding. The Soviet delegation's criticisms and interpretations of the Potsdam Agreement and other agreements were completely different from the facts as understood by the U.S. delegation.

The true intentions and motives of various proposals or objections to such proposals cannot, of course, be determined. This is inevitable in any international negotiation.

But regardless of how divergent the above opinions are, and how difficult the problems are, the progress we have made toward the final solution of the problems may be greater than expected.

This is the first time that the differences between the parties have been fully revealed. From now on, the problems can be seen clearly, and future discussions will know how to start resolving the outstanding issues. The foreign ministers of each country have clearly understood the accurate views of their respective governments on different issues. Then, they may be able to resolve some differences, or submit a report on the results of the agreement and non-agreement, so that the outstanding issues can be further clarified. This is the greatest hope for the next few months. No matter how difficult and slow progress is, there will inevitably be some progress in the end. These things are of great importance to the lives of all European people and to the future of world history. We should not compromise on major principles in order to reach an agreement. Similarly, we must sincerely seek to understand different opinions.

At this point, I am reminded of a statement Marshal Stalin made to me. When he spoke about this meeting, he believed that these were just preliminary probes and contacts with the problem. In the past, we had many problems and many different opinions, but it seemed to have become a rule that people understood the need for coordination after being tired of debating. We may not have had much success at this meeting, but he believed that it was still possible to reach agreements on all major issues. These issues include the disarmament of Germany, the problem of Germany's political organization, the problem of reparations, and the problem of economic unification. We must be patient and not be pessimistic.

The Situation in Europe is Serious, the Soviet Union Should Not Delay

I sincerely hope that the views expressed by Stalin are correct, and I hope that his opinions show that in future meetings, the Soviet delegation will have greater cooperation. However, we cannot ignore the time factor involved here. The recovery of Europe has been slower than I expected. The forces of division are becoming more obvious. The doctors are pondering deeply, but the patient is dying. Therefore, I believe that we should not delay again and again until the moment of no return before taking action. New problems arise every day. We should take steady and possible actions to deal with these urgent problems without hesitation.

Finally, I would like to express my opinion on a certain aspect of something that has a major relationship with all of us. Just like the experience of Burns, I could not invite the two leading members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to attend the meeting with me, but I did get the extremely valuable assistance of Mr. Dulles, a Republican member of the House of Representatives and an expert on foreign affairs. In fact, during this conference, Senators Vandenberg and Connally clearly expressed the bipartisan nature of U.S. foreign affairs measures in the midst of leading the Senate in planning new developments in foreign policy. This sign of consensus was of great help to me far away in Moscow. I believe that today's world situation and the situation of the United States have made it the responsibility of the American people to take unified action. That is why I have reported in detail my views on the Foreign Ministers Conference. (End)

Spring and Autumn

— Dedicated to the Shanghai Literary and Art Workers Association - A New "May Fourth Movement"

— Xu Zhongdong

Fight for the dignity of mankind!

Fight for the reverence of wisdom!

Fight for the freedom of thought!

In the modern Chinese intellectual history, the "May Fourth Movement" is a page that should be specially highlighted. This movement was initially a patriotic movement, and later evolved from a patriotic movement into an intellectual liberation movement. The so-called liberation is to liberate from feudal ideas, overthrow old ethics, and absorb new ideas from abroad. In literature, the greatest achievement was the replacement of classical Chinese with vernacular Chinese, which ascended to the throne.

Analyzing the historical facts of the "May Fourth Movement," it first started with specific events and people; even if it later shifted from reality to thought, it was a "smooth evolution" rather than a new beginning. Then, we might as well say: it was passive. Secondly, the movement made great contributions to overthrowing the old ethics; unfortunately, this contribution only contained destructiveness and no constructiveness, so it was negative. Thirdly, it absorbed "new" ideas from abroad—which may have already been outdated in those countries—eating everything without discrimination. The result? Contradiction, superficiality, degeneration, indigestion! On this point, it failed completely.

Since then, every national humiliation has aroused a wave of patriotic sentiment. However, there are very few cases where patriotic sentiment has been expanded and deepened into a certain kind of thought. The most important one was after "August 13th"; the peak of that period coincided with the gathering of Chinese cultural figures in Wuhan; at that time, the nation was paramount, the prejudices of the individual were discarded, and efforts were made to build a new China in spirit. The momentum was so great and the waves so surging that it almost surpassed the "May Fourth Movement." Because the "May Fourth Movement" only contained destructiveness, while this one contained constructiveness; the "May Fourth Movement" was negative, while this one was positive.

Unfortunately, all climaxes are difficult to sustain, and this movement that almost surpassed the May Fourth Movement only went "almost," and did not become a reality! Since the "tragic victory," the Chinese cultural world has been on the verge of bankruptcy. This is not alarmist talk, but 100% true. We can find any professor, any writer, any scholar, any publisher, any journalist, any college student, any cultural person of any kind, and talk to him or them about the situation in the contemporary Chinese cultural world. Unless the other party is blind, deaf, an idiot, or mentally ill, he or they will never be optimistic!

Perhaps some people attribute the creation of this situation to the "tragic victory." This is not entirely wrong, but not entirely correct either. Another group of people believes that this is related to the "internal strife"; internal strife leads to unease, and unease leads to economic recession, which naturally includes the decline of culture. This view is also partially correct, but not entirely correct. Why? If we talk about "tragic victory," it is not just China alone; France "won" even more "tragically" than us. However, at the recent Moscow Conference, the Soviet Union was the host, and the United States and Britain were the main pillars, so their participation was natural; in addition, France, which had surrendered, participated, while China, which fought to the end, was excluded: why is this? Is it because China and France both had a tragic victory, and France has already embarked on the road to recovery, while our China is progressing too slowly and is still far from this goal, so we are looked down upon? Taking a step back—or rather, taking a step forward—the countries that "tragically failed," such as Germany and Japan, especially Japan, are of course living harder lives than us, but judging from their past cultural standards and the perseverance of their national character, their recovery does not seem to be too slow or too uncertain. Why is this again? If we talk about "internal strife," it seems that in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there was war every day, and the chaos was even worse than today, but how can the scholarship of that time compare with the scholarship of today? Why is this even more so?

Materialists say: all of this is because of material relations. If material civilization is not prosperous, it will inevitably lead to such a tragic result. When I heard the words "material civilization," I couldn't help but smile: because although matter can create a certain kind of civilization, the use of matter still depends on the brain. The difference between "spiritual civilization" and "material civilization" lies in: "spiritual civilization" takes people as the master and things as the slave; "material civilization" also takes people as the master when it first rises, but it takes people as the slave when it reaches its peak! Especially in culturally backward countries—"culture" includes both spirit and matter—when they encounter culturally advanced countries, they will inevitably become slaves. Contemporary China is the "second master" of the great powers, that is, a high-class slave; at most, it is just a parasite; as for equality, it is far away, beyond the ten thousand li! This is the reality, and we should no longer be blinded by the name of "Five Great Powers," deliberately not seeing, or daring not to see this fact!

The "Atlantic Charter" explains the new human rights and also explains the new dignity of mankind, which is in line with the dignity of the times. However, this charter reflects that the current world does not recognize these human rights and this dignity; otherwise, if it had already become a reality, why would we need this charter? In China, for a long time—long before the "May Fourth Movement"—all policies and all social activities have made the mistake of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts"; they focus on "events" based on "individuals," rather than focusing on "individuals" based on "events"; this practice of reversing the master and slave, and turning slaves into masters, completely abandons the human rights that should be enjoyed, and completely forgets the dignity of mankind! Wood must be eaten by insects before worms are born, and people must insult themselves before others insult them: if you despise yourself, why should others respect you?

In terms of vision, humans are inferior to cats; in terms of smell, humans are inferior to dogs; in terms of running, humans are inferior to horses; in terms of physical strength, humans are inferior to cattle. However, humans are the most intelligent of all things, and cats, dogs, horses, and cattle are used by them: why is this? Because humans have a high degree of intelligence and develop in many ways; while the intelligence of animals is either far inferior to humans, or develops only in one way, or only has imitative ability and no creativity. Man is only the most fragile reed in the universe: a breeze can blow it down, and a drop of rain can make it bow its head. A small sparrow, standing on a willow branch, sways with the wind and has nothing to do with it; however, if it takes a fancy to this reed, this reed cannot bear its weight, and if it is lucky enough not to break in the middle, it will inevitably prostrate on the ground! However... this is a reed with wisdom and the ability to think: it knows its own fragility, but it can think of various ways to first protect itself, and then try to overcome the universe that is many billions of times larger than itself: this is the fate of mankind, this is the ambition of mankind, and this is also the greatness of mankind! Therefore, the dignity of mankind lies in wisdom.

Of course, this small reed is very stubborn. It uses a spirit of dauntlessness to deal with and wrestle with wind, fire, water, earth, sun, moon, stars, and beasts. Its life is a constant struggle, and its happiness is the smile of victory. However, there is a considerable process from a seed becoming a reed; in this process, it needs sweet rain and gentle breezes—just as human thought needs freedom! It is said that there are scammers in the world who specialize in scamming children. After scamming them, they raise the children in jars. When they grow up, they turn into all kinds of monsters: the thoughts that are cultivated in an atmosphere of unfreedom are all strange thoughts. This reed, even if it grows up, is a morbid reed, an unhealthy reed.

If the "May Fourth Movement" was a liberation movement, liberating the Chinese people who were bound by the old ethics and restoring their freedom, especially restoring their freedom of thought, then we have to lament that the ripple of the movement was not broad and dried up halfway! Let's not talk about the distant past—because we don't have huge space or enough time to describe and criticize them one by one—let's talk about what's close at hand, that is, the short time since the "tragic victory." Is there freedom of thought? Of course, the nation is paramount, and all thoughts that endanger the nation should be eliminated: this is true in all countries in the world, not only in China. However, even within the scope of national policy, has there been cultivation of free thought, has there been allowing freedom of thought to develop, as permitted by the constitution and ordinary laws? I will lie awake at night seeking it, but I cannot find it, and can only toss and turn!

I sincerely believe that the government does not intend to suppress thought: first, all the officials in power are intellectuals, and even if they have risen to prominence and have high positions and generous salaries, they still retain some scholarly temperament; second, they have accumulated many years of experience and know that thought cannot be "suppressed," for if it is "suppressed," it will "change," and if it "changes," it will be "more harmful"! However, there is one thing they have to admit: in recent years, they have not paid attention to wisdom, and have not paid attention to scholarship! It is not that they have not taken measures similar to paying attention to scholarship and paying attention to wisdom, and even some of them are somewhat satisfactory. However, generally speaking, there are probably very few who seek impartiality and selflessness, and who truly deeply understand the reverence of wisdom and the preciousness of scholarship! In fact, there are not a few morning stars, it is just that the sunlight is a little strong, blinding the eyes—and the sunlight in this place at this time is golden!

Because of this one-thousandth of an inch difference, the entire Republic of China has become chaotic and backward. "When superiors and inferiors contend for profit, the country is in danger": is there a contention for profit between superiors and inferiors now? Let's not talk about it for now. Just this "comprador spirit" flooding like a flood is more than enough to destroy the country! What is the "comprador spirit"? The people of Shanghai all understand this; I'll add a few words for readers who are not from Shanghai: when they see foreigners, they forget their parents and grandparents, bowing deeply; when they see Chinese people, they look arrogant and haughty; when they see money, their hearts blossom and they are overjoyed. "The purpose of life is to make money," only the devil's son studies! Thus, thus, thus, that is the "comprador spirit." Today's old men, middle-aged men, young men, gentlemen, ladies, young ladies, and young masters are all "using their brains" and trying to make a fortune. Of course, life is pressing, but most of the time, it is "people" who are pressing "life," constantly improving life.

Let's take a look at what other countries are like? First, let's talk about the United States and the Soviet Union. They are at opposite poles in terms of thought and policy, but they both respect wisdom. How was the atomic bomb invented in the United States? Because the United States was willing to spend money and invest capital, gather scholars from various countries, provide them with security of life, and provide them with the convenience of research: thus, the atomic bomb was invented in the United States first, not in other countries. Before World War II, the United States had a very developed applied science (because it had money), but theoretical science was not as good as Germany and France. Now, it has not only caught up, but also implicitly occupies a leading position! As for the Soviet Union, there was an initial mistake: the sanctity of labor suppressed brain work, and academic standards fell sharply, almost inferior to the imperial era. They discovered this mistake and immediately cleverly broadened the scope of "labor" to include both "hands" and "brains," so it encompassed everything. Today, in the Soviet Union, a brain worker is at least free from the danger of freezing and starvation.

France, a "victorious" country, is trying every means and using all its strength to promote scholarship and fight for the dignity of mankind. It is reported that France has discovered all the secrets of the atomic bomb: according to common sense, this news is unlikely to be false. Japan, a "tragically defeated" country, is bound to conduct academic research under the protection of the Americans, and some news has already been leaked and published in newspapers. Germany, a "tragically defeated" country, is in a more difficult situation than Japan—Japan is protected by one strong power, while Germany faces the danger of being divided by several strong powers—but to say that Germans do not conduct academic research is as unreliable as saying that Chinese people do not play mahjong!

While others are burying their heads in research, we are promoting the "comprador spirit." Perhaps atomic bombs can be resisted with mahjong, and radar rockets can be neutralized with customs gold. Human strength is inferior to cattle, human running is inferior to horses, and human smelling and seeing are not as good as dogs and cats: if humans lose their wisdom, if humans despise wisdom, then they are inferior to cattle, horses, dogs, and cats! Today is May 4th, and it is also the opening of the founding congress of the Shanghai Writers Association. With passion, I utter the following call; I think that all those who do not want to be half-men, do not want to be horses, do not want to be dogs, do not want to be cats, but want to be "human beings," will definitely express their sympathy to me and shout with me:

— We want:

To fight for the dignity of mankind!

To fight for the reverence of wisdom!

To fight for the freedom of thought!

### Li Zonghuang's Speech: Grassroots Organizations

— Chen Qilong

Jiangning, 20th Dispatch

Today is the graduation ceremony for the fifth session of your county's cadre training center. I am very happy and excited to have this opportunity to participate! I have devoted my life's energy to working at the grassroots level because my parents were farmers, and I came from the fields. Remembering the source of the water I drink, I have always liked to be close to my farmer compatriots and comrades. So, of course, I had to come today.

Interpretation of Grassroots Organizations

What are grassroots organizations? In a broad sense, all levels of the county can be said to be grassroots organizations, and the so-called grassroots are relative to the province and the central government above the county. In a narrow sense, it refers only to rural townships, villages, and neighborhoods. The county level is the main body of local self-government, so all personnel engaged in county administration are also personnel engaged in local self-government. When it comes to the nature and meaning of grassroots organizations, of course, all political measures cannot be separated from the scope of "control, education, nurturing, and sanitation." Since the county is also the main body of local self-government, it naturally has the nature of a local self-governing body within its jurisdiction. According to the teachings of the Father of the Nation: "Local self-governing bodies are not only political organizations but also economic organizations." From this, we can see that this grassroots organization places special emphasis on people's livelihood issues, using political organizations as a means to achieve economic organizations as the goal. Economic organization is the center of gravity in grassroots organizations. The law on the implementation of local self-government has very detailed provisions, which I believe you all already have a full understanding of. The various agricultural, industrial, trade, banking, insurance, and other cooperatives to be established in the new county system all take rural townships as the center to implement production. If we do a good job in these political and economic organizations, we can fully achieve the negative aspects of childcare, elderly care, poverty relief, disaster relief, and medical care for the public, and on the positive side, we can improve people's lives, obtain full welfare, promote social and cultural progress, and consolidate the foundation of the country and the nation. From the above, we can see the importance of grassroots organizations. Next, let us further examine the following questions.

Looking at Chinese History

Looking at China's inherent history, our country certainly has a long and enduring life, but starting from the earliest written records, it has about four or five thousand years of history. Turning the pages of our Chinese history, we find that it is entirely filled with the rise and fall of governance and chaos, but there is always less governance and more chaos. Have you all read the Romance of the Three Kingdoms? You may remember that it begins by saying: "The general trend of the world is that after a long period of division, there must be unity, and after a long period of unity, there must be division." What is the reason for the division and unity of governance and chaos in our country's history? Why is it that the period of chaos is often very long, while the period of governance is often very short? In the four or five thousand years of Chinese history, how many years have there been of true peace and people truly living in peace and contentment? I am afraid it is too short. This is because we have never been able to preserve and improve the good grassroots organizations that China has always had. People are always in a state of panic and fear, with their lives and property unprotected, trapped in deep water and fiery pain from which they cannot extricate themselves. The "well system" of the Yellow Emperor era, the "well-field" and "rural settlement" systems of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties were all excellent grassroots organizations. In the Spring and Autumn period, there was the great statesman Guan Zhong, who, with his "track and neighborhood" method, enabled Duke Huan of Qi to unite the princes nine times and achieve the great feat of unifying the world. The extraordinary strength of the Qin state was due to Shang Yang's "mutual responsibility system of ten and five families," which was also the most fundamental and well-meaning grassroots organization. The Han and Tang dynasties were the golden age of our country, and their ability to promote national prestige was due to the Han's "rural pavilion" system and the Tang's "neighborhood" system, which were the best grassroots organizations. Therefore, they were able to expand their territories (foreigners call us Qin people, Han people, Tang people), maintain internal stability and external defense, and demonstrate great achievements. Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty created laws such as the Baojia and Baoma systems, which were very good systems for sound grassroots organizations at the time. However, due to various obstacles from conservative forces, they could not be implemented, and soon there was the Jingkang Incident, and then the Song Dynasty had to perish. Wang Yangming's "ten-family card system" in the Ming Dynasty was also not widely used or preserved. The roving bandits arose and swept through the country, and the Ming Dynasty still fell. From the perspective of our country's history, the failure to establish grassroots organizations is why we have perished twice. What a painful lesson! This enables us to deeply recognize the importance of the tomb-level organization.

In the history of our country, when turmoil occurred, it was always because the peasants of the time were excessively oppressed by tyrannical rulers, corrupt officials, and local bullies, forcing them to use popular uprisings and riots to overthrow the government and transform the country. If the people can live in peace and contentment, the country will be at peace. If they cannot get what they need and cannot make a living, riots will naturally occur. I come from the fields, and in my childhood, I personally saw my elders, brothers, sisters, suffering all kinds of oppression and pain in my hometown. The peasants' contribution to the country, especially in this resolute war of resistance, spending money and effort, shedding blood and sweat, only they have contributed the most and the greatest. For twenty-eight years, I have liked to be close to farmers and have worked hard in grassroots work, taking local self-government as my lifelong ideal career, willing to work for the people, willing to seek their freedom and liberation for the farmers. Based on this ideal, I am willing to work for this lofty ideal, as long as I have a breath, this ambition will not be slackened and I will continue to do it forever. If this work cannot be completed in my lifetime, my sons and grandsons will continue to do it.

Looking at the Teachings of the Father of the Nation

Looking at the teachings of the Father of the Nation, the two greatest figures in our country's history that I admire the most are Qin Shi Huang, who used a very grand spirit to fully unify the divided country, because the times were different, so the methods he adopted were purely autocratic, and the Father of the Nation, who recognized the mission of the times, followed the trend of the world, and used democratic methods to establish our country, he once said: "Local autonomy is the foundation of the Republic of China. The civil rights of the people in the three thousand counties of the country are like three thousand stone foundations. If the foundations are solid, the country is strong, and if the country is strong, our children and grandchildren will enjoy the same benefits." The politics of our country are different from those of other countries. The politics of our country are like building a house, always putting the beams and pillars first, without paying attention to building the foundation. Once a big storm comes, it will collapse. And most of the people in our country who are engaged in politics only want to be high officials and are unwilling to be small officials. Everyone only wants to concentrate in the cities, in the provinces, and in the central government, and they never want to pay attention to the grassroots work in the localities. Our country is not strong, and there is more chaos than governance, and more division than unity. This is like building a country in the way we build houses, and most people only want to be governors and presidents, and are unwilling to be township chiefs and village chiefs. This is really wrong.

But there is one kind of architecture in our country that is the best, and that is the pagoda. The president is like the top of a pagoda. I recently went to Hangzhou and made a special trip to climb the Liuhe Pagoda, which is thirteen stories high. It is said that it was built more than eight hundred years ago. Standing on the top of the pagoda, looking down at the sails and waves on the Qiantang River, I felt very happy. I had a feeling at the time that the builder of this pagoda could really be our guide in local self-government. (It is said to be a person from the Song Dynasty, but I forgot his name.) So, in the future, we should build our country like building a pagoda. Today, all of you here are very good engineers.

Looking at Modern History

Looking at modern history, the emerging United States on the other side of the Pacific has only been building its country for more than one hundred and sixty years, and England has only been around for more than one thousand years. How can they maintain their position in the world? Even a small country like Belgium has only been around for more than seven hundred years. How can they make people not dare to underestimate them? It can be said that it is entirely due to their good grassroots organization and sound local self-government work. Before and after the invasion of our country, before their defeat, the local self-government work in Japan was also good, but because they only focused on political organization and ignored economic organization, they only achieved a strong country, not a rich country. The greatness of President Roosevelt of the United States is known to the world, but after his death, President Truman, or people may think that he is more ordinary than President Luo, but the grassroots organization in their country is good, and the president is only the top of the pagoda. Whoever comes to be the top of the pagoda, the inherent strength of the country will not change. England is still the same. Prime Minister Churchill led the country in resisting Germany during the war and was invincible. After the war, Attlee of the Labor Party came to power and formed a cabinet, and the efficiency of national administration was not affected by Churchill's departure. It is also due to the good local self-government and the perfect grassroots organization.

Let's look at our China again. It's really pitiful! Because we are being attacked by internal and external troubles, so even though the tutelage period has ended and constitutional government is about to begin, we still cannot complete the local self-government work of one county and one town. We really feel that this is a great shame and humiliation. If we want to search hard, only Shanxi and Guangxi in the past had a little achievement. In addition, I personally saw the autonomous work in Zhenping, Deng County, Neixiang, and Zhejiang counties (collectively known as Wanxi) in Henan, where I served, and it was done quite well. There are two outstanding figures, one named Peng Yuting and the other named Ge Bietingfang. They especially did a good job in the "art" of making all the people soldiers, able to defend themselves. During the War of Resistance, it was not easy for the enemy and puppets to invade, protecting our borders of Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei. This time, Li Xiannian's troops sneaked in from Hubei and could not cross the Lei Pond for a step when they reached the Wanxi border. The other aspects of management, education, and nurturing were also done quite well. This is a rare miracle, so the next issue of the local self-government special issue that I am organizing will specially publish a "Wanxi Autonomous Center Special Issue" to commend them, encourage them, and make people rise up everywhere. If our countries can all pay attention to grassroots organization, local self-government work, and elected county magistrates like them, why can't it be completed sooner?

Looking at the Words of the President

Looking at the words of the President: The President created the new county system, which stipulates in the outline of the organization at all levels of the county; "The county is an autonomous unit, and the county is a legal person." Since the county is already a unit of local self-government, and it has the qualifications of a "legal person," it naturally has the right to be independent and autonomous according to law. Township is a basic unit, so it also has the qualifications of a "legal person." We can get full proof from the enactment of the new county system. How important is grassroots organization. For a truly noble ideal, we should use the spirit of acting bravely for righteousness, not hesitating when duty calls, and never changing our minds to complete this lofty ideal and sacred work. Therefore, I think that to achieve this ideal and work, we cannot ignore the following two measures:

Talent Goes Down and Rises

When we talk about how to complete the work that needs to be done in the grassroots organization, we cannot help but feel deeply that the first thing that is lacking in the townships is money, and the second is people, the so-called lack of talent. The township is just an empty shell. As mentioned above, talented people and rich people only want to run to the cities, provinces, and central government. They only want to be high officials and are unwilling to be small officials. Talented people go to other places to seek development. May I ask who can be found to do the management, education, nurturing, and sanitation work in the grassroots organization? I think the state should specially formulate a system that requires anyone in the locality, after graduating from middle school or university, to return to their hometown to work for at least one year, just like students who graduate from the Central Military Academy have to go to the company as interns after graduation. In this way, they can deeply understand the suffering of the people, the importance of grassroots organization, so that they will not forget the fundamentals, and at the same time, they can make their work power and knowledge experience more and stronger. On the other hand, the talents who are scattered to the outside world in the locality, the majority of people who are concentrated in the cities, provinces, or the central government, (that is, at least one-third of the people can be cut from the county, provincial, and central governments) let them return to the county and township to work in the grassroots organization, so that they can truly achieve the talent injection, and all undertakings can be gradually started, but the government must still complete a legal system to realize it.

After the talent injection is achieved, it is still necessary to supplement it with the talent rise, because a good talent, after doing ten or twenty years of grassroots work, will inevitably have the idea of not being willing to be lonely and striving for progress. If pressure is applied, it will inevitably lead to nothing. In local self-government work, we cannot just fulfill our obligations. The state should give salaries and establish official ranks, from township village chiefs to section chiefs, county magistrates, county magistrates can be promoted to commissioners, and commissioners can be promoted to committee members, department heads, and promoted layer by layer, and then to the central government, and a pseudo system must be completed so that grassroots organization personnel have the opportunity to rise. Secondly, the state should also formulate a standard for rewards and punishments and competitions, and conduct competitions and assessments within a certain method and within a certain period, for townships, counties, provinces, and the central government. Among townships and townships, and among counties and counties, which townships and which counties can eliminate disadvantages and solve problems that have not been resolved for hundreds of years? If they can be demonstrated, we can reward them as a model township model county, or a model township chief, or a county magistrate with special achievements. This township chief can be called a township heroine and be respected by the whole county, or the whole province, or the whole country. Naturally, talents will emerge in large numbers, otherwise, how many unknown heroes will be buried in our grassroots organization? Isn't it a pity? There are heroes at all levels, and talents will naturally rise up. This is an indispensable measure in establishing grassroots politics. If the methods are correct, the education is proper, and the encouragement is proper, then people can make the best use of their talents, land can be used to its fullest extent, things can be used to their fullest extent, and goods can flow smoothly.

Prospects for Grassroots Organizations

Gu Tinglin said: "Too many high officials lead to the chaos of the country, and too few low officials lead to the governance of the country." It makes a lot of sense. If there are too many high officials, sometimes there will inevitably be disagreements, instigations, alliances, and betrayals. Instead, they will forget the public for the sake of private gain and leave things undone. If there are more low officials, whether it is management, education, nurturing, or sanitation, everyone can still work together with one heart and devote themselves to their posts. Just take the word "Wei" in a village unit as an example. If the national military village team is well organized, in case of an emergency, whether it is a drumbeat or a gong, they can immediately gather guns, knives, sticks, spears, and extinguish a few bandits, and unite the forces of each township. The county government's forces and the country's army do not need to be used, let them all be put into national defense. Please see if this effect is great or not?

Let's talk about production again. Every village unit can dig a pond, and use the water in the pond to irrigate the fields, plant lotus roots, and raise fish. There are 470 village units in Jiangning County. If each village unit raises 100 jin of fish and plants 100 jin of lotus roots, how much will there be in total? As for other rural side businesses, it is the same. Every village unit can have the strength to support a disabled and helpless person. With more than 800,000 village units in the country, we can rescue more than 800,000 people. So, if the village organization is well run, the national government can really be carefree at that time. Conversely, just take the word "Wei" as an example again. If the state uses one soldier for each "Wei" in each village unit, the country will need these more than 800,000 soldiers, and each person will cost at least 1.2 million yuan per year. Just take a look, how much money will the country spend each year? This is beyond imagination.

Finally, we can deeply know that if the grassroots organization is good, the country's construction work will have a way. There will be no internal strife within the country. Just like the murders and arson by bandits everywhere today, it will not happen. The people will be able to live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, when the grassroots organization is completed and local self-government is realized, our China can forever stop civil wars and have long-term peace and stability. Why did Japan invade us in the past? Because we were a pan of loose sand without organization. Otherwise, with our large population, a breath of air or a drop of saliva could destroy him. We were not only lacking in political organization, but also lacking in economic organization. If we want to transform the destiny of the country and the nation, it is on all of you present today. When local self-government is completed, we will have a paradise everywhere, a beautiful land, and our descendants will be able to share happiness and become the most outstanding nation in the world. "Tang used seventy miles, and King Wen used a hundred miles to rule the world." May you all strive for it!

### Summer is Approaching: Be Careful of Fake Medicine

Editor: Recently, it has been discovered on the market that Japanese fake medicines such as "Jintan" for summer use, "Jiuer" for scabies, and "Zhiyingzi" for coughs are being openly sold and flowing into the countryside. Purchasers are greedy for cheapness and do not investigate carefully, misleading patients and endangering their lives, which is extremely harmful. With the approach of summer, it is the active period for these fake medicines. Therefore, I hope that the health authorities will pay close attention to this and urge medicine buyers to be careful of fake goods and not be deceived. (Du Zhongrong)

### The Emergence of Literary Masterpieces

— Sun Fuxi

Commemorating the May Fourth Movement and Celebrating the Establishment of the "Shanghai Writers Association"

Today is the 28th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Comparing the present with the past, what progress has been made? It is really difficult to say clearly.

First, the fervent mood in literature, art, and academia at that time is far beyond what can be compared to now. How substantial was the content of publications such as "New Youth," "New Tide," "Weekly Review," and "Sunday Review" at that time, and how firm and clear was their attitude? Especially the readers at that time, whether young or old, were humble and enthusiastic in their studies, with no preconceived notions and no selfish interests, with academia as the highest principle. Not only were they sincere towards various magazines, but they also devoted themselves to the supplements of every newspaper. Compared with the present, rather than saying that the readers of today are not as enthusiastic and sincere as before, it is better to say that the publications of today do not have the attractiveness of the past.

Second, from the perspective of the times, politics at that time was the dark age of warlords. Although it was nominally a republic, the people had no say in domestic and foreign affairs. Now, the revolution has been successful, the War of Resistance has been won, and the call for democracy and constitutional government has reached its peak. However, the democratic spirit in literature, art, and politics is even less enthusiastic than it was twenty-eight years ago. This cannot but be blamed on our lack of effort as people who have a duty to the nation. I still remember that when we were students, we organized meetings, published periodicals, and invited famous experts to give lectures, all from the bottom of our hearts, without any intention of gaining power or fame. Everyone wore a blue cloth gown, and there was no disturbance from terms like dancing and movies, and even cigarettes and alcohol were not close to us. These words are of course difficult to avoid the criticism of being outdated and pedantic, but they can still be used as a reference for the national physique and national morality test.

Third, many people wonder: Why have no literary masterpieces been produced after the great era of the War of Resistance? Since the War of Resistance, knowledge has increased a lot, the meaning of life has been understood more, and there has been a great progress in the understanding of how to deal with oneself and how to deal with national affairs. But now it is in the process of brewing and organizing, and there is no doubt that literary masterpieces and artistic masterpieces will appear in the future. Western scholars believe that European and American societies are not rich enough, so they go to Africa to observe the lives of primitive people and study tropical diseases. China has all kinds of forms and nothing is impossible. It is really a good material for academia, so there is no need to be discouraged. I believe that China will surely produce the world's great scholars, not to mention literature and art. In the future, great masters unique to the world will also be produced in sociology, economics, and political science. Now they are being studied and sorted out, and they will surely amaze the world in the future.

But I hope that Chinese youth will not be discouraged, and I also hope that those who have the resources to lead young people will pay attention. This is the meaning of commemorating the Literary Arts Day and celebrating the establishment of the Shanghai Writers Association.

### Ode to the May Fourth Movement

— Lv Baihua

Who defined the May Fourth Movement?

Days of unbearable spring chill;

This symbolizes the literary and artistic path,

How many rugged islands and hot and cold seasons it has passed through.

We don't want hearts of brocade,

Nor do we want mouths of gold;

A powerful giant pen,

Forever held in the hands that mend the sky.

Look!

Breaking through the spring cold,

Stars shine out of the ashes,

Literature and art are blooming on barren land!

### A Group·Several Businesses

— Wang Jinshan

Some Opinions of the Preparatory Committee of the "Shanghai Writers Association" Regarding the Future Business of the Group

In the past, there have been many similar groups, and there have been precedents: holding an inaugural meeting, passing a few articles of association, and hanging a sign, and then disappearing without a trace, as if a great cause had been accomplished. The so-called scholars rebelling never succeed in three years; men of letters doing things are just carried away by their whims, and most things are started but never finished. Therefore, everyone hopes that the establishment of the Shanghai Writers Association will not be like this, cannot be like this, and dares to believe that it will not be like this.

In another article, I once talked about the organizational tasks of a literary group. In addition to the emotional connection between members and the cooperation in their careers, there is no need to shy away from striving for the freedom to write, protecting the rights and interests of writing, and then jointly establishing a new writing belief and creating a new style of modern Chinese literature and art.

During the preparation period, friends have expressed many valuable opinions. Everyone believes that the times have progressed, and the style should also change. Now, the group is more important than the individual, friendship is more important than political views, practice is more important than theory, and mutual assistance and cooperation are more important than personal development; mutual respect for freedom of thought and common respect for human wisdom and emotion; this cannot but be said to be the awakening of the Chinese intellectuals' thinking after the May Fourth Movement and after eight years of the War of Resistance. The reason why the preparatory work of the Shanghai Writers Association has been completed so quickly in the past month, and the reason why the recruitment of members has been so widespread and smooth, cannot but be said to be due to this common belief.

Therefore, the practice of organizational tasks in the future has become the main topic of today's inaugural meeting. The funding has not yet been sourced, and personnel cannot be determined, but everyone is convinced that spirit is more important than matter, and human resources are more important than material resources. As long as everyone has a common sense of purpose and a sense of responsibility as a member of their own group, even with money, things can be done, and without money, we must find a way to do it. In other words, as long as everyone still has the energy to contribute to our group, all sectors of society will definitely give us business connections and assistance. For the future of the Shanghai Writers Association and for the future of literary and artistic undertakings, it must be so, it should be so, and it must be so.

Here, we can try to list a few things to illustrate the business that a literary group can undertake.

For example, the introduction and evaluation of works is originally a kind of literary service or communication business, but the society has not yet progressed to the point of producing such an institution, but the actual needs already exist, and our group may as well take the responsibility without hesitation.

Specifically, the group can contact publishing institutions to compile literary series on behalf of them, or accept commissions from film and theater institutions to write film and theater scripts, cooperate with music groups to write lyrics, and cooperate with art groups to write works that emphasize both pictures and text.

If the government or other social groups hold literary awards, the group can accept commissions to handle the procedures for soliciting and recommending candidates.

It can also systematically select and translate excellent literary works and introduce them to foreign publishing circles; at the same time, it can also translate excellent foreign works to supply the needs of domestic publishing institutions.

In addition, improving the welfare of writers is also something that the group cannot ignore. The settlement of royalties and the registration of copyrights are cumbersome procedures, and most writers, being scholars by nature, do not bother to do this. The group can specially hire lawyers and accountants to serve as legal advisors for members on a regular basis. Similarly, we can specially hire doctors and hospitals to serve as medical advisors for members.

Then, specially contracted bookstores and publishers often give writers preferential treatment when buying books; specially contracted libraries try their best to facilitate writers' borrowing of reference books and periodicals, which is a matter of course, should be done, and can be done.

If there is sufficient funding or someone invests, the group can run its own publishing institution to publish members' works, as well as build clubhouses, hostels, and even literary and artistic new villages.

Furthermore, in the connection of friendship, it is best not to forget to learn from each other and practice "meeting friends with literature and assisting benevolence with friends." Various tea parties, evening parties, appreciation meetings, commemorative meetings, as well as group tours and visits, and joint research and criticism, which are often held by general literary groups, are all activities that cost little and gain a lot in the group.

What's more, if we want to build a solid literary foundation for the next generation, guiding young people to write should also be a task that the Shanghai Writers Association cannot ignore. Evaluating and revising young people's works, inviting famous writers to talk about writing experience, holding short-term writing workshops, and recommending young people's works for publication or publication. Although the previous generation did not give us much help, we cannot therefore ignore it. "The younger generation is to be feared; how do you know that those who come later will not be equal to us?" This is what Confucius said long ago.

Unity is strength, and mutual assistance and cooperation are the way. In the past, literary people looked down on each other, which caused the division of the literary and artistic circles in the past and the desolation of the literary and artistic garden today. Wartime literary and artistic construction should undoubtedly be given equal importance to material construction; moreover, in terms of the form of literary and artistic works, it is just like the form of life of our generation. The old has been destroyed, and the new still needs to be worked hard. In this era, in order to pursue the harmony of ideals, we have to seek the harmony of reality; in order to establish a common belief, we have to give up the prejudices of various purposes; in order to create a new style of Chinese literature and art, we have to start with the establishment of a new organization. Although Shanghai writers dare not say that they want to be an example for writers from all over the country, the Shanghai Writers Association must give literary and artistic groups from all over the country a demonstration and a new perception. This is the case in fact, and even if we don't intend to do so, it must be so.

Note: Most of the arguments in this article are the results of the exchange of opinions among the preparatory committee members over the past month. The author is only acting as a representative and dare not take the credit.

### Congratulations on the Establishment of the "Shanghai Writers Association" Joy and Wishes

— Liu Shi

The "Shanghai Literary Writers Association," which has been in preparation for so long, has finally been officially established today!

"Officially established" brings us joy, but also brings worries

In the process of participating in the preparatory group, I have exchanged opinions with many friends. Everyone believes that it is urgently needed to organize a literary group in Shanghai, the cultural center. The question is how to organize it? What is the meaning of the organization? Therefore, Brother Jinshan publicly expressed our attitude to everyone in the Chunqiu on April 19. Here, I don't need to say much more. In order to express my personal sensitivity and wishes, it seems that I have to say a few words to fulfill my responsibilities.

Literature and art and politics are closely related. Therefore, in the past, a few people actually regarded literature and art as a tool of politics. Sinclair even said this: "All art is propaganda"; they regarded literary and artistic groups as military forces to seize political power. On the one hand, they sang the praises of democracy, but on the other hand, they closed the Xuan gate tightly, rejecting people thousands of miles away.

Literary and artistic authors themselves should be absolutely free and detached. Their works should reflect everything of the times, not only affecting everything of the present, but also affecting future generations. Only such literature and art have life! Only such writers are worthy of being called great. Leaving aside the literature and art of ancient times and their authors, we will only take Cao Xueqin and Lu Xun, who are familiar to the public, as examples:

"Dream of the Red Chamber" and "The True Story of Ah Q," although are two works with different contents, their thought system is the same. They used sharp eyes to see through everything, and in their writing, they targeted reality and reflected everything of the times. Although readers have different views, they are after all two penetrating and vital masterpieces. Therefore, they can all win the love and respect of the broad masses.

In other words, Cao Xueqin and Lu Xun have fulfilled the duties of literature and art and completed the tasks of writers. In other words, their works are not used for politics. On the contrary, they have improved politics and led politics.

Therefore, we hope to produce more such literature and art and such writers. Moreover, we hope that such liberal writers can unite to become a free writing group. They can increase friendship, get mutual assistance in life, complement each other in learning, and exert greater power in their careers. Therefore, we should not be divided by parties and beliefs, regardless of men, women, old or young, not shape idols and leaders, not close doors, and allow established writers and young people in learning to participate freely and breathe together in the air of freedom. This is our urgent desire and purpose for organizing this association.

### Is Good News Not News?

— Bu Shu

In the past, the petty bourgeoisie used to describe the abilities of ordinary superiors, saying: "Scholars do not go out, but they can know the affairs of the world." In the past, although there may not have been newspapers, official reports and residence copies may have existed. The so-called "affairs of the world" were only limited to the court, and folk news was not included. Today, some tabloids compete for victory with yellow news or insider news, which is regarded as catering to the popular taste. Compared with the boring sermons in official reports and residence copies, it is naturally not the same, but in terms of news morality, the former is still a "veritable record," while the latter is just exaggeration or fabrication.

What is worth studying is why so many people like to read this kind of news that they know is fabricated? - Is it because of the monotonous life? Or is it the increasingly decadent social atmosphere that is encouraging them?

The British Huxley once said a famous saying: "Good news is not news." The meaning of this sentence is actually "Dog bites man is not news, man bites dog is news." In a society where everything is abnormal, "normal" is far less popular than "abnormal." Reporting on the construction plan of a large bridge is far less attractive to readers than news about lust, theft, and killing. In such a situation, if some people cater to and seek favor, and compete for victory with "yellow" or "insider" news, it will naturally arouse the abnormal desires of readers, which is inevitable.

At the same time, we cannot simply blame reporters for creating yellow news. The corruption of social customs sometimes encourages them to talk nonsense and fabricate stories, and their nonsense and fabrication then turn around and affect social customs. Over time, it becomes a cycle, which will eventually plunge the entire society into a state of eternal ruin.

For example, the two recent cases of incest that occurred in Shanghai: hotel owner Chen Dada defiled his own daughter, and teahouse owner Du Quntu defiled his stepmother. The absurdity of the plot is somewhat beyond the imagination of the "yellow news fabricators"; as for the "Shen Wuye" case of transvestites uncovered in Elizabeth Apartment, the obscenity is even worse than the serialized novels in the tabloids. What else is there to say? At present, it seems that the entire society is moving towards the path of lust and killing, and the words such as etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame that are covering up "obscene behavior" may be even more difficult to understand than oracle bone inscriptions in the eyes of ordinary people. One day, scholars will have to come to study the true meaning of these four words.

I remembered what a reporter from a certain newspaper said after describing the "transvestite case":

"Now, Room 11 of the beautiful Elizabeth Apartment on Fuxing Middle Road is already empty, leaving the beautiful gauze curtain hanging empty, covering up everything in the room, just like the prosperity and wealth of this city, shielding all the debauchery and shamelessness."

Paper cannot cover up the fire. If you think that the beautiful gauze curtain can completely cover up the obscene behavior in the room, then "Shen Wuye" seems to still have a few years to live in the "palace"; if you think that the prosperity and wealth of the city can shield all debauchery and shamelessness, then how can the theft and incest cases in Shanghai Beach be published in newspapers?

If the future world can still be called a "paradise," I think the first condition must be "Only good news is considered news!"

### On Simplified Characters

— Yi Bai

Chinese characters are complex in structure, which not only takes time to write, but also often confuses beginners and makes it difficult to remember, which has an impact on the popularization of education. In recent years, many people who are enthusiastic about education and philologists have been engaged in simplifying Chinese characters in order to eliminate illiteracy and promote mass education. The creation of simplified characters has gradually increased, and the illiterate masses are all claiming that it is convenient. However, the simplification of characters did not start in modern times. "Xiaoji" once recorded a story: "A Jinshi of the Tang Dynasty had a single surname and went to the examination hall. The chief examiner mistakenly wrote it as "Dan." Dan complained: "Although my clan is humble, I don't want my surname to be changed by others. Please correct it." The chief examiner said: "Is it worth arguing about the square mouth and the sharp mouth?" Dan said: "If it is not worth arguing about, then can the Wu'er County of Taizhou be changed to the Er County of Luzhou?" The chief examiner had nothing to say."

Among the current simplified characters, the symbols used for simplification do not have a certain standard, and it is necessary to discuss them. For example, the "Shang" on the left side of the word "敌" (dí, enemy) is simplified to "舌" (shé, tongue). If the "Shang" of the word "适" (shì, suitable) is also written as "舌", then it becomes the "适" (kuò) of Nanggong Kuo. Another example is that "怀" (huái, bosom) is written as "怀" and "还" (huán, return) is written as "还", then the simplified forms of "环" (huán, ring) and "環" (huán, surround) should be the same, "环". Furthermore, such as the "奚" (xī) beside "鷄" (jī, chicken), the "灌" (guàn) beside "漢" (hàn, Han), and the "葛" (gé) beside "歡" (huān, happy), all use the character "又" (yòu, again) to represent them, as "灌," "汉," and "欢." Three symbols are usable by one symbol, which makes it feel like "汉" cannot be made into "溪" (xī, stream) or "灌" (guàn), and "灌" cannot be made into "鶴" (hè, crane). Although it is because of custom, it is not reasonable after all. Beginners who do not know many characters are especially difficult to distinguish. I think that the symbols for simplified strokes must be uniform. If we replace "旧" (jiù, old) with "父" (fù, father), then "觀" (guān, view) becomes "观," "權" (quán, power) becomes "权," and "歡" (huān, happy) becomes "欢," without any doubt. However, "漢" (hàn, Han) can only be made into "濯" (zhuó, wash), not "英" (yīng, hero) or "溪" (xī). As for "灌" and "奚," other simple symbols should be used to represent them separately, so that the system is clear and not mixed up, which will be more beneficial for beginners. I wonder what the experts who are currently working on simplifying Chinese characters think?

### Pitiful Words

— Cheng Zhi

General Eisenhower told a story, he said: "After the end of the war in Europe, I was ordered to return to the United States by plane to participate in a certain meeting. Among the many passengers, there was a paratrooper, and he told me a lot about his flying experience, but when our plane landed, I found that he seemed very uneasy.

"Boy, what's wrong?" I asked him.

"General," he replied, trembling, "this is the first time I've landed in an airplane!"

### Dead Model Living Appearance

— Yi Feng

Southern Song History records: "On the Lantern Festival of Gui Chou, the emperor (Lizong) summoned prostitutes into the palace. There was Tang Anlun, whose singing and appearance were unparalleled. The emperor loved and favored her.侍郎牟子才奏曰: 'These are all the temptations of Dong Songchen and others, which have destroyed your Majesty's twenty years of self-cultivation.' The emperor ordered Ding Daquan to issue an edict: "Loyalty is not forbidden, but do not distribute copies." Zi Cai then made a picture of Gao Lishi taking off his boots, and sent copies to those who were friendly with Song Chen. Song Chen was furious and said: "Verbal advice is still acceptable, but to draw this dead model living appearance? He took it in and said to the emperor: "Mou is scolding the official family." The emperor looked at the picture and laughed: "You are scolding you, not me."

From ancient times to the present, villains are mostly like this, their actions are smelly and ugly. Because they are guilty, they are even more afraid of others saying they are smelly and ugly. It is like people who have suffered from painful sores, fearing that others will touch their scars, which is exactly the same. Speaking of the characters and time of this story, when Lizong was facing south and calling himself lonely in the small court, the Xianghuai area had already been lost, and the alarms were alarming. At the critical moment of national affairs, a slight sense of conscience, would never be such a dog 　 enjoying the sounds and colors, absurd through the top of it. But he recruited prostitutes into the palace and was very happy. Dong Songchen, as a small yellow door, saw through the emperor's weaknesses and catered to his preferences to win favor and solidify his position. This is exactly the cleverness of small people, and the living appearance of their dead model. When other people draw his portrait, and even he himself feels a little uncomfortable, he becomes impatient, and does not want to correct his own dead model living appearance, but blames others for saying "Verbal advice is still acceptable, but to draw this dead model living appearance," and as a result, he cries to the master, attempting to seek revenge. It can be seen that the work of "self-restraint" is more difficult for small people. Or it may be said that this is the traditional spirit of the Chinese people. Don't you see Ah Q? With scabies growing on his head, he does not blame himself for being born badly, but everywhere he is taboo against others saying words like "light" and "bright." Isn't this the same reason as Dong Songchen's originally thorough dead model living behavior, but being ashamed and hating Mou Zicai's boots-off picture?

Today, the era of Huang Songchen is far away, and the era of Ah Q still exists. There are many people with dead model living appearances, and there are also many people who are afraid of being said to have dead model living appearances.

### Mr. De and Mr. Sai

— Lei Ke

The two gentlemen in the title were introduced to the Chinese people in the year of the May Fourth Movement. However, for 28 years, these two gentlemen have been put aside, and not many people know them. Since they don't know them, they naturally don't pay attention to them, let alone treat them as partners affectionately. After 28 years, it is really too sorry for these two neglected guests to introduce them by name again.

Speaking of this matter, we have to admit the failure of the introduction at that time, which is also a part of the failure of the New Culture Movement. One of the fruits of the New Culture Movement was the expansion of vernacular Chinese, but unfortunately, this fruit was picked before it was ripe. The purpose of advocating vernacular Chinese is to unify spoken and written language, to popularize writing, and to make writing a tool for the masses. Because only when the masses can read and write can Mr. De and Mr. Sai be recognized and loved by the masses. Today's vernacular Chinese does not belong to the masses. It is still something possessed by a few people. No matter how vernacular we make vernacular Chinese, as long as the masses do not know it, they will be thousands of miles away from it and unable to touch it. Lacking this medium, it is always difficult to hope to introduce Mr. De and Mr. Sai to the Chinese people.

The "May Fourth" Movement is called the Renaissance. The mistake is in this place. What we need is not a revival, but a thorough enlightenment movement. During the "May Fourth" Movement, we introduced a large amount of Western culture and worked hard to improve the tools of introduction. Unfortunately, we only saw the trees but not the forest, and only knew to spin around in vernacular Chinese, but did not hand vernacular Chinese over to the masses. There is no high theory, we have neglected basic education.

Popularized writing is important, but it is even more important for the masses to understand it. With the illiteracy rate in the country still accounting for more than 50 percent, it is difficult for the masses to recognize Mr. De and Mr. Sai. The characteristic of Mr. Sai is the scientific method, which is the idea that conforms to ubiquity, and the characteristic of Mr. De is mutual tolerance and the art of mutual compromise. If these things do not have education as a tool, they cannot penetrate into the masses, but can only become empty talk on paper for scholars, without the funds for realization. We do not object to the two gentlemen being introduced on stage again and again, but the eyes of the illiterate must be made to shine so that they can see the two gentlemen with their own eyes.

### "Cooperation"

— Qi

She was repairing the car that had broken down on the narrow road, but the cars behind her were getting impatient and honking their horns desperately. Finally, she ran to the car behind her.

"I'm very sorry, but I can't fix it." She said very gently to the driver, "If you can repair it for me, then I'd be very willing to stay here and honk the horn for you."

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"We've been waiting for more than a month. If there was no other way, I would never dare to bother Director Xiong again!" He smiled reluctantly and said with extremely tactful words: "Fortunately, we have no extravagant hopes. Any car will do, one is fine, two is even better...!"

Director Xiong raised his face and looked at the ceiling, showing a very impatient look.

"I heard that a batch of military vehicles will be driven back to Liuzhou tomorrow,..." Lao Zhu planned to gradually make his request more concrete.

But the door of the director's office was pushed open again. In came a young woman of about thirty years old, dressed very beautifully, with expressive eyebrows and eyes; a gust of fragrant wind blew in, immediately startling the young Director Xiong, who was about to fall asleep. He immediately jumped out of his seat and greeted her with a smile.

Lao Zhu was so disappointed that he almost wanted to leave in a huff.

The host and the female guest each occupied a sofa amidst laughter, and the conversation immediately unfolded very smoothly; Lao Zhu managed to suppress the anger in his heart with a piece of candy, pretending not to care, and sat in the back listening. But his mind was already in a mess, and he couldn't hear half of what was said. He only occasionally heard a word or two, vaguely knowing that this wealthy woman had come specifically to beg for help because her three trucks loaded with commercial goods had been blocked by the inspection office and were not allowed to pass; Director Xiong initially seemed to have made a set of official remarks, but he couldn't resist the charming woman's repeated use of gentle means, and she played with him until he lost all his will and had nothing to say.

"Then call me immediately! Don't forget your friendship after turning around!" Finally, the wealthy woman, who knew how to seize the opportunity, immediately forced Director Xiong to notify the inspection office on the highway by telephone to let the three trucks out of Guilin.

Director Xiong staggered back to his desk with intoxicating steps.

"Call back, and I'll treat you to dinner!" He said, staring at the wealthy woman with greasy powder, as he picked up the phone receiver.

This made Zhu Zhaonian very anxious.

"What's the rush? That's how you are!" The wealthy woman twisted her head! Jiao Chen said: "I'll treat you in the evening!" Perhaps she really didn't have time at noon, or perhaps she had already eaten.

Zhu Zhaonian breathed a sigh of relief.

The next six or seven minutes passed quickly. The wealthy woman saw that her goal had been achieved and was unwilling to entangle with the easily impulsive young military officer anymore. Although Director Xiong had been provoked to excitement, there was no way to force her to stay because the other party insisted on leaving. (62)
