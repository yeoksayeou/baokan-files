[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] Chen Cheng has flown to Shenyang to oversee the situation.

### Reforming Politics and Economy; Government is Pragmatic

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Director Dong answered reporters' inquiries regarding political and economic reforms as follows:

Economic and political reforms are a matter of great concern to our government. Everyone acknowledges the need to refresh politics. After a long period of war, it is inevitable that the internal order of any country will not be stable. Today, China has many difficult problems to solve. Taking inflation as an example, it inevitably affects the emotions and work efficiency of the salaried class. However, the government firmly believes that this difficulty is not absolutely insurmountable. Everyone must remember that from the 16th to the 26th year of the Republic, there were great achievements in political construction, which were praised by the world, and this was the National Government under the leadership of the same leader. The current central government is gradually implementing plans to improve politics, such as the recent economic reform plan announced by the Executive Yuan, the revision of foreign exchange management and import and export trade regulations, the nationwide anti-corruption campaign, and the reform of county administration. All of these are sufficient to show the sincerity and efforts of the government. We cannot expect complete results overnight, especially at this time, when the communist bandits are creating disturbances, consuming national strength, and hindering the implementation of many economic construction plans. However, I can assure everyone that economic and political reforms will certainly become major news topics in the coming months. The government is determined to be pragmatic and down-to-earth in order to realize its plan to refresh politics. I sincerely hope that world opinion will refrain from making hasty judgments as our government strives to move forward.

The Chairman's speech briefly stated: "It has been another year since I was last with you brothers and sisters. I am very pleased to be able to meet with you again on this visit. I am very concerned about the fire in Guling, which caused a lot of hardship for our compatriots. Madame Chiang and I often think of the suffering of our compatriots, so we sent the Headquarters to provide relief." The Chairman continued: "Originally, I wanted to come earlier this year, but I could not leave the bandit suppression work for a while. Now that summer has passed and autumn has arrived, I still want to come and see you elders and compatriots."

### Emmett Arrives in US Capital From Korea; Issues Statement Before Departure, Thanks Koreans; Will Go to Hawaii to Draft Report

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] President Truman's special envoy, Emmett, completed his investigation in Korea and arrived here by plane at 2:15 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. He immediately went to the US Embassy. He will depart for Hawaii today to draft a final report on the results of his investigations in China and Korea, and submit it to Truman in order to determine US policy in the Far East.

[United Press, Seoul, 3rd] Emmett issued a statement today before his departure, saying: "I and all members of the delegation are very grateful to the people of Korea and the United States for their warm hospitality and assistance to our delegation. Here, as in China, the delegation has made every effort to contact the Korean people as much as time permitted. However, there are more than 200 political parties and public organizations in Korea, so it is difficult to solicit opinions from each of them. Fortunately, many valuable reports have been obtained from the letters and opinions received. Koreans, whether men or women, from industry, commerce, education, and political circles, have had the opportunity to express their views on the domestic political, economic, and social situation. Members of the delegation, either as a group or individually, have traveled to various places to collect public opinion widely, not only limited to Seoul. The Mayor of Seoul and the representatives of the people, knowing that the delegation had limited time, held a reception to enable the delegation to meet with Korean and foreign representatives, which was deeply appreciated. The opinions collected were very diverse, but one point was almost unanimous: the desire to establish a peaceful, prosperous, and unified Korea. The task of our delegation to seek facts in China and Korea has now come to an end. We will depart for Tokyo and then fly to Hawaii on September 5, where we will stay for about a week, close ourselves off to sort out the materials and draft the final report, in order to submit it to the President upon our return to the country. This matter is of great importance and must be completely isolated from the outside world, concentrating our minds and acting with caution. Lieutenant General Hull, Commander of the Army in the Pacific, has agreed to take care of everything. As I am about to leave, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all sectors of Korean society and wish the country prosperity."

### Soviet Attitude; Delays Korean Reunification

[Another Telegram] Sources say Emmett felt that power politics and the Soviet attitude were delaying Korean unification. Emmett's observation of the Soviet Union seemed consistent with that of Korean and American military personnel, who recently said the Soviet Union seemed only willing to grant Korea independence on Soviet terms. The power politics point was made at the Korean Legislative Assembly yesterday. It was stated: "We only need to eliminate or reduce the pursuit of power in your country at home and abroad, in both public and private sectors, and the goal of a unified government will be achieved quickly."

### Siam Today

— Our Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang

Special report on the maiden flight to Nanyang by China National Aviation Corporation

In the entire Southeast Asian region, Siam is undoubtedly the place most worthy of China's attention. Siam is the only independent country in Southeast Asia, with a population of 15 million, and may be a vast market for China. Siam needs cheap fabrics and various manufactured goods, and there are currently almost no import restrictions. In the future, China may obtain rice, timber, rubber, tin, and other products from Siam. Currently, about 80% of Siam's trade is handled by 3 million overseas Chinese.

Bangkok, the capital of Siam, is today the nerve center of international air transport. The twelve routes of the American, British, Dutch, French, and Siamese airlines all pass through this city. Siam is also the back door to Malaya. Once railway transport returns to normal, there will be trains running day and night between Siam and Singapore.

As a promising market and a major producer of goods, Siam is now rapidly raising its international status. The expansion of nationalism is gradually making it aware of the large number of overseas Chinese in the country and the important and extensive businesses they control. Most of the overseas Chinese in Siam have resided here for more than 50 years and have helped develop the country's industry and commerce. Now they are beginning to feel less welcome by the local people.

The Siamese government is often suspicious of China's intentions and openly jealous of the industry and commerce run by overseas Chinese, using legislative procedures or other methods to instigate anti-Chinese behavior. In fact, although most of the government officials and political leaders are of mixed Sino-Siamese blood, the Siamese government does have the above-mentioned trend.

Since the signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship and the establishment of the Chinese Embassy a year ago, Chinese Ambassador Li Tieh-cheng has made great efforts to improve Sino-Siamese relations. According to reports from overseas Chinese in Bangkok, in recent months, the Siamese people's open opposition to overseas Chinese has gradually decreased, but Ambassador Li often encounters resistance from Siamese leaders and their government. The following pending cases are enough to illustrate the general trend of Siamese policy:

First, the issue of education for overseas Chinese. Not long ago, the Siamese government passed a law restricting the hours of Chinese language instruction in overseas Chinese schools to no more than four and a half hours per week. In addition, the law also stipulated that all teachers in schools must be tested in the Siamese language. This law almost made it impossible for overseas Chinese schools in Siam to operate. The Siamese government's intention was obviously to have the second and third generations of overseas Chinese educated in Siamese. When the law was announced, Ambassador Li immediately protested and discussed modifying the law with the Siamese government. After a long period of negotiations, the Siamese government finally agreed to increase the hours of Chinese language instruction and also agreed to lift the restriction that all subjects must be taught in Siamese. Furthermore, as a result of this negotiation, teachers in overseas Chinese schools will no longer need to be tested in the Siamese language in the future. Regarding this educational issue, the overseas Chinese in Bangkok unanimously recognize that Ambassador Li has achieved a complete diplomatic victory.

Second, the issue of the Bank of China setting up a branch in Bangkok. However, diplomatic negotiations have not been successful regarding the issue of the Bank of China opening a branch in Bangkok. Zhang Jinghui, the commissioner preparing for the Bangkok branch of the Bank of China, has been here for nearly eight months, and the request forwarded by the embassy in February of this year has not yet been approved by the Siamese government. The Siamese government, considering that 80% of Siam's industry and commerce are in the hands of overseas Chinese, fears that once the Bank of China is allowed to set up a branch in Bangkok, the deposits of the 16 banks in Bangkok will be absorbed by the Bank of China. After lengthy consultations, the Siamese government agreed to allow the Bank of China to set up a branch that is only allowed to operate overseas remittances and foreign exchange business, but Ambassador Li and Commissioner Zhang did not accept this proposal and insisted that the Bank of China should have the franchise to operate all banking businesses. According to the most-favored-nation clause, the Siamese government has an obligation to grant this permission, because HSBC, Chartered Bank, and Banque de l'Indochine are all permitted to operate all banking businesses. The Siamese government could not provide a satisfactory response to the reasons put forward by Li and Zhang, so it simply adopted a delaying tactic. Later, Ambassador Li and Commissioner Zhang tried in various ways to raise this issue again through private and diplomatic channels. When this reporter left Bangkok, it was reported that the Siamese government's attitude had slightly improved, and perhaps it would allow the Bank of China to open a branch. (To be continued)

### Overseas Chinese compatriots elections. We are studying how to proceed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Zhang Lisheng, Minister of the Interior and Chairman of the Election Headquarters Committee, spoke to reporters on the 3rd about the participation of overseas Chinese compatriots in the election, saying: "We attach great importance to the upcoming general election, so we are carefully studying how to proceed with the election of overseas Chinese compatriots. We must not exercise administrative power on the territory of other countries. We agree with the Siamese government's statement that 'future elections for overseas Chinese will violate Siamese sovereignty in accordance with international law.' Without violating international law, the Election Headquarters will consult with the overseas Chinese election organizations to discuss how to proceed." Zhang also gave an example: "In the past, Germany used warships to sail fifty nautical miles offshore from other countries to conduct elections overseas. Even with this example, we will not conduct elections on the territory of other countries." elections."

### Northeast Engineer Yue Li; Invents Two Steelmaking Methods; Steel Output Speed Breaks Record

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] Engineer Yue Li has invented the calcium carbide steelmaking method and the method of directly manufacturing high-speed steel from manganese-tungsten sand. Yue works at the Benxi Coal and Iron Company. In a turbulent environment, he is still able to work with peace of mind and diligently research. In February of this year, he invented the calcium carbide steelmaking method. The steel produced has fewer sand holes and increased speed. A one-ton electric furnace can produce eight ingots in 24 hours, breaking the highest record of five ingots in 24 hours during the Japanese occupation. Yue also invented a method of directly manufacturing high-speed steel from tungsten-manganese sand in April of this year. The electricity used is saved and the steel quality is better. This is a great contribution to China's steel industry. He has now presented these two inventions to Sun Yueqi, Vice-Chairman of the National Resources Commission. Sun has agreed to assist in registration, apply for a patent, and award a reward.

### Execute War Criminals

### US State Department Formally Announces; The Soviet Union's Absolute Opening of Dalian Does Not Assume Protective; US Interests Responsibility

[US Information Service, Washington, 2nd] The State Department released on the 2nd the Soviet Foreign Ministry's response on August 26 to the note of August 14, 1947, regarding the Dalian issue. The important parts have been translated. This reply was delivered to the US Embassy in Moscow on August 27. The content is as follows:

"In response to your embassy's note number 689 of August 14, regarding the issue of opening Dalian to international trade, the Soviet Foreign Ministry requests that you refer to note number 103 of February 27, 1947, which states: The status of Dalian has been clarified by the Sino-Soviet Special Agreement on the Dalian issue of August 14, 1945. According to this agreement, during the period when the state of war with Japan exists, Dalian is under the jurisdiction of the regime established at the Lushun Naval Base. At present, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, so the state of war with Japan has not ended. Therefore, the regime of the naval base still has jurisdiction over Dalian. In view of this environment, and the fact that the civil administration of the Chinese government has not yet fulfilled its work in Dalian (the reasons for which are beyond the control of the Soviet Union), the Soviet government does not see any reason to change the current regime in Dalian. In view of the above circumstances, the Soviet government firmly rejects any attempt to make the Soviet government responsible for American interests."

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The State Department recently revealed that the Soviet Union has refused the US request to return Dalian to China and open it as an international commercial port. The Soviet Union also said that even at the time of return, it could not hand over to Chinese administrative officials to take over management, because the Chinese government had expressed that it would refuse to accept unless the National Army was allowed to enter. The Soviet Union continued to say that China had not yet "fulfilled its tasks in Dalian." According to sources, the Sino-Soviet negotiations broke down due to the issue of not allowing the National Army to enter Dalian. After the Chinese representative returned to Nanjing, he reported to the government that the Soviet Union refused to allow the National Army to enter Dalian to support administrative work, so it was impossible to hold talks with the Soviet Union.

### Preliminary Meeting on the Peace Treaty with Japan: Our Country Determined to Uphold its Position; Foreign Minister Wang to Embark on Active Diplomacy; Some Quarters Believe MacArthur Has Been Deceived by the Japanese

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Foreign Minister Wang told our newspaper's reporter on the 3rd that our suggestion regarding the voting method for the preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan was made on the premise that all countries that should sign a peace treaty with Japan would attend. If one or more countries do not attend the meeting, we will thoroughly reconsider our attitude and position. Mr. Wang's statement was in response to a reporter's question about whether Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao's statement the week before that "the approval of more than two-thirds, including the attending and voting major Allied nations, is required to pass a motion" meant abandoning our country's veto power. After he finished speaking, he laughed heartily and said, "I have already given the reporter too much of an answer." According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Wang's main task during his trip to the United States, in addition to attending the United Nations General Assembly, is to conduct informal consultations with the heads of various countries attending the UNGA on the matter of the peace treaty with Japan, so as to strive for a satisfactory conclusion to the signing of the peace treaty as much as possible. Otherwise, it is necessary to take necessary measures to prevent certain countries from ignoring the aggressive nature of Japan, resulting in an overly lenient peace treaty and causing endless harm. Furthermore, the reporter had discussed with several experts on Japanese affairs and senior diplomats the position that our country should adopt regarding the peace treaty with Japan. They all expressed that we are not willing to suppress Japan excessively, but every bit of its aggressive nature must be eliminated. Most people believe that MacArthur has been deceived by the Japanese, and the US policy towards Japan is very likely to follow the wrong path of its policy towards Germany. For the sake of the happiness of the people of the Far East and the peace of the entire world, we must be confident in our understanding of the Japanese problem and firmly adhere to our position. This, coupled with Foreign Minister Wang's frank and confident words on the 3rd, suggests that our country may launch a very significant active diplomacy outside the UN General Assembly.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] The "Pravda" newspaper today published an article by Markov in a three-column position titled "Victory over Japan and Strengthening the Work of Peace in the Far East," expressing extreme dissatisfaction with the US policy towards Japan and stating that although the issue of signing a peace treaty with Japan has been raised, the talk of establishing lasting peace in the Far East is still too early. The article reviews the US policy towards Japan from various aspects, and its conclusion is that the Potsdam decisions concerning Japan have not been fulfilled in any way, and it accuses the United States of pursuing military construction in Japan. The article repeatedly accuses the United States of unilateral actions and claims that it was not the sole force of the United States that defeated Japan. The article also attacks the US policy in China. In addition, the "Red Star," "Izvestia," and "Trud" newspapers also published articles commemorating the second anniversary of Japan's surrender.

The above-mentioned disaster areas, including Shanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, and the Northeast, total two cities and 310 counties, with a total of more than 22.19 million victims (the number of flood victims in Shandong Province has not yet been fully counted). (4) Bandit Disasters: The provinces most severely affected by bandit disasters include Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Anhui, Gansu, Hubei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. In addition, Henan, Hebei, northern Jiangsu, and the Northeast are also suffering from both natural and bandit disasters. Moreover, the floods in various provinces were actually caused by the Communist bandits destroying river embankments and obstructing repairs everywhere, leading to unmanageable flooding. As for the bandit disasters, because the Communist bandits implement the so-called "Three-You Struggle" and "Three-Alls Policy" in the areas they occupy, the people cannot bear the massacre and trampling. In addition to those who fled to safer areas in various provinces harassed by the Communist army, the number of those who fled to major cities such as Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Xuzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai is also large. According to reports from various places this [illegible] month, the number of refugees who have fled from these areas has reached more than 16.4 million. In the past two weeks, various places have continued to report, and the total number should be more than 20 million.

### Government Allocates Huge Sums of Money for Comprehensive Relief

The government has allocated huge sums of money to the disaster victims in various provinces for comprehensive relief. The relief funds for floods, droughts, and other natural disasters include 6.3 billion yuan for Henan, 4.7 billion yuan for Hebei, 6 billion yuan for Shanxi, and 5 billion yuan for Shandong. The Liaoning relief funds are being reviewed and allocated by the Executive Yuan. Relief work in various places is now actively continuing, either by setting up temporary shelters, providing agricultural and grain loans, or implementing construction relief. This year, the central government allocated 3 billion yuan in relief funds and 10 billion yuan in grain loans to Guangdong Province, 2 billion yuan in relief funds and 5.7 billion yuan in grain loans to Guangxi Province, and initially allocated 1 billion yuan to Sichuan. The Executive Yuan meeting decided to allocate an additional 1 billion yuan in relief [illegible] and ordered the Four Banks Joint Treasury to allocate 10 billion yuan in loans. In addition to the 1 billion yuan initially allocated by the provincial government to northern Jiangsu, the 17th Executive Yuan meeting decided to allocate 4 billion yuan in emergency relief and provide 10 billion yuan in emergency agricultural loans and 5 billion yuan in seed loans.

The government focuses on comforting and resettling refugees fleeing from bandit areas, either by providing funds and materials, introducing them to jobs, guiding young people to study, or providing care for the elderly, weak, and disabled in institutions. To date, the government has allocated a total of 35,117,540,000 yuan in emergency relief funds and 45,800,000,000 yuan in various loans to the Northeast, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, Chahar, Rehe, Suiyuan, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Nanjing, and other provinces and cities to relieve bandit disasters and refugees returning from bandit areas. In addition, there are 34,000 tons of relief grain, 15,000 tons of salt, and 50,000 packages of clothing. All disaster victims fleeing from bandit areas who are in need of food and clothing have been given relief, with the number already exceeding 6 million, and the rest are being actively rescued. In addition, 1 billion yuan of national currency has already been allocated by the central government and transferred to the Guangdong-Northeast Relief [illegible] for the disaster relief of youths who have fled bandit areas from the nineteen counties and cities in the four recovered provinces of the Northeast and the five provinces and two cities in the unrecovered areas that have lost their education and employment opportunities.

### Wang Yaowu Publishes Long Article: Earnestly Appeals to Bandit Cadres; Hopes They Will Resolutely Return to Build a New Shandong

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] Wang Yaowu recently published a long article addressed to bandit cadres on the second anniversary of the victory. The wording is unusually frank and earnest. The general idea is: I hoped to see you after the victory [illegible]. It is [illegible] painful. I am a government official, implementing national policies and benefiting the people. You are Communist Party cadres, also promoting everything for the people and the masses.

The Communist Party's policies and lines have made mistakes, resulting in disastrous military defeats everywhere. China must have a modern unified country in order to stand in the world. Any political party that violates the trend of the world will go to a dead end. The historical crimes are all caused by a difference in thought. I hope that you will abandon military adventures, stop destruction, and resolutely return to work together to build a new Shandong. Whether it is rebirth or destruction, I hope you will boldly make the final decision.

Editorial

### Review of the Canberra Conference

The British Empire's peace conference on Japan, which opened on the 26th of last month in Canberra, Australia, to discuss various issues related to Japan, successfully concluded on the 2nd of this month. The conference issued a communique clarifying the common and consistent attitude of the British Empire's self-governing dominions towards the Japan issue. The main points are as follows: (1) Immediately convene a peace conference on Japan, in which all member states of the Far Eastern Commission and Pakistan can participate; when voting at the conference, a two-thirds majority voting system should be adopted. (2) Establish a control committee to replace the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in the Pacific to supervise Japan's fulfillment of its obligations under the peace treaty. Therefore, the result of this Canberra Conference is not only that the opinions of the United Kingdom and its self-governing dominions tend to be consistent, but also that the differences between the British Empire and the United States can be expected to disappear invisibly. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt stated at the conference: "The United Kingdom does not want to formulate a peace treaty with Japan based on hatred and revenge, and believes that MacArthur will feel the same way about this British view." It is widely rumored that the United States has expressed its willingness to accept the United Kingdom's proposal, which is likely. Therefore, this Canberra Conference will surely accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, which is worthy of our attention.

After the Second World War, the British Empire seemed to be gradually heading towards the misfortune of disintegration, especially its position in the Pacific, which was declining day by day, and the United States took its place. However, the ingenuity of British diplomacy lies in making good use of the power of the United States to achieve British expectations. For example, on the issue of Japan, British public opinion was originally dissatisfied with Marshal MacArthur's ruling policy, and the government also knew the mistakes of the American policy, but the United Kingdom had no right to force its friends, and it had no intention of exercising its veto power in the Far Eastern Commission, condoning the United States, and the United States condoning Japan. Recently, in order to end the control of Japan as soon as possible, the United States proposed holding a preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan with eleven countries, and based on a two-thirds majority voting system, not based on veto power. This approach is most unfavorable to China, followed by the Soviet Union, and the most beneficial to gain is naturally the United Kingdom and its Commonwealth. As a result, the United Kingdom had a good harvest. Originally, the United Kingdom's position in the Far East had reached a point of decline. If it can hold a two-thirds majority voting right in the future peace conference on Japan, it will undoubtedly enhance the United Kingdom's voice in the Far East, and can use this to exchange for concessions from the United States on some issues. In order to solidify the opinions of the Commonwealth and form a common front for the British Empire, the Canberra Conference was held.

The decision of the Canberra Conference on the attitude towards the peace treaty with Japan has no independent opinion, and fully demonstrates the psychology of using the United States, fearing the Soviet Union, and buying good will from Japan. The expression towards the United States is that this conference will never decide on a plan to confront the United States, but everywhere praises the US proposition. Addison first argued that the peace treaty with Japan should not be drafted by the four powers, but should be jointly drafted by all countries directly involved in the war with Japan, clearly expressing that the United Kingdom abandoned the veto power, which is consistent with the attitude of the United States. Therefore, at the meeting on the 26th, it was decided that the eleven-nation peace conference on Japan convened by the United States should be based on a two-thirds majority voting system and should not be based on veto power. The British Commonwealth has considerable dissatisfaction with the friendly remarks made by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt when he visited Marshal MacArthur. They fear that the United States will condone Japan, and in the future, the United States and Japan will acquire the United Kingdom's power in the Far East. Therefore, it is a stroke of genius to use the United States to cover up its vested interests in the Pacific. Addison explained many times: "The United Kingdom agreed early in the war that the United States must bear the moral responsibility for peace in the Pacific and Asia, but this agreement does not mean that the United Kingdom will transfer its legitimate interests in the Pacific to the United States." This is the best revelation of the British mentality.

The British Empire's expression of fear of the Soviet Union is the leniency of the attitude towards Japan decided by this conference, in order to prevent Japan from heading towards the Soviet Union. Australia first called on the various states to pay attention: the expansion of Soviet power towards the Pacific will be detrimental to the British Commonwealth in the Pacific. Therefore, Australia and the United Kingdom do not advocate concluding a retaliatory peace treaty with Japan, which will allow the Soviet Union to use Japan to resist other United Nations, especially the United States, and increase the Soviet Union's position in the Pacific. Based on this point of view, the Canberra Conference's principles for the peace treaty with Japan have condensed into a draft with unlimited leniency, and even discussed whether the peace talks should be decided unilaterally by the victorious countries or whether Japan should be allowed to participate in the discussions. Obviously, it is unwise for the British Commonwealth to make this discussion, and it violates the usual practice of peace treaties. This lenient principle of the Canberra Conference towards the peace treaty with Japan is all aroused by the psychology of fear.

In short, the Canberra Conference was conducted under the contradictory psychology of the British Empire authorities. On the one hand, they feared that the United States would acquire the United Kingdom's position in the Pacific, and they could not find a way to confront the United States on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. They only wanted to use the power of the United States. On the other hand, they feared that the Soviet Union would extend into the Pacific, and they were even more afraid that Japan would turn to the Soviet Union after its rise again. As a result, they had to support the United States and buy good will from Japan. Therefore, it can be said that the actions of the Canberra Conference were a gathering for the United Kingdom to plan and organize a joint US-Soviet defense front, and to seek self-preservation, and there is no other special significance to say. Since the British attitude is like this, it is extremely unfavorable to China's position in the peace conference with Japan. People have been preparing step by step, I wonder what our diplomatic authorities are planning?

### The Far Eastern Commission Instructs MacArthur to Destroy Japanese Military Industrial Needs; The Level of Civilian Industry Remains to Be Decided; Allied Officials Are Actively Planning to Support Japan's Revival

[United Press Washington, 3rd] The Far Eastern Commission announced today that it has ordered MacArthur to destroy most of Japan's military industrial needs, with the remainder used for compensation. This deliberation policy was discussed for several months and was decided on August 14th. The Commission is currently discussing the level of Japanese civilian industry. The industry that should be destroyed is limited to all factories and machinery that can manufacture military supplies. In addition, the Far Eastern Commission also decided that during the occupation period, the Allied authorities should prohibit the reconstruction of military industries and limit auxiliary industries such as steel, coal mines, and transportation, so that they do not exceed the future industrial production level. This is roughly the same as what is done in Germany.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 3rd] Li Dai, Director of the Industrial Department of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, made a statement to the press corps on the 3rd regarding the issue of Japanese industrial water: At present, Japanese industry only reaches 45% of the average from 1930 to 1934, so it is natural that Japan cannot supply its own daily necessities. In particular, the production of coal ash is only two-thirds of the current necessary amount. If this continues, Japanese industry will not be able to revive quickly. In addition, before the war, Japan imported 7 million tons of coal from Asian countries every year, but in the two years since the end of the war, it has only imported 1,400 tons. Therefore, Japan in the future must import coal from Asian countries in order to fully utilize its industrial facilities and seek the revival of various Asian countries. Also, the production of steel is one million tons, which is only one-third of its necessities. This is not only the case for iron ore. If coal is not imported, the steel problem cannot be solved. Furthermore, the United States exports 12,000 to 13,000 tons of fuel oil to Japan every year, and will continue to export in the future. In short, Japan must highly utilize its growth equipment and manufacture products that meet the interests of the world in order to revitalize trade. However, in order to restore the capital exhausted by the war, it will inevitably have to increase savings.

[United Press Tokyo, 3rd] Li Dai, Director of the Industrial Section of the Allied Headquarters, answered reporters' questions on how Japan should deal with the anti-Japanese sentiment of China and other Eastern countries, and how to deal with the determination of these countries to develop their own industries, saying: "Attitudes can change, but economic considerations cannot change. Japanese industry has developed, while the rest of Asia is mostly lacking. The industrialization of the country will not reduce the exchange of products, but will change the exchange to another different level."

### US Officials Welcome the Resolution of the Canberra Conference; It Is Expected That China and the Soviet Union May Raise Objections

[United Press Washington, 3rd] Sources say that US officials "are greatly pleased" with the resolution of the Canberra British Empire Conference on the peace treaty with Japan. Officials here commented on the conference's decision to continue to be monitored by the Allied authorities after the peace treaty is signed, saying that this decision is largely in line with the US proposal to withdraw the occupation forces after the treaty is signed, and to have civilian officials monitor Japan's implementation of the treaty. However, there may be a lot of debate on the organization and power of this agency. Sources believe that China and the Soviet Union (if the Soviet Union participates in the peace conference) may raise the greatest objections. Both China and the Soviet Union hope that the supervision of the peace treaty with Japan should be stricter and more substantive than what the United Kingdom and the United States have proposed. China and the Soviet Union will greatly oppose the economic revival and restriction of prices in Japan. The British Empire's decision that Japan should have strong reparations and be economically self-sufficient coincides with the claims of the United States and MacArthur. China particularly hopes to greatly limit the Japanese economy, which is contrary to the US view. As for the attitude of the Soviet Union, judging from previous signs, it is expected that it will oppose the US allowing the Japanese economy to recover too quickly. At the same time, US officials said that the United States has not yet definitively decided when to hold the peace conference. They are still studying the recent Soviet Union's rejection of the US proposal to convene an eleven-nation peace conference and insisted on the note that the peace treaty should be drafted by the four foreign ministers' conference. Since the Canberra Conference advocated convening a peace conference as soon as possible, the United States only has two options: one is to continue to negotiate with the Soviet Union to agree to the eleven-nation peace conference, and the other is to directly issue a request to convene the peace conference. Sources say that the United States still hopes to find hope for continued discussion.

### Major Corruption Case in the Japanese Silk Rationing Association

### Bevin Appeals to the United States to Redistribute the Gold Reserves in Fort Knox; This Is the Most Reliable Way to Restore Economic Order

[United Press Southport, 3rd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin today appealed to the United Kingdom, advocating the redistribution of the large amount of gold stored in Fort Knox. He believes that this is the most reliable way to restore the world economy. He said at the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress: The world must solve the problem of the balance of payments, otherwise it will continue to be in constant chaos.

Bevin said: "There are many solutions, but I know that my words will annoy the Americans, and I have to say it. I personally think that the United States is making a cocoon and trapping itself by not being able to redistribute the gold in Fort Knox, which has created extremely high tax rates in the country. It would be great if we could discover a gold mine, but there is no production in a gold mine that has already been mined." Bevin's speech lasted six minutes, mostly about the British economic crisis, but also mentioned diplomatic issues.

Bevin accused the Soviet Union of abusing the veto power of the United Nations. He said: "Most of the work of the United Nations is good, but the Security Council is the most disappointing. In fact, it has become a propaganda show. The use of the veto power has reached an absolutely stupid level. Can the Security Council continue like this?" Bevin said that the United Kingdom has done its best to fulfill the resolutions of the Potsdam Agreement, but "we have been frustrated." The four foreign ministers' meeting in November is the last chance to unite Germany's economy and rebuild Europe. I cannot guarantee its success, but I will do my best.

### The Committee on Japan Discusses Rules of Procedure; US and Soviet Representatives Engage in Heated Debate; Soviet Representative Criticizes Allied Headquarters for Suspending the Provision of Reports

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 3rd] Soviet Representative to the Allied Control Committee for Japan, Major General Kishlerko, first spoke on the rules of procedure, saying: The director of the Secretariat of this Committee notified on August 8th that the headquarters will suspend the provision of particularly detailed reports to this Committee in the future. This is a unilateral measure that hinders the operation of the Control Committee. The revision of the rules of procedure must first be approved by the representatives of the Committee.

The Chairman, US Representative Sebald, said: "This means that the headquarters will suspend the production of special reports unless it deems it necessary, and this Committee does not have the authority to bind MacArthur and the headquarters. The Soviet representative has not been helpful, but only knows how to obstruct, trying to inject foreign ideologies into Japan, and criticizing the Commander-in-Chief." The Soviet representative then said: The Chairman's statement is a serious criticism, and I reserve the right to speak. The head of the Chinese delegation, General Shang Zhen, suggested that this issue should be handed over to the Secretariat for processing, and then reviewed by the Control Committee.

### Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance Signed; The Western Hemisphere Is United; The Spirit of the Treaty Complies with the Provisions of the United Nations Charter

[Reuters Rio de Janeiro, 2nd] The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, passed by the Inter-American Conference, was signed here on the 2nd.

The full text of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance consists of 26 articles, which unites the entire Western Hemisphere between the poles and declares to the rest of the world its participation. The treaty is also a formal implementation of the first provision of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which allows countries to engage in cooperation to engage in individual or collective self-defense.

The full text of the treaty is only 1,800 words, but it mentions the United Nations Charter no less than seven times, with the intention of showing that the American republics have not gone beyond the scope of the United Nations Charter. The main provisions of the 1945 Chapultepec Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance have been rewritten in this new treaty. Although the new treaty still has loopholes, it has undoubtedly expressed the unity of the Western Hemisphere with the strongest formal expression. The main provision of the new treaty is that when any American country is attacked, the Inter-American Alliance Council shall meet to decide by a relative majority whether to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the American countries. Any resolution passed by the foreign ministers' meeting by a two-thirds majority shall be binding on the signatory countries of this treaty, but countries that do not wish to provide troops to resist aggression shall not be forced to provide troops. During the consultation, any country may also take unilateral action to assist the attacked country. The treaty also stipulates that when an American country attacks another country, the signatory countries of this treaty shall first meet and use all possible means to seek a peaceful solution before using collective force to stop the action. The scope of the Western Hemisphere stipulated in this treaty is wider than any previously defined definition, as it includes not only large areas of the polar regions, but also most of Greenland.

### Soviet Ship Disregards Our Government Orders and Carries Passengers from Dalian to Shanghai; The Government Has Lodged a Protest and Passengers Are Not Allowed to Disembark; The Second Batch of Soviet Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Will Return to the Country Tomorrow

[Reported by this newspaper] The Soviet merchant ship "Eripki" has sailed to Shanghai again from the Soviet Union, preparing to send the second batch of Soviet overseas Chinese back to the country. However, on its way to Shanghai, the ship violated our country's regulations and sailed to Dalian without permission, carrying 27 passengers and cargo. Our government authorities believe that the ship has repeatedly disregarded our country's laws and regulations, and will not allow it to come to Shanghai again in the future. At the same time, the 27 passengers from Dalian (including overseas Chinese from Italy, Greece, and Denmark) are not allowed to disembark. Chen Guochang, director of the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office, told reporters yesterday that the ship violated our country's laws and regulations in two ways this time: (1) It violated our government's recent regulations on temporarily suspending the opening of the Port of Dalian, and berthed at a temporarily suspended commercial port without obtaining special permission from our government in advance, which is a disregard for our country's government orders. (2) It transported passengers and goods in our coastal ports, which is an infringement of our coastal shipping rights. Therefore, in addition to ordering the relevant agencies to handle this case in accordance with the law, our government has also lodged a protest with the Soviet side through diplomatic channels.

In addition, the second batch of more than 1,060 Soviet overseas Chinese in this city who are returning to the country will leave Shanghai tomorrow (the 5th) on the "Malipki." Among them, there are a small number of young people who were born in China, but their parents are stateless. Later, they joined Soviet citizenship. According to our country's laws and regulations, these young people should be of Chinese nationality, but our government has given them convenience because they requested to return to the country, and ordered them to complete the formalities before they can go to the Soviet Union. According to the relevant authorities, there will be at least three more batches of Soviet overseas Chinese returning to the country this year, with about 4,000 people.

As for the 27 passengers who came to Shanghai on this ship from Dalian, our authorities will order them to be transported back to their original place on the original ship.

"In the two years since victory, prices have risen daily, and the economy and people's livelihood are worse than during the War of Resistance. Reflecting on the basic conditions for achieving victory at that time, it lay in the unity of national will, the concentration of strength, and the unified opposition to foreign enemies under the leadership of a wise leader. Today, the reason for the nation's chaotic situation lies in the inability to unite. Therefore, it is hoped that when citizens celebrate the victory festival, they will first examine themselves. Nation-building is not yet complete and still requires our efforts."

### Basic Rights of the People Should Be Effectively Protected; Garrison Headquarters Receives Order from the Chairman

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters received an order from the Chairman, relayed by the Ministry of National Defense yesterday. The original order is as follows: "It is investigated that the basic rights of the people should be solemnly respected and properly protected. For the past two years, the government has repeatedly issued strict orders on record. The recently promulgated "Outline for Mobilization, Suppression of Rebellion, Completion of Constitutional Government Implementation" also shows this again. All levels of political, military, constitutional, and legal organs must strictly abide by this to uphold the rule of law. In the future, regardless of the pacification area or non-pacification area, except for the rebellious bandits who have been clearly ordered by the government to be suppressed, and cases that can be temporarily accepted by military judicial organs in accordance with the "Martial Law" and "Revised Temporary Emergency Military and Political Measures for the Pacification Zone and the Nine Provinces of the Northeast" and other laws and regulations, all non-judicial organs and organs not legally empowered with judicial police powers are absolutely not allowed to arrest the people, especially not allowed to have other extra-legal acts of infringing on the people's freedom. Even if the judicial police are ordered to detain criminals, they should strictly transfer them to the court within the prescribed time limit, so as to thoroughly cultivate the essence of upholding the rule of law and protecting civil rights in this emergency period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, so as to deeply plant the foundation for nation-building. It is hoped that the subordinates will be instructed to strictly abide by this."

### Continued Trial of the Yu Shengxiao Case: Malley's Defense Attorney Thoroughly Cross-Examined Queli, Exposing Numerous Flaws in His Testimony

[Report from our newspaper] The American military court continued its hearing yesterday morning, from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, questioning Queli, the Englishman who is the most important suspect and witness in the entire case for conspiracy. The public seating was completely full, especially with foreign women.

After the court opened at 9:15 AM, the prosecutor continued to question Queli about his actions on August 1st. Queli's testimony was the same as before, stating that Malley, lacking funds, had him exchange gold bars for US dollars. He also frankly admitted to buying a handgun and bullets for Malley, but insisted that the weapons remained in Malley's possession at all times. The defendant's defense attorney, Bowler King, then launched the most intense and exhausting cross-examination of Queli, delving into the details of exchanging gold bars for US dollars and thoroughly tracing Queli's past criminal history to prove he was a habitual criminal. Queli was extremely embarrassed and sometimes did not answer. At this point, the judge stated: He hoped Bowler King could ask concrete questions within the scope of the case, adding that under US law, a witness has the right to refuse to answer questions that would incriminate them, and the court cannot compel them to answer. Subsequently, the questions became slightly more focused. Queli gradually lost his composure, and flaws in his testimony became increasingly apparent. As it was past lunchtime, the court took a 45-minute recess.

The court reconvened at 1:00 PM, and the defendant's defense attorney focused on Queli's statements from August 3rd and 14th, selectively questioning him. When his answers contradicted his original statements, the defense attorney was stern and relentless. Under this grueling cross-examination, Queli's testimony was riddled with inconsistencies. The major ones included: (1) The person who rented the car, the Russian Yong Luofu, was originally stated on August 3rd as someone whose name he did not know, but now he admitted to being familiar with him. (2) Queli stated to Major Edson of the US military headquarters on August 14th that after hearing a gunshot on the road, he never looked back until the car stopped. However, in the traffic court, he said that as soon as he heard the gunshot, he looked back and saw Malley committing various acts of violence, which are inconsistent. (3) After Yu Shengxiao was shot, Queli took no action to save Yu's life. (4) In the military court, Queli said he did not see blood on Malley's hands and trousers, but in his statement on August 14th, he said his hands and trousers were covered in blood, which is a major inconsistency. At that time, Queli said that he had gone upstairs and his wife had seen it. But the defendant's defense attorney questioned that his wife saw a person with blood on their hands and did not even ask, which is strange. Queli was speechless. (5) After the incident, Queli contacted as many as five different places to sell gold bars, making his suspicion obvious. (6) The defendant's defense attorney asked Queli why he did not report to the police station after the bloodshed if he was not involved in the conspiracy. From this point alone, it can be seen that he was guilty and feared implicating himself if he went public. The defendant's defense attorney's questioning ended at this point, and Queli was completely placed in an unfavorable position. The flaws in his testimony were numerous and inconsistent, proving that he was a conspirator. The defendant's defense attorney's six-hour questioning aimed to prove that Queli was a conspirator, in order to improve Malley's position. At this point, the prosecutor presented a piece of physical evidence, Malley's trousers worn on August 1st, which Queli identified without error, and the defendant's defense attorney had no objection. Another piece of physical evidence was also presented by the defendant's defense attorney, a letter from Queli to Malley, promising to find Malley a job in China, but Queli went back on his word after Malley came to China. The defendant's defense attorney's purpose in making this letter public was to demonstrate that Queli was a habitual deceiver and untrustworthy. At this time, a judge asked Queli under what circumstances his statements from August 3rd and 14th were made. But Queli was mentally distraught and did not answer. He was also asked if Yu Shengxiao had any weapons with him when he went out that evening, and he also said he did not know. At 4:15 PM, Colonel Palmer announced a recess, scheduled to resume at 9:00 AM this morning.

### New Women's Fashion This Autumn is Even More Elegant and Refined

[Special Report from our newspaper] If everything in the world makes people feel broken and desolate, then the beautiful "fashion" at least provides a glimmer of hope and love to the human spirit. Look: From Paris to New York to Shanghai, from spring to autumn, from "Mantique style" to "sports style," the endless stream of new clothes admired by ladies has covered up the psychological distress of people after the war!

Now, the women of Shanghai are also beginning to accept the comfort brought by this new fashion!

This year's most popular autumn coats are divided into two types: long and short. The long ones are 40 inches, and the short ones are 27 inches. The waves on the back of the long coat protrude even further than this spring, wider and more spacious, and the sleeves are cut from the entire piece of fabric, with cuffs added to the lantern sleeves, and the collar is even wider. Except for the slightly disproportionate length, it looks almost like a monastic robe from a pilgrimage to Putuo Mountain. In addition, this long coat has a unique feature: it does not use a single button, but instead is full of "decorative buttons" on the patch pockets, cuffs, and front. "Decorative buttons," as the name implies, are only for show, so they are shiny and crystal clear, with the beauty of diamonds and none of the vulgarity of mother-of-pearl. They are like stars dotted on the coat, enhancing its elegance.

Shoulder pads on short coats are reduced

The shoulder pads on short coats have gradually decreased this year, without the strange, rigid, and stiff appearance of the past. In addition, there is a butterfly knot on the front, a belt at the waist, short sleeves to the elbows, and the length of the coat stops at the ribs. A flowing line fully complements the lightness and softness of the season. The colors of short coats are mostly bright red, lake green, sky blue, silver gray, and beige. As the saying goes, "A red shirt and a black belt, a butterfly knot, a young woman is about to marry," which is really enough to make people yearn for.

Shawls have an elegant beauty

There is also a kind of shawl that will become the most popular clothing item this year. The form of the shawl is extremely simple, while the style is more dignified and luxurious than a short coat. Its characteristic is that the long sleeves are separated from the body and do not reveal the cuffs, and there are slits on the left and right sides of the front. If both hands are hidden in the sleeves, the line of the whole body can present a kind of hidden elegance. If both hands are freely extended outside the sleeves, the demeanor is more lively, and the dignified atmosphere is full of rich temptation. This kind of dress is most suitable for the dusk of early autumn, quiet and elegant, intoxicating, like the stunning elegance of a noblewoman admiring the world under thousands of lights.

Beige coat inlaid with otter fur

Last year's dark green coat inlaid with leopard fur was once very popular. This year, it is expected that a beige coat inlaid with otter fur will replace its position. In terms of style, it is no longer the two wide edges and cuffs of the front placket, but the form of a long coat with a front placket.

Recently, Shanghai's Hongxiang Company is designing and imitating two short coat styles from the American Ladies Tailor magazine. One is to add a square placket and decorative buttons to the upper part of the belt, and the other is to completely adopt the form of a Western suit jacket, with a scarf lined at the neck. The former can be used as everyday wear, light and generous, while the latter is most suitable for outings. In the clear autumn air and sunny weather, wearing a light coat and paddling a boat among the green hills and clear waters, there is infinite comfort and elegance.

A noble's dress is several years of a poor man's food

Autumn clothes are good, but the prices are not low. This year, each short coat costs more than 3 million, and each long coat costs more than 5 million. Those inlaid with fur are close to 10 million. If it is the transition from autumn to winter, a gray back coat will not be less than 40 million. "A noble's dress is several years of a poor man's food," we cannot help but feel "unable to leave" in the face of this reality.

The fashion industry's livelihood is bleak

It is said that before the war, fashion stores could sell more than 300 pieces a day, but now they sell less than one-tenth of that. Before the war, customers would order in advance, but now they almost all buy ready-made clothes. On the one hand, the shops are doing everything possible to accommodate customers, and on the other hand, customers are trying their best to accommodate their own financial resources. Therefore, fashion transactions often take place under this mutually contradictory psychology, and the bleak situation can be imagined.

Now, in Shanghai's fashion industry, the Ningbo and Pudong gangs are still constantly studying new clothing designs, and larger fashion stores have also specially hired experts stationed in France to provide new clothing information. More than 300 fashion stores and more than 4,000 fashion workers are still seriously making beauty and warmth for others. Although the business is sluggish, it brings some comfort and yearning to the general public of women.

### To Stop Armed Elections and Eliminate Clan Fights, Jiangxi Provincial Government Stipulates Eight New Measures

[Dispatch from Nanchang, August 29th, from our newspaper] The tragedy of clan fighting and cannibalism in Yugan has not yet ended, while clan fighting has risen again in the Liu and Peng families of Fenyi Pu Huang, Yichun, and Qingjiang Ruijin counties. In order to vigorously prevent clan fighting, the local police and security department posted a wide-ranging notice, stating that local tyrants who occupy a village are using ignorant and foolish people due to the lack of popular education, and instigating them to create a disaster of burning, killing, and looting over minor and irrelevant grievances. Currently, in the Mengshan mountain area bordering the three counties of Fenyi, Xinyu, and Yichun, corpses are lying everywhere and property is in ashes. Dozens of villages have been completely looted, and it will take more than a decade to restore them to their former state. It is even more tragic than the Japanese invasion. Chairman Wang yesterday issued a hand decree to all commissioners and county magistrates that if clan fighting occurs in their jurisdiction, they must strictly suppress it, and in fact, only the commissioner and county magistrate will be held accountable. Moreover, the general election is imminent, and local tyrants in various places are using evil forces as a weapon to compete for votes. For example, when selecting Bao representatives in Baijiaxu, Jingong, both sides set up machine guns, ready to fight to the death. There are countless other similar incidents. The authorities are paying close attention to this. The provincial government has strictly ordered that anyone who uses force to disrupt any election will be punished as clan fighting. (Correspondent Deng Guihua)

[Dispatch from Nanchang, August 30th, from our newspaper] Clan fighting in Yugan, Ruijin, Fenyi, Qingjiang, Xinyu, Shanggao, Yongxin, and other counties in Jiangxi Province is mostly for the sake of elections. In the democratic movement outside the county, a wave of enthusiasm has been unleashed. A township people's congress to elect Bao representatives or township representatives often turns into a factional struggle, with machine guns set up and mutual fighting. The competition for the general election is even more willing to involve neighboring counties. For example, in the "Battle of Shanggao," Fenyi and Xinyu were "allies" in that clan fight.

The occurrence of these clan fights is on the one hand due to the candidates using force to monopolize and control the elections. However, there are also cases of seeking revenge for minor grievances. Those who are fond of fighting intend to profit from it and incite clan fighting. There are also some unemployed soldiers who use the opportunity of clan fighting to do their arms business.

The Jiangxi Provincial Government has repeatedly tried to stop the evolution of clan fighting. Now, eight measures to prevent clan fighting have been drafted and have been preliminarily reviewed and approved by the provincial affairs meeting. The main measures are as follows: (1) Those who preside over and incite clan fighting will be severely punished in accordance with the General Mobilization Law. (2) Those who participate in clan fighting will be enlisted in the military in advance. (3) All weapons used for clan fighting will be confiscated. (4) Those who use force to encourage and incite the masses to disrupt any election will be treated as clan fighting. (5) Civilian weapons without licenses will be investigated and confiscated and will be punished as illegally possessing firearms. (6) Those who participate in clan fighting and commit murder and arson will be severely punished. (7) The heads of townships, Bao, and Jia who prepare for clan fighting and fail to report in advance, resulting in the brewing of clan fighting, will be severely punished. (8) Those who secretly report the location of weapons before the occurrence of clan fighting, leading to their seizure, will be rewarded generously. (Reporter Liu Zao)

### Escaping the Red Encirclement: Commissioner Zhao Arrives in Bian and Speaks of Anyang with Tears

[Dispatch from Kaifeng, August 30th, from our newspaper] Zhao Zhiting, the Commissioner of Anyang, and Qin Tingyu, the Magistrate of Anyang, who led the local people to defend the isolated city of Anyang for three months under the fierce encirclement of the communist bandits, have recently left Anyang and flown to Zhengzhou. Magistrate Qin Tingyu, who has made great contributions to the local area, has been invited by Chairman Liu to accompany him to supervise the war in western and southern Henan. Commissioner Zhao Zhiting, who is ill due to overwork, arrived in Bian yesterday and hosted reporters today to report on the situation in Anyang since the siege. He was moved to tears when he spoke of the tragic situation, and it was unbearable to listen to. It is said that Anyang has been under siege for three months and is still surrounded. There are no farmers within 15 li of the city, and the world beyond 15 li is the communist bandits' territory. The local situation is extremely tragic. Zhao, sweating and in pain, recounted in detail with tears in his eyes, which made the reporters feel saddened.

Prelude to the war: Commissioner Zhao arrived in Anyang on March 17th, took office on the 18th, and went to various places to inspect on the 21st to understand the people's plight and lay the foundation for governance. On the 27th, the situation in northern Henan became tense. He reported to his superiors on the one hand and ordered the county siege teams to prepare for battle on the other hand. On April 3rd, the communist bandits began to attack Laiyuan, and on the 6th, it was breached. The team led by Si Bingnan, with more than 1,000 men, was completely annihilated. On the 7th, the communist bandits attacked Dabao, and it was captured on the morning of the 9th. The first general team of the people's self-defense force, led by Cheng Daosheng, was completely sacrificed, and Cheng himself was captured. Chu Wangzhen was besieged on the 8th and fell on the night of the 10th. Zhang Longwen, the Magistrate of Neihuang County, heroically committed suicide, and more than 3,000 officers and soldiers of the first general team perished with him. The second general team of the people's self-defense force was stationed in the Liuyuan area and retreated, suffering only minor losses. Another group of bandits attacked Junxian on the 5th and solved the Hu Quanlu team. The team led by Deputy Commander Liu Lexian also retreated from Shuiye Xiqugou to Chengguan one after another. After capturing Tangyin on May 1st, they concentrated their efforts on besieging Cuijiaqiao. The Wang Ziquan team defending the area tried their best to repel the enemy, but after 21 days of fighting, their ammunition was exhausted and they were forced to break through. Cuijiaqiao fell into the hands of the bandits on May 6th. This was the prelude to the war, and the Anyang siege defense war immediately began.

The siege: The battles of Tangyin Cuijiaqiao and other places were only a prelude to the communist bandits' isolation and capture of Anyang. After the fall of Cuijiaqiao on the 6th, the communist bandits gradually gathered in the suburbs of Anyang City. However, in the prelude, more than 10,000 people were killed or injured, and their morale had invisibly declined. The communist bandits began to attack Anyang City on the 9th, first attacking the South Gate and then the East Gate. Many strongholds fell one after another. However, the most critical was on the night of the 13th, when a unit of communist bandits infiltrated the railway station and approached the West Gate. The defending military authorities and the Commissioner's Office simultaneously issued the strictest orders, stating that no matter whether they were national army or team, they must not abandon any strongholds, otherwise the officers would be executed. The military morale was greatly boosted, and the bandits failed. Our national army and team all had heroic performances worthy of praise. The bandits attacked from the southeast and west but failed, so they chose a weak point and attacked the Anyang Bridge in the north of Anyang City, where the second general team of the people's self-defense force, led by Guo Jingquan, was located. Commander Guo led the troops to fight the bandits hand-to-hand, and the bandits suffered unprecedented sacrifices, creating the most brilliant battle results. From then on, the bandits' offensive gradually eased. Later, as the national army in Jixian advanced north, the bandits stopped attacking Anyang on May 31st. According to the confession of the captured bandits, the communist army suffered at least 15,000 casualties in the attack on Anyang, possibly more than 20,000.

Tragic wartime situation: Those who have not been there cannot imagine the tragic situation in Anyang during the siege. During the siege, the sound of gunfire was like the tide of the Qiantang River, and bullets fell in the city like rain. Almost every house was destroyed, and there were deaths at all times. One morning, Commissioner Zhao found three stray bullets on his bed, which shows how dangerous it was. Although stray bullets could cause death at any time, there was still luck and misfortune. The real difficulty was the shortage of food. The amount stored in peacetime was only enough for a few days. If necessary, everything was exhausted, but it was still not enough. But our team could not go without food for a day. Under the persuasion of all sectors of society, all residents were willing to donate their only food to the defending army, even if they themselves did not eat. At that time, the people of the whole city could be described as "one-tenth human, nine-tenths ghost"! Commissioner Zhao witnessed the tragic situation and resolutely reorganized the team, eliminating the weak and reducing the team from more than 20,000 to more than 7,000 according to the principle of one gun per person, in order to save expenses. However, the problem still could not be solved. Later, the air force dropped food, and the people, unable to endure hunger, picked it up and ate it regardless of whether it was cooked, raw, or dirty. The most people were killed by being hit by the food, reaching 39 in one day. The food panic can be seen. However, at the beginning of July, rumors of the withdrawal of the national army from Anyang spread widely, and the people panicked as if the end was near.

Factors of victory: Anyang was able to stand firm under Liu Bocheng's all-out attack, which must be attributed to the bravery and skill of the defending army, but the fact that the people of Anyang had a common hatred for the enemy and were united in their hearts, contributing their lives and property, was also an important factor of victory. Other factors such as the frequent assistance of the air force, and the construction of strong fortifications according to the principle that brick bunkers are not as good as mud bunkers and high bunkers are not as good as low bunkers, were all factors of victory. Commissioner Zhao then introduced the styles of the leaders of the Anyang team, Wang Ziquan, Liu Lexian, Guo Jingquan, and Cheng Daosheng. He said: Their styles may be different, but their spirit of defending their hometown and fighting bravely is the same.

Urgent hope: The situation in Anyang is still difficult due to the successive disasters of war and natural disasters. Autumn crops have not been sown within 15 li of Bincheng, trees have been felled, and houses have been demolished. The once heavenly famous city has become a hell on earth. If Anyang is not defended, then the area north of the Yellow River will no longer be ours. Even Qing, Xu, Huai, Hai, Xiang, Yun, Jing, and Han will be difficult to preserve. The Chinese people should open their eyes wider, face this serious problem squarely, and unite to provide relief, quickly air transport and store a large amount of military food, otherwise, if it is not defended, 500,000 residents of the isolated city, including the elite talents of northern Henan and southern Hebei, will all be dragged to death under the bandits' "rooting out struggle." The local government is indeed unable to bear the burden of the team's supplies, and it can no longer be blamed on the local government. We can no longer begrudge a small amount of money and accelerate the death of the people of Anyang. We cannot treat the people of Anyang as the people of Yue treated the people of Qin, indifferent to their wealth or poverty. All sectors of society should immediately call for the speedy deployment of a large army to relieve the siege. (Special correspondent Shoumei)

### Multiple Kidnapping and Murder Cases in Recent Days: The Bandit Atmosphere in Yicheng Awaits Pacification

It is now known that Wu Guoliang, the Deputy Head of Dongshu Township in Heqiao, led two guards to visit homes one after another on the 31st. On the way, they encountered six bandits who opened fire on Wu Township Head. The two guards were immediately killed, and Wu Township Head was shot three times, and his life is in danger. Furthermore, Pan Maopei, the Bao head of the Fifth Bao of Yingshan Township in the Xiaohou District, was suddenly visited by four bandits at 10:00 PM on the 31st, who forcibly collected public grain.

Magistrate Li has reported and prepared a detailed plan to launch a full-scale suppression to pacify the area.

[Dispatch from Jiangyin, 2nd of our newspaper] The bandit atmosphere in the four rural areas of Cheng County is uneasy.

### Motor Sailing Ship, Pirate's Nest: Fifth Robbery Case Exposed in Dinghai, Gang Members Captured

[Dispatch from Ningbo, 1st of our newspaper] On August 27th, the Dinghai Police Guard Squad seized a motor sailing ship at Cen Port Pier. There was only one man and one woman on board. Under questioning, the man's name was Yue Jinxian, who worked as a cook on the ship, and the woman, Ms. Lu, was a local prostitute. Five rifles without gun licenses were found on the ship. According to Yue Jinxian, "The ship has been moored here for eight or nine days because it is damaged, and the rest of the people have gone to the city to handle goods." The rest of his words were vague. Captain Zhong suspected that they were bandits and took the two suspects, Yue and Lu, to the county. When they reached the territory of Kenhe Township, eight li away from Tuocheng (it was already 6:00 PM), a rickshaw drove towards them, with a woman passenger and three strong men following behind. He ordered them to stop and inspected them, finding a pistol under the rickshaw seat. After strict questioning, (the passenger was the daughter of the captured Ms. Lu, who was also a prostitute) and a man named Shi Xiufeng, (the names of the other two men were unknown, all were from Nantong.) were all partners of the motor sailing ship moored at Cen Port. They also confessed that "There are many more people living in hotels in the city." Captain Zhong then detained these four people and brought them back to the county government together. After inspecting the hotels, they successively found Ye Shouqing, Yan Zhongchen, Zhang Miaoen, Zhou Shuqun, Bao Jintao, Chen Yunhang and other six people in the Doutou Shunji Hotel and the Xijie New Inn, and a pistol was found on Zhang Miaoheng. At that time, when inspecting the Shunji Hotel, a Cai Yongqing escaped by jumping out of the window. The inspectors believed that Wang Axian, the owner of the hotel, was harboring bandits and was also brought to justice for questioning. According to the confession of the captured bandits, the ringleader's name is Jiang Haishan, and another bandit's name is Wei Guangchang (at large). In the first time, they robbed yellow croakers in early May of the lunar calendar and transported them to Nantong to sell them, earning more than 30 million yuan, which they exchanged for Nantong cloth and transported back to the Shenjiamen ×× line for sale. They used this money to buy five 79 rifles in Shenjiamen. The second time, they robbed yellow croakers and transported them to Lvsi Port near Nantong. Because the area was a bandit area, Shanweng Shiyao came forward to sell them, earning more than 30 million yuan, which Weng absconded with. The third time, they robbed matches from Shanghai and transported them to Shenjiamen to sell. The fourth time, they robbed 90 dan of raw oil and vermicelli at the Yangtze River Estuary, earning about 100 million yuan. The fifth time (this time) they robbed 50 dan of raw oil and six cans of gasoline, with five more cans still on the motor sailing ship.

Yarn Prices Fall Back

　　The yarn market yesterday initially opened with slightly looser silver roots, and the demand from local customers was active, and buyers pulled up prices, and the market was once bullish. Subsequently, because Fangjian Company opened sales of fine yarn, and the quoted prices continued to decrease, and the foreign exchange market quoted small, people's hearts suddenly became flat, and shouting prices also fell back. As a result, the price of fine yarn fell back by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared with the previous day, while coarse yarn rose by 120,000 yuan.

Longs Take Profits and Exit, Chinese Stocks Weaken Near Close

　　Chinese stocks rose sharply yesterday, and the long profit-takers in No. 223 first came out of the market. The lower US dollar market price made those holding long positions in No. 224 and others unwilling to stay, and the situation changed suddenly and quickly fell, closing at a low price. The situation in the cold stocks was unique. Commerce had the strong capital of No. 177, vigorously purchasing more than 400 shares and standing alone on the limit. Jinglun was sold by No. 61, and once fell to the limit. The rest also saw both rises and falls.

Although Xinguang was absorbed by Nos. 204 and 117, and there was news of an increase in capital with three shares given for every three shares subscribed, it was still profitable, but it was powerless to cheer up. Jinglun was supplied by No. 61, and once fell to the limit.

　　At 10:40, Commerce was raised to the limit by Nos. 177 and 55. Nos. 218 and 235 were still accepting and slightly rising. However, No. 224 closed again and again, and No. 86 and others were selling. Although there were Nos. 116 and 225 absorbing, it still felt powerless. No. 218 also exited after entering, and Guanzai once called for a price limit in the chaos, although no transaction was made. At the noon close, Yongsha retreated to the price of 241 yuan and 242 yuan to close, and the shouting price after the close was flat and weak.

Production and Sales Joint Company Ships Cotton Textiles
　　80 Boxes of Towels, Handkerchiefs, etc.

　　After the establishment of the Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Company, which was jointly formed by more than 70 manufacturers in the city, no effort was spared to promote the export of cotton textiles and assist the replica industry in increasing production. It is reported that in addition to introducing overseas merchants to purchase directly from manufacturers, the first batch of exports to Southeast Asia will be shipped out by ship within days, totaling 80 boxes of cotton textiles, mainly towels, handkerchiefs, and socks. It is said that this export is a trial, because sales channels in Southeast Asia have been interrupted for nearly ten years, and there is no certainty about the required patterns, so the goods are only shipped to Hong Kong, and then shipped to various parts of Southeast Asia by overseas merchants. As for increasing the production of cotton textiles, the company has applied to the government for loans, and the loan amount is expected to be based on 3,600 pieces of cotton yarn.

Spot Cotton Trading is Booming

　　[A female reader from Songjiang asks] I am a poor person who may lose the opportunity to study at any time. Although I was admitted to Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Girls' High School this semester, and the school is about to start, my tuition fees are still not settled. Yesterday, I received a payment notice from the school, which did not include tuition fees, but the items were quite numerous, including an item for "collected living subsidy for teachers and staff of 200,000 yuan." Is this a mandatory payment, and can those from poor families be exempted from payment? Given my current situation, can I apply for a scholarship from the Poor Student Scholarship Committee in this city? Please answer, sir.

　　[Answer] (1) Whether the teacher's living allowance can be waived should be determined by the school. (2) Only students in private middle schools in this city can apply to the school.

BaobJia Heads and Others Speak Out Righteously
　　Appeal for Relief for Orphans and Widows

Qian Jindao and Her Three Children Drift Around and Endure Human Suffering

　　Dear Editor,

　　Qian Jindao, a resident of our Bao, her husband, Mr. Qian, served in the Sichuan Provincial Highway Bureau before the war. During the war, he followed the bureau's orders to rush to transport supplies. Even under the enemy's crazy bombing, he never left his post without authorization, resulting in accumulated labor and illness, and eventually he passed away. Mr. Qian's life was extremely poor during his lifetime, and he left nothing behind him. Dao Xin carried her orphans and raised them, drifting around, hoping to return to her hometown in Beiping. She begged for food along the way, enduring the hardships of the world. In March of this year, Dao Xin came to Shanghai with her brother-in-law, but unexpectedly, her brother-in-law suddenly died of cerebral hemorrhage in June of this year, and Dao Xin's life fell into an even more desperate situation. In a last resort, she sent her three children to an orphanage for foster care, and she herself washed her face with tears day and night. There is no greater tragedy in the world than this. Jianzhen and others witnessed this situation and could not sit idly by. Therefore, we specially send a letter to your newspaper, hoping that you will publish the original letter to appeal to the public to generously donate and rescue Dao Xin and her four children from the fire and water. Everyone has a heart of compassion, who can stand by and watch them die? We send this to wish you peace, 17th District, 9th Bao Head Quan Jianzhen, He Heming, Xia Hongsheng, Shen Zhenxing, Gu Zihua.

(If you would like to donate, please send to Qian Jindao, No. 16 Anji Lane, Jixiang Street, North Sichuan Road)

Publishing Circle Weekly Educational Psychology
Hu Shuyi

(Edited by Zhang Zhongyou, published in July 1947, Yuying Middle School, No. 4, Ju Garden, Lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai, general sales, price: 1.44 yuan)

This review is edited in accordance with the "Teacher Training School Curriculum Standards" promulgated by the Ministry of Education and can be used as a textbook for educational psychology in teacher training schools. The book is divided into four parts: Part 1, Introduction; Part 2, Child Psychology; Part 3, Learning Psychology; Part 4, Subject Psychology. Part 1 has fewer pages; Part 2 discusses children's physical and mental development, individual differences, and the education of special children; Part 3 continues to discuss learning and learning laws, learning progress, memory and forgetting, learning transfer, and learning guidance; Part 4 discusses the subject psychology of subjects such as Chinese language, calligraphy, arithmetic, nature, history, and geography. Overall, the book covers all areas of educational psychology. What is particularly valuable is that the materials collected in Part 2 are all experimental conclusions from various sources that have been carefully organized, which can be regarded as a summary of the achievements of educational psychology research by Chinese people in the past 20 years. Part 4, Subject Psychology, is concise and helpful to teachers. The writer has carefully read this book and believes that it is indeed a rare textbook in the recent publishing world. Its advantages can be summarized into the following two points:

First, it is easy to teach and easy to learn, which is the greatest advantage of this book. The reasons why it is easy to teach and easy to learn are roughly three: (1) Educational psychology is not originally unique to our country, so most of its materials are translated from Western books. Translated texts tend to be obscure and difficult to recite. However, this book is compiled by the editor who integrates Chinese and Western materials, using his fluent writing skills to rewrite it. Therefore, there are no textual difficulties when reciting. (2) Most educational psychology editors do not have specialized psychological literacy, but they lack classroom experience. They build cars behind closed doors, and it is difficult to find a match when they go out. Even if the editor uses his own textbook to teach himself, endless difficulties will arise in the classroom. However, this book is compiled and revised by the editor based on his research experience and years of teaching experience in actual teaching. Therefore, all points that are considered difficult in teaching have been eliminated. This is the second reason why it is easy to teach and easy to learn. (3) The content of this book focuses on practicality. In terms of theory, it strives to be simple. When encountering difficult points, it often uses the inductive method to compile and describe, striving to be in-depth and clear, or uses many charts and examples for illustration. Charts and examples are tools for elaborating principles and sources of interest for scholars. The number of charts and examples in this book is more than any other textbook. The book has a total of 37 figures and 22 tables, and some of them were created by the editor himself.

Second, the materials are novel, which is the second advantage. The materials in this

### Tonight's Charity Volleyball Match: Zhenya vs. Yongsheng Again, Women's Interlude at 6:30 PM: Fuhua vs. Huayan

The Zhenya Volleyball Team from Beiping has come to Shanghai on an expedition and has won all four matches. With outstanding results, they originally planned to return north by ship, but at the request of the Municipal Gymnasium and the Volleyball Committee of the Sports Association, they will hold a charity volleyball match tonight at 7:30 PM against the Yongsheng Team for the second time. The ticket revenue, after deducting necessary expenses, will be entirely allocated to the relief of the flood disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi. The venue is still the gymnasium of the Municipal Gymnasium, and tickets are divided into two types: 5,000 yuan upstairs and 10,000 yuan downstairs. During the break, charity balls will be auctioned to increase donations. Before the match, a women's interlude will be added, with Fuhua facing Huayan. Reporters will be admitted with their press passes, and players will be admitted with their player passes. No complimentary tickets will be issued.

Zhenya and Yongsheng met for the first time, and the visiting team won 3-1. However, in that match, Yongsheng's main player, Xu Heng, injured his arm, and Huang Chaoqun had not returned from Beiping, resulting in the visiting team's victory. Today, for the sake of the flood victims in Guangdong and Guangxi, they will meet again. Yongsheng has recalled Huang Chaoqun, and Xu Heng has recovered from his injury and decided to play. Yang Jianting will still assist. With increased strength, Shanghai General Zheng Zhishen will still play for Zhenya, and Captain Qi Zengju has recovered from his illness. Tonight's match will undoubtedly be exciting.

The order is as follows:

Fuhua vs. Huayan (Women's) 6:30 PM Referees Yu Juju Wu Zibin

Zhenya vs. Yongsheng (Charity Match) 7:30 PM Referees Liu Hesheng Zhang Le
