### Balancing Revenue and Expenditure to Stabilize Prices and Balance Payments: Mr. Yu Hung-chun Explains Financial Policy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Senate held its fifth meeting on the morning of the 23rd to hear a financial report from Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun. The meeting began at 9:20 AM, chaired by Zhang Boling. 286 senators were registered for the day, with 191 in attendance. Mr. Yu's report lasted approximately one hour, followed by written and oral inquiries from Senator Gu. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. The sixth meeting convened at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to continue oral inquiries.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun, in his financial report to the Senate on the morning of the 23rd, stated that "the severity of the current financial and economic situation is undeniable and should not be concealed." He claimed that the most serious financial problem is the issue of prices. The government is currently making earnest efforts to achieve a balance, and a balanced budget will also contribute to price stability. Mr. Yu then elaborated on the current financial situation and future efforts, stating that defense spending will account for 21.4%, even less than last year. In the total budget of over 930 billion for this year, defense spending accounts for 36%, less than in the past, while spending on education and culture has increased. Mr. Yu then analyzed revenue and expenditure, believing that the tax revenue sector could still be reorganized, estimated to exceed the original budget by over 300 billion. U.S. dollar bonds could yield over 400 billion, and revaluation of enemy and puppet assets could add another 200 billion. Combined with the original planned revenue of 700 billion, total revenue could reach over 1,700 billion. On the expenditure side, a total of 500 billion has been spent in the past four months, and approximately over 1,200 billion will be needed for the next eight months, plus another 200 billion, bringing the total to over 2,000 billion, a difference of over 300 billion from the revenue of over 1,700 billion. The question of how to bridge this gap is said to be of concern to all parties. To bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance, the authorities are seeking solutions in difficult circumstances. In the future, greater efforts will be made in tax collection, striving for substantial increases, and institutions will also be adjusted. In addition, the aim is to establish creditworthiness, issue public bonds, and sell enemy and puppet materials and surplus materials to increase revenue. As for expenditure, the authorities have made the utmost determination to save on all non-urgent and non-constructive expenditures. With both increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, it should be possible to overcome the difficulties. Mr. Yu explained that finance should be self-reliant; therefore, even if foreign debt is incurred, it will be used to complete post-war reconstruction and accelerate domestic economic stability, and will not be used to balance the budget. He then analyzed the improvement of the tax system, adjustment of tax collection agencies, stabilization of finance, and the situation of local finances one by one, pointing out that currency reform is indeed the most effective way to stabilize finance. The Ministry of Finance has been studying this issue in detail for the past few months, but this matter is of great importance and a concrete decision cannot be made until the appropriate time.

### Yu Hung-chun's Financial Report

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun gave a financial report at the fifth general meeting of the Senate on the morning of the 23rd. The original text is as follows: The severity of the current financial and economic problems cannot be denied or concealed. We recognize that the most pressing financial and economic problem now is the issue of prices. Therefore, everyone feels that how to stabilize prices and how to balance the budget should be the two major goals that the government strives to achieve. There is a correlation between the two because balancing the national budget can reduce currency issuance, and prices can be stabilized as a result. On the other hand, price stability also helps to balance the budget because when prices are stable, revenue and expenditure are easier to control, making it easier to achieve balance. For the past year, colleagues in the Ministry of Finance have been working in various ways towards these two major goals. To achieve these goals, the application of financial policy has, on the one hand, cooperated with the needs of national economic development, improved the tax system, and measured the taxpayers' ability to bear the burden, expanding various possible sources of income. On the other hand, it has strengthened financial control and supervised the use of funds to assist in production and construction. At the same time, in addition to taxes, public bonds and materials policies are used to supplement income with social idle funds, international surplus economic power, and the sale prices of enemy and puppet properties. In addition, adjustments to institutions, reforms of financial administration, rectification of tax officials' discipline, and enrichment of local financial work have all been earnestly promoted. However, national financial revenue and expenditure are inevitably affected by domestic political and economic conditions. Since the government implemented policies to increase revenue, annual tax and business income has increased significantly. However, after the victory, although the government repeatedly strived for domestic peace and unification, it has not been realized. Traffic is blocked, production stagnates, and the economic enterprises on which finance depends are greatly affected. Tax sources are naturally difficult to replenish, and expenditures for post-war recovery and pacification remain an important part of expenditures. At the same time, production and construction are necessary steps to prosper the economy, especially in pacification areas, where they must be actively promoted. Expenditures are huge, and the national treasury's revenue and expenditure cannot be fully matched. At the same time, due to the government's intention to increase revenue, the burden on the people cannot be fully and reasonably adjusted, that is, the work of cultivating tax sources has not been fully addressed, the policy of economic and financial coordination has not had a significant effect, the people's living standards have not been improved in a timely manner, and some financial measures have not been freed from the wartime control color, which is not in line with the nature of peacetime finance. These are all things that should be continuously improved in the future. The above report is a general outline of the current financial situation. Now, a simple report will be made on the actual situation of finance and finance: (1) The situation of national treasury revenue and expenditure. The national treasury revenue and expenditure are reported in two stages, the 35th and 36th years. The total national budget for the 35th year listed the expenditure part as over 252.49 billion yuan. In the course of the year, the actual expenditure was over 556.72 billion yuan, exceeding the original budget by over 276.77 billion yuan. The off-budget expenditure accounted for approximately 49.7% of the total expenditure. As for the income side, tax revenue was higher, followed by property and material sales revenue, accounting for 35.52%. The remainder was made up of debt income, accounting for 64.48%. We reviewed the budget and found that the reason why there was still a large deficit was that the Anti-Japanese War had just ended that year, domestic order had not been restored, military expenditure, post-war rehabilitation and relief expenditure, and adjustment of living allowances for civil servants and improvement of soldiers' treatment were huge, all of which were off-budget expenditures, and there was no room for saving. Even so, the revenue and expenditure deficit for that year has been reduced to 64.48%, which is an improvement compared with the deficit of 90% in the 34th year, the deficit of 80% in the 30th year, and the deficit of over 75% in previous years. The total budget for this year lists revenue and expenditure at over 937 billion yuan each. In the revenue part, tax revenue ranks first, accounting for 38.5% of the total, followed by property and material sales revenue, accounting for 27.2%, followed by public business surplus revenue, accounting for 9.2%, followed by requisition of in-kind income, accounting for 2.3%, and other income, accounting for 1.2%. Most of them are normal national income, totaling over 720 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 78.5% of the total revenue, which is much higher than last year. The remainder is still listed as debt income, totaling over 205 billion yuan, accounting for only 21.4% of the total revenue. As for the expenditure part, although defense expenditure is still higher, accounting for approximately 36% of the total expenditure, the percentage of expenditure compared with previous years has been greatly reduced. Construction expenditure accounts for 17%, rehabilitation and relief expenditure accounts for 15%, and ordinary government expenditure accounts for 13%. In this year's expenditure, military expenditure has been reduced, and construction expenditure, education and cultural expenditure, and expenditure on subsidies to provinces and cities have been increased. The budget allocation is more reasonable than in any previous year, which can truly reflect the government's focus of governance, and the deficit between revenue and expenditure is only over 20%, which is also the year with the smallest percentage of budget deficit in history. Nearly five months have passed this year. From January to April, it was originally a slow time. According to the national treasury figures, the income was over 200 billion yuan, and the expenditure was over 500 billion yuan. According to current estimates, tax revenue this year can exceed the original budget by 300 billion yuan. Enemy and puppet assets and surplus materials can increase revenue by over 200 billion yuan due to changes in the foreign exchange rate. U.S. dollar bonds and treasury bills can yield over 480 billion yuan. Together with the original total revenue budget, it may reach 1,700 billion yuan. On the expenditure side, the original budget listed over 937 billion yuan, but the expenditure for pacifying localities, restoring transportation, helping victims, and adjusting the treatment of civil and military officials is huge. It is estimated that approximately over 1,200 billion yuan will still be needed to be spent from May to the end of the year, totaling approximately over 1,800 billion yuan, plus an additional 200 billion yuan for reserve funds, totaling 2,000 billion yuan. After deducting the income of 1,700 billion yuan, the shortfall is being properly raised from financial sources to make up for it. Gentlemen, you must be very concerned about how to make up for the revenue and expenditure deficit. Government colleagues are also working hard on this issue. Balancing revenue and expenditure cannot be achieved by empty words. Politics, economy, and finance are interconnected. The peaceful unification of the country is certainly the premise for all effective construction measures, but we cannot think that just because the political situation is unstable, we will not try our best to come up with more effective remedial measures. We must seek a way out in a difficult situation. Therefore, in order to bring the national treasury's revenue and expenditure closer to balance, first, we must make greater efforts in taxation, and truly increase the proportion of direct taxes, so that the wealthy class can contribute to the country's reconstruction. Indirect taxes and consumption taxes should focus on heavy taxation of luxury goods and non-essential goods. At the same time, adjust the collection agency, strictly control tax sources, simplify collection procedures, eliminate malpractices, and enrich tax revenue. Second, establish creditworthiness, promote the public bond policy, and accelerate the sale of (1) enemy and puppet industries, (2) surplus materials, and (3) production enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government. On the expenditure side, the government has made the greatest determination to save or stop all expenditures that are not urgently needed by the country and that are not conducive to production and construction enterprises. In addition, national finance should respond to self-reliance, but European countries after the war, such as the United Kingdom and France, have followed the path of international cooperation and obtained assistance internationally. China's eight-year war of resistance was a great and painful experience. In the past, it made great contributions to world peace. The rapid restoration of China's economic order was the common hope of all friendly countries, and it was also related to the safety and prosperity of the world. Therefore, it is planned to consult abroad at an appropriate time in order to obtain financial assistance. However, it should be especially pointed out here that the government will never rely on foreign debt to make up for the shortage of expenses. What is hoped is that this will be used to promote the completion of the country's important construction as soon as possible during the post-war recovery period and accelerate the stability of the domestic economy. (To be continued)

### Today's Agenda

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Senate will hold the seventh and eighth meetings on the 24th, with reports on agriculture, forestry, and transportation in the morning, and reports on military affairs and post-war relief in the afternoon.

### Chen Qitian Takes Office on Schedule

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The new Minister of Economic Affairs, Chen Qitian, is scheduled to take office at the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 29th, and will hand over to the former Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yunwu. Mr. Chen told reporters on the 23rd that he feels deeply responsible for taking office as Minister of Economic Affairs at a time when the domestic economic situation is quite serious, and hopes that people from all walks of life will give him instructions and assistance. Zhang Zizhu, Political Vice Minister of the ministry, and Zhu Shilong, Chief Secretary, will take office at the ministry on the 29th. Chang Ji-tooth is still in the United States and will be temporarily replaced by Liu Siying.

### Senators Question Finance, Focusing on Balancing the Budget

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] In the written and oral inquiries on finance raised at the Senate meetings on the 23rd, the issue of balancing the budget was given the most importance. Wu Wangji pointed out that if one wants to balance the budget, it is better to start with state-owned enterprises than to levy taxes. Are there any wasteful situations in public utilities such as postal and telecommunications, railways, and navigation? If so, how should they be rectified? All are worthy of attention.

### Issuance of Special Treasury Bills Should Be Carefully Considered

The issue of public bonds, which is linked to balancing the budget, is also a focus of questioning. Chen Yaodong believes that special short-term treasury bills can be issued, because this move can not only allow legal tender to return to the cage and contract currency, but also allow idle funds to be incorporated into the right track. Zhu Huiqing holds the opposite view. Zhu pointed out that the issuance of U.S. dollar bonds has not been successful. In the past month and a half, less than 5% has been sold. If this example is followed, it will only be sold out after three years. The main reason for the sluggish sales is that the country has lost its credibility. Therefore, the issuance of special short-term treasury bills should be carefully considered. Pan Chaoying also believes that if new bonds are to be issued, it is necessary to start with the reorganization of old debts, because all public bonds are the people's hard-earned money and should be reasonably repaid. Senators from the private sector are most concerned about taxes. Zhao Xuefeng believes that if tax revenue is to increase, merchants will face more difficulties. As a result, the national treasury's revenue and expenditure cannot be increased, but only enrich the intermediaries. Zhang Liangxiu cited the real situation in South China, explaining the necessity of eliminating corruption.

### Banks' Business Operations Often Exceed the Scope

Yin Shuxian and others expressed opinions on financial control, pointing out that the business operations of banks often exceed the scope, and even operate rice and coal, which should be restricted. Jiang Yiping and Wu Wangji also held the same view.

In addition, senators also raised questions about foreign exchange management, foreign exchange applications for overseas students, and paper for newspapers. More than 70 written and oral inquiries were raised successively.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Senate held its sixth meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 23rd, chaired by Lin Hu. Senators continued to conduct oral inquiries on the financial report, and Minister Yu gave oral answers on various points such as balancing the budget. Mr. Yu pointed out that taxation is the most stable and best way to increase national treasury revenue, because the country's expenditure is huge, and it would be very dangerous to rely entirely on issuance to make up for it. At the same time, issuing currency is equivalent to increasing the burden on the people, which is not as reasonable and fair as taxation.

### Use Direct Tax Methods to Restrict Wealthy Capital

Some people advocate dealing with the wealthy, but in fact, the wealthy do not have words written on their foreheads, and they are good at breaking up the whole into parts. It is better to restrict them by direct tax methods, because this tax is progressive in nature. The larger the property, the more tax is paid, which is very fair. Regarding balancing the budget, the government is making the greatest efforts to ensure that revenue and expenditure are close to balance, because the authorities know that one more banknote means one more danger. The authorities' efforts are still nothing more than reorganizing taxes and selling enemy and puppet materials to allow legal tender to return to the cage and find ways to eliminate corruption.

### Senate Gleanings

— Our reporter Yu Zhen

Minister Yu Hung-chun reported on finance to the Senate on the 23rd, and said at the outset: "Hung-chun is ordered to report to your meeting, and I am willing to conduct a practical review and state frankly the financial situation in the past year." His sincere attitude made him the most popular minister in recent days.

Minister Yu's report was a series of figures. Senators who were concerned about balancing revenue and expenditure listened and took notes, and also made calculations in preparation for raising questions.

Finance Minister Yu reported that a total of 300 tax officials had been dismissed and prosecuted in the past year for violating the law, corruption, and dereliction of duty. The number sounded alarming.

The issue of currency reform, which is of concern to all parties, was also mentioned in the financial report. Yu said that currency reform is the most effective way to stabilize finance, but this matter is of great importance and there cannot be a "concrete decision" until a "suitable time."

In a written inquiry, a senator considered some banks to be "bureaucratic capital's aerial fortresses."

Ye Suozhong and Shen Zhijing inquired about the future of the publishing industry due to financial problems. Shen Zhijing also pointed out that two people in the United Kingdom read one newspaper, and three people in the United States read one newspaper. He also said that this matter is related to culture. An colleague said: "Newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai are distributed at the meeting, and each senator reads at least five newspapers, which shows that the level of senators has increased."

Regarding the issue of whether to extend the time, Chairman Zhang Boling sought the opinions of the audience. Pan Chaoying said: "Each person's speaking time should be limited to five minutes, otherwise the Senate will not be able to finish its meeting in two or three months."

During oral inquiries, Yu Nanqiu said: "On the eve of the French Revolution, there were only six cents left in the national treasury. The government asked the nobles to take out money, but the nobles refused, and as a result, a revolution occurred. The nobles were the ones who suffered."

Pao Wu Chunwu asked, and Minister Yu said that he had not dealt with property due to technical difficulties. The Ministry of Finance has ways to deal with every grain of rice and every penny of the poor people in remote villages and deep mountains, but why is it difficult to investigate the wealth of the rich?

Chen Yaodong said that if currency and prices continue to run, the people will not be able to bear it. He advocated that extraordinary measures should be taken in extraordinary times, and effective measures should be taken against the powerful and privileged capital that endangers the national economy.

Zhao Shu, a representative from Yunnan, advocated publicizing financial figures. He said that if finance is not made public, it is enough for some people to stir up trouble.

Xue Mingjian, a representative from Wuxi, appeared in person to report on the results of running an industry in Wuxi. The conclusion was: "Only by running an industry can we solve all national crises." Wu Wangji criticized the financial sector for abandoning its proper business and engaging in speculation and profit-making, "making the financial sector fat and the people thin."

Some senators mentioned the issue of smuggling. Zhang Liangxiu reported on the situation in South China, saying that in Guangdong and other places, "smuggling" is done publicly, and as a result, it has become "official smuggling." These people came from the sky, so everyone gave them a nickname of "parachute unit."

Zhang also reported on the tax officials' corruption, saying: There is a saying in Guangdong called "three three three one." For a tax revenue, 30% is contributed to the superiors, 30% goes to the middlemen, 30% goes into private pockets, and the remaining 10% is paid to the government.

Xiao Yishan asked "three-dynasty veteran." Beijing is a cultural city, so why is so little newsprint allocated to it?

Zhou Qianchong believes that begging for a printing press is equivalent to suicide. A few months ago, a person whose salary could be worth 100 U.S. dollars could only be worth 30 or 40 U.S. dollars after several adjustments, which is not as good as the income of the hardest worker in the United States.

Many people cheered for Minister Yu. Zhang Qianhua hoped that the Ministry of Finance would show courage and hoped that Minister Yu would deal with the wealthy with the demeanor of a politician.

Minister Yu answered the senators' questions in ten points. He said "gentlemen" at least dozens of times in half an hour. Everything went smoothly all the way, but unexpectedly, in the last few minutes, a big wave was caused. Qian Gonglai and Huang Yuren got up to question several times, and the meeting was noisy. Regarding the fact that Director Dai of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance was often in Shanghai, Minister Yu pointed to the seat of the chief of the ministry and said, "Dai himself is here." When he spoke, he pointed to the seat of the chief, and the whole audience burst into laughter.

Minister Gu's report on food was read in one hour with a report of 20,000 to 30,000 words. An average of one or two hundred words per minute, no stenographer could record it. The reporters all put down their pens and rested. A senator asked in writing, hoping that Minister Gu would show his past style and kill a few field food officials.

### Senators Call for Peace and Will Submit Plans to the General Assembly Separately

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Zhang Boling has already stated in his opening remarks that the theme of this Senate meeting will be peace first. When questioning politics, the senators' questioning focuses on peace talks. However, because the General Assembly is still in the reporting stage, the cases have not yet been submitted. It is reported that the China Democratic League's peace plan can be finalized on the 23rd and submitted to the General Assembly on the 24th. Xu Deheng's proposed peace plan has not yet been drafted, and Zhou Binglin has decided not to come to the south. In addition, Senators Xiao Lai, Hu Qiuyuan, Zhu Huiqing, Wu Yunzhu, Xi Lun, Liu Qirui, Duanmu Kai, etc. also submitted a reasonable peace plan to the General Assembly. The main text is to call for peace, promote peace, and use the country to teach the country's life and death. The methods are: (1) This meeting calls on the government and the CCP to call for peace and requires both parties to immediately cease fire on the spot. (2) The Senate will form a Peace Promotion Association, send appropriate candidates to solicit peace opinions from both parties, and study fair and reasonable peace plans. (3) The Senate will solicit the consent of both parties on this plan and reopen peace talks. (4) Those who refuse to call for peace and refuse peace talks are those who are responsible for undermining peace. The Senate should call on the people to abandon them together. Mr. Yu once again solemnly stated that the Ministry of Finance will never balance the budget with foreign debt. Regarding currency reform, Yu said: The situations in the Northeast and Taiwan are both expedient measures, and they should be reorganized after a considerable period of time. As for the requisition of foreign deposits, diplomacy has not been successful, and the answer received is "restricted by law, unable to assist." Regarding this matter, the government has stipulated in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan that incentives and threats should be used to promote such funds to be used for production purposes. Some senators asked about subsidies for state-owned enterprises. Mr. Yu said that this was a last resort for the government and that the authorities were considering new methods. The authorities are also paying close attention to smuggling, because the black market for foreign exchange cannot be eliminated if smuggling is not eliminated one day. The government has ordered the customs to strictly prevent and send personnel to Hong Kong to find ways to repair this loophole.

### Regarding the Gold Rush Case, It Is Being Handled by the Court

Mr. Yu then answered questions about the gold case and the investigation into Yangtze and Zhongfu companies. Regarding the gold rush case, Mr. Yu replied simply that the matter is being handled by the court. Regarding the investigation of Yangtze and Zhongfu companies' purchase of refrigerators, Jeeps, and radios, Yu said that the Ministry of Finance was ordered to conduct the investigation jointly with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and is now responsible for instructing the customs to investigate. The Jeep imported by Zhongfu Company was shipped before April 29, 1946. It is believed that this case will be brought to light after a fair and thorough investigation. A senator asked whether the Governor of the Central Bank can concurrently serve as the chairman of other companies. Yu said that Yu had not heard that President Zhang had any such concurrent positions, and pointed out that the government had clearly ordered government officials not to run businesses concurrently. If there is such a situation, it should be dealt with according to law, but the President of the National Bank is not subject to the control of the Ministry of Finance. Yu replied to this point, and Huang Yuren continued to inquire about the affairs of Zhongfu and Yangtze companies, hoping to report to the Senate. Yu said that the Ministry of Finance was ordered to conduct a secret investigation. The information obtained should be reported to the government, which is a matter of course.

### The Ministry of Finance Has Investigated the Surplus Problem of China Textile

Mr. Yu also answered questions about the payment of the surplus of China Textile Company to the national treasury. According to reports, the company only paid a surplus of 80 billion last year. The Ministry of Finance went to investigate. China Textile initially refused, but it was later found that the total surplus was 368.2 billion. After deducting the public accumulation fund, there should also be more than 240 billion, but China Textile has its own explanation.

Huang Yuren stood up again and raised questions about Lin Fengbao's appointment as a member of the National Bank's accounting committee, asking why Lin was reappointed to his post before Lin's old case was cleared, and the person who bailed out Lin was Yu. Huang hoped that Yu would explain. Yu said that this matter can be inquired to the Judicial Yuan.

### The Atmosphere at the Meeting Was Once Tense, and the Chairman Announced a Break

Huang continued to inquire, and the atmosphere at the meeting was very tense. At this time, Yu had returned to his original seat. Soon after, the chairman announced a break, and a storm subsided. It was already 5:30. Senators questioned the Ministry of Finance.

### Insufficient Newspaper Imports: Tantamount to Crippling Democracy

Councilor Questions Ministry of Finance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding the problem of insufficient newsprint imports, Councilor Shen Zhijing spoke about this at the Fifth General Assembly on the 23rd, stating that the current foreign exchange control policy imposes harsh restrictions on foreign exchange for paper imports. The monthly approved paper import quota is not even enough for the newspaper industry in Shanghai alone, let alone allowing provinces and cities to enjoy a share. If the government is truly moving towards a democratic path, newspapers, especially local newspapers, are indispensable tools. However, the current policy direction is full of rhetoric about democracy, while the financial and economic policies are ruthlessly destroying public opinion, the vanguard of democracy. A statistic was seen in the newspapers that Americans have one newspaper for every three people, and Britons have one newspaper for every two people. Even India, outside the five major powers, has one newspaper for every two hundred people. May I ask how many people in China, one of the five major powers, have one newspaper? Please consider and calculate whether the Ministry of Finance should increase foreign exchange for paper imports or abolish restrictions.

### Food Situation in Various Regions: Authorities Decide to Adjust and Regulate; Gu Zhenglun Responds to Inquiries at the参政会

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] During the Sixth General Assembly of the 参政会 on the 23rd, after the financial report inquiry was completed and a ten-minute break was taken, Minister Gu Zhenglun reported on food administration, explaining eight points including land tax collection in kind and price stabilization. He then listened to more than thirty written and oral inquiries. The issues raised by the councilors mainly focused on rice shortages and collection in kind. Representatives from the north mentioned the severe food shortage in North China and hoped for a speedy relief effort. He Jihong pointed out that the wheat in North China was only two inches tall, making famine inevitable. Sun Shengwu strongly advocated for relief in North China, stating the people's food situation was dire and hoping for food shipments to provide assistance. Councilors from Jin and Min provinces also reported on the local food situation, hoping the authorities would pay attention. Gu responded, saying that the authorities were constantly paying attention to the food situation in North China and had decided to ship 100,000 bags of flour to Tianjin, with further shipments to follow. Fujian and Guangdong have always lacked food, and the authorities have decided that, apart from military supplies, they will find ways to adjust and regulate surplus grain. Gu finally stated that 200,000 tons of foreign rice were on their way, which would greatly help China's food problem. The meeting adjourned at 7:40 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding the food report, Zhang Deng'ao, Cai Chusheng, Wu Yunfang, and eight others made oral inquiries, asking: (1) The Northeast Special Commissioner of the Food Department was thoroughly investigated by the investigation team and found to have committed corruption. Why has the court not prosecuted him? (2) Rice grabbing is rampant in various places. What are the improvement measures? (3) The price set by the Food Department for purchasing grain in various places differs greatly from the market price, resulting in significant losses for farmers. How will the Food Department improve this? (4) How is the Central Grain Corporation, operated by the Food Department, doing? It should be made public. (5) The largest source of rice for this capital is Wuhu, but the Anhui Provincial Government authorities have banned rice exports, causing problems with the rice supply in this capital. Has the Food Department learned of this measure by the Anhui Provincial Government? Are the people of Anhui not Chinese, and is Nanjing not a part of China? Finally, Gu gave a brief answer, explaining the number of grains collected in various places. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Can Be Repaired Within the Year

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Councilors Wu Wangji and others recently proposed to the General Assembly that the government concentrate its efforts and repair the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as soon as possible to maintain transportation in Southeast China. According to people in the Ministry of Communications, the destruction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was due to banditry, material shortages, and insufficient funding. It is determined that it can be repaired within this year.

### Maxwood's Remarks

In the Future, Decisions Will Be Made According to Central Instructions

To Seek Welfare for the People of Xinjiang

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 22nd] The newly appointed Chairman of Xinjiang Province, Maxwood, told reporters on the 22nd: "It is unprecedented for the Central Government to govern Xinjiang Province with the people of Xinjiang, which makes me feel a deep sense of responsibility and also shows the Central Government's goodwill towards the border areas. This measure by the Central Government is in line with the demands of the people of Xinjiang. In the future, I will follow the instructions of the Central Government, respond to the demands of the local people, and strive to seek welfare for the people of Xinjiang under the principle of peace." The newly appointed Secretary-General Aysha said, "The task of the Secretary-General is extremely heavy, and I am quite apprehensive about this new appointment."

### The Democratic Socialist Party's Reformist Faction Holds Its First Central Standing Committee Meeting

[This newspaper report] The Reformist Faction of the Democratic Socialist Party held its first Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon, passing a declaration and a letter to party members, and discussing various issues after the establishment of the Reformist Faction. The declaration and the letter to party members will be published today, and a reception for the press will be held next Tuesday and Wednesday. According to Sun Shigang, "This is just a reform, not a split. The future relationship with the original Central Standing Committee will be decided by the National Congress."

### Postponement of Public Utility Price Increases

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] During the 233rd State Council meeting, the issue of subsidy policy was discussed. Minister of Communications Yu Dawei proposed that public utilities have accumulated heavy debts, and in order to reduce the expenditure of state subsidies, he suggested appropriately increasing prices. However, the proposal was not passed and was temporarily postponed.

### Third State Council Meeting Approves Supplementary Budgets for Various Agencies; Adjustment of Salaries for Civil and Military Personnel

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan Committee held its Third State Council meeting at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, presided over by Chairman Chiang himself. Committee members Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Zhangjia, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Yu Youren, Wu Zhongxin, Chen Bulei, Chang Naihui, Yu Jiaju, Ji Yiqiao, Chen Huide, and Wang Yunwu, totaling nineteen people, attended. Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, Chief of Civil Service Wu Dingchang, Chief of Military Affairs Xue Yue, and Comptroller-General Xu Kan were also present. First, Wang Shijie and Vice Minister of National Defense Liu Shiyi reported on the recent diplomatic and military situation on behalf of Minister Bai. The Civil Service Department reported that the second reserve funds listed in the 36th-year general budget for various agencies, school re-establishment expenditures, post-war relief funds, and provincial and municipal subsidies would remain as approved and be disbursed by the Executive Yuan.

The Communist forces are determined to take Changchun, so there will be a fierce battle at Changchun and Gongzhuling. The Communist forces are increasing a large number of reinforcements from the Fuyu area towards the area west of Changling, and the situation is very urgent. The 23rd was cloudy, with only transport planes constantly coming and going.

### Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Collect Rice in Southern Jiangsu; Provincial Government Orders Strict Prevention in Various Counties; Rice Prices in Wuxi and Suzhou Exceed 300,000

[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, Twenty-third] The recording of the Provincial Government recently approved a telegram from the Capital Garrison Command, stating that according to reports, Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu recently entrusted coastal merchants in Nantong and other areas to purchase large quantities of rice in southern Jiangsu at a high price of 280,000 yuan per stone (equivalent to 220,000 yuan per market stone), causing rice merchants in various places to directly transport exports to the north, affecting the rice reserves in Wuxi. It is now known that its northern transportation ports are located at the junction of Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Changshu, Nantong, and other counties. The Provincial Government has urgently telegraphed Zhenjiang and other counties to pay close attention and sent personnel to patrol the river crossings to stop it. Also, Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang telegraphed various county mayors again on the 23rd, instructing: (1) Local rice reserves must be cleared as much as possible to replenish rice sources. (2) The circulation of food within the province and transportation to Nanjing and Shanghai should be absolutely free and unobstructed.

### Food Prices in Beiping Continue to Rise

### Japanese Zaibatsu Industries Prioritized for Reparations; Far Eastern Commission Stipulates Procedures for Dismantling and Removing Factories

[United Press, Washington, Twenty-second] The Far Eastern Commission decided today to prioritize the industries of the Japanese Zaibatsu in the first of one thousand factories to be allocated for reparations. According to reliable sources, the Far Eastern Commission has stipulated the order in which these one thousand factories should be handed over to the Allied countries. The first to be dismantled and shipped are factories owned by the Zaibatsu, followed by factories owned by ordinary or private individuals; next are some factories owned by people from neutral countries, and the Japanese government will compensate the original owners for these neutral countries' properties; finally, some Allied countries' properties will be moved, and the Japanese government will also compensate the original owners. These procedures have been instructed to be executed by MacArthur.

### Japanese Concerned About Four-Power Joint Control

[United Press Tokyo, 23rd] Regarding China's proposal that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China jointly administer Japan for thirty years after the signing of a peace treaty, Japanese sources here and some officials at MacArthur's headquarters appear greatly alarmed. While the official side has not expressed an opinion, the Japanese are quite concerned. The United States' desire to include domestic foreign assets in reparations, which China opposes, is also causing unease among the Japanese. The Soviet Union's insistence on treating Japanese assets in the Northeast as war spoils has also diminished the recent hope among the Japanese that the reparations issue might gradually be resolved. Most of Japan's key industrial assets are in China and the Northeast. If these assets are excluded and then distributed, Japan will be unable to meet its reparations obligations. The Japanese government anticipates that after the peace treaty is concluded, Japan will be subject to some form of international joint control.

### Ms. Yang Yunzhu Arrives in America and Speaks

MacArthur's proposal to restore Japanese trade is interpreted by some as being done before the peace treaty is drafted, but in the case of Germany, no such proposal was made. For the sake of economic efficiency, the Japanese people still need to improve their rationing system. The success of the occupation policy seems to be generally recognized.

### Full Text of Zhang Qun's Report, Continued from Yesterday's First Edition, Finances and Economy

The current financial and economic situation in China can be described as very serious. Although we can call ourselves an agricultural country, even before the war, China was not a self-sufficient country in terms of food and clothing. Rice, wheat, and cotton all required some degree of imports. As a result of the eight-year war against Japan, our losses, according to preliminary estimates by the Reparations Commission of this Yuan, amount to approximately US$33.1 billion in direct losses, US$20.4 billion in indirect losses, and US$4.1 billion in war expenses. The losses in the northeastern provinces and the areas occupied by the Communists have not yet been estimated. After the war ended, due to domestic division and unrest, domestic production continued to shrink, prices continued to rise, transportation was disrupted everywhere, and people's lives were difficult. This desolate economy naturally reflected on the finances. The total national revenue and expenditure budget for this year has already been submitted to the Resident Committee of your esteemed assembly for preliminary review. The original expenditure budget was over 930 billion, but due to the continued rise in prices, the average monthly overspending by the end of April this year was 900 billion yuan. Based on this figure, it is possible that it will reach 20 trillion by the end of this year. On the revenue side, the income is listed at over 730 billion yuan. Even if the tariff revenue increases due to foreign exchange rate adjustments, it may increase to 10 trillion yuan according to current estimates. Adding the US dollar bonds and US dollar treasury bills issued this year, totaling 400 million (approximately 4.8 trillion in legal currency), it is still a large deficit compared to the expenditure. It relies on the handling of state-owned enterprises and surplus goods to make up for it. If prices rise further, the deficit will increase even more. The current financial and economic illnesses can be said to be mutually causative. It is really difficult to increase revenue, reduce expenditure, and balance the budget. However, under these circumstances, no matter what, the government's approach to finance is to try to increase revenue as much as possible on the one hand, and to save expenditure as much as possible on the other. All the money that can be saved is saved as much as possible, and all non-urgent and non-fundamental construction projects are eliminated as much as possible, using all our strength and determination to gradually balance the budget. In the emergency economic measures announced at the beginning of February this year, the first method proposed was to balance the budget, which shows its importance. Because economic stability, social stability, political progress, and construction can only be carried out by starting with a balanced budget. If it cannot be achieved immediately, we should also strive to reduce the difference between income and expenditure in the budget. Only in this way can we control the issuance of currency, stabilize the currency value, and lay the foundation for the fundamental reorganization of the currency system. (To be continued)

Editorial

### Our Country's Attitude Towards the Japanese Reparations Issue

Yesterday, Foreign Minister Wang, in his foreign policy report to the National Political Council, reiterated our country's basic attitude towards the Japanese reparations issue. He stated: "Regarding the Japanese reparations issue, we should seek a solution based on the demands of justice and fairness. The standard of living allowed to the Japanese people in the future by the Allied nations should also be determined in accordance with this principle. China has resisted for the longest time and has suffered the greatest losses. According to any fair standard, China should receive the largest proportion of the total Japanese reparations." At the same time, Foreign Minister Wang also expressed the hope that this reparations issue can be resolved reasonably and fairly as soon as possible. In fact, at present, countries such as Britain and the United States all hope to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

When the British House of Commons discussed the current foreign policy on the 16th, Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed particular concern about Britain's interests in the Far East, and said that Britain hopes to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, and Australia and Canada are particularly concerned about this. As for the United States, Secretary of State Marshall considered how to draft the peace treaty with Japan after returning from Moscow. Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces MacArthur has also repeatedly called for accelerating the work of concluding a peace treaty with Japan. However, among this series of Japanese issues, the most important link is the Japanese reparations issue, which is the core of the peace treaty with Japan. Without resolving this issue, the peace treaty will not be easy to draft successfully. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall convened the Far Eastern Commission on May 5 to listen to the opinions of the representatives of eleven countries to determine the percentage of distribution of Japanese reparations, so as to achieve a partial solution to this complex issue. However, the Australian representative insisted that the reparations issue should be resolved by the peace conference with Japan, so the Far Eastern Commission adjourned without results. Later, the Soviet Union also stated its position, advocating that reparations should be extracted from Japan's current production, making the stalemate on the reparations issue even more difficult to break.

However, the US State Department is still trying its best to break the deadlock on the Allied nations' demands for reparations from Japan. Therefore, after the Far Eastern Commission adjourned without results, it continued to meet in the past week and has reached agreement on three points: (1) All Japanese liquid assets should be used first to pay for US occupation expenses and relief expenses; (2) The removal of reparations materials should not hinder the minimum standard of living for the Japanese people based on 1934; (3) The proportion of reparations demanded by each country should be based on the standard of its actual losses and its contributions, and this should be used as the basis for future discussions. Can this effort by the United States break the deadlock? At least for now, it is still a serious question. Even the representatives of various countries attending the meeting are not too optimistic and unanimously believe that it will take several months to reach an agreement. However, the repeated delays and unresolved resolution of this issue will affect China the most. Today's China not only hopes that the Far East will achieve lasting peace as soon as possible, but also urgently needs to obtain reparations materials from Japan. Therefore, we cannot ignore this issue.

First, regarding the issue of the percentage of Allied nations' distribution of Japanese reparations, our government has already issued a statement: "Our country has resisted for the longest time and has suffered the greatest losses. China should enjoy a preferential ratio and priority of compensation for Japan's reparations to the Allied nations." This statement can be described as justified and forceful, so that the Allied nations cannot but express their approval. From the July 7th Incident to the end of the victory in the War of Resistance, the total loss of public and private materials was no less than US$300 billion, not including the deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians and the expenditure of national military expenses. Now, after our country has suffered great trauma and is engaged in post-war reconstruction, whether in terms of materials or economics, we need foreign assistance. It is reasonable to demand priority compensation and a preferential ratio from Japan. Wu Bannong, head of our reparations group stationed in Japan, stated in Osaka on May 10: "China hopes to extract reparations from Japan's current production. China needs to obtain materials that can be used immediately from Japan. China also hopes to obtain all daily necessities immediately as part of the reparations China should receive, such as cloth, locomotive heads, steel rails, and other materials that Japanese factories can produce." This passage can represent the true attitude of the Chinese government. However, our representative stationed in Japan has always been in a passive position, and the opinions of our delegation have not been valued by all parties. Therefore, we have to request the government to negotiate with MacArthur's headquarters, especially for the following two things, we must argue with reason: (1) Japan requested MacArthur's headquarters to reduce the number of reparations that would first be allocated to China, the Philippines, and other countries; (2) It is heard that the new US plan stipulates the ratio of each country, with the United States accounting for 31%, China accounting for 27%, and other countries totaling 39%.

The second issue is that the United States and the Soviet Union have completely different opinions on the Japanese reparations issue. Our country should adopt a detached attitude. No matter what the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are, our attitude should always be based on our own interests. For example, the Soviet Union moved all the industrial equipment in the Northeast, with a total value of more than US$20 billion. In the Soviet Union's view, this is the Soviet Union's "war spoils" and cannot be regarded as Japanese reparations. It opposes deducting it from the reparations it should receive. The United States insists that the industrial equipment in the Northeast is Japanese assets and can be used for reparations, and should be deducted from the reparations that the Soviet Union should receive. Our country has already expressed a clear attitude towards this issue. When the Soviet Union moved the industrial equipment in the Northeast, a patriotic movement to protect rights occurred in our country, protesting against the Soviet Union's actions. In the future, when discussing this issue, our country should still maintain its original position. For example, on the issue of extracting reparations from Japan's current production, in order to reduce its occupation burden, the United States not only opposes extracting reparations from Japan's current production, but also advocates raising Japan's industrial production level from 1928 to the 1934 standard. The Soviet Union firmly opposes the US proposal and has repeatedly accused the US authorities of condoning Japan economically, and that the defeated country will soon become a prosperous paradise. Regarding this issue, on the one hand, our country urgently needs Japanese reparations and naturally supports extracting reparations from Japan's current production. At the same time, our country will never allow Japan to maintain a high level of industrial development, so that our country will still be economically oppressed by Japan. We believe that President Truman's reparations commissioner Pauley's proposal to restore Japan's industrial production level to the 1928 standard is the most reasonable. For the sake of our country's security and the lasting peace of the Far East, our delegation must argue with reason and not stop until the goal is achieved.

In short, the issue of Japanese reparations is not only the core of the peace treaty with Japan, but also the security of the Far East and is closely related to our country. Our delegation should broaden its horizons and, on the one hand, argue with reason, so that all countries respect our country's demands for reparations, so that our country's due interests are not subject to any major losses. On the other hand, it should also use its skills to harmonize the opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union, so that this issue can be resolved reasonably and fairly as soon as possible.

### With the Unanimous Support of the Four Major Parties, Tetsu Katayama Elected Prime Minister; New Cabinet Lineup Expected to Be Decided Next Week

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 7:00 PM on the 23rd to elect the prime minister by roll call. As a result, Tetsu Katayama received 420 votes out of 426 and was elected as the first Japanese prime minister after the new constitution. The Senate then convened at 7:37 PM to elect the prime minister. The voting result was that Katayama received 205 votes out of 207 and was elected. The meeting adjourned at 8:05 PM. Katayama, who is now 59 years old and a native of Wakayama, graduated from the Third High School and then entered Tokyo Imperial University. In 1891, he graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University. Afterwards, he practiced law in this county. In 1898, he went to Tokyo and set up a law firm at the YMCA. From this time on, he devoted himself to social movements. In 1900, he served as a legal advisor to the General Federation. In 1906, the Social People's Party was established, and he served as its secretary-general. Later, he served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Social Masses Party. During the war, he lived in the countryside, immersing himself in reading and writing. In November 1945, he served as the secretary-general of the Japanese Socialist Party. In September of last year, he became the chairman of the Executive Committee. After the Socialist Party obtained the status of the first party this time, the elder of the Socialist Party, Anehiko, praised Katayama as the most suitable candidate for prime minister in Japan today.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Ten minutes after being elected as the new prime minister, Tetsu Katayama issued a statement saying: "Today, I was unanimously elected as prime minister by the entire parliament, for which I am extremely grateful. In order to overcome the crisis of the Japanese nation and build a new Japan, I will do my best with utmost sincerity."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] After being formally appointed as prime minister on the 24th, Tetsu Katayama will ask the presidents of various parties to cooperate in forming a cabinet, and will convene the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party at noon to determine the future cabinet formation policy. It is planned to use the prime minister's official residence as the cabinet formation headquarters. The cabinet formation work will officially begin on the 26th, and will be carried out in accordance with the established policy agreement and the joint policy of the four parties: Social, Democratic, Liberal, and National Cooperative. As for the left-wing problem raised by the Liberal Party, it will also be decided according to the party's own views. It is generally expected that the entire list of cabinet members can be decided around the 28th.

### The Democratic Party's Attitude is Ambiguous, and the New Cabinet is Fraught with Crises

[International News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Although the four major Japanese political parties successfully elected Katayama as prime minister, according to people here who are familiar with the political situation, there are still great difficulties ahead in forming a cabinet. Although the Liberal Party has repeatedly expressed its support for Katayama, it is difficult to expect it to cooperate with the Socialist Party in any way today, when it has let other parties take over the positions of speaker and vice-speaker and has to move towards the status of an opposition party. As for the Democratic Party, although it changed its original intention at today's four-party talks and took the lead in suggesting that the prime minister should cede to Katayama, it emphasized that it must be conditional on the formation of a four-party cabinet. Its intention is probably nothing more than to realize that the Liberal Party has no intention of forming a cabinet and to shirk the responsibility for failing to organize a four-party cabinet to the Socialist Party, and to criticize Katayama for being unable to complete the four-party united cabinet to save the country, in order to achieve its own certain attempt. Therefore, as a result, the Socialist Party will be forced to take the path of forming a cabinet with the Social National Cooperative Party. However, judging from the current political situation, it is feared that forming a cabinet by only two parties will be difficult to achieve.

### The United States Attaches Importance to the World Economic Issue

[United Press Washington, 23rd] US government economic experts, who had hoped that Congress and the public would accept the plan to lend and aid several countries with billions of dollars, said today that they were extremely pleased because some of the government's fiercest political opponents also attached importance to the world economic issue. They also carefully studied the ten-year foreign economic plan of Stetson, the Republican presidential candidate. Although economic experts do not agree with Wallace's fierce criticism of the Truman Doctrine, they privately admit that Wallace's continuous discussion of the world economic issue and the issue of American responsibility has been very helpful to them in gaining public support for the government's global economic plan. The number of plans to solve the world economic issue has increased in quantity in the past few days. The government economic experts believe that what is satisfactory is that although the various plans to solve the world economic issue differ in principle and detail, they all recognize that this issue does exist and that the United States should play an important role in solving it.

### Economic Concentration in the United States Poses a Serious Threat

[French News Agency Washington, 22nd] The unprecedented phenomenon of the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few industries in the United States after the war has now aroused the vigilance of some congressmen and President Truman's economic advisors. A generation of economic advisors believes that this phenomenon is a serious threat to the American way of life and small private enterprises. President Truman had previously requested Congress in February to study new anti-trust legislation to curb its development. The conclusions of the Senate Special Committee's research on small private enterprise problems also believe that the concentration of production power in the hands of large industries is a terrible problem for the country's future.

### The British Cabinet's New Plan Has Been Delivered to Indian Leaders

[United Press New Delhi, 23rd] According to reliable sources, Nehru has received the British Cabinet's new plan to hand over power to India, which predicts that if Indian leaders cannot accept the British Cabinet's original plan, three committees should be organized to divide the boundaries, allocate national assets, and handle the national defense army. It is reported that the plan has also been submitted to the Allied leader Jinnah and Defense Minister Singh. According to well-informed sources, the National Congress Party has expressed its willingness to accept the British Cabinet's recommendations, while Jinnah is unwilling to accept them under any circumstances.

[Reuters London, 22nd] Related parties expect the development of the Indian issue to follow the following four stages: (1) Indian leaders decide on unification or division; (2) Assuming that a decision is made to divide, the Indian Governor-General will convene Indian leaders to propose a plan under the division that satisfies all major ethnic groups. The Indian Governor-General may suggest convening a constitutional conference of the Allied nations to obtain the democratic expression of the representatives of the Muslims; (3) Assuming that the leaders agree with this suggestion, the opinions of the representatives of all ethnic groups in India can be obtained in a short period of time. Britain expects this period to be no more than two or three months; (4) Convene a meeting of the highest leaders of India to give final approval to the Indian plan based on the response of the two major constitutional conferences.

### The World Monetary Fund Loans to France and the Netherlands

### The United States' Policy Towards Korea Remains Unchanged, and it is Determined to Abide by the Moscow Agreement

[United Press Washington, 23rd] A State Department spokesman reiterated today that the United States will work with the Soviet Union to assist Korea in establishing a unified and democratic provisional government, and has notified Lieutenant General Hodge, the US military governor of South Korea, that the US government still maintains a firm policy of fulfilling the 1945 Moscow Agreement to place all of Korea under trusteeship. Earlier, it was telegraphed that the right-wing leader of Korea, Lee Seung-man, had announced that he had concluded a secret agreement with the United States to build an independent government in the US military occupied area of ​​South Korea, so the State Department made this statement. According to newsman White, the United States has not concluded any secret agreement with anyone on the future government of Korea.

### Partially Open News During U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission Meetings; The Soviet Side Has Made Some Concessions in This Regard

[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] The U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission advocated for open meetings to allow global press coverage. Today, they achieved a partial victory. Chief U.S. Representative Brown, after today's meeting, hosted the press for the first time. He reported that the committee had allowed him to informally brief the press on non-confidential matters. The committee decided that reporters would not be allowed to attend any meetings, unless both sides agreed to designate a specific meeting for public access. Subcommittee meetings were also closed to the press. The Soviet side had proposed that all meetings be open to journalists, but considering the experience of last year's seven weeks of meetings, which resulted in only seven communiqués, today's decision can be considered a concession from the Soviet side. It is reported that the committee will issue a joint communiqué tomorrow, reporting on the initial two meetings, and will assign personnel to form three subcommittees: (1) to study matters related to consultations with Korean political parties and social organizations; (2) to handle matters related to the structure of the interim government and the preparation of a constitutional platform; and (3) to handle the method of obtaining personnel for the interim government, and the plan for the interim government to take over the duties of the existing governments in North and South Korea. The committee will reconvene at the call of Soviet Chief Representative Shtikov, who will chair the next meeting according to the procedure predetermined by the delegations of both countries.

### First Meeting Progresses Well

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 22nd] The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission recently began meetings here to discuss the Korean issue. The meetings are being held in absolute secrecy. Today's meeting lasted for three hours. Afterwards, Major General Brown, head of the U.S. delegation, only stated that the Joint Commission had discussed procedural issues and had made great progress. According to well-informed sources, today's discussion focused on the issue of newspaper publicity, and a decision will be made on this matter tomorrow. The agenda was also discussed, one of the most important items being the issue of hearing opinions from various Korean political parties. It is reported that both U.S. and Soviet representatives agreed to grant consultative rights to all Korean political parties, regardless of whether they are left-wing or right-wing, even those parties that refuse to accept the trusteeship plan drafted at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, Korean political parties must provide a promise not to hold demonstrations or give speeches against the trusteeship plan during the Joint Commission's meetings. Extreme left-wing parties and the Democratic Party, and even some conservative party leaders, have already provided such promises, but extreme right-wing leaders have refused to provide promises, and their attitude remains very tough. The two main figures are Kim Koo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Independence Party, and Syngman Rhee, Chairman of the Independent Korean Labor Federation. Both are sixty years old and veterans of the resistance against Japanese rule. Kim Koo replaced Syngman Rhee as Chairman of the Korean government-in-exile in Chongqing in 1943. After returning to Korea, Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee both actively participated in the movement against the trusteeship plan. Their position is that whether to accept trusteeship depends on whether the U.S. and Soviet sides can reach an agreement on General Hodge's definition of trusteeship, that is, trusteeship is meant for assistance and not foreign interference. The total electricity bill is US$5 million.

### North Korean Power Plant Bill; Soviet Union Has Delivered It to the U.S. Side

The total electricity bill is US$5 million.

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] A reliable source acknowledged to United Press today that the Soviet Union has sent a bill to the U.S. side for the electricity supplied by power plants in the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea to the south. The total electricity bill is US$5 million. However, this information has not been officially confirmed here. Most of the large power plants in Korea are located in the north, and they supply a significant amount of electricity to the south through power lines. There have been several power outages, but there is no indication that the Soviet side deliberately cut off the electricity. It is said that the power outages were due to the lack of experience of the electrical workers. It is also reported that the U.S. Army has inquired with U.S. civilian contractors about whether they are interested in building power plants in southern Korea, but the contractors have shown little interest. According to unverified reports, the U.S. occupation forces are considering installing mobile generators near the residential areas of U.S. military personnel and their families, in case of power outages.

### Truman to Submit to Congress Soon; Western Hemisphere Arms Standardization Plan; Brighton May Submit Resignation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Well-informed sources here recently stated that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, following the recommendation of a special committee organized by the Army, Navy, and State Department, have decided to submit a plan to Congress in the near future, advocating for the standardization of armaments in the Western Hemisphere and the training of senior military officers from South American countries in the United States. Following this important change in U.S. foreign policy, Brighton, Assistant Secretary of State for South American Affairs, may resign. Brighton has opposed this plan for some time, believing that it will cause the United States to lose credibility in South America. However, Marshall does not agree with Brighton's views. Marshall has promised the special committee organized by the Army, Navy, and State Department that he will prove to the Senate that this plan is in line with the principles of regional armament and that it will be easy to pass. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican senator, has also promised to do his best to get the Senate Republicans to vote in favor of this "Truman Plan." General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief of Staff of the Army, also believes that the United States' implementation of this plan is sufficient to curb the arms race in the Western Hemisphere.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The government today accelerated the implementation of the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey, as a barrier to prevent the expansion of communism and Soviet influence in the Middle East.

According to reliable sources, the suggestions that the investigation team has decided to submit to the Security Council are as follows: (1) The investigation committee has decided not to interfere in Greece's internal affairs; (2) The investigation committee hopes that the Greek government will issue an amnesty, which can prevent continued civil war. The Security Council should indicate to the Greek government the manner in which the amnesty should be implemented; (3) Appoint a special delegation, chaired by a neutral country that is not a member of the Security Council, to continue investigating the Greek borders for a period of two years; (4) The task of this special delegation should be to urge the governments of Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria to conclude agreements based on the principles of the 1931 Greco-Bulgarian Convention to resolve border disputes; (5) Refugees from these countries should be moved from the border areas to concentration camps, and the special delegation should be authorized to manage the activities of the refugees; (6) The special delegation should also strive to enable Greece and its neighbors to conclude effective agreements to resolve minority issues.

[Our Report] London, 23rd Broadcast: The Italian cabinet formation issue has not been resolved after ten days of turmoil.

Gasperi himself met with Nicola, but refused to disclose whether he had been ordered to form a cabinet.

### On the Issue of Amending the Anglo-Soviet Treaty; British Foreign Office Issues Statement; To Respond to the Soviet Newspaper Izvestia's Criticism

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Soviet official newspaper "Izvestia" stated today that the amendments proposed by the British side during the recent negotiations on amending the Anglo-Soviet Treaty were sufficient to weaken the obligations contained in the original treaty.

For example, the British proposal to extend the validity of the treaty from twenty years to fifty years can indicate Britain's desire to consolidate long-term understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union. Britain's aim, as Foreign Secretary Bevin said, is to harmonize the amended Anglo-Soviet Treaty with the obligations of both countries to the United Nations organization, as well as Britain's obligations to other allies to safeguard security and prevent Germany from re-aggressing.

### Internal Disputes in Various Schools Intensify; Fights Occur at Fudan and Shanghai Law College; Fudan Student Yan Chongze and Others Seriously Injured; Mayor Guarantees Safety of Students Attending Classes

[Our Report] Fudan University students attended classes as usual yesterday morning, but unexpectedly, at around 1:00 PM, many students from outside the school came to the school to incite a strike, attempting to expand the student movement. This was opposed by the majority of students attending classes, leading to a conflict. Fudan student Yan Chongze was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for emergency treatment. Other students, including Li Maoqun, Su Changgeng, and Hou Zhenyu, sustained minor injuries. The Xinshi Street Police Precinct, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched police officers to maintain order outside the school gate. Subsequently, the Police Headquarters also dispatched two police vehicles to suppress the situation. At that time, five students who committed the violence, Zhang Hengchang, He Qingrui, Liu Yuhua, Ling Youxian, and Lü Youwei, were identified by students who opposed the strike and handed over to the precinct for detention. Other students attempting to strike remained in the classroom. The school principal, Zhang Yi, and the heads of various departments convened an administrative meeting to discuss solutions. In the evening, Mayor Wu also personally went to the school to investigate, guaranteeing the safety of students attending classes to the school principal and withdrawing the police. A resolution was reached at around 9:00 PM. As of the reporter's deadline, more than one hundred students remained in the classroom.

[Another Report] More than ten groups, including the Anhui Students' Association of the school, established the "Fudan University May 23rd Bloodshed Support Association" at 9:00 PM last night. More than eighty representatives attended. It was decided to request the security authorities and the school authorities to severely punish the perpetrators and thoroughly investigate the masterminds. Also, two reporters from the Wenhui Daily were beaten when they went to the school yesterday to cover the news. They appealed to Mayor Wu, who expressed his condolences.

[Central News Agency] As the student movement evolved yesterday, it formed a conflict between two factions of students, those advocating for resuming classes and those insisting on the strike. Internal disputes in various schools are intensifying. Yesterday, both Shanghai Law College and Fudan University saw incidents of students advocating for resuming classes being beaten. At the same time, the "May 20th Massacre Support Association," led by a small number of students from Jiaotong University, Jinda University, and other schools, dispatched propaganda teams yesterday, taking two large trucks and going to various middle schools to incite strikes. However, they were rejected by the majority of students in most schools. Therefore, although yesterday was the day of "General Strike" promoted by the "Support Association," the strike situation was not as serious as generally speculated. Some middle schools and girls' schools, fearing accidents, effectively suspended classes in the afternoon, and students left school to return home. Universities that completely went on strike yesterday included Jiaotong University, Jinda University, Tongji University, Shanghai University, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Datong University, Shanghai Art College, and China Vocational School of Industry and Commerce. Middle schools that went on strike or suspended classes included Pudong High School, Zhaoguang High School, Jiancheng High School, Chouneng High School, Huafa High School, Datong High School Affiliated, Meilun High School, Fudan High School, Shizhong High School, Jiaotong High School Affiliated, Chongde Girls' High School, Yangzheng High School, Tongji High School Affiliated, Jinyuan High School, Fudan High School Affiliated, and others. Partially suspended schools included Fudan University, Shanghai Law College, Soochow University, Tongde University, and others on the university side, and Xinjian High School, Yucai High School, Nanyang Girls' High School, Renyi High School, Peiming Girls' High School, Wuxing High School, Zhirenyong Girls' High School, Qixiu High School, and Nanyang Model High School on the middle school side. All other schools attended classes as usual. The situation in various schools is recorded as follows:

Guanghua: Guanghua University still attended classes as usual yesterday. However, at 9:00 AM yesterday, a small number of students went to the Academic Affairs Office to prevent professors from going to the classroom to teach, causing a disturbance, but it was quickly quelled. Yesterday, the number of students attending classes accounted for more than two-thirds of the total. The school also issued a notice yesterday, advising students to attend classes, and those who do not attend classes will be marked as absent.

School of Commerce: The Bank Association, formed by some students of Shanghai School of Commerce, launched a plenary meeting yesterday, intending to organize a "Support Association." However, most of the students in the school had already signed condolences to the students of Central University some days ago, believing that their attitude of justice had already been expressed. They all advocated that academics should be the priority and that classes should be attended as usual. Therefore, very few people attended the meeting yesterday, less than one-fifth of the total. Most of those who attended also opposed participating in the "Nanjing Massacre Support Association" organized by various universities in the city. Therefore, they only decided to send a telegram to comfort the injured students of Central University and a letter to students across the country, and continued to attend classes as usual. More than one hundred students from Jiaotong University went to the school yesterday to promote and incite strikes, but were rejected by the school. The propaganda team left disappointed.

Tongde: Tongde Medical College launched a strike yesterday by the third-year students, and propaganda teams from Shanghai Medical College and Jiaotong University propagandized to other grades, but did not receive a response. As a result, except for the entire third-year class being absent, the entire school attended classes as usual.

Soochow: Soochow University's College of Arts and Sciences decided to strike for two days starting yesterday, in response to the "Massacre Support Association." The students of the school's Law College listed three methods: (1) sending a telegram to comfort the injured students of Central University, (2) striking, and (3) petitioning, as a public opinion test. The test results determined that the first method, sending a telegram of condolence, would be adopted, so classes were still attended as usual.

Zhejiang: Zhejiang University school authorities issued a message yesterday stating: "Since the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association was organized last month, its constitution has not complied with the student self-government association rules promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The school authorities have ordered it to be amended, but it has not been completed so far. The representatives and staff members produced by it have not officially taken office. However, the association has been exercising its powers arbitrarily for the past two weeks and is taking an equal position with the school, not listening to guidance. Recently, it has become even more serious, announcing a strike, organizing a picket team, interfering with students' freedom, and threatening teachers and staff, adding insults. Its actions are outrageous and inexplicable. The school has been forced to dissolve the association on May 21st, according to the Ministry's regulations, and ordered the students to reorganize under the guidance of the Dean of Students. Now, during the storm, the school has notified the families of the students remaining at the school to take them back separately to avoid accidents. Classes will be notified again once the storm subsides." The School of Nursing of the National Shanghai Medical College's Resumption of Classes Movement Committee, in order to maintain its studies and oppose the strike, has issued a letter to the parents of students, urging them to supervise their children to abide by school rules and resume classes immediately.

St. John's: The strike propaganda team also went to St. John's University yesterday to propagandize. Among the more than 1,800 students in the school, only more than 180 students signed in favor of the strike, and more than 300 students signed in favor of sympathizing and consoling without striking. Therefore, the school still attended classes as usual yesterday. Zhang Jiongbo went to lecture yesterday, but the audience was not enthusiastic. The Jiaotong University Student Self-Government Association has recently been publicizing extensively outside the school, and invited Mr. Ping Xin, a member of the China Democratic League, to give a lecture at the school last night to incite strikes. It also posted large cartoons inside and outside the school, doing everything possible to insult the government. Among them, there were ten cartoons with the words "Who is the murderer? The government!" which aroused the righteous indignation of a student named Qin, who tore them down. He was then taken away by special members of the Self-Government Association, who searched his body and interrogated him under threat, arousing the public outrage of the majority of students. For a time, the order in the school was in chaos. The military police rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, and the Self-Government Association ordered the school police to close the school gates. Later, the principal came forward to mediate and released Qin. It is heard that most of the anti-strike students in the school have decided to organize the "Jiaotong University Student Justice Alliance" to actively launch a struggle to protect the school and resume classes, and to uphold justice.

### Embezzlement of Fines Case, Customs Police Chief's Trial Concluded and Awaiting Judgment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Fang Junde, acting police chief of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Station, was accused of embezzlement and corruption. The case was heard by Judge Meng Tingke in the District Court yesterday. According to his confession, he had collected 2 million yuan in fines from the Zhongxing Shipping Company while in office, but because the affairs at the time were complicated, he did not report it. However, all the public funds were stored in a safe deposit box and there was no intention of embezzling them.

The defendant's lawyer, Zheng Lintong, then stood up to defend, stating that the customs handled the case without following normal procedures, avoided the participation of Chinese and Western officials, and did not conduct an investigation by the investigation committee, so the transfer to the court was obviously inappropriate. He then stated that the cause of the case was due to a private feud with Duan Baike, the director of the Extra Port Bureau. Finally, he said that the defendant had received higher education and had been working in the customs for 15 years, so why would he embezzle this small amount of public funds. The court concluded the trial of the case and scheduled the judgment for the 30th.

Lace him to death in a deserted place and bury his body in the reeds on the beach, intending to remove the thorn in his side and be able to sleep soundly from now on. For the sake of万全, he later instructed Tang to send a letter under a false name to prevent his uncle from investigating.

Since Losing His Slippers

His uncle had sent people out to look for him for more than a month, but there was no news. Later, he suddenly received a letter signed by Huang De, which said, "I have been introduced by a friend to work in a certain unit in Chongming, everything is fine, don't worry." After comparing it with his past handwriting, it was obvious that it was not written by him, and there was no real address in the letter, which increased his doubts. After discussing it with the chief of the town, Xi Zhiliang, he decided to report it to the Gaoqiao Police Station and request an investigation. At that time, the director of the sub-bureau, Zhou Zhijian, immediately believed that his wife and tenant Shi Xiaoyi were suspected of a major crime. However, after being summoned, there were no suspicious points, so he

Release on Bail

He sent section chiefs to secretly investigate. After learning that Zhang Yinzi and Huang Gengqing had an affair, he arrested the pair of adulterers and adulteresses on the 10th of this month without making a sound and deliberately imprisoned them in one room.

The next morning, according to the confession, the accomplice Tang Quansheng was arrested near Longhua, and Shi Xiaogou, the boatman who crossed the river that day, was arrested in Xingang. After interrogation, the confessions were roughly the same, and the whole case was revealed. However, although the body has been excavated for many days, it has not been found.

Except for Shi Xiaoyi, the accomplice who is still at large, the four male and female criminals who were arrested in the case have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation yesterday.

### Shanghai Executive Headquarters Children's Welfare Division Hosts Child Welfare Organizations, Announces Complete Closure at the End of the Month, Introduces Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association to Take Over

[Our Report] The Shanghai Branch of the Executive Headquarters' Children's Welfare Division, due to the headquarters' decision to completely cease operations by the end of this month, will transfer all matters related to children's welfare to the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association. Therefore, the division specifically convened more than forty units of various child welfare and relief organizations in the city at 2:00 PM yesterday to formally announce the closure of the Children's Welfare Division and introduce Ms. Liu Dewei, the executive director of the Children's Welfare Promotion Association.

Treasure Resources, Utilize Fully

During the meeting, Fu Ruoyu, the chief of the Shanghai Branch Children's Welfare Division, delivered a speech, stating: "In the past, various child welfare organizations in the city have had excellent cooperation with our division, for which we express our gratitude. However, there may have been imperfections in our division's allocation of relief materials, and there were various reasons for this, which we hope everyone can understand. Our division's allocation of materials has always prioritized children's institutions, and the quantity allocated to children's institutions has also been the largest. This is something we can assure everyone of. After our division closes, children's welfare matters will be handled by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association. Currently, our division still has materials such as floral cloth, khaki cloth, and used clothing, which are sufficient for several years of use and will be distributed by the Promotion Association. However, we hope that all organizations can treasure these resources and utilize them fully, with children as the target. Recently, we have heard that a few institutions will close after our division closes. This action violates the purpose of relief and social welfare, and we hope that they can grit their teeth and persevere in their service to the end."

Unite, Launch Work

Subsequently, Ms. Liu reported on the organization, plans, and working principles of the Promotion Association, stating that the association's service scope is very broad and hoping that all sectors can unite to launch work together. However, the association will not establish any relief homes or child welfare institutions. The initial work will be led by Ms. Ma Bin to investigate all children's institutions in the city, statistics on poor children in each district, details of poor families, and charitable organizations, so that subsequent work can be based on these findings. Regarding materials, there are currently cotton quilts, military blankets, mosquito nets, etc., which will be distributed by the association's distribution committee after reviewing applications.

### Accusing Husband of Being a Thief, Filing for Divorce, Case Involves Korean Laws, Court Orders Attempt at Reconciliation

[Our Report] On the 30th of last month, the Fourth Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters cracked an international car theft organization. Reports stated that the leader of the organization was a Korean youth named Li Yiping. Yesterday, Wang Qihua, a Guangdong woman, requested the court's Sixth Civil Court to grant her divorce from her husband, Li Chunzhen. It is claimed that this Li Chunzhen is the thief Li Yiping. Judge Cai Jing presided over the hearing. Both Wang and Li appeared in court successively. Wang Qihua first presented the grounds for divorce: (1) Married for nine years, the eight-year-old child has been taken back to Seoul by the defendant, and the defendant already had a Korean wife in Seoul. (2) The defendant wanders around all year round, does not engage in production, is violent, and often beats her. He recently colluded with a White Russian to steal a "Jeep," and his name is indeed Li Yiping. (3) The defendant suffers from venereal disease. The defendant, Li Chunzhen, speaking Chinese with difficulty, filed a counterclaim in court, denying that he was Li Yiping, claiming that the plaintiff had absconded with five gold bars and 2 million legal tender on January 29th of this year and had not yet returned. The plaintiff is uneasy at home and goes out to dance when summoned. The defendant has suffered great mental loss. The court, considering that this case involves "foreign-related divorce," instructed both the plaintiff and the defendant to submit Korean marriage law regulations for reference, and ordered the two parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court, scheduling a further hearing for the 23rd of next month.

### Luo Jialing's Will, Servants of Ai Li Garden File Lawsuit, Entitled to Two Thousand Yuan, Must Be Calculated According to Index

[Our Report] After the death of Jewish tycoon Silas Hardoon, disputes over his estate have repeatedly arisen. Now, Sun Shicheng, Chen Yuanzhi, Ma Xiangying, Fan Jinqi, Zhou Qingxin, Han Xiuqing, Xie Guanjun, and seven other workers of Hardoon Garden (Ai Li Garden) have filed a lawsuit with the court, suing Hardoon's adopted son, George Hardoon, requesting a ruling to "execute the will." The main points of their complaint are as follows: "We, the plaintiffs, are loyal employees of the defendant's Ai Li Garden, having served for many years. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, we were treated with consideration by Mrs. Jialing, the heir of Mr. Hardoon, who made a will during her lifetime. Article 14 of the will stipulates: 'I bequeath a property of 100,000 yuan (according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's valuation in 1936) to the staff of the writing room and the old employees in my garden.' After Mrs. Jialing passed away, we, the plaintiffs, remained silent about this will. Now, citing Article 1199 of the Civil Code, we legally file this lawsuit, requesting that it be ordered to execute the will as soon as possible, in accordance with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' announced living index for March (6,614 times), and with reference to the amount separately bequeathed to each of the plaintiffs in the will (according to the Hardoon Foreign Company and Ai Li Garden employees noted in Mrs. Jialing's will, 100,000 yuan was distributed to fifty people, with an average of 2,000 yuan per person), and to order that the defendant bear the costs of this lawsuit." This case was heard yesterday by the Civil Court of the District Court. Representatives of both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court. The court ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court and adjourned the hearing to another date.

### Mayor Wu Meets with Reporters Yesterday, Reports on the Handling of the Student Unrest, In Order to Safeguard the Safety of Four Million Citizens of Shanghai, Will Never Tolerate Conspiratorial Elements Inciting Student Unrest

[Our Report] Mayor Wu met with reporters at the Municipal Government office at 11:00 AM yesterday to report on the Municipal Government's handling of the student unrest: (1) The night before last (the 22nd), a mutual beating occurred among students at the Shanghai Law School, caused by some students publicly inciting the "Dragon Strike" (a city-wide strike of shops and factories). Three students reported the incident to the police station, and eleven students involved in the incident were arrested on the spot and sent to the court for investigation. The "Dragon Strike" is a loss for all citizens, and such actions by a few students clearly violate the Criminal Law and the Martial Law, disrupting social order. (2) The Freshmen College of Tongji University in the city had already resumed classes voluntarily. Yesterday, more than forty outside students suddenly went to the school to incite a strike. The school authorities formally requested the Municipal Government to provide protection. The Municipal Government has ordered the Jiangwan sub-bureau in charge to provide strict protection. In the future, if such situations occur again, they will be investigated and dealt with severely. (3) At Datong University, a small number of students occupied the school buildings. The Municipal Government received a letter from the school's president, Hu Dunfu, a few days ago and sent Councilor Ge Kexin to the school to persuade them. Mayor Wu also personally visited the school the day before yesterday (the 22nd) and ordered the students to withdraw within the prescribed time, otherwise the leaders will be arrested. (4) The Student Self-Government Association of Shanghai Medical College sent me an open letter in the Wenhui Daily a few days ago, asking me to answer it. It must be known that the four measures decided and promulgated by the Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters are all based on legal regulations. According to Article 52 of the Police Offences Act, the police authorities have the right to question anyone who holds a meeting without the permission of the government. The Shanghai Medical College held a meeting without notifying the police or obtaining the consent of the president of the college, which is clearly inconsistent with the Police Offences Act and should be punished by law. Finally, Mayor Wu solemnly stated that the four million citizens of Shanghai need stability. In order to safeguard the safety of the four million citizens, the Municipal Government will never allow a few conspiratorial elements to disrupt social order and public peace. Those who do not abide by the law will be punished by law and will never be tolerated.

### Truth About the Chaoyang Incident, President Shi Has Not Yet Handed Over the Murderer

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] After the incident on the 22nd at Chaoyang College where reactionary students beat eleven students who were returning to school, Shi Zhiquan, the president of the college, and Zeng Zhishi, the dean of academic affairs, went to Beiping Garrison Headquarters to meet with Director Li, reported the incident, and asked for instructions on how to deal with it. According to President Shi's report on the cause of the incident, the students who were enthusiastic about returning to school had already resumed classes yesterday. However, the students who opposed the return to school issued a wall poster, scolding two students who were most strongly advocating for the return to school in every possible way. When these two students tore down the wall poster, the students who were cursing had already prepared and began to beat the students who advocated for the return to school and who were well-behaved, causing eleven students to be seriously injured one after another. Dean Zeng Zhishi tried to stop them but was unsuccessful, and other students who sympathized with the beaten students were also beaten by the students who caused the incident. President Shi believes that the students who caused the incident were acting in an organized and planned manner. Also, the security authorities respected the opinion of the college authorities. After consultation with President Shi of the college, it was agreed that the school authorities would be responsible for handing over the murderers of the students who were beaten. President Shi Zhiquan signed his agreement to be responsible for investigating and identifying the students who caused the incident and beat the students by 4:00 PM on the 23rd and transferring them to the District Court for investigation according to law.

### The "Eating Light" Movement Deepens the Farmers' Misery, Farmers' Associations in Jiaxing and Other Three Counties Oppose It

[Our Report from Jiaxing on the 23rd] The Farmers' Associations of Jiaxing, Tongxiang, and Haiyan Counties believe that the recent strikes and demonstrations by students demanding an increase in non-staple food expenses and the expansion of publicly funded student places are tantamount to killing the hen to get the egg and deepening the farmers' misery. Therefore, they jointly issued a "Letter to the Gentlemen of the University Student Self-Government Associations," asking them to consider the farmers and seek improvements for the entire country, and quoting two ancient poems: "Hoeing millet at noon, sweat drips onto the soil, who knows that the food on the plate, is all hardship," "Planting one grain of millet in spring, harvesting ten thousand grains in autumn, there is no idle land in the world, yet farmers still starve to death." Therefore, they ask them to display the noble spirit of "sympathizing with the majority," curb the behavior of "small self-interest," and stop the "eating light" movement.

The second batch will also be shipped soon. The schools receiving these books are Furen, Zhendan, Guanghua, Daxia, and Guangzhou University. These books were all published between 1937 and 1946 and were selected by Miss Witty莱, director of the Columbia University Teachers College Library, to help the schools catch up with the important developments in education during the war, as Chinese universities were unable to purchase books from abroad during the war. The five universities receiving these books all have educational colleges. In addition, United Service to China has also transported 1,800 supplementary readers for use in primary and secondary schools. These 1,800 books were donated by the New York City Board of Education. United Service to China's plan to assist Chinese private schools is very broad, and the donation of books is only part of the plan. The association also donates scholarships to help university teachers pursue further studies or engage in research in the United States. 225 teachers have applied for this scholarship and are currently being screened by five specialized committees. These committees are all composed of outstanding leaders in various fields of education, such as natural sciences, social sciences, agriculture, engineering, education, and psychology. In order to ensure impartiality, the members of the committees have no relationship with the schools where the applicants are serving. The first batch of applicants who receive the scholarship will depart for the United States this summer, and the second batch is scheduled to set sail next spring.

### Students of St. John's University, with a Democratic Style, Stand Independently and Are Not Attacked by Student Unrest

[Our Special Article] Amid the surging wave of student unrest, most universities in the city have been affected to some extent, and many schools have even seen conflicts and even beatings due to differences of opinion among students. However, St. John's University has resolved the "strike of classes" dispute very democratically. The whole school is full of a free atmosphere and continues to attend classes very quietly.

The day before yesterday afternoon, a group of students held a lecture, with Ma Xulun and Li Pingxin attending to give speeches. However, it did not arouse much interest among the students. Ma Xulun spoke for three hours on "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage," and the atmosphere at the venue was very calm. Many students sitting in the back were reading novels. When Li Pingxin brought up the topic of the student unrest in Nanjing and the anti-civil war, he was met with a lot of "boo" sounds.

Later, a Jiaotong University student came to the stage to give a speech, inviting St. John's to participate in the "General Strike," and the "May 20th Incident Support Association" was immediately formed, with a total of 180 students participating. However, a "School Protection Association" was also established. With the support of 300 students, the "School Protection Association" decided to oppose the strike of classes, but agreed to launch a donation to comfort the injured students in Nanjing. They democratically sought opinions from all 1,800 students in the school, posting slogans to express different positions and actions. The "School Protection Association" humorously posted an announcement at the gate: "We urge Mr. Ma Xulun and Mr. Li Pingxin not to come to the school to promote a strike of classes. We want to study with peace of mind." In order to win over the masses, the "May 20th Support Association" promoted: "Strike of classes for two days, drag it out for a few days, and credits can be easily obtained." The "School Protection Association" retorted: "We are here to continue studying, not to steal credits. Look at Shanghai University and Jiaotong University, the strike of classes has no end in sight, and credits are even more elusive."

Promotion is promotion, and opinions can be different, but actions depend on the students. Most students are unwilling to strike of classes, so they are still very quietly continuing to attend classes.

### Tonight, the Expeditionary Force Faces a Formidable Enemy; The Zheng Lun Team Confronts the Giants; From 7 PM at the City Gymnasium; Mayor's Cup Youth Group Finals Before the Match

The Zheng Lun basketball team's arrival in Shanghai has resulted in five wins out of five games.

Prior to this, the Mayor's Cup youth group finals, featuring the Sino-French team against the Green Elite team, will be held. Since the beginning of the Mayor's Cup youth group competition, the Youth Group One champion has been determined to be the Sino-French team, while the Youth Group Two champion is the Elite team. The two group champions will compete for the overall championship in a best-of-three series. The first match will begin today at 6 PM, with the second match scheduled for 6 PM on the 30th, before the Zheng Lun versus Hua Lian match. The originally scheduled League matches for Group B and the Industry and Commerce Group have been postponed. Tickets are priced at 5,000 yuan upstairs and 8,000 yuan downstairs, and will be sold starting at 5 PM. The gymnasium doors will open at 5:30 PM.

Determination to Defeat the Enemy

This is the Zheng Lun team's second visit to Shanghai. They have previously defeated teams such as Chen You, Ren Yu, Shan, and John. The night before last, they defeated the foreign team "Enkas" with a score of 49 to 40. Facing the "Giants" today, they are carefully considering their lineup in order to maintain their winning streak. Yesterday, the team's manager, Mr. Wu, told reporters that although the team captain, Cai Zhongqiang, suffered a serious eye injury and bled heavily during the match against "Enkas" the night before last, the swelling has subsided after careful treatment by the military doctor. However, his spirit has not yet fully recovered. Nevertheless, he is determined to lead the team in this crucial match against the "Giants." The "Sharpshooter" Tu Wenlong, as well as Yu Ruizhang, Liu Zhengjun, Wang Binghuan, and others are all determined to do their best to compete with the "Giants."

Tonight's Key

Under the guidance of Kaiji Miluofu, the "Giants" have many talented players. Funik is tall and strong, Tao Bolinki is short and skillful, and the tall Gu Fo is the most dangerous player. There will undoubtedly be a tense performance. According to insiders, the most noteworthy aspect of Zheng Lun's match against the Giants tonight will be the duel between Tu Wenlong and Gu Fo. Whether Zheng Lun can win depends on Tu Wenlong's ability to score, as well as their ability to monitor Gu Fo and control the rebounds. The matches between Cai Zhongqiang and Tao Bolinki, and Yu Ruizhang and Yerong, will also be evenly matched. Today's lineups are as follows:

### Control Measures for Transporting Gauze to Hankou – Textile Control Committee Petitions for Cancellation – Procedures for Transporting Gauze to Various Ports in Hebei and Northeast Similar to Control Measures in South China

[Report from our newspaper] The 35th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. The meeting was attended by Wu, the concurrent chairman, Li, the vice-chairman, and committee members Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Guo Dihuo, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and the head of the committee's business division, Liu Wenteng. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. The three important resolutions are as follows:

(1) The Cotton Textile Association of the Sixth District and the Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association listed reasons for requesting the cancellation of the control measures for transporting gauze to Hankou. Resolution: Passed a petition to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the cancellation.

(2) The Textile Control Committee regularly inspects cotton yarn from various factories each month. Some yarn factories often request a re-inspection. Resolution: Cannot be accepted, but the inspection method can be improved. The original inspection method used 20 cones of yarn. It has now been decided to increase this to 40 cones, so that the yarn samples taken are more representative.

(3) Discussed the draft charter for the Organization Committee for the Management of Cotton Production Promotion and Textile Industry Development Funds. Resolution: Amended and passed, to be implemented after approval by the ministry.

[Another report] The committee had previously suspended the review of applications from manufacturers for the transport of gauze to various ports in Hebei and Northeast because various parties had repeatedly requested revisions to the control measures. Now that the 35th regular meeting has passed a petition to cancel the control measures for Hankou, the review of applications for Hebei and Northeast ports will begin immediately, and the procedures will be the same as the control measures for gauze verification in South China. It is also estimated that the second quarter (May to July) quota for foreign cotton is currently set at US$20 million, equivalent to 100,000 bales of foreign cotton. However, the actual demand for foreign cotton by yarn factories nationwide in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 520,000 bales, so there is a significant shortage. Furthermore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has already allocated 60,000 bales of foreign cotton, with half allocated to national private yarn factories. At the time of allocation (early April), the market price of cotton was approximately 800,000 yuan, so the price was set at 750,000 yuan per dan. Now that the market price of cotton has reached 1.7 million yuan, the price adjustment will be considered for future cotton allocation.

### Government Bonds Remain Weak; Foreign Stocks Steady

Government bonds were weak yesterday but stabilized later in the day. Only Unified Ding bonds fell significantly. Room 552 and Room 503 took deliveries, while Room 360 and Room 420 were sellers. Unified Bing bonds opened at 13,800 yuan, fell from 14,100 yuan to a low of 13,000 yuan, and finally struggled around the opening price. As a result, Unified Jia, Yi, Bing, and Wu bonds all fell slightly compared to the previous close, while Unified Ding bonds fell by 800 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 6 million yuan.

Foreign stocks opened lower yesterday. After Guang Bang's intention to sell foreign currency to Bang ceased, securities brokers also exited and then moved forward rapidly, eventually recovering. Shen Dian's quoted price was mediocre, and the market situation was still not very volatile. Yi Yarn opened at 65,500 yuan, which was a low price. The high price reached 71,000 yuan, and then stabilized. As a result, English League Airlines, Steel, and Shipping all rose slightly more than half a percent compared to the previous close. Hui Dejian Telephone was flat, and the rest rose slightly.

### Parallel Line Checks Stimulate Confidence – Chinese Stocks Stop Falling and Rise Again – The Battle Between Bulls and Bears Has Subsided; Small Investors are Helpless

Chinese stocks saw greatly reduced interest from all parties yesterday. Trading inside and outside the exchange was quiet, and fluctuations were unusually erratic. Guang Bang sold some, but yarn factories still had an appetite for buying. In addition, there was a rumor that parallel line checks had already entered the market, making it easier to recover after a decline. The situation for miscellaneous stocks remained depressed. The new shares of Sino-French Pharmacy had just debuted the day before yesterday. A large number of shares were sold at high prices, and yesterday, it even hit the limit down.

The opening situation in the morning was sparse and rather weak. After Di Yong Yarn opened at 7,000 yuan, numbers 157, 218, 76, and 223 were all sold, falling to a low price of 6,880 yuan. Numbers 232, 36, 89, 91, 106, 224, and 237 all advanced, rising to 7,280 yuan. Sino-French first hit the limit down. Numbers 157, 142, 22, and 97 were sold off, falling to 7,150 yuan. Numbers 117, 148, 142, 104, and 35 advanced to 7,300 yuan. Numbers 85, 60, 32, and 36 were still being liquidated, and once fell below 7,050 yuan. The quoted price outside the exchange was high, and numbers 65, 224, 112, 16, 160, 235, 231, and 237 were successively bought, and the market rose and fell. There was a rumor that parallel line checks were entering the market, recovering to 7,480 yuan. There was news that the bulls and bears had already joined forces, and numbers 226, 224, 85, 89, 196, 143, 160, and 188 advanced to 7,730 yuan. Numbers 85, 219, 218, 165, 89, 152, and 155 were sold at below 7,450 yuan. Number 143 and others continued to advance, and Yong Yarn spot goods still hit the limit up, closing at around 7,650 yuan. As a result, Yong Yarn hit the limit up compared to the previous close. Xin He, Meiya, Xin Guang, and Jing Fu all rose slightly more than half a percent, Xinhua rose by 10%, Qin Xing rose slightly, Yong Gong was uniquely flat, and Sino-French fell by the limit down, affecting the Chinese goods listed on the same day, dropping a little more than half a percent.

Di Jiao calculated that Yong Yarn, Xin He, Meiya, Yong Gong, and Jing Fu all rose by half a percent, Xin Guang rose slightly, and Qin Xing fell slightly. Outside the exchange, the old stocks of the world were flat, Wuzhou Dasheng rose slightly, and the rest were flat or weak.

### Yarn Prices Decline

Yesterday's yarn market opened relatively stable, but later, due to the decline in cloth prices, holders sold their spot goods, and the supply was abundant, causing prices to fall. The final price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 1.2 million yuan, a slight decrease of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining 20-count and 16-count yarns all fell by small amounts, ranging from 50,000 to 120,000 yuan.

The Textile Construction Company sold cotton yarn as usual yesterday. Prices remained unchanged. A total of 826 pieces were sold, all to manufacturers. There were a total of 368 applications.

### Cloth Market Initially Weak, Then Firm

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was weak because the industry believed that credit was still tight, sales were not lively, buyers were hesitant to enter, and many dyeing factories were even selling white cotton cloth. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 296,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan. B-character Five Blessings fine cloth, supplied by the Textile Construction Company, was sold for 68,000 yuan below cost. Four Gentlemen Golden Seal drill fell to 289,000 yuan. By the afternoon, due to the favorable news of coupon trading, the market rebounded. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 298,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Five Blessings was 285,000 yuan, also an increase of 6,000 yuan. The remaining color ball, blue crane, and Zhenzhong fine cloths all rose by 2,000 to 7,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen drill recovered by 5,000 yuan. Twill gray cloth and gray tribute satin also increased by 4,000 to 10,000 yuan. However, bleached cloth and Shilin cloth showed weakness.

### Reviewing Cocoon Collection Situation

[Report from our newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Silkworm Cocoon Sales Coordination Committee is scheduled to be held at 10 AM today at the China Silkworm Company on Laobazi Road. At that time, the cocoon collection situation will be reviewed based on reports from various parties, and discussions will also be held on accelerating the promotion of loan disbursement.

It is also learned that to date, the number of manufacturers approved by the coordination committee and who have signed loan contracts with the Bank of China Farmers Bank has reached 52. Among the two banks that disburse loans from the China Agricultural Bank, Jiangsu accounts for 20 and Zhejiang accounts for 16. The loans that have been remitted by the China Agricultural Bank to date have exceeded 30 billion yuan. It is reported that after this year's price of fresh cocoons was set at 1 million yuan per dan, the average profit for silkworm farmers is estimated to be 300,000 yuan per dan. Therefore, after this year's spring and two loans are expanded to 200 billion yuan, the amount of direct benefits to silkworm farmers is expected to reach 60 billion yuan.

### Cigarettes: More Declines Than Increases

Yesterday's cigarette market saw mainly small, retail transactions. Out-of-town peers dumped a considerable amount of Hardeman cigarettes, while the dumping of Great Britain cigarettes was firmer. The noon close was still 20,000 higher than the previous day, but in the afternoon, due to tight funds within the industry, weak buying sentiment, and supply sales, the market declined again. The result was 7.15 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife was 6.6 million yuan, also a decrease of 75,000 yuan. The prices of other Chinese brands such as Beauty Golden Mouse Bank Brandy all declined uniformly. However, the prices of several brands of 10-count Five Flowers Double Axe and 20-count Goods Golden Dragon Kress Crusader rose slightly.

[Another report] Yesterday, the price of San Wu brand cigarettes fell again as foreign ships continued to arrive, bringing a large number of goods to the market. The price fell from 44,000 yuan to 42,500 yuan. The cigarette flavoring market was generally calm, with little price fluctuation. However, because foreign companies slightly sold off "Triangular Glycerin," the price fell slightly from 1.35 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Sugar Weak and Declining

Yesterday, the sugar market turned from laborious to weak. The association judged the price of first-grade sand to be 400,560 yuan, a primary decrease of 10,000 yuan, rebounded midway to 410,000 yuan, then 400,780 yuan, and still fell by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Two-Zero medium sand white small 10,000+ yuan, 370,000 yuan. Shantou Green, De Green, and Ji Diaocing were all originally priced, with little transaction. Xinghua white was 385,000 yuan to 380,000 yuan. Xing red was 285,000 yuan to 280,000 yuan. Only dozens of baskets were traded. Fujian sliced ice opened at 580,000 yuan, and yellow common Jian ice was 520,000 yuan.

### Rice Market Soars Madly: White粳 Rice Sets New Record High Price, Jumping to 385,000 Yuan per Shi

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the rice market soared madly, with white粳 rice reaching a new high price of 385,000 yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market is volatile, as price increases are reported from producing areas, making the rising trend unstoppable once trading begins. Someone was manipulating prices in the North Market, pushing them up to 400,000 yuan in a "passing the buck" manner, and has been arrested and sent to legal authorities. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated that such unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate prices, harming people's livelihoods, should be severely punished.

The market arrivals yesterday were relatively scarce due to the wind and rain overnight. The South Market had 3,663 shi and 7 dou, while the North Market had 2,978 shi and 5 dou. High-quality white粳 rice was priced at 365,000 yuan in the South Market and 385,000 yuan in the North Market.

Reasons for the Rapid Rise in Rice Prices

Ji Ming, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, said yesterday: Rice prices in the producing areas rise with those in the city, and prices in the city rise again because of the high prices in the producing areas. This cycle of cause and effect, coupled with human factors such as market manipulation and price-gouging, leads to continuous increases. Although the free trading of rice has been approved, it should be limited to maintaining legal profits. Any deliberate price-gouging, manipulation, or hoarding will be severely dealt with according to the "Measures for Combating Hoarding of Essential Daily Commodities during Extraordinary Times."

Direct Rice Allocation to be Implemented Within the Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] The direct sale of rice to factories and schools in the city is currently undergoing active registration, application, and review. The number of employees reported by some factories differs significantly from the number previously registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, so the procedures cannot be completed in the short term. The Education Bureau is handling matters for schools and will submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for review once all the information is collected. It is hoped that sales can begin within this month. Due to the recent surge in rice prices, there are rumors that the Ministry of Food may raise the price to 200,000 yuan per dan. However, according to Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, they have received instructions from the Ministry of Food that the price for rice allocated to schools will remain at 168,000 yuan per shi. The price for rice purchased by factories on behalf of their employees (i.e., purchased by the factory through the Social Affairs Bureau) will be 240,000 yuan per shi. However, rickshaw pullers, dockworkers, and others without fixed employers or employers who do not provide meals can purchase rice at 168,000 yuan.

Regarding rice allocation for the poor, the Social Affairs Bureau has already drafted measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government's Counselor's Office for discussion. Relevant agencies are scheduled to meet at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM today to discuss the matter.

In other news: Yesterday, flour prices followed suit, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran also became firm, with small packages rising by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake supply was abundant, with a slight increase of 300 to 500 yuan. Yellow soybeans remained stable. Mung beans were moving slowly, declining by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red sorghum arrivals and sales were scarce, and the market was firm. Corn was heavily purchased from the north, soaring by more than 10,000 yuan. Sesame from foreign firms showed slight movement, becoming subtly tight. Raw peanuts and red beans were in short supply. The oil market saw continuous arrivals, but the volume was very small. Soybean oil was firm, raw oil was flat, clear oil was unchanged, sesame oil was similar, and vegetable oil was mediocre.

### Fourth Joint Office Discusses Wheat Loans: 58 Flour Mills Request 320 Billion in Loans

The new wheat season is about to begin. To facilitate early purchases and increase production, the Fourth District Flour Industry Association has requested the Fourth Joint Treasury to establish a special project to handle loans. This document has been submitted to the Fourth Joint Office, which will submit it to the Office Committee for discussion. According to the person in charge, the amount of the requested loan is quite large, totaling over 320 billion yuan. Each flour mill will be loaned enough to purchase 20 days' worth of raw wheat for production. A mill producing 500 bags of flour per day needs 300 market dan of raw wheat. Assuming the market price of new wheat is 150,000 national currency per market dan, then a mill producing 500 bags should be loaned 900 million national currency. The association has 58 member mills, so the loan amount is over 320 billion, with a term of six months and the lowest possible interest rate, secured by the mills' movable and immovable property. Furthermore, the Fourth Joint Treasury established a wheat loan silver group in June of last year to cooperate with national policy and solve the people's food problems. However, due to the lack of consensus among the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, it was suspended. This year, the association has submitted another request, and it has not yet been decided whether to re-establish the silver group or have the Bank of Communications handle it.

### Rayon Rises, Silk Goods Fall

Yesterday, rayon prices rose again, mainly because of recent strong sales and low inventory levels, leading holders of goods to hoard and raise prices. 120-count Gaoshan Youguang rayon opened at 17.7 million yuan with immediate transactions, then rose again to 8 million yuan at closing. In the afternoon, actual buyers were deterred by the high prices and held back, causing the asking price to gradually decrease, eventually reaching 17.8 million yuan. However, the final price was still 600,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Dongyang and Jin Sanma brands also fluctuated accordingly. 75-count semi-gloss rayon was offered at 1 million yuan higher than the previous day, but no transactions occurred. Yesterday, silk goods continued to decline. Meiya bedspreads were offered at 8.3 million yuan in the market but saw no transactions. D誠格子壁縐 opened at 30,700 yuan and then gradually declined, eventually closing at 30,200 yuan, 400 yuan lower than the expected price, which was 1,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Although the raw material for rayon goods was expensive, the selling price was not easy to increase due to sluggish transactions.

The factory yarn market was quiet yesterday, with no transactions at any level. Asking prices remained unchanged from the previous day. High-grade Lingdan D-grade yarn was priced at 19.5 million yuan, and C-grade yarn was priced at 19.8 million yuan. Several packages were sold, purchased by knitting factories from other cities.

### Rosin for Varnish Nearly Exhausted

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Varnish Industry Association recently reported that its stock of the main raw material, rosin, is nearing exhaustion, and import is difficult due to control regulations. They have petitioned the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office and the Transport Control Committee for assistance. The petition states that rosin was previously supplied by Texaco, Mobil, and Asiatic Petroleum Company. When asked to continue supplying, the companies stated that they could not ship the goods without our country's permit. According to representatives from Texaco, there are still thousands of bridges of this raw material stored in customs, but they cannot be released without a permit. Therefore, the varnish industry has submitted a document requesting assistance to avoid production stoppages due to a lack of raw materials.

### Western Suit Linings Trendy

High-end black carbon, all-wool linings are particularly trendy, with rising prices and significant shortages. Lower-grade goods are abundant in stock, and prices are mostly flat and weak. French-style linings have balanced supply and demand, with prices generally stable. Sales of soft linings continue to be low, with most brands other than Hongsheng Jinqian brand being flat or weak. Printed cotton fabrics are selling well and are in short supply, with hardening market prices. Sleeve lining silks are in greater demand than supply due to silk yarn raw material and labor costs, and the lack of weaving capacity among small factories, causing prices to remain firm. Mercerized feather yarn production is strong and sales are booming, with consistently firm asking prices on the Tea Association and Yuan Yu Xing retail prices. Satin-backed yarn is awaiting actual sales, and few offer it.

### Soap and Matches Sluggish

Yesterday, the used soap market saw a drop in asking prices due to large shipments received by merchants from other cities, tightening their cash flow and forcing them to sell in the market. Huang Xiangmao soap, 120 bars per case, initially opened at 254,000 yuan, but buyers remained hesitant, and the closing price in the afternoon was 251,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. 100-bar cases also dropped by 5,000 yuan. Prices for other brands such as Guben, Arrow, and Daoguang also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The match market was also sluggish due to slow sales and a lack of vitality. Xin Fenghuang and Nanjing Dahua three brands were down 20,000 yuan per case from the previous day, while Xin Meili, Laohu, and Meigui brands remained flat.

### Fir Rises Again

In the lumber market, fir prices, which had risen to 3,000 yuan, had slightly retreated to 2,600 yuan. Yesterday, due to increased transportation costs, they rose again to 2,800 yuan. Foreign pine market sentiment remains flat.

### How to Allocate Import Quotas for Industrial Raw Materials? Importers and Exporters Express Their Opinions

Regarding the issue of allocating import quotas for industrial raw materials, the City Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association decided at yesterday's meeting to request the Transportation Control Committee to directly obtain the right to allocate raw material imports, intending to avoid intermediary profiteering by importers. Our reporter specifically visited Song Binglun, director and secretary-general of the Importers and Exporters Association, who stated the following:

(1) Since the establishment of the Transportation Control Committee, the qualification review for importers has become stricter. When the association previously processed registration applications, it stipulated that: (A) Importers must obtain a certificate from the American manufacturer recognizing the importer as its resident agent in China; (B) The importer's business scope is determined and specified based on the individual import volume in 1946. Therefore, importers who still exist after this preliminary review have a non-negligible foundation.

(2) Outsiders often believe that importers are only intermediaries who profit and exploit, but this view is due to a lack of understanding of international trade. The idea that factories want to directly obtain the right to allocate imported raw materials is extremely narrow-minded. Most of our country's industrial raw materials rely on foreign countries, and not every factory in one country can directly order from abroad. (A) Market conditions and prices fluctuate constantly, and importers have more timely access to information; (B) Foreign manufacturers make the same goods with different qualities, and prices often change at any time. This kind of specialized commercial experience can only be mastered by those experienced in international trade.

(3) International traders are not only familiar with domestic industry but also with foreign industry. Importers' business scope involves ordering various goods and is flexible at any time, with no fixed items. Their preparations for importing goods cover a wide range to meet the needs of our various industries. The difficulties faced by factories individually ordering from abroad are unspeakable.

In other news: The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Association held its 19th joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon, chaired by Director Zhang Huanzhang, to discuss several proposals. Because the outside world may not fully understand the position of importers and exporters, the association sent a letter to Director Zhang of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Committee, stating the main points as follows: "It is noted that importers and exporters are regarded as tools for implementing national policy in all countries around the world, and every effort is made to protect and assist their development. The development of import and export trade also promotes the prosperity of banking, insurance, transportation, and factories. Importers and exporters must be aware of the production situation, product standards, and price levels of foreign manufacturers, and they must also have accurate surveys and statistics on the actual situation and real needs of domestic factories. Most also have agency relationships with foreign manufacturers, which gives them accurate market prices for ordering materials to meet domestic needs. Therefore, importers and exporters are commercial organizations that cherish foreign exchange and prevent its wasteful use. Why abandon the fundamentals and pursue the branches, and request that the quota allocation be handed over to the autonomous management of each industrial association? Furthermore, importers have been reviewed and registered by your association and are legitimate organizations. Therefore, the ability to obtain allocation quotas is granted after careful consideration by your association, knowing that your association will never lightly believe rumors and hastily approve them to fulfill their selfish desires. However, in order to maintain the economic prosperity of the country and express the position of importers and exporters, this matter was raised at the 19th joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and it was unanimously decided to telegraph your office to request your review, grant justice, and we await your orders." (Remainder omitted).

### High-Grade Bituminous Coal Rises

The market for high-grade bituminous coal, such as Kailuan, Fuxin, and Keelung coal, is gradually rising as manufacturers become more active and traders become more enthusiastic about stocking up. The market for low-grade bituminous coal, such as Jiaocheng and Poluo coal, remains sluggish due to numerous arrivals, and prices remain low. Arrivals of white coal lumps from various locations are gradually increasing, but they are mostly of poor quality and do not meet the actual sales standards in Shanghai, so the market for high-grade goods such as Jiaozuo coal lumps remains firm. Tianjin and Yingkou are showing interest.

### Sian New Roasted Green Tea

Tianjin and Yingkou are showing interest.

Since the prices of red and green tea specifically for export have been gradually tightening from overseas, it is increasingly difficult to reach a negotiation. Recently, transactions have been like dead ashes, and the market has no vitality. It is understood that tea exporters, in view of the current situation of Chinese tea exports nearing extinction, will soon convene their colleagues to actively discuss ways to save the situation in order to continue their survival. As for domestic sales, there are exchanges and changes in the process. According to industry insiders, Tianjin and Yingkou are very interested in this year's new roasted green tea from Sian. There are reports that prices are very harsh, which may prevent smooth sales for a time.

### Cement Industry Applies for Permission to Import Gypsum

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Cement Industry Association stated that gypsum is the main raw material for cement production, and the domestic quantity of gypsum has sharply decreased, transportation is difficult, and supply is insufficient. It has petitioned the Transportation Control Committee to approve the supply of foreign exchange to allow import. It has been learned that the Transportation Control Committee replied on the 5th of this month, saying that it would "approve the amount within the possible range."

### British Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Boyd Visits Fuzhou

— By Chen Zhengyu, Special Correspondent in Fuzhou, 19th by Airmail

On the 13th, Fuzhou received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that Vice Admiral Denis Boyd, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, would arrive in Fuzhou for a visit on the 16th. People from all walks of life in Fuzhou were extremely excited upon hearing this news. It was the first time since the war that such a high-ranking guest had visited Fuzhou with goodwill and friendship!

Those who pay attention to the history of World War II and international developments will likely know that General Boyd was a senior commander in charge of British Air Force operations during the war. In the battles against Japan and Germany, he commanded the British Royal Naval Air Service, using surprise attack tactics to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. He had an immortal record for the British Empire during the war. He was promoted from commander of the Naval Air Service to Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, awarded the rank of Vice Admiral, and rose to become the fifth most famous figure in the British Navy. Boyd is nearly sixty years old and has served in the British Navy for forty-two years.

Distinguished Guest Arrives, Crowd Goes to Mawei to Welcome

Early in the morning of the 16th, over thirty leading figures from various circles in Fuzhou, including news reporters and British residents, traveled from Nantai by two motorboats to Mawei to greet him. The Alert, the ship on which Boyd was traveling, sailed into the Minjiang River estuary at noon and anchored at Mawei. The welcoming party immediately approached and boarded the ship. Boyd, accompanied by his wife and daughter, stood respectfully on the deck to greet them and shook hands with each welcomer, a lively scene. Accompanying Boyd were also Colonel and Mrs. White, Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Dulliel, Lieutenant Colonel Gullard, Captain Gibson, and Miss Milligan. These people had all fought against the Japanese Navy in Chinese waters during the war, were very familiar with the situation in China, and had a general liking for China. After arriving in Fuzhou, Boyd and his party stayed at the residence of the customs commissioner of the Fuzhou Cangqianshan Maritime Customs and the HSBC Bank of British merchants.

Three-Day Stay, Visit the "Living Buddha"

At 5:00 PM on the 16th, Boyd and his entourage went to the provincial government to visit Chairman Liu. This event kept the officials in the government busy. If not caught off guard, it could at least be said that they were not very familiar with this occasion. A platoon of new, fully equipped military police was temporarily transferred from the military police corps to act as a guard of honor, and the provincial government band was also temporarily reorganized. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, a "Rice Petition Group" organized by students from the entire Xiehe University arrived at the provincial government to petition. Chairman Liu hurriedly sent the students away with a "full promise." Soon after, the distinguished guest arrived, and the Chairman received him in the Chairman's reception room. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, the Chairman hosted a Chinese-style dinner for Boyd and his wife that evening, inviting naval veteran Sa Zhenbing, Li Shijia, and leading figures from all circles in the provincial capital to accompany them. The scene of toasts and exchanges was a rare international dinner party in Fuzhou.

That same afternoon, Boyd visited the Chinese naval veteran, "Living Buddha" Sa. Sa was the first Chinese student sent to Britain to study naval affairs. Boyd had always admired Admiral Sa Zhenbing and paid his respects very respectfully during this visit, greatly admiring Sa's indelible contribution to the founding of the Chinese Navy.

At 10:00 AM on the 17th, Chairman Liu, Mayor Yan, and the heads of various departments of the provincial government went to Mawei to return the visit and were invited to a banquet on the ship. That same afternoon, Boyd visited British residents and consular officials from various countries in Fuzhou. On the morning of the 18th, naval officers and soldiers held a football match in Lin Sen Park (formerly the racecourse). This is the sport that the British love the most. He left Fuzhou on the 19th to return to Hong Kong.

Meeting with Reporters, Expectations for the Chinese Navy

On the morning of the 18th, the reporter drove to Boyd's residence on Cangqianshan, took out a business card, temporarily added an English title on the back, and asked the waiter to report it. After waiting for a while, the general came out in casual clothes, with white hair on his temples and a burly physique. He appeared calm and serious, fully demonstrating the personality of the British nation. He expressed his pleasure at the reporter's visit and immediately began a question-and-answer session. Boyd said that there were three motives for his visit to Fuzhou: (1) a friendly visit; (2) a visit to the Mawei military port; and (3) a general tour to benefit his duties. At the same time, he brought his wife and daughter on a long sea voyage. Since the end of the war, he has visited Singapore, Yokosuka, Kobe, Tokyo, Qinhuangdao, Beiping, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Manila, Bangkok, and other places. This was his first visit to Fuzhou, because he had a deep impression of Mawei, the birthplace of the Chinese Navy, and had long cherished the idea of visiting Fuzhou. Regarding the composition of the Pacific Fleet, Boyd also explained in detail to the reporter that it included two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, eight battleships, two destroyers, fourteen small gunboats, and various auxiliary and transport ships, forming a powerful fleet. These ships are stationed in various strategic areas of the Pacific, and Boyd himself is mostly stationed in Hong Kong.

"After the war, is the Allied nation willing to assist in the construction of the new Chinese Navy?" When asked this question, he replied very politely: "The Chinese Navy was once strong, but unfortunately suffered great losses after the war against Japan. China is a country with an extremely long coastline. Rebuilding the navy is not only necessary for China but also important for stabilizing the Far East. I hope that there will be peace in China as soon as possible so that the foundation of heavy industry can be laid and then the navy can be developed. The Allied nation is willing to provide China with possible assistance. Chinese sailors trained in England have achieved excellent results, which is enough." He also praised the position of Mawei, praising it as a naval resort, suitable for becoming an excellent Chinese military port.

The General was very interested in our newspaper, which has the longest history and largest scale in China. The reporter brought a copy of our newspaper, gave it to him to read, and told him about the circulation situation of our newspaper before shaking hands and saying goodbye. Before leaving, the General also told the reporter that he would soon return to Hong Kong and head south to meet with Chief of Staff Montgomery somewhere in Nanyang.

General's Visit Enhances Sino-British Friendship

China and Britain have always had a traditional and deep friendship. During the war, they were allies. A gentleman values a friend in need, and a friend in times of adversity is the most valuable. China is influenced by its profound cultural heritage and has always valued morality. During the war, when China's domestic battlefield was in crisis, it did not forget the difficulties of its British allies and sent elite troops to Burma to relieve the crisis in northern Burma. The British will not forget this. After the war, some disputes over Hong Kong and Kowloon and their borders have stained the precious friendship between China and Britain. We hope that after General Boyd's goodwill visit to various parts of South China, it can promote the friendship between China and Britain. General Boyd's visit to Fuzhou this time has excited more than 300,000 citizens of Fuzhou. Let this friendship of welcoming allies be taken back to Britain by General Boyd.

### Ten Days in Southern Yunnan: The Life of a "Sha Ding" (Mining Coolie)

— Special Correspondent Xu Ji, Kunming Telegraph Dispatch, 17th

In Gejiu, miners account for over 90% of the population. Therefore, the rise and fall of Gejiu's tin industry can be clearly seen from population changes. Although the tin industry in Gejiu is currently in a slump, many miners are still working hard to support this dilapidated situation. According to records from Mengzi regarding the origin of the miners: "... initially, Fanglian Cave was a haven, attracting no less than tens of thousands of people from all directions. Seventy percent came from Hubei, thirty percent from Jiangxi, followed by Shaanxi and Shanxi, and then other provinces..." This shows that most miners came from provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. However, in recent years, miners from Yunnan have become the vast majority.

The lives of these "Sha Ding" who carry ore on their backs are unimaginable to outsiders. This reporter personally spoke with them and learned about their conditions through their facilities, understanding how they endure days without sunlight. I deeply feel that if the welfare of laborers continues to be eroded like this, our construction work will truly be a pipe dream.

Most "Sha Ding" Recruited

There has never been an accurate count of the "Sha Ding" in Gejiu mines. They are recruited in batches and quickly fall ill or die in batches. Mine owners fill their pockets with their blood and sweat, so how can they have the leisure to care about these insignificant matters? However, from a humanitarian standpoint, we should speak out on their behalf.

The hiring of "Sha Ding" can be divided into two types: recruitment and voluntary factory entry. However, the latter is very rare, accounting for only about 5%. Recruitment usually begins around the Winter Solstice. Recruiters receive commissions, while the "Sha Ding" are only given some settlement money. Like black slaves, their lives after entering the mine are entirely controlled by the mine owner. Although contracts are used in form, the "Sha Ding" essentially lose their freedom. There are no set working hours, and wages are not guaranteed. The "Sha Ding" never think about their future lives, let alone plan their own lives. Their fate is in the hands of the mine owners, who have almost absolute power over their lives and deaths.

Poverty-Stricken and Helpless

Assistant Manager Lu of the Tin Industry Company said: The lives of "Sha Ding" have improved a lot now. The past situation was even more unimaginable. Because private mine owners are only interested in profit, they naturally don't care about the lives and deaths of the "Sha Ding". The "Sha Ding" come to work in the mines because of economic difficulties and extreme poverty. Coupled with their lack of knowledge, their life goals and methods are very simple, so they are helpless and never complain.

A Dark World Inside the Caves

The average age of the "Sha Ding" is mostly between 21 and 40 years old, but there are also many young "Sha Ding" around 12 years old. When the reporter visited a private mine in the Huangmaoshan mining area, I personally saw a "Sha Ding" faint and fall while carrying ore out of the cave. Of course, the cave is dark and the paths are rugged and winding. Their journey in the cave is measured in steps, and the hardship is evident. Mine owners dig into the mountains to save labor and improve efficiency. The caves are dug very small, allowing people to only enter by hunching over. In areas with loose soil, there are no fir wood supports. When the "Sha Ding" enter the cave to carry ore, they rely entirely on their steps. Once inside, they have difficulty breathing. Sand falls into their eyes, mouth, and lungs. As a result, the "Sha Ding" often suffer from eye diseases and lung diseases. The sand fills the gaps in their lungs until they die silently.

Private mine owners are very unreasonable to the "Sha Ding". After being recruited to the mining area, they almost lose their freedom. They have no way to think about their future lives, and they spend their days with sand and mud, rarely seeing sunlight and fresh air. Those who cannot withstand the pressure try to escape, but escaping the control of the mine owners is a difficult task. If they are caught, they will suffer endless hardships and may even be forced to work in shackles, becoming prisoners who must work for the mine owners until they die. A popular folk song in the mining area goes: "Like grass growing under the ground, never seeing the sun. A carrying pole and basket pair, a rope in each hand. If the ore is not carried enough, you can't wash the ore when it rains. In spring, the days are long and the nights are short, and the crowing of the rooster makes you panic. You have to endure hunger and work as usual from early morning to late night. If you walk a little slower, the foreman will scold you loudly. The 'Sha Ding' never see the sun, eating only old mother soup. Carrying a gas lamp, with a good pole and two baskets on your shoulder. Holding a funeral stick, with sweat cloths tucked behind your ears. The supervisor watches you from behind, so there's no way to be lazy. The tunnels are narrow and difficult to walk, and you have to crawl on your hands and knees. The ore bags become heavier and heavier, and blood and sweat flow down your chest. When you reach the entrance of the trough, you can finally see the sun. You take a deep breath slowly, and cough up mud. The tunnels are like hell, and coming out is like being reborn." From this short folk song, we can imagine the difficult lives of the "Sha Ding".

Uniform Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

The clothing, food, and housing of the "Sha Ding" are all uniform. The mine owner provides each person with a blue cloth vest, a pair of socks (used to cushion their seat when resting in the cave), and a set of off-work clothes. These items are deducted from their wages in installments. In addition, they can receive a small kerosene lamp, a sweat scraper, a hand pestle, and a set of burlap ore bags. In terms of food, they eat red rice and old mother soup (soybean soup) every day. Both of these contain large amounts of vitamins, and the "Sha Ding" rely entirely on them for nutrition. Gejiu has a severe water shortage, and drinking water is a major problem. In times of water scarcity, water must be used to wash the ore, making it extremely precious. The "Sha Ding" have a saying: "Wash your face and don't drink the soup, drink the soup and don't wash your face."

The "Sha Ding's" living quarters, where they cook and eat together, are commonly called "kitchens". They are built of random stones and mud, with straw covering the roof. The four walls have no windows, and there is insufficient sunlight and air, but they are slightly better than the mine tunnels. Cruel mine owners even force them to live with mules. When the reporter leaned inside, I felt nauseous because the inside was filled with smoke and dust, and the excrement of mules and horses flowed everywhere, like being in a public toilet on the street.

Dangerous Tunnels Filled with Unjust Souls

Due to the lack of safety equipment in most factory tunnels, many "Sha Ding" die each year from accidents such as tunnel collapses. Skin diseases and other illnesses caused by humidity and filth are also common. Typhoid, cholera, dysentery, stomach problems, skin diseases, parasitic diseases, and respiratory diseases are rampant in the mining area. A folk song in the factory area says: "The factory area is damp and dirty, there are no latrines, the diet is irregular, and there is no concern for hot or cold. In May and June every year, illnesses are unusually common. Look at the desolate wilderness, corpses are abandoned by the roadside. Who doesn't have a wife and children? Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have compassion? Who doesn't have a heart? Seeing this heartbreaking scene, they forget everything for money!" This short folk song vividly portrays the miserable lives of the "Sha Ding".

Public Mine Owners Pay Attention to Welfare

The management of the Tin Industry Company is certainly more reasonable, and they strive to improve the lives of the "Sha Ding". For example, the implementation of an eight-hour work system is a fair measure. In addition, there are holidays, weekly rests, and established methods for overtime and rewards. They have also organized a Workers' Advancement Association, which includes a supply cooperative, a literacy school, an arts and crafts group, and a recreation group, so that miners can have welfare facilities in addition to work. They also pay special attention to medical and health care. These are all things that other private mine owners in the Gejiu mining area should emulate.

In short, it is a fact that the "Sha Ding" in the mining area work hard and live in poverty. For the sake of national health and labor welfare, from any point of view, we should speak out on their behalf. The goals should be to improve their wages and improve their lives!

### Appeal to the Academic Community for Self-Control and Self-Discipline

Editor: Recently, student movements have sprung up across the country, evolving from local demands to unified actions. Their slogans and propaganda have exceeded the bounds of national morality and state law, clearly indicating that someone is orchestrating them behind the scenes. Everyone knows that the country urgently needs stability at present, and only after stability can construction be undertaken. Only the Chinese Communist Party and a few dangerous elements have other agendas,妄想奪取政權, so since August of the previous year, although the government has repeatedly invited CCP leaders to discuss peace plans, the government has repeatedly made concessions, compromising and seeking reconciliation, the CCP has never been sincere, advancing step by step, so that negotiations have been fruitless. Recently, the constitution has been passed by the National Assembly and promulgated by the National Government. The National Government has also been reorganized, accommodating many people from other parties and social elites. This shows that the government is indeed actively preparing to implement constitutional government. Only the CCP and its followers not only refuse to participate in the government, but also want to overthrow the constitution that has been deliberated and passed by the National Assembly representatives. Communist troops are harassing everywhere, and the CCP and its followers are instigating workers and students in major cities to carry out strikes and demonstrations, hoping to disrupt public order and echo the Communist army. We believe that democracy should be based on the rule of law. If the implementation of democracy disregards the rule of law, the result will inevitably degenerate into mob rule. The actions of students in various places, surrounding agencies, cursing officials, interfering in school administration, and even forcing classmates to strike, completely disregard the rule of law, violate the spirit of democracy, and are clearly excessive behaviors. Good students should certainly be protected. Why aren't the rioters sanctioned? The state runs education to cultivate talent, not to accommodate rioters. Therefore, we ask the government to severely punish any level that takes excessive action. If the identity of CCP members is confirmed, they should be detained and sent to the CCP-occupied areas, so that they can no longer operate in various regions under the rule of the National Government, so that discipline can be rectified and society can be stabilized. Nearly ten of my relatives and children are currently studying at Jiaotong University and Jinan University. Because rioters forced them to strike and even threatened them with pistols, making them unreasonable, they had no choice but to ask for leave to return home to rest. I sincerely hope that the government authorities will quickly deal with this matter so that the majority of good students can continue their studies. Your newspaper is an authority on public opinion, so please do your best to advocate and urge the government to deal with it as soon as possible, and at the same time advise blindly following students that saving the country depends on knowledge, and do not be used by ambitious elements to make unnecessary sacrifices. (Respectfully submitted by reader Zhang Dihua)

Scenes from the Life of a "Sha Ding":

(1) "Sha Ding" are the porters who transport ore from the mine to the ground. This is their "residence." (2) Some "Sha Ding" are between the ages of thirteen and fifteen.

Spring and Autumn

### Green Willow Village - Continued Dreams of Yangzhou, Part 18

— Hong Weifa

Teahouses outside Yangzhou city that have a close relationship with tourists, such as Green Willow Village, Fragrant Shadow Pavilion, Qingsheng, and Zhichun, are all located on both sides of the suspension bridge in the northern suburbs. In the past, young people and women mostly liked to go to Green Willow Village, while older people preferred to stay at Fragrant Shadow Pavilion, probably because Fragrant Shadow Pavilion has a long history and an elegant name, making it easy for them to express nostalgic feelings.

Wang Yuyang's "Remembering Red Bridge" in the style of "Huanxi Sha" says: "A clear stream flows in the northern suburbs, the scenery of Red Willow is autumnal in my eyes, Green Willow city walls are Yangzhou." It seems that Green Willow is a unique symbol of Yangzhou. Since Yangzhou is called Green Willow city walls, it is natural to have a Green Willow Village teahouse to embellish it.

However, the Green Willow Village of the past is significantly different from the current Green Willow Village. The Green Willow Village of the past was almost entirely shrouded in willow smoke. White cloth flags were hung high on the treetops, with the three words "Green Willow Village" written in bright red. From a distance, it was quite reminiscent of the feeling of "a single red dot in a sea of green, captivating spring scenery needs no more." I remember my late father pointing to these three words "Green Willow Village" and asking me what I could pair with "White flag, red letters, Green Willow Village." At the time, I struggled to think of something. My father laughed and said I could pair it with "Blue stone, blue writing, Osmanthus Ridge." Unfortunately, I still don't know where Osmanthus Ridge is.

Green Willow Village faces the city river and is close to Red Bridge. Behind it is an earthen hill, which is the main road. There are no walls around it, and only a wooden sign with the three words "Green Willow Village" is erected at the entrance, which is considered the signboard. There used to be a small plank bridge here. Whenever dusk fell and the tourists had left, standing on the bridge and humming the lines "Standing alone on the small bridge, sleeves full of wind, after the setting moon in the forest, people return home," would add a lot of poetic and artistic charm.

After crossing the bridge, there is a short earthen road along the river, filled with large and small tourist boats. The more attractive boat girls wait here for customers. On the other side is a short bamboo fence. Inside the bamboo fence, there is an earthen hill, and a pavilion stands proudly. The hill is covered with bamboo and trees. Many people like to lie on rattan chairs in this area, sipping tea while leisurely gazing at the boats on the river from the gaps in the green shade, forgetting the passage of time and the disturbances of the world. This is the most elegant place in Green Willow Village, and it is also the most attractive place in Green Willow Village.

In addition, water is drawn into the interior from under the small bridge, forming a small lotus pond. On the north side of the lotus pond, there are several low houses. Each faces south and has a short railing with bamboo tables and chairs inside. From here, you can see the tea drinkers coming and going in Green Willow Village, and you can also see the boats on the river from afar. This is a place where people with families like to stay, and it is also a happy place for lovers to whisper sweet nothings. At the end of the earthen road, there is an extremely large open hall. You can fish on the side facing the river. Sparse fishing rods are reflected on the green water. The anglers have the joy of Haoliang, and the tourists who see it also feel it is elegant and pleasant. There are also some other tea-selling houses, but they are all located inside, far from the river. From the perspective of sightseeing, they are not as good as the above three places.

Unfortunately, these situations are all in the past. The short earthen road in Green Willow Village has become a pedestrian avenue. The small bridge is gone, and so is the bamboo fence. Many of the bamboo and trees have been cut down, and there is no longer any willow smoke. In addition, the side facing the river is surrounded by a short wall. Occasionally entering it, it is a desolate scene, and there is even the feeling that the plank bridge is "not very visible in the sky." It is said that after the Anti-Japanese War, the owner has changed. Perhaps the minds of the old and new owners are different, which is why Green Willow Village has changed so much, not only because of the chaos of war!

### The Realm of Art

— Yu Heng

Due to the development of art, although直觀arts such as sculpture and painting can give people a sense of satisfaction to some extent, their realm, in their essence, at most only achieves "beauty." However, the realm of "beauty" alone is narrow. Therefore, some aesthetic works are not easily appreciated by the public.

Since the aesthetic nature of art has problems, it is of course necessary to expand its realm. Thus, the two realms of truth and goodness appear. This enriches the content of literature and art.

### Short Note

— Li Weichu

Starting yesterday, the most painful day of your life will also be the day I remember most deeply. At the same time, it is also the first time I have seen the most solemn impression of the end of life. I will never forget it!

Without a hint of falsehood, my heart was most sorrowful yesterday, because it was the first time I met the most kind mother, the most gentle mother, the most enlightened mother, Wei Ci! Although this mother is yours, from the first time we met, we planted respect and love. There is solemnity and emotion. Children all over the world love this kind of old person. Didn't I once frankly express my envy to you? And didn't you say: "All mothers in the world are equally great?" How long ago was that…… So I cannot restrain my tears. Every memory increases a burst of grief.

Yesterday, I returned home for a long time and still couldn't erase the scenes I had experienced. Waking up in the morning, recalling the kind face, the gentle smile, the soft and quiet voice, I couldn't help but shed a few tears again, Wei Ci! I turned to think of you; suddenly losing so much, so great, so profound, so heavy, so important all of this, every time I saw a scene that evoked memories, I thought of your sorrow! Poor child, how can you bear it! But, Wei Ci! I want to comfort you! Life is ruthless, the physical body cannot last forever, and the shell will always disappear and be destroyed, but the spiritual life of the old people lives in the hearts of each of your children.

Writing these few lines, I originally wanted to comfort you, but at this point I don't know how to express it! You are an extremely intelligent person, and you will be able to free yourself from the sorrow and pain that this world has given you. You must think that your mother is still living in this room, she can hear your weeping, and she can also see your tearful face, so you must live as she used to love you.

Wei Ci! How many times have I thought of the impermanence of the physical body, the impermanence of life, and the ruthlessness of the destruction of life! My soul wants to escape from this world and ascend, so for so many years I have not been able to live like the secular world, and for so many years, I am still tirelessly writing, being a person, and arduously pursuing an ideal, an immortal truth, Wei Ci! Youth and beauty are lovely and moving, but they are also fleeting, so they are the least reliable. The physical body and matter cannot last forever, so it must disappear and be destroyed. No matter how much sincere love, weeping and wailing, can bring back the ruthlessness of the departed life! Taking away the dearest person and the loving heart. Therefore, for so many years, I would rather endure material hardships and endless torment, but also pursue a kind of ideal spiritual life, that is eternal and immortal!

I often think: if I had been born twenty years earlier, with my thoughts, emotions, and personality, I would definitely have entered the empty gate and converted to the Three Truths. But in this era, I am going to tirelessly and unyieldingly pursue an eternal and immortal existence. If you think like this, think about these things, maybe you can slightly reduce the sorrow in your heart? You know, Mom hasn't gone, Mom is scattered in your lives, so you must take care and cherish yourself!

I want to comfort you well, don't provoke your sadness, but if you want to cry, just cry; good Wei Ci! Crying may make you feel better. But, you must take care, don't let Mom worry in that world, and take care of each other in this world, as Mom loved you in the past.

These days, I want to see you, send my concern to you, and greet your other three people, bless you!

### Waste

— Zang Zan

At dusk or twilight, in the city or the countryside, we often encounter a person who carries a box filled with discarded items that are precious to him.

Waste? Apart from the arguments in books about "waste utilization," these useless things are by no means waste. Like zero and infinity, which can never be grasped, the closer something is to uselessness, the more infinite hopes it can be placed upon.

A broken tile, a small stone picked up from the riverbank, a piece of green glass bottle, a piece of patterned cloth, a tin can... If people haven't forgotten their childhood, these treasures would be treasured in their pockets, just like adults carrying locked leather bags.

After becoming "adults," we occasionally encounter these situations again: when we see two children quietly talking to a cardboard box or a blade of grass, we might laugh, not a knowing laugh, but feeling that the children are too naive. After the children become adults, we cleverly replace those waste items with banknotes, which are more useful. From then on, we close the door to that belonging to the innocent fantasy, but can it be closed?

Never, a stamp or a ticket stub with a corner cut off, a maple leaf or a petal replace those glass and tiles.

People put down this and then pick up that, until they are old: an old woman has a string of prayer beads, and an old man has a fake antique. A strand of hair, a cigarette butt, and a handful of sand become the most meaningful and priceless objects in the world.

A mushroom, overnight, makes millions of neat little folds, even the most incredible sculptor is surprised. The creation of a flower and a fruit is an engineering project that lasts for years and months. Even the smallest and most insignificant thing may contain a universe, and even the most rigid and immobile thing has life.

This life, this universe is less on top of these things than it is in our hearts. Life always has to have a basis, but a confidant, a lover, no one is as loyal as these little things.

A grain of sand contains a world. A handful of soil ignites the passion of a musician, the hardships and joys of a vast land; a work of nostalgia and anger appears. A handful of soil falls into the hands of a sculptor, and he捏makes his wish, an "學西"and a "巴爾扎克"流出from his hands.

Cherish these trivial things, don't laugh at the rag pickers.

### Random Notes on Poetry

— Keng Qiang

Poetry is a bee with a sting, it uses honey to soothe good souls and stings to pierce false masks.

### Words from the Bi Xiang Pavilion

— Chen Jiaqing

To the Tune of *Man Ting Fang* – Sitting by the Moon

Dew wets the murmuring whispers, cold chills jade arms; a clear sky is neatly divided. Leaning on the balustrade, the flower shadows are naturally graceful. Ten thousand miles of boundless sky is like water, beyond the distant mountains, neither mist nor smoke. Raising my cup, I toast, this fine night of the fifteenth, people and moon perfectly round. Entwined, infinite thoughts, difficult to convey with brush and ink, I idly compose on silver stationery; yet I sit facing the beauty, secretly regretting her splendor. I wish to call upon Chang'e to rise and dance, but the Lunar Palace is far, who can gather all the immortals? At the place of gazing, containing affection, wanting to speak, leisurely appreciation prevents sleep.

To the Tune of *Chu Jiang Qiu Dan*

The Chu River is serenely clear in autumn, just as evening skies are clean of clouds, a season of light cold. With hands behind my back, the west wind comes and goes, startling the red leaves tinged with frost. Wild grasses entwine with yellow, sparse woods fade to green, a vast landscape of smoky villages. Bean flowers and thatched cottages, who painted them with such pure and exquisite beauty?  Alas, time flows like a steed glimpsed through a crack, childhood revisited, years passed in empty review. I wish to borrow Lu Yang's hand to hold back the setting sun, awakening heroes of the Central Plains. Such mountains and rivers, such scenery remains, how can I bear to see the golden goblet incomplete? On the road home, without words, a chest full of shattered bright moonlight.

### Shakespeare: Sonnet 57

— Translated by Zhen Qin

Being your slave, what should I do, if not to serve you, according to your pleasure? My time is utterly worthless, and I have nothing to do but await your command, my emperor! As I keep watch over the clock for you, I dare not curse the endless time, nor speak of the bitterness of painful separation. If, once, you bid your servant farewell! I dare not, with jealousy, inquire where you have gone, or guess at your delights, but like a sorrowful slave, without a single thought, only think: that you make those around you rejoice. Love is truly like a fool, no matter what you do, he always believes you mean well, and nothing more. Neither bronze, stone, earth, nor the vast waves, can escape being ruled by death, how then can beauty, whose power is weaker than a flower, resist that stern death? Oh, sweet summer breezes, how can they withstand time's daily violent assault, when even rocks and steel doors, however strong, must be destroyed by time? Oh, terrible thought! Time's truth, alas! How can one escape being gathered into time's coffers? Which powerful arm can pull back his swift feet? Who can forbid his act of plundering beauty? Oh, no one can, unless this miracle has the power to make my love forever bright in words. When I am dead, grieve for me no more, only when you hear the mournful knell warning the world that I have left sin and gone to dwell with worms. When you read this poem, do not think of the hand that wrote it; for I love you too much, and if you thought of me you would suffer, so I wish to be forgotten in your sweet thoughts. Oh, I say, when you see this poem, if I am already lying with the soil; then please do not speak my name; it would be best if your love were buried with me; lest clever people see through your sighs, and after my death ridicule you with it.

Sonnet 73 You can see this season in me, when the yellow leaves have all fallen, or a few still hang on the branches that tremble in the cold, the desolate choir loft of the birds of yesterday. You can see such an evening in me: when the light of the setting sun has already declined to the west, and night, like the incarnation of death, slowly drives away dusk, locking everything into peace. You can see this kind of fire in me, burning on the ashes of its own youth, like the bed it must die on, destroyed along with the fuel that feeds it. Seeing these things, your love will grow stronger, loving well what you are about to lose.

Sonnet 87 As waves rush towards the shore, so does my time rush towards decline; each minute taking away the one before, contending to move forward in haste. My guiding star first allowed me to be born in the sea of light, heading towards the peak of maturity, yet eclipses insist on competing with it, and time reclaims its old gifts. Time pierces the splendor of youth, digging wrinkles on the brow of beauty, devouring rare natural beauty, everything is cut flat by its knife. Away with its poisonous hands! My poems will still praise you in the future.

### A Painting of Weary Sighs

— Xu Ju'an

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood (516)

— Ye Jingfeng

"Oh, what's happening now?" Hejian asked, flustered.

"I'm afraid these few characters aren't listening, and are acting up again... But it doesn't matter..."

Shouyi had just said this when he heard two light taps on the door. Before he could answer, the door had already opened. It was Zhengyan who had come; his expression was extremely anxious.

"Team leader, '012' and '02' both have urgent messages, asking the team leader to issue orders quickly. They say things are likely beyond salvage! ... They suspect that the Konoe cabinet has already signed the departure order..." As he spoke, Zhengyan's expression became even more tense.

"I know, Lao Yan, but what can one person do? ... But at twelve o'clock, no matter how things are here, whether Pingzi can get out, and no matter what instructions are hidden in Elder Aoki's ink circles, I have no choice but to use my old trick to give them a big shake-up. Whether it's effective or not, we'll just have to leave it to fate."

Hejian's old trick, of course, was to use telecommunications to create several false messages that would be unfavorable to the Japanese launch of their grand plan. First, he would try to pour cold water on their raging flames of private desire, perhaps sweeping away some of the military's enthusiasm, and putting the planned schedule on hold for a while.

"It's easy to handle now," Shouyi said suddenly. "Just now I was thinking; assuming we rushed to Hongzhen, there's no one here to relay the message. I'm afraid that Li Ming and the others on both sides, and the two groups of people we've already launched, will be waiting in vain on the Bund at the appointed time - they must wait for the two of us to arrive before heading towards Hongzhen... If we don't hurry there now, look, it's only nine forty-five, if we don't hurry there, I'm afraid that group of mischievous ones will start before us, and ruin the big plan."

It turned out that Shouyi had not heard Hejian's telephone message. At this time, he was still thinking about the problem on the Hongzhen side. His mind was focused, and he didn't pay attention to Zhengyan's report, and Hejian's opinion, so he only paid attention to the local situation; "I think, let's leave now, and let Zhengyan guard here... If they have a phone call, ask them to quickly go to Hongzhen to provide support, and tell them that the plan has changed, and we have to go ahead first."

"Why not call our three sides right now, ! Bai Ren Manor, Han Fang, Ben Ming -?" Hejian suggested.

"It's too late... They've all set off separately and piecemeal in advance, they're all on the road now, there's no way to make phone calls... It's okay, let Zhengyan go to the Bund first," Shouyi changed his mind again, "If our people come, the password is '0915,' after passing the password, tell them to rush there separately, anyway, we've already spread out our lines of scouts on the Hongzhen side."

"Team leader," Zhengyan was driving the car, speeding towards the Bund, when he suddenly called out to Hejian.

"What?"

"Wasn't that maid at Wansui Hall off duty and going home?"

"I know, didn't you tell me that?" Hejian replied in the back compartment.

"Didn't the team leader pay some attention to that maid?"

"Yes, I suspect her actions are unusual; didn't you say she's also a veteran worker in the Han Fang group?"

"That's right, but..."

"What's wrong?" Hejian heard that Zhengyan's words had something more to them.

"She committed suicide!"

"Oh... Why?" Hejian was taken aback.

### Idle Talk from a Moored Boat

— Wang Cong

As the poet says well:

"In such a world, whether good intentions, kindness, friendship, love, loyalty, compassion... beside the evil of self-interest, money, privilege... etc., has completely lost its color, the greed and hunger before one's eyes cannot be healed by distant love. The values recognized by the world are tangible objects, while hope and ideals are mocked as foolish dreams. In fact, aren't these seemingly empty things that the dreamers are singing about today the more real reality and more perfect benefits of the future? Aren't the martyrs of ancient times considered, in the eyes of the world, as people who cannot even manage their own lives? They 'extravagantly talk' about beautiful statements, yet cannot even preserve this shattered one. Therefore, in today's secular world, true vanity is seen as reality, and true value is instead regarded as an illusion."

I have a good friend, who also explains it very thoroughly with a writer's mind. He believes that for a writer, being morbid (I think these two words should be carefully considered and appreciated by the reader) cannot be considered bad, and in a broader and deeper sense, all creators are morbid. You see, what others don't feel, he feels; what others don't consider a big event, he considers a big event; what others consider ordinary, he considers extraordinary; what others don't think is worth a laugh, he thinks is worth crying about... Isn't this morbidity? But precisely because he is morbid, he feels more sharply than ordinary people, and his explosions are more intense, thus giving ordinary people a kind of awakening, encouragement, impetus, and spur in real life. This is the true value of ordinary poets.

### First Concert by the Listening Sound Conservatory

— Sheng He

The National Shanghai Listening Sound Conservatory held its first concert of teachers and students after its relocation on the 18th and 19th of this month at the Lyceum Theatre. In addition to the choir program, the programs on the two days were different, with teachers and students each accounting for half. The concert mobilized an eighty-person choir and ten famous professors from the school to participate in the performance. This is a grand event in the Shanghai music scene this year.

After listening to this concert, I couldn't help but be ecstatic about the many new musical talents that are being nurtured. Because of limited space, here I will only give a general description of a few of the programs and performers with the most distinctive achievements.

Regarding the students, I must first recommend Zhu Yaqing's piano solo. She soloed Bach and Rachmaninoff's "E Major Prelude" and Liszt's "Opera Rigoletto Italian". Her pure and skilled technique and her ability to understand the richness of the music were very successful. The second piece was played with great appeal, showing a perfect mastery. Secondly, the baritone Li Zhishu's solo had a full tone, a wide and deep volume, and he could control it freely. His portrayal of the music's emotions was quite skillful. There is no doubt that he will become an outstanding bass in our country. Huang Tangxin's violin solo had extremely flexible bowing and fingering, and she has a good chance of becoming a famous violinist; her performance of Rode's "A Minor Seventh Concerto" was beautiful and moving, and she was able to express the emotions of the music.

Regarding the professors, this time it was very rare that we heard several famous professors' solos and recitals. The cello solo, Professor Dukson's performance of Chopin's "Nocturne in D-flat Major", was deeply moving and fascinating! It immersed the audience's emotions in a gentle, tranquil, yet slightly melancholic musical tone. Professor Foa's violin solo displayed a high degree of skill, and he and Professor Magolinsky's piano coordinated very well. Madame Magolinsky sang five pieces by Mozart, Mendelssohn, and Brahms. This outstanding lyrical soprano had a beautiful tone and excellent expression. Professor Magolinsky's accompaniment helped her a lot, highlighting the beauty of the music's emotions everywhere. What I was most moved by was Magolinsky's piano solo. He soloed two piano pieces by Liszt adapted from Wagner's opera "The Flying Dutchman". His highly polished technique and grand spirit captured the audience in the entire hall. In the slow sections, the contrast between loud and soft was clear, and the rise and fall were pleasing to the ear; in the tense sections, the power was like thunder, but every note could be heard clearly. If one closed one's eyes and listened quietly, it was as if one was listening to a piano solo by the modern piano master Paderewski. The only "chamber music" program in this concert - the trio, Professors Foa (violin), Shekson (cello), and Magolinsky (piano) played Beethoven's "Trio in B-flat Major", which was extremely wonderful. They were able to display their strengths and cooperate, making people feel deeply moved by this brilliant and powerful work of the music saint.

As for the choral program, the two days were the same, singing the "Kyrie" and "Agnus Dei" from Mozart's "Mass", conducted by Professor B Zhaozhi. On the first day, the voices of the sections felt slightly out of tune, but the results were better on the second day. These two choruses fully revealed the pious, profound, and powerful religious meaning.

### High Heels

— Hua

Male A: Who invented high heels?

Male B: A beautiful little girl, people always kissed her forehead.

### Movie Fan

— Hua

Female A: That's a comet.

Female B: What's a?

Female A: A comet. You always know what a comet is, right?

Female B: No.

Female A: A star with a tail trailing behind it, you don't even know that?

Female B: Oh, so it's Mickey Mouse.

### "Chang'e"

— Ma Gao

The author uses a folk tale to write this play, intending to satirize "Hou Yi-style" characters who are obsessed with military force through this myth. This idea is commendable, and it does indeed have many superficial successes, such as the exquisite lines, which have gained the audience's sharp "sense of the times." However, after a calm and quiet study, it is found that it only fully expresses the author's cleverness and witty talent. Because in this play, Chang'e's sorrow occupies too much of the composition, as well as too much showing off of novel and elaborate techniques. As the basic driving force of resistance - the people - in this play is merely a "supporting role that has become the main character," and it does not delve deeper into them or describe them, so that the death of Hou Yi at the hands of these pitiful insects seems a little impossible. This is not the right path for creation. Overly catering to the audience, manipulating techniques, and using the audience's intuition have the scent of speculation and profiteering.

The director appears disorganized here, and has not even determined the structure of such a play. It should be completely stylized, but the current state of the play is messy and mixed, with the set, costumes, and acting each going their own way.

As for the actors, Zhang Fa is good material, and he put a lot of effort into the character of Hou Yi, and there were some wonderful parts. Chang'e, Lü En seems unsuitable, her physique is too strong, especially when she is placed together with her three "little" sisters, it looks very uncomfortable. In her childhood, her innocence and liveliness were "acted" out, and after she was established as the queen, the audience only saw her "acting" in an ancient costume "play." Wu Gang, played by Xia Tian, ​​is one of his relatively poor performances in his several plays. He used his usual tricks, and did not have any new discoveries, so he was not outstanding at all. He Lu's Feng Meng has a spirit of integrity, but his muscles are not relaxed enough, which makes many scenes rigid.

As for the design of the costumes, I feel that there is a need for reconsideration. Not to mention that Chang'e's era is too far away to be researched, so it is just copied casually. Putting them together with the cave-dwelling set on stage is also inappropriate. Especially some of the so-called "extra" actors, even the 20th-century undershirts were seen by the audience, which seems unacceptable.

But, I don't say that this play is a bad play, why! Because it is more or less close to "reality," and this can be proved from the audience's reaction. I really don't want to say that it is a masterpiece, because it is incomplete and not profound.

### Professor Byrne on Smoking

— Cun Yuan

Why does the first cigarette of the day taste particularly good? Someone took this question to Professor J.H. Byrne of the University of Oxford's Faculty of Pharmacy. He said, "Before you smoke your cigarette tomorrow morning, you can first sit in a chair and count your pulse. After you've counted, go smoke your cigarette. Then, within ten minutes, you'll find that your pulse has started to rise, from 70 beats per minute to 80, or even 90. At the same time, if you're willing to ask a doctor or nurse to measure your blood pressure, then you'll find that your blood pressure has also risen by about one inch."

"So, if smoking is harmful, what exactly are the harms"? In response to this question, Professor Byrne said, "We are now able to prove that the nicotine inhaled when smoking excretes a hormone from the pituitary gland in the brain, which we call Holland's, allowing it to seep into the blood.

"This hormone has the following effect on the heart - the heart's action allows blood to flow throughout the body, and the thick heart wall alternates between contracting and relaxing. This heart wall is made up of many living cells, and each cell needs a supply of air to do its job. Therefore, there is also a fine system of blood vessels within the heart wall.

"The hormone from the pituitary gland can narrow these blood vessels, thus reducing the blood supply to the heart. Therefore, an athlete must never smoke while training. If he smokes, the cells in his heart will only be able to get less blood, and he won't be able to run as well."

So, are there any scientific reasons for smoking? Professor Byrne's answer is: "We know that the blood vessels within the heart wall, i.e., the coronary arteries, often have problems in the fifty to sixty-year age group. Some doctors have long suspected that smoking is very related to this heart disease. Now that we know that smoking can allow the hormone from the pituitary gland to seep into the blood, then we can easily see a possible explanation for their point of view. However, we are still unable to clearly understand whether there is any relationship between smoking and coronary artery disease."

### The Organization and Reform of Small Seal Script

— Dong Meng

Small seal script still has an important place in today's culture, and must not be ignored as an aesthetic appreciation; because official and private seals, and the most noble state seal, "The Seal of the Republic of China," are all made using small seal script. However, currently, when seal engravers want to use small seal script, they all rely on the "Shuowen Jiezi" as the only reference specimen, and there are no other books that can guide them. Therefore, regarding small seal script that cannot be found when applied, they have to imitate it according to their own psychology. As long as the form is similar, and it is close to reason, that is enough. Thus, seal engravers who are not proficient in seal studies engrave in a chaotic and unorganized manner, which is not in accordance with the system. Moreover, seals are used on documents to show faith and adherence, which is of the utmost importance. How can seal engravers be allowed to fabricate them at will? However, there is no prescribed template from the state, so it is no wonder that seal engravers do this, because they cannot find a clear path, resulting in numerous errors in people's private seals, and sometimes even official seals are engraved incorrectly. Therefore, in the current century, since seal script is still needed because of its relationship with seals, then the government authorities should take this opportunity to compile a "Nationally Approved Correct Seal Script Dictionary," adding the missing seal characters, to serve as a national seal template for all ages; this would not only be very beneficial to culture, but also a landmark reform, and it is a very necessary thing.

Now, because of the limited space, I will simply raise a few characters for discussion: for example, the surname Bian "卞," the "checkpoints" "卡," the "sail" "帆," these are all very common characters, but there are actually none in small seal script, or they are borrowed from other characters. Others such as "氣" and "乞," "刀" and "刁" are not distinguished, and "亨," "享," and "烹" are all represented by one character, etc. There are many such cases, and it is necessary to correct and distinguish them. If this humble opinion is adopted by the government authorities; then it will also be necessary for domestic seal script experts to seriously refer to it.

### The Education of Prodigies

— Tang Shan

I don't know if it's a sign of national auspiciousness, or a result of the nation's superior genes, but recently, our country has been producing prodigies one after another. A few months ago, a commissioner in Henan province was competing with others for a child prodigy. That child was originally a wandering orphan, but because he was a child prodigy, nutrients and dried goods were fought over by everyone to claim kinship. Later, somewhere in Taiwan province, another child prodigy appeared, who is said to have written a novel of several hundred thousand words. Moreover, it is a masterpiece that reflects the times and has rich content. Now, we see someone introducing a child prodigy in the newspaper again. It says that he "began to practice calligraphy at a young age, and loved to wield the brush… with vigorous and unrestrained strokes, as if dragons were dancing and phoenixes were flying," this is of course a calligrapher.

It seems that China has been producing child prodigies since ancient times. It is said that Wang Bo wrote the Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng at the age of seven, and Kong Rong, Sima Guang, and Han Yu were all child prodigies. Now that education and culture are more advanced and widespread than before, child prodigies will naturally also increase in production. But what I find strange is that these child prodigies often become obscure later on. It seems that child prodigies are only "miraculous in childhood"; after childhood, they are just ordinary people! Or even worse than ordinary people.

According to the views of biology, any good seed must have good germination and results. Then, if one is called a child prodigy, he must also become a great talent in the future. But why do our child prodigies all fade away like ephemeral flowers? Is it really like the saying about women: "Beauty" is destined to have a short life? Or is it still the case that "he was clever as a child," but he is not certain as an adult?

Regarding this difficult question of "child prodigy" but not "miraculous person," I later got an answer from a biologist. He said: It is not difficult to make a plant bloom and bear fruit early! You only need to cut off a few more roots of it, or damage some of the bark. Otherwise, you can just give it excessive nourishment. But in this way, its life will not last long. Because it has lost the proper beauty or received too much favor!

So I thought that the loss of our child prodigies is also the same! In society, for a child who "has a special talent in childhood," if he belongs to the class of wealth and power, his parents and relatives will naturally keep him in the greenhouse. If he comes from a poor family, there will also be a group of well-meaning people to take care of him. But these people who hope their son will become a dragon all hope to quickly recoup a sum of money, so the education they provide is a means of forcing growth. They either give the child prodigy excessive nutrients, or cut off his roots and stems. Such a child prodigy will eventually either have a short life, or become an "ungodly" person!

### Fighting Poison with Poison

— Guo

Madam, after you went out, the young master swallowed a stink bug. But don't worry, I've already given him a packet of stink bug powder.

### Record of a City in Peril

— Qin Shouou

Barely more than a week had passed, and Liuzhou quickly followed Guilin to become a city in peril directly threatened by enemy cavalry. Thus, as usual, came a series of evacuations, emergency evacuations, air raids, chaos, retreats, and exiles...

It was a brutally hot autumn morning. After expending tremendous effort, Old Zhu and the entire troupe—including Lan and Feifei—finally arrived in Jinchengjiang one after another.

The night before, Lan had already developed a fever and eaten nothing. She climbed onto the truck with everyone else; the mountain wind blew in gusts, and she felt her body shivering. However, she tried her best to remain calm, saying nothing, simply wrapping a white woolen blanket tightly around herself. Others mostly knew she had never been one to talk much, so no one noticed she was feeling cold, feverish, and shivering.

An exhausted Feifei was fast asleep in her arms, her plump head pressing against Lan's chest, making it difficult for her to breathe. But she didn't want to interrupt her beloved daughter's sweet sleep, so she endured it with great effort.

It wasn't until everyone got off the truck in Jinchengjiang that Old Zhu saw her pale face and her swaying body about to collapse, and he rushed over to inquire anxiously.

When he helped her off the truck, her icy cold fingers startled him even more.

"What's wrong? You're quite ill!"

Lan shook her head and gave him a bitter smile. However, she couldn't hold on any longer. Old Zhu planned to help her go to a small teahouse near the military station to rest, but after walking only four or five steps, Lan's body suddenly sank, almost causing Old Zhu to fall as well.

"Hey! Old Lu! Hurry! Hurry!" Old Zhu immediately dropped the small suitcase in his left hand and held her up with both arms, while shouting frantically at the limping Lu, who was walking ahead.

"Don't panic! It's not... serious, I just... feel a little dizzy," Lan said in an extremely faint voice, trying to comfort Old Zhu.

Old Zhu didn't say much more to her. He and Lu Qian quickly divided up on the left and right, and supported her.

Feifei was sitting in the small teahouse with Zhang Chang and the others. When she saw her mother in this state, she immediately burst into tears. Fortunately, there were many people in the troupe, and they were often wandering outside, so everyone had some emergency experience. Some called for boiling water, some fetched medicine, some coaxed Feifei… finally, after a dozen minutes, they managed to revive Lan, who was on the verge of fainting.
