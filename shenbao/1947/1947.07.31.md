### Timely Arrival of Reinforcements Completely Relieves Weifang Siege Yesterday; Besieged Bandits Collapse Under Internal and External Assault

[Special Dispatch from Jinan by this newspaper, 30th] The siege of Weifang has been lifted. On the 30th, National Army reinforcements advancing north from the Nanma and Yue Zhuang areas occupied a line extending eight kilometers east of the city to Muhu Mountain and Nunnery Mountain, and ten kilometers west of the city to Shangxia Wujing. These forces coordinated an internal and external assault with General Li Mi's troops, who had been tenaciously defending the city walls for seven days and nights, resulting in the complete collapse of the communist bandits.

[Special Dispatch from Linyi by this newspaper, 30th] The intensity of the battle for Weifang City exceeded even the recent Battle of Shanmei in Southwestern Shandong. The National Army, with a minimal force, faced fifteen times more bandits, enduring for seven days and nights. By the evening of the 29th, the east, west, and north gates of the city had all been breached by the bandits. The 30th was the most critical period, with the National Army holding only a corner of high ground in the south and Qushan in the east. At one point, communication with the rear was lost, leading to fears that the city had fallen. However, thanks to the exceptional command of General Li Mi, the unwavering advance of the entire army, and the air force's supply efforts amidst adverse weather, a fierce battle was fought continuously for seven full days and nights from the 24th to the 30th. By noon today, the main force of reinforcements from the south finally arrived at Muhu Mountain and Nunnery Mountain, eight kilometers east of the city, and the area around Shangwujing, ten kilometers west of the city. After coordinating with the defending troops within the city, they are now launching a fierce attack against the remnants of Chen Yi's seven columns, who are abandoning their positions.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 30th] The main force of the Shandong Communist bandits besieging Weifang began a complete collapse at 4 PM on the 30th. Remnants fled in two directions towards Gaoya and Yidu. The battlefield has become a sea of blood, with over 20,000 bandit corpses left behind. A large number were captured or surrendered. The weapons seized by the National Army can equip a brigade. The defending troops inside the city have now joined hands with the northern reinforcements and are currently pursuing and annihilating the fleeing bandits after defeating the main force of the Shandong Communist bandits.

[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou by this newspaper, 30th] Commander Wang Yaowu completed his inspection in Taian and returned to Jinan on the 31st.

[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou by this newspaper, 30th] Chen Yi's First and Fourth Columns, surrounded by the National Army in the Baodugang and Shanting areas north of Zaozhuang, began breaking through the encirclement on the 28th, attempting to flee towards the Teng County - Zou County border's Jiehe Train Station. The National Army is currently intercepting them. Furthermore, Chen Yi's Eighth and Tenth Columns, based in the Dongping and Xiliangshan areas, have also begun fleeing towards the Zhangwu area southeast of Wenshang since the 28th. The National Army is sending reinforcements to pursue and剿.

[Special Dispatch from Tianjin by this newspaper, 30th] National Army forces on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway advanced westward from Duliu, Jinghai, and Tangguantun on the morning of the 30th, crossing the Longgang River and launching mopping-up operations against bandit strongholds in Ding'an Wangkou Town and Ziya Town along the Ziya River. The bandit forces in the area, consisting of the 63rd, 64th, and 65th Regiments of Liu Bingyan's troops from the Central Hebei Military Region, and a prisoner conscript brigade, totaling three to four thousand men, engaged in fierce fighting until noon. Both Wangkou Town and Ziya Town were recaptured by the National Army, and the bandit forces retreated towards Wen'an, eliminating the threat to the western side of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. The National Army forces that advanced near Ji, continued to consolidate their position on the 30th and did not advance further. Automobile traffic between Jinghai and Tangguantun was restored on the 30th.

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by this newspaper, 30th] Zheng Dongguo says: The main force of the communist bandits is massing on the Pingmei Road, attempting to launch a sixth offensive, possibly in late August or early September. However, this is during the rainy season, and their movements and supplies will be hampered, making it difficult to succeed. The communist bandits have unlimited access to manpower replenishment. Although the damage in Siping was great, replenishment troops have already been sent from Jiangbei since the fighting has just ended. The National Army is currently closely monitoring their developments.

Grain Minister Yu Feipeng expressed satisfaction to reporters on the 30th regarding the progress of the conference, believing that the provincial chairmen were mostly able to follow the government's intentions. However, provincial speakers, from the perspective of public opinion, requested changes to a few areas. It is expected that this year's collection of actual grain and loans will not exceed 80 million dan. The quota for each province will be set after a decision by the General Assembly, but this will depend on the harvest in each province. In the evening of the 31st at 7:00 PM, the three leading figures of the Party, government, and military, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and Chen Cheng, hosted a banquet for all the representatives attending the conference.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] President Zhang convened the provincial chairmen attending the Grain Conference at 4:00 PM on the 30th for the second administrative meeting.

The discussion centered on the division of powers between the central and local governments, aiming to enhance administrative efficiency and reduce superfluous structures. However, no conclusion was reached at today's meeting, and a third meeting may be convened to continue the discussions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Executive Yuan held another administrative symposium at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, chaired by President Zhang.

President Zhang first reported and asked the provincial chairmen to continue to express their opinions, stating that although these two meetings may not immediately resolve many major issues, he requested the provincial chairmen to broadly present their opinions, which would be summarized, studied, and gradually improved. Subsequently, the provincial chairmen delegated Shen Honglie to speak on their behalf. Shen stated that the provincial chairmen had met again on the 29th to exchange opinions and had provided additional supplementary opinions to the issues raised in the previous symposium. In addition, the "Government Reform Plan" and the "Improvement of Local Finance Plan" proposed by the Executive Yuan at the previous symposium had been discussed and studied, and all opinions would be reported verbally again. "The main focus is on the provincial agency personnel system." After the report, President Zhang asked the relevant ministers to report on the issues raised by the provincial chairmen, starting with Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense. President Zhang then added instructions and decided to schedule a third symposium to continue exchanging opinions.

Question: Will the government try to arrange a meeting between General Wedemeyer and representatives of the Chinese Communist Party?

Question: If the CCP takes the initiative to want to talk to General Wei, will the government support it?

Answer: These are purely hypothetical questions, and I cannot answer them.

Question: Will the Chinese government concisely inform General Wedemeyer of its basic political, economic, and military needs? What does the Chinese government need?

Answer: I am sorry, I cannot tell you this at this time.

Question: Based on what General Wedemeyer has stated, what is the current attitude of the United States towards China?

Answer: General Wedemeyer's appointment to come to China to investigate the facts is sufficient to show the US government's concern for the situation in China.

Question: Will General Wedemeyer's investigation of new "facts" reveal "facts" that General Marshall has not discovered, or that the US Embassy has not known about?

Answer: Only General Wedemeyer will be able to answer this question when his mission is complete.

Question: What kind of recommendations does the Chinese government hope General Wei will make to the US government?

Answer: I am very sorry that I cannot tell you.

Question: What kind of recommendations do you think General Wei will make?

Answer: In my opinion, no one can answer this question except General Wedemeyer himself.

Question: Mayor Wu of Shanghai has called for a resolution to the Shanghai military police conflict. What kind of response will the Ministry of National Defense take?

Answer: Although this is a local incident, because the situation is relatively serious, the Headquarters of the Military Police and the Police Department have sent senior personnel to handle it in order to resolve it as soon as possible.

Question: What is the recent military situation?

Answer: Shandong was still the center of fierce fighting last week. In central Shandong, as of yesterday, the most intense battle of the week was at Weifang. The communist bandits mobilized the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Columns, another rapid column, and the main force of the Fifth Column, concentrating more than five columns of troops in total, to launch a fierce attack on Weifang. The battle is still ongoing, but the defending troops have passed through the critical period. In southern Shandong, the bandit army's First and Fourth Columns and a part of the Fifth Column have withdrawn west across the Jinpu Railway in Teng County. The connection between this group of communist bandits and other bandit armies in Shandong has been completely cut off. In western Shandong, the situation in Yangshanzhai is unknown, but the National Army to the west of that area has recovered Lingquan Town and Dongkou. As for northern Henan, the National Army has recovered Xiuwu, but the Jiaozuo coal area is still under heavy attack by the communist bandits.

### Ma Hongda to Leave for Zhangjiakou Today

### Fuzhong and Yangtze Companies Issue Statements Explaining Business Operations; Refute Allegations of Violating Import and Export Regulations

[Local News] Recent reports in newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai regarding Fuzhong and other companies violating import and export regulations have garnered significant attention from various sectors after being reprinted by Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city. Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Board of Fuzhong Industrial Company, issued a statement explaining the company's situation as follows:

Question: Has Fuzhong Company settled foreign exchange of up to 150 million US dollars with the Central Bank?

Answer: Fuzhong has only settled approximately 1.5 million US dollars in the past year and a half, of which over 200,000 US dollars were offset by Fuzhong's own foreign exchange, which can be verified with records.

Question: What is the equity stake of Song Ziliang, General Manager of Fuzhong Company?

Answer: All of Fuzhong's capital is invested by the Bank of Communications, the China National Products Bank, and the Jincheng Bank. There is no private capital involved. Song Ziliang is participating as a representative of the China National Products Bank, and I am participating as a representative of the Bank of Communications. Neither Mr. Song nor I have invested any personal capital.

Question: Has Fuzhong Company violated import and export regulations by importing automobiles?

Answer: Fuzhong's import of Jeeps and settlement of foreign exchange were in accordance with Customs Announcements No. 51, No. 55, and No. 80. Fuzhong's import of Jeep touring cars was within the quota allocated by the Import Management Committee. The Import Management Committee only allocated Fuzhong a quota of 101 vehicles for the entire year of 1946, which is less than the quota given to some other automobile dealers.

Question: What is the situation with Fuzhong's import of wireless radios?

Answer: Fuzhong is the agent of Westinghouse Electric Company of the United States. In early 1946, the Central Air Transport Corporation, in view of the need to improve its telecommunications equipment in Shanghai and various domestic airports, signed a contract with Fuzhong to purchase a large batch of telecommunications equipment. However, due to frequent strikes at Westinghouse, the delivery was delayed. The wireless radios that Fuzhong is rumored to have imported are actually the Central Air Transport Corporation's equipment. When foreign manufacturers ship goods, the bill of lading only briefly states "Wireless radios, several boxes," so people mistakenly believe they are ordinary wireless radios. I have thoroughly investigated and confirmed that Fuzhong Company has never engaged in the business of ordinary wireless radio receivers since its inception and has never imported them.

Question: Does Mr. Qian have any opinions on the cause of the misunderstanding from the outside world?

Answer: Fuzhong was established at the end of the War of Resistance. The three banks aimed to cooperate with the government's post-war industrialization construction. Before the war, all imports of equipment and exports of local products were handled by others. After the War of Resistance, the Chinese people should pay attention to managing this industry, which will definitely benefit the country's overall economy. After its organization, Fuzhong immediately took over as the agent in China for several well-known American manufacturers. Therefore, merchants with older qualifications before the war, or those who already enjoyed vested interests, felt the impact. For the sake of competition and vested interests, they fabricated rumors and instigated discord. In reality, Fuzhong's total turnover in 1946 was miserably small compared to that of the older importers. I believe that the Chinese people should pay attention to comparing the foreign exchange earned by major companies last year with the foreign exchange earned by Fuzhong. It is fair to see who earned more and who earned less.

In addition, the person in charge of Yangtze Company stated: "Yangtze Company was established in January 1946. As of the end of April this year, it had settled only over 1.8 million US dollars in foreign exchange in sixteen months, while the report stated over 180 million US dollars, a difference of a hundred times. Perhaps there was an error in the decimal point. Regarding the three wireless radios in the imported goods, legal procedures were obtained, and they were purchased for personal use. As for the return of 228 boxes of cosmetics, this did not happen. As of recently, the company has settled 1.28 million yuan in foreign exchange with the government for export business. After offsetting the foreign exchange for imports and exports, it has remitted a net amount of over 500,000 yuan in foreign exchange to the government. Allocated over 19 months, this amounts to only about 30,000 yuan per month. This amount is also not large," and so on.

[United Press, Nanjing, State] Supervisory Committee member Wang Guanwu recommended that the government should establish a special committee to thoroughly investigate the accounts of Fuzhong Company, Construction Bank Company, and Yangtze Trading Company. Wang Guanwu is one of the supervisory committee members sent by the government to Shanghai to investigate the activities of these three companies.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] At the press conference held by the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM on the 30th, when a reporter inquired about the incident of Fuzhong and Yangtze companies violating import and export regulations, Director Dong stated: "This matter is currently being investigated by the relevant agencies, and I have nothing more to say."

### Air Force Staff College Holds Graduation Ceremony This Morning

Chairman Chiang Will Personally Attend and Give Instructions

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] According to the military news agency: The Air Force Staff College is scheduled to hold the graduation ceremony for the sixth class of students at 9:00 AM on the 31st.

Presidents of universities in the capital have also been invited to attend. All faculty and students will have a group dinner, and an evening party will be held in the afternoon.

### American Newspapers Sympathize With Chairman's Remarks to American Journalists; Claim Our Current Situation is Due to Complex Reasons

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The first response from the press here to Chairman Chiang's remarks to American journalists on the 27th appeared in the Scripps-Howard-owned "World Telegram." The newspaper published an editorial titled "Fair Treatment of China." The full text is as follows: "Chairman Chiang's request that the American press give more sympathetic consideration to the Chinese problem is worthy of deep thought. The various inequalities in China's social system, when revealed all at once and measured by Western standards, can easily lead to a distorted view of the complex situation in this vast country. When Japan launched its war in 1937, the so-called Republic of China was little more than an empty term. At that time, warlords controlled various regions, and the Communist Party controlled the rest. From 1937 to 1941, China resisted aggression alone. From 1941 to 1945, China under the Kuomintang was the army under Chiang's control against the Japanese. After the end of the war in 1945, the United States immediately demanded that Chairman Chiang end his feud with the Communist Party, the method being to establish a Kuomintang-Communist coalition government to unify China. During these negotiations, there was no time to address other political problems. At the same time, when the Soviet Union withdrew from the Northeast, it turned the Northeast into a region controlled by the Communist Party, greatly damaging the Kuomintang's position. The political and economic situation in China today is more complex than it was at the end of the war, due to a combination of Soviet conspiracy, American indecision, and Chinese mismanagement. Until recently, Chairman Chiang was able to decide on actions freely within the country. Chairman Chiang must have suppressed a forced smile when he stated to American journalists that the United States also had a stake in its suppression of the Communist Party. Although the United States' understanding of this view has been belated, it has now gained widespread recognition. However, not long ago, the State Department insisted that Chairman Chiang invite the Communist Party to join the government."

### Snowflakes Flutter on Beita Mountain; Our Troops Capture One Mongolian Soldier Attempting to Assault Our Positions

[Central News Agency, Qitai, Beita Mountain, 27th (Delayed)] Amid rumors, the reporter came to Beita Mountain yesterday with Brigade Commander Han of the 7th Cavalry Brigade, staying overnight in a Mongolian yurt. Heavy snow suddenly fell late at night, and the temperature dropped below zero degrees. This morning, snowflakes were still fluttering. Alagtag Mountain, the main peak of Beita Mountain, stood tall amidst the clouds and vastness, covered in silver. Last night, our troops captured one Mongolian soldier attempting to assault our positions. The rumor circulating in Qitai for days that the Mongolian side had increased its troops by over a thousand cavalry and planned to attack us was confirmed by the captured Mongolian soldier. This morning, the reporter and Brigade Commander Han rode to the top of Alagtag Mountain and looked down at the Mongolian army's positions in Ulastai, north of the mountain. After the snow, the horizon was clear for thousands of miles. In the distance, six or seven cars were parked behind the Mongolian army, seemingly having arrived last night. According to the reporter's observation, Beita Mountain is about 200 li long and 50 li wide, with steep mountains. With the loyalty and bravery of our troops, we will surely crush the shameless attack of the invaders.

### Wei Envoy to Fly to Peiping, Then Shenyang; Bishop Yu Bin Urges Attention to the Northeast; Ministry of Economic Affairs Compiles Data for Submission to Mission

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] The US Embassy announced that Wedemeyer and his advisors will leave Nanjing for Peiping on August 1st to begin their inspection tour of the north. On the morning of the 30th, Wei only spoke with his advisors to discuss the data and documents he continued to receive. In the afternoon, he met with several guests. He had both lunch and dinner with Ambassador Stuart.

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by this newspaper, 30th] On the afternoon of the 30th, Wedemeyer successively met with Li Zongren, Wei Daoming, Feng Yan, and Yu Bin. It is reported that Li and Wei's conversation focused on arranging their inspection tour of Peiping and Hebei. (Note: The date for Wei's trip to Taiwan has not yet been determined.) Feng Yan is the Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of National Defense. He told reporters afterward that he had served as a liaison officer at Mountbatten's headquarters and had a previous friendship with Wei, so he visited him and spoke for about a quarter of an hour. As for the content of the conversation with Wei, it mostly involved the Northeast problem. Bishop Yu Bin visited Wedemeyer at 4:30 PM on the 30th, accompanied by Pan Chaoying, and they spoke for over an hour. Yu told reporters afterward that Wei first inquired about the current situation of the Catholic Church in China and expressed concern about the damage suffered by religious undertakings in the communist-occupied areas. After Yu answered, he raised the Northeast problem, stating that the situation in the Northeast has been deteriorating since the victory, and its development will have a significant impact on future world peace. He urged Wei to pay attention to this area, which has implications for international disputes, and hoped that he could personally visit the area for on-site inspections to obtain sufficient data to meet his needs. Wei expressed that he was very concerned about the Northeast and had decided to go to Shenyang. Finally, Wei and Yu exchanged views broadly on the general situation in China. Yu said that the views exchanged would not be released for the time being.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 30th] In order to provide economic data for Wedemeyer's visit to China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has specially compiled "Data on the General Situation of Chinese Industry" and translated it into English for Wei's reference.

[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] According to sources in the industry, U.P. reported late on the 30th that General Wedemeyer does not intend to seek contact with the Communist Party after he goes to North China on Friday, but he is willing to listen to any opinions presented by the Communist Party if they contact him. Because his announced tour is entirely within National Army territory, observers believe that although a meeting with the Communist Party is possible, it is unlikely to happen.

### United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Far East Regional Committee Recommends Suspending Shipment of Supplies to North China; Yellow River Disaster Relief Efforts Will Also Be Halted

[News from this newspaper] According to the Ta Mei Evening News: According to sources, due to the government's decision to blockade ports in the communist-controlled areas, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's (UNRRA) Far East Regional Committee has recommended that UNRRA relief supplies no longer be shipped to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude. That is, areas north of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Xuzhou will no longer be within the scope of assistance. Yellow River area flood relief, which was one of UNRRA's main undertakings in China, will also be halted. The original plan to provide supplies to the government-controlled and communist-controlled areas of North China was for more than 50,000 tons. As a result of this suspension, the more than 250,000 tons of supplies currently being transported, most of which are industrial and construction materials, will also be affected. It is reported that the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee has decided to temporarily suspend the distribution of supplies originally intended for North China and the Northeast until the Chinese government lifts the blockade on the shipment of relief supplies to communist-controlled areas, or until the Washington headquarters decides to provide all supplies to government-controlled areas. The capital believes that UNRRA will adopt the latter decision within a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, the UNRRA China Office has not yet issued any official announcement on this matter.

### The Saying That Xiaoshan Nanshatou Peng Township Has Completely Submerged Is Not Accurate

Tang Works Bureau Decides to Hasten the Construction of Tiaoshui Dam

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 30th] It is widely rumored here that Xiaoshan Nanshatou Pengjin Township has already completely submerged. Our reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Tang Works Bureau, who said that only a portion of Tou Peng has been swallowed by the sea tide. The bureau's engineering office is still in the town. However, observing the current situation, the submergence of the entire town is extremely dangerous. From August 1st, the Nansha emergency repair project will be completely taken over by the Tang Works Bureau. The bureau has decided to build stone-filled wooden cage embankments along the one-kilometer coastline near Tou Peng along the river to protect the shore and build Tiaoshui dams. This project requires about 1.6 billion yuan. In addition to the original 400 tons of flour for work relief, the bureau will allocate another 200 tons and allocate another 600 million yuan of public funds. The remaining half will still be raised by the local government. Currently, the flow of the Qiantang River is shifting southward, and the vicinity of Haining is already a shallow beach. This autumn, the Qiantang River tide will no longer be a spectacle here and will need to be viewed in Nansha.

Also, rumors that after the number of Kuomintang members in the National Government Committee was cancelled, the Democratic Socialist Party would request half of the eight seats were inquired about. Democratic Socialist Party members stated that this was absolutely inaccurate and had never been discussed.

The electoral district where the post is located refers to the electoral district of the county or city where their official office is located and equivalent areas. Provincial chairmen and members, administrative inspectors, and civil servants above the rank of county-level appointee, as well as military officers above the rank of lieutenant, who wish to run for National Assembly representatives in the electoral district where their post is located must resign before the start of candidate registration; otherwise, they cannot be candidates. If they participate in the election for National Assembly representatives in an electoral district that is not where their post is located, they are not restricted by the aforementioned law, even if it is an electoral district within the scope of their administrative authority, except for incumbent personnel handling election affairs.

### The Central Political Council Will Hold an Extraordinary Meeting Today to Discuss Sino-Japanese Trade Issues, to be Submitted to the State Council Meeting for Discussion Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The State Council Committee is scheduled to hold its eighth State Council meeting on the 1st to discuss two major cases: the economic reform plan and the opening of Sino-Japanese trade.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The Central Political Council held a routine meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Dai Chuanxian. First, Bai Chongxi, Wang Shijie, and Yu Hongjun reported on the recent military, foreign affairs, and financial situation, respectively. Then, the opening of Sino-Japanese trade was discussed, and Zhang Qun reported on the deliberations of the Executive Yuan on the case. Many committee members expressed their opinions, and the advantages and disadvantages of opening and not opening were studied in detail. The discussion was extensive. It was believed that the case was extremely important and that another meeting was necessary. It was decided to convene an extraordinary meeting at 8:00 AM on the 31st to specifically discuss the case. At the meeting on the 30th, those who advocated opening also expressed dissatisfaction with the original plan and believed that it could be revised. As for those who believed that it was not necessary to open, their reasons were still based on the current economic situation. It is also learned that Guo Taiqi, our representative to the United Nations Security Council, has been overworked due to his busy meeting schedule and needs a short break. The government has approved his request for sick leave and appointed Jiang Tingfu to temporarily replace him. This was also decided at today's Central Political Council meeting.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] Senator Wu Jingxu recently told reporters that he does not agree with the opening of Sino-Japanese trade. He stated that before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese emphasized economic cooperation and called for an agricultural China and an industrial Japan. At that time, our country did not accept this request because it did not want to be an appendage of Japan. Later, the War of Resistance broke out. Now that China has won and Japan is in a defeated state, and the peace treaty has not yet been signed, how can there be a victorious country opening trade to a defeated country? Moreover, we should know that the foundation of Japan's military industry has not been destroyed. What Japan needs are raw materials for heavy industries such as iron, salt, and cotton. If we open Sino-Japanese trade, these raw materials will flow into Japan, which is tantamount to assisting the reconstruction of Japan's heavy industry. The result will first endanger our country. We know from past experience that after Japanese goods are shipped to China, the political and military power of Japanese merchants will follow. Wu then raised two facts that deserve attention: one is Taiwan, which was under Japanese control for 50 years. Now that it has returned to the embrace of the motherland, it is still restless. The other is the Northeast, which was occupied by Japan for 14 years. Now the people in the Northeast live in poverty and cannot stabilize. If Japanese goods are opened and flow to the Northeast and Taiwan, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, we must not be greedy for temporary gains and create future troubles. When Wu talked about the issue of the Sino-Japanese peace treaty, he believed that we should prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism and that the eradication of Japanese militaristic thought should be carried out through re-education. We should adopt a century of control over Japan based on the ancient teaching of "cultivating people for a hundred years" to achieve its effect. As for the control opinion, Wu believes there are several points: (1) The Allied countries should set up a control mechanism in Japan. (2) Japanese industrial production should be in accordance with the control methods of the Allied countries. (3) All military equipment in Japan, especially the armed police, should be thoroughly dismantled. (4) Disguised military schools cannot be established. Wu believes that these points are the minimum conditions for control.

### Our Business Delegation Cancels Trip to Japan

[Our Newspaper Report] A leader of a certain industrial and commercial circle stated that the business delegation to Japan, which the government originally planned to send, has been delayed for too long, and the delegations from other countries, such as Britain, Australia, and India, have arrived in Japan for many days. Therefore, it is no longer planned to go. As far as the restoration of private trade with Japan is concerned, it should be a part of our entire foreign trade. Because our country has not prepared for this at all, the industrial sector is only filled with fear and has no constructive countermeasures. However, solving the problem of opening private trade with Japan cannot be done by passively opposing it. It is heard that in September this year, major commercial centers such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will elect representatives to discuss our country's entire foreign trade issues. Whether this matter is convened by the government or initiated by the people, it is a necessary move. If China wants to gain a leading position in Asia, the most ideal path is, of course, to use American capital and technology, but in the current situation, whether it is possible is still a question. Another path is to use Japanese technology under certain conditions, which is actually possible if used properly. As for those who advocate expanding the scope and quantity of the Central Trust Bureau's barter trade to replace the opening of private trade with Japan, of course, there is also a point of view, but today's democratic countries advocate free trade, and we should not go against this trend.

### Unified Weights and Measures

Ministry of Economic Affairs Urges the Bureau of Standards to Prepare for the National Metrology Conference

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The promotion of the unification of weights and measures had achieved considerable success before the war, but unfortunately, due to the suspension of metrology in the occupied areas during the War of Resistance and the destruction of the system, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to review the direction of promoting metrology work in the future, has urged the Bureau of Standards of the ministry to convene a national metrology conference of responsible persons from metrology from all provinces and cities in the shortest possible time.

### Coal Production Increase Conference Begins Registration Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] The Coal Production Increase Conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on August 1st.

### Taiwan Scientists Organize New High Mountain Survey Team

Departure from Taipei to Shanzhen today

[Our Newspaper Taipei, 30th] Following the scientific survey team to Red Head Island (Lanyu), Shih Yen-han, Director of the Meteorological Bureau here, Wang Renyu, a technician, and others have formed another scientific survey team. The destination is New High Mountain, which is completely different from Red Head Island. The mountain was originally named Jade Mountain, with an altitude of 3,950 meters. It is the only peak on the coast of the Western Pacific. After the Japanese seized Taiwan, because the mountain was higher than Mount Fuji, it was renamed New High Mountain by imperial decree on June 28th, Meiji 30th year. Due to the changing peaks and its high location, it is the most conditional observation point for meteorological observation and geophysical research. Moreover, because the mountain is the mountain with the lowest subtropical temperature, the flora and fauna and geological aspects have special research value in academia. The main members of the team are meteorologists Shi and Wang, geologist Bi Qingchang, and agricultural, animal, and plant researchers, etc., seven or eight people. They decided to take the night train from Taipei to Chiayi on the evening of the 31st, and the next morning, they will take a gasoline car from Alishan to New High Mountain. It is planned to conduct two days of research and observation on the mountain and then descend the mountain. Transfer to Taichung to return to the province. Our newspaper reporter was also invited to participate, and I am deeply gratified, because after the restoration, it is the first time for a planned research on New High Mountain, and there is no precedent for reporters to climb this mountain. The most important thing to note before departure is to prepare a woolen sweater, because the climate on the mountain is colder. Although you are sweating in Taipei, the autumn wind is still rustling on New High Mountain.

### Foshan Ship Smuggling Case, Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Decides to Investigate Thoroughly

Orders the Ship to Hand Over the Principal Culprit Immediately

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 30th] Regarding the unprecedented Foshan ship smuggling case, according to sources from the Pacification Headquarters: This ship and the Wuxue ship, which was previously involved in smuggling, both belong to the Taikoo Company. The company has not yet paid the fines for the Wuxue ship's smuggling. Now it is smuggling on a large scale again, which is obviously a planned act by the ship's personnel. In order to thoroughly punish smugglers and eliminate smuggling, the Pacification Headquarters has ordered the ship to hand over the principal culprit smugglers immediately and ordered the Foshan ship to suspend sailing until the smugglers are handed over.

### Preliminary Peace Conference with Japan, US Decides to Postpone Convening, Our Country's Reply Has Long Been Delivered to the US Embassy

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 30th] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, announced at a press conference on the 30th that with regard to the US proposal on July 11 to convene a meeting of eleven countries to discuss the preparation of a peace treaty with Japan, our reply was delivered to the US Ambassador to China on July 17, who immediately informed the US State Department by telegram. Our government also instructed the Ambassador to the United States on the same day to discuss this matter with the US State Department.

[Associated Press Washington, 29th] State Department officials recently said that the preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan, which the United States proposed to convene on August 19, has been decided to be postponed. Although the date has not yet been decided, it is being discussed and a decision can be made within days. The United States will submit a note to the Soviet Union regarding this conference. The method of the note can also be decided within days. The Soviet Union's reply advocated that the meeting of foreign ministers should discuss it. The US note will probably refute it, but it is considered that it can be issued in the form of the four powers discussing the matter in advance. However, the United States will not change its position, that is, the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission must participate in the preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan.

### Australian Foreign Minister Speaks

Opposes the Four Powers Drafting the Peace Treaty

[Associated Press Tokyo, 30th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt recently said here that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted in early 1948. He also said that Australia would oppose any suggestion that the treaty be limited to the four countries. Evatt did not mention the Soviet Union's suggestion that the Japanese peace conference be limited to the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. However, he emphasized that, from Australia's standpoint, all eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission must attend the Japanese peace treaty conference.

Evatt said at a banquet for reporters that if the preliminary peace conference with Japan is held by eleven countries, there should be no major difficulties in drafting the treaty. He believes that the meeting may be held in mid-February or March next year.

Evatt said that a peaceful settlement with Japan is not a long-term thorny issue and should be completed in early 1948. In fact, its basic principles have been agreed upon by the Far Eastern Advisory Commission and have since been recognized by the current Far Eastern Commission. The foundation of the treaty has also been laid by MacArthur's administration in Japan, as disarmament has now been practically completed.

When asked if he agreed that the conference should be held in Japanese cities such as Kyoto, he replied that he hoped that the conference could be held in a location in the Pacific region such as San Francisco or Honolulu. When asked whether the peace treaty would be easier to conclude without the participation of the Soviet Union, he replied that this was a delicate question, but according to common sense, the Soviet Union should participate, and the meeting should adopt a two-thirds majority vote.

He estimated that the Allied countries' monitoring of Japan would require ten years or more. He believed that the most effective way to control Japan's war potential was to monitor its import and export trade.

Finally, Evatt emphasized that the Japanese peace treaty must be based on the security and prosperity of the Pacific, so the Japanese economy must be made part of the overall economy of Asian and Pacific countries.

### Singapore Overseas Chinese Donate Money to Relieve the Guangdong Disaster, British Side Refuses to Allow Remittance, Acting Governor Has Agreed to Negotiate with London Again

[Central News Agency Singapore, 29th] The Singapore Foreign Exchange Bureau notified Li Guangqian, Chairman of the South China Flood Relief Association, today that the British government in London could not agree to the association's request to remit funds to relieve the South China refugees. The reason is that the total amount of relief funds remitted to China within the entire British Empire has already reached its limit, so it cannot approve any other remittances. This news was announced at the South China Flood Relief Meeting this afternoon. The people of the association were deeply angered by the British government's refusal. The association asked Li to negotiate with the Singapore government again. Li negotiated with the Acting Governor tonight, who expressed sympathy for the relief funds and promised to telegraph the London government to ask it to reconsider this request.

### A Student at Tsinghua University Stabs a Professor with a Knife Due to Failing the Exam, Arrested, Teachers and Students Confronted in Court

[Our Newspaper Peiping, 30th] A student stabbing a professor occurred here on the 26th. Jin Chengyi, a second-year student in the Department of Economics at Tsinghua University, was dissatisfied with Professor Zhao Renjun's assessment of his monetary silver science exam paper, which did not meet the professor's prescribed procedure, and was given a failing grade. On the evening of the 26th, he went to Professor Zhao's residence to argue, but was unsuccessful. In anger, he took out his small knife and stabbed Professor Zhao. Jin was arrested and sent to the authorities that night, and sent to the court on the 28th. At 2:00 PM, teachers and students confronted each other in court. Jin has been released on bail pending trial. According to Jin, he inverted the exam questions unintentionally. Professor Zhao previously suspected him of plagiarism, and he wrote to Zhao to explain his reasons. He also said that this failure would affect his public expenses for the next semester, and he hoped to re-grade the paper. The letter also said that if he was not believed, he would choose the last of the three paths in life. When arguing on the 26th, he originally wanted to invite the professor to drink and resolve the matter peacefully, but he was rejected before entering the door. In anger, he threw a wine bottle at the professor but missed. Instead, Zhao struck him with a wooden stick, so he took out a fruit peeling knife to resist and stabbed Zhao. Professor Zhao said that Jin came aggressively. At first, he closed the door and ignored him, but his son opened the door. Jin then threw the wine bottle and shouted, "I will kill him first, and then I will kill you." The wine bottle missed, and Jin took out a seven-inch dagger from his waist and stabbed him wildly but missed. Then his son injured him with a wooden stick, and two assistant teachers who happened to be in front of the door captured Jin and sent him to the police station. Both sides have their own stories, and the truth remains to be seen pending a court hearing.

### Traitorous Bandits Rampant in Eastern Zhejiang, Hindering Conscription Work

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 30th] The traitorous bandits in Siming Mountain, eastern Zhejiang, are becoming more and more rampant, so that conscription work is difficult to carry out in the towns and villages near the bandit forces' entry and exit.

Involved the Director of the Huqiu Mu Du Tax Office

After the case occurred, all circles in Suzhou were extremely indignant. It also involved Fan Xinwei and Chen Houti, the directors of the Huqiu and Mudu offices, who are highly suspected. Shen Chenglong, the magistrate of Suzhou County, and Lu Jiasan, the director of the Tax Bureau, both expressed that they would be severely punished, and the perpetrators will be transferred to the local court.

### Editorial: Calm Thinking, Detailed Investigation!

Because the Capital Central Daily News disclosed the outline of the financial and economic departments' investigation report on the foreign exchange settlement situation of Fuchung, Yangtse, and other companies, a decimal point was missed in the numbers, and the Associated Press telex miscalculated the numbers, so society was again clamoring for "tycoon capital." If there really is tycoon capital, everyone is willing to give it a head-on blow, but after calm reflection, if we rush to release arrows based on this entangled record, I am afraid it may not "hit the mark." Please everyone think calmly first, and further request the government or the Central Bank to investigate and announce the complete list and amount of those who have applied for foreign exchange settlements for import or other reasons since the victory, to verify where the "tycoon capital" really is.

According to the investigation report of the two ministries carried in the Central Daily News, from March 4th to November 17th of the 35th year of the Republic, the Central Bank sold a total of US$381,552,461.13 in foreign exchange, and another US$2,012,040.80 was sold by February 1st of the 36th year of the Republic, totaling US$383,564,501.93. If Fuchung's foreign exchange settlement was indeed more than 153 million US dollars, and Yangtse's foreign exchange settlement was more than 180 million US dollars, then the official foreign exchange obtained by the two companies reached a huge sum of more than 330 million US dollars, accounting for nearly 87% of the total foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank. This would be a monopoly that would be difficult to defend. However, the fact is not so. According to the conversation with the chairman of Fuchung Company yesterday, the company only settled more than 1.5 million US dollars, and Yangtse Company's announcement also said that it only settled more than 1.8 million US dollars, totaling more than 3.3 million US dollars, which is exactly one hundred times different from the amount reported by the Associated Press. Moreover, reading the original text carried in the Nanjing Central Daily News, it can be known that the Central Daily News missed the decimal point before the last two digits, which constitutes this "magnified one hundred times" spectacle. We discuss the matter based on the facts, and discuss the two companies' foreign exchange settlement amount based on the investigation report, and it seems that the power of "tycoon capital" is not as large as rumored, because they only obtained 0.87% of the total foreign exchange, less than 1%. May I ask, which of the larger companies or import and export firms in Shanghai today, their capital, the foreign exchange they hold, is only this small amount? Then, who is the owner of the tycoon capital? It is really a question worth noting.

Now that the financial and economic departments have investigated Fuchung, Yangtse, and other companies and issued reports, we very much hope that the authorities will continue to thoroughly investigate the complete list and amount of all foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank in the past year and a half or since the Anti-Japanese War, so that the people of the country can know which "tycoons" - including wealthy merchants and tycoons - have enjoyed the country's favor and accumulated superior capital. At least during this year and a half, the Central Bank sold the foreign exchange for 99% of the imported goods, which trading companies were they sold to? - Chinese trading companies or foreign trading companies? This is the procedure that should be taken for "seeking the truth."

Finally, we advocate that everything - including international trade - should be equal for everyone, and oppose the existence of special classes, regardless of whether this special class is Chinese or foreign. We especially want to encourage Chinese and foreign merchants to do all business on an equal footing, but we cannot just follow the foreign merchants and dislike Chinese companies or trading companies operating import and export, and strike at them at every turn. In short, we hope to make all facts public, and we must make calm and objective judgments based on the true facts.

### A Review of the United States' China Policy

Since President Truman appointed General Wedemeyer as a special envoy to China to investigate the truth about the Chinese situation, the general public believes that this is probably a precursor to the United States' impending change of its China policy. Even the Washington Post in Washington, D.C., according to the news transmitted by the Associated Press, also wrote an article yesterday, believing that General Wedemeyer's arrival in the East may be a sign of a change in the United States' China policy. The newspaper also said that this change in China policy was initiated by the lifting of the ban on arms exports to China on June 28. Whether the United States' China policy is about to change is entirely in the hands of the United States government and people, and we do not want to make any judgments; but from a historical perspective, we believe that the United States' China policy has a consistent tradition, from the announcement of the Open Door Policy, through the convening of the Washington Conference and the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, to the announcement of the Stimson Doctrine and the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States' China policy has been fundamentally consistent: that is, to maintain the emergence of a unified and strong China. What was the reason for the announcement of the Open Door Policy in the era of John Hay? It was to maintain the unity of China. By the end of the First World War, Japan dominated East Asia, and the United States convened the Washington Conference. What was the reason? It was to maintain the unity of China. When Japan tore up the treaty and established the puppet "Manchukuo," Secretary of State Stimson announced the Stimson Doctrine. What was the reason? It was to maintain the unity of China. Because the United States' consistent policy is to maintain a unified and strong China, this conflicts with Japan's policy of invading China, which eventually led to the Pacific War. This policy of the United States is in line with the national aspirations of China, so we see the Chinese and American youth fighting side by side. Therefore, this China policy of the United States has been baptized in blood. We do not believe, and we do not want to see, that this China policy will change in the world today, when the major war has just ended and the international situation is becoming increasingly unstable.

However, policy is one thing, and strategy is another. The policy remains unchanged, but the strategy changes with the different times and circumstances. Looking at the United States since its founding, its foreign policy has three aspects: for the Americas, we see the Monroe Doctrine; for Europe, not to conclude any alliances with collusive significance; for the Far East, the Open Door Policy. These three policies constitute the entirety of the United States' foreign policy. These three policies cannot be shaken and cannot be changed; but in order to implement these three policies, the strategy must be changed as necessary according to the times. The Monroe Doctrine for the Americas is no longer entirely the same as the meaning of President Monroe due to the evolution of the situation in the past hundred years. The initiation and active participation of the United Nations organization does not conflict with the policy of not concluding any alliances with collusive significance; we cannot say that because the United States participated in this organization, it has changed the traditional policy of not concluding alliances with any country. The situation in the Far East is also the same.

The United States was originally a country in the Western Hemisphere, but since the Spanish-American War, the United States has become a Far Eastern country. After the First World War, the United States became a world power in one fell swoop. Even the maritime hegemony that the British Empire was unwilling to give up was divided equally with the United States in a 5:5:3 ratio. By the end of the Second World War, the United States was the only country whose homeland had not been invaded and destroyed by enemy forces; now, it is in fact the hope of the world in the future, and it is leading the world. However, since the end of the Second World War, the United States has not had a clear expression of how to lead the world until recently; therefore, situations that run counter to the ideals of this war have developed everywhere in the world. Due to the development of the United States in the past fifty years, the United States has been very concerned about the Far East. It has a traditional China policy. If it can implement it seriously, the situation in the Far East, especially the situation in China, would not be in the current situation. What has caused this situation is not that the United States has no policy towards China, but that this policy has not been emphasized and implemented.

Therefore, when we talk about the United States' China policy today, what we expect is not a change in policy, but how to strengthen the implementation of this policy. The traditional policy of the United States towards China is to maintain and support a unified and strong China; there are various ways to implement this policy. After the First World War, we saw President Harding convene the Washington Conference, inviting nine countries to attend, and reaffirmed the Open Door Policy, which is to maintain the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty and equality of opportunity. This was indeed a wise move at the time, especially when Japan and China had the so-called Twenty-One Demands secretly signed. After the September 18th Incident, Japan established the puppet state of "Manchukuo" in the Northeast. Under the circumstances at the time, the announcement of the Stimson Doctrine was also a wise move. However, the announcement of the Stimson Doctrine ultimately failed to solve the Far East problem. Instead, Japan intensified its aggression against China, which eventually led to the Pearl Harbor Incident on December 7 and the Pacific War that followed.

The United States has its traditional policy towards China, and the situation that emerged in China after the war is inextricably linked to Yalta. The United States has a moral responsibility to strengthen the implementation of its traditional policy towards China - maintaining and supporting a unified and strong China. How should this policy be expressed in today's Chinese situation? By strengthening the aid to the legitimate government supported by the Chinese people and recognized by the great powers, and supporting this government with all its strength. More specifically: it is to implement the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan in China and the Far East. The communist bandits have isolated themselves from the Chinese people, and the Chinese people and government are mobilizing the power of the whole country to suppress the rebellion; the Chinese people are eliminating this national cancer with the greatest determination. Only under this government supported by the Chinese people can a unified and strong China emerge. As mentioned earlier, the United States' China policy coincides with the wishes of the Chinese people; therefore, the strengthened implementation of the United States' China policy is not only related to the interests of the United States itself, but also sufficient to satisfy the wishes of the Chinese people.

What we want to point out here is that the relationship between countries should be viewed with a long-term perspective; we must not allow a country's major plans to be affected by people who only seek short-term gains. These short-sighted people often limit their vision to one corner and cannot make comprehensive plans; as a result, the short-term gains they plan to obtain will also become impossible from a longer perspective. The United States is already a country leading the world, it can only move forward, not backward. How it will shoulder this responsibility is not only related to the future of China, but also to the fate of the entire human race. We hope that American politicians can make wise decisions as soon as possible.

### Reports of Turmoil in the British Labour Cabinet Are Inaccurate; Attlee Wins Vote of Confidence; There Is Absolutely No Such Thing as Organizing a Coalition Cabinet

Britain May Cut Military Spending to Cope with the Economic Crisis This Winter

[Reuters, London, 30th] The House of Commons today passed a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Attlee by a large majority. The Prime Minister requested a vote of confidence due to recent announcements in the press demanding his resignation.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee today told Labour Party leaders that, given the increasingly serious economic situation in the UK, Britain will reduce its military obligations in Germany, Italy, Greece, and other countries. When asked at the time whether British troops would also be reduced in Palestine, the British Prime Minister declined to answer.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 30th Broadcast: Prime Minister Attlee declared today that he opposed organizing a coalition cabinet to cope with Britain's current economic crisis.

[United Press, London, 30th] After Prime Minister Attlee explained the plan to cope with the national economic crisis to the Labour Party members of Congress today, the government issued a communique stating that the members expressed complete satisfaction and guaranteed unanimous support for the Prime Minister to take all measures he deemed necessary. Although the details of the plan have not been announced, Attlee will explain them in the House of Commons. Previously, according to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister will ask the national miners to work an extra hour each day in order to increase coal production. He will meet with the leaders of the Miners' Union tonight.

[United Press, London, 29th] Responsible sources said today that in order to cope with the long-term economic crisis, Britain may have to resort to cutting military spending, which will have a significant impact on Britain's position in the world. At the same time, the cabinet may decide to use 2.56 billion yuan in gold and US dollar reserves. There are also rumors that Prime Minister Attlee will announce the re-election of Congress or invite the Conservative Party to join in forming a coalition government, but officials have denied this. Attlee replied to questions from members in the House of Commons today, "I saw a shocking message about me in a certain newspaper, which is completely inaccurate." Regarding British military strength, at the beginning of this month, the army, navy, and air force totaled 1,297,000 people. Chief of the General Staff Montgomery, who is inspecting the Far East, has decided to rush back early, and may submit a plan to the cabinet to cut military spending. US dollar loans will be used up in December, and the Marshall Plan for European aid will not be submitted to the US Congress for discussion until January next year. At present, the opposition Conservative Party and the newspapers that support the government are talking about the economic crisis every day, which is by no means without purpose.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] An official of the Army Department said today: This place will pay close attention to the sudden decision of Marshal Montgomery to return home. It is said that any large-scale reduction in British military personnel may affect the entire situation of world defense. The United States and Britain still have a shared responsibility in the Mediterranean, it is said.

### US House Forms Special Committee to Investigate the Economy in Europe and Asia; Nineteen Members Will Depart in August

[US News Agency, Washington, 29th] House Speaker Martin (Republican member of Massachusetts) recently announced the appointment of a special committee composed of nineteen House representatives, which will leave the US in August to investigate the current economic situation in Europe and the Far East.

This committee will be led by Eaton, chairman of the House Republican Foreign Affairs Committee. After announcing the appointment, the Speaker of the House issued a statement saying: "Congress needs to collect as much accurate information as possible on the situation in Europe and the Far East, and at the same time needs the most accurate arguments from those who are in the situation. For this reason, we have appointed a special committee to visit Europe and the Far East for inspection, and report at the second meeting of Congress. According to the second meeting has been scheduled to be held in January next year, following Martin's speech, Eaton said: In order to discuss the development of the Marshall Plan for European aid, Congress may reconvene as early as "early October." The special committee will go to Europe on August 27. The committee's investigation plan has not been announced. It is reported that the time spent abroad has been set for five weeks. The work of the committee will closely cooperate with the House Military Service Office and the Foreign Affairs Committee. The latter two are also institutions planning foreign investigation matters. Representatives of the Foreign Affairs Committee account for four of the special committee

(6) Eaton has also appointed Congressman Herter as the vice chairman and general affairs director of the meeting. Due to health reasons, Eaton may not be able to go to Europe in person, and everything will be presided over by Herter. When Eaton mentioned China, he said that the future of the Far East lies in the United States and China. If the United States can help China achieve industrialization, it will be one of the greatest advances in history. He also said that the current situation in Korea is tragic and dangerous, which has never been seen in world history, but Eaton did not explain this further.

### Britain to Allocate Large Sums to Develop Colonial Economy

[French News Agency, London, 29th] British Colonial Secretary Jones declared in the House of Commons today: Britain will allocate 300 million pounds to various colonies in the next ten years to develop their economies.

### India and Australia Successively Suggest to the Security Council to Mediate the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute; Britain and the United States Oppose Taking Drastic Measures

[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] The Indian government has already sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations Security Council today, raising the Indonesian crisis. The telegram was originally intended to be sent yesterday, but was delayed by one day at the request of the British government.

[Reuters, Canberra, 30th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley told the House of Representatives that the Australian government has instructed its representative to the United Nations Security Council, Hodgson, to urge the United Nations organization to pay attention to the situation in Indonesia. Australia is deeply concerned about the development of the Dutch East Indies, as the situation there threatens Australia's post-war peaceful development. Therefore, the representative to Lake Success has been instructed to raise this issue with the Security Council as soon as possible. It is my opinion that the Anglo-Egyptian issue still has a legitimate and effective treaty in place, so it may be postponed for a while. In Indonesia, we are already facing actual war. The consequences of delaying this conflict are truly incalculable. Therefore, I have decided to ask the United Nations organization to intervene in this dispute. Australia may raise this matter before India. We believe this is a decisive and important event that cannot be delayed for even a moment. Australia is in constant contact with the Commonwealth countries on this matter and has received encouragement from the United States. Chifley also said that Australia will soon supply Indonesia with Red Cross supplies, and a number of aircraft will be allocated for this purpose.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] A State Department official recently said that the United States "may" support India's request for the United Nations to take action to peacefully resolve the Indonesian situation. However, he solemnly pointed out that this does not mean that the United States will necessarily support everything India claims. It is believed here that India may ask the United Nations to take more forceful action before taking milder measures that Britain and the United States are willing to support. After exchanging views on the Indonesian situation, Britain and the United States agreed to take swift action, but denied that Britain or the United States intends to bring the case before the United Nations.

[Reuters, The Hague, 29th] Officials here recently denied the report by a certain news agency that China had suggested mediating the Indonesian dispute, saying that China had not made such a suggestion. However, officials confirmed that the Chinese government had expressed concern about the safety of Chinese people in Indonesia. The Dutch side has replied to the Chinese government, informing them that detailed instructions have been issued to all Dutch military commanders to strictly protect the lives and property of Chinese people.

[United Press, Batavia, 30th] The Dutch military today released a war report stating that Dutch amphibious forces have launched a new campaign near the northern tip of Sumatra, entering a rich agricultural area. According to Japanese sources, Dutch troops moved fifteen miles south from Lawang towards Malang at dawn today, and the area is feared to fall by dusk.

### The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Emergency Measures to Protect Overseas Chinese; Unanimously Advocates Sending Troops to the Dutch East Indies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After the outbreak of the war in the Dutch East Indies, the lives and property of overseas Chinese have suffered severely. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission attaches great importance to this and, after repeatedly consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has made a request to the Dutch government to effectively protect our overseas Chinese citizens. On the 29th, Liu Weizhi, the chairman of the commission, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the Executive Yuan's political meeting, requested the passage of a resolution to allocate 1 million guilders in Dutch currency for emergency relief. On the 30th, the commission convened a meeting of senior officials to discuss the issue of protecting overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and unanimously advocated that the government immediately send troops to protect them, and requested an additional allocation of 2 million guilders for emergency relief. On the 30th, the commission convened relevant agencies to discuss practical emergency measures to protect overseas Chinese.

### The Soviet Union Exercises its Veto Against the Establishment of a Balkan Monitoring Group; The United States Declares it Will Take Further Action

[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 29th] Soviet representative Gromyko today used his veto in the Security Council to oppose the American proposal to establish a border monitoring committee in the Balkans. When the Council voted on the draft resolution chapter by chapter, Gromyko sat still for half an hour, taking no action, so the council members thought that the Soviet Union would not use its veto. Unexpectedly, Gromyko suddenly used his veto, causing all the previously passed introductory chapters to be discarded. This is the eleventh time the Soviet Union has used its veto in the Security Council.

Afterwards, US representative Johnson suggested adjourning the meeting so that the representatives could consult their governments on this "extremely serious situation". British representative Law seconded Johnson's motion, and the Security Council announced that it would reconvene at 7 pm Standard Time on Wednesday (4 am Shanghai time on Thursday). After the meeting, US representative Johnson declared that the United States did not consider the matter closed because of the Soviet Union's use of the veto. The hasty use of the veto does not change the situation in the Balkans. The US government will, as soon as possible, consider the actual situation and propose the next course of action to the Security Council. The abuse of the veto by major powers to undermine the will of the majority may encourage troublemakers in the Balkans. The Balkan Special Committee and the majority of members and councillors of the Security Council believe that the situation in northern Greece seriously threatens peace, so the Soviet Union's action has created a serious situation. It is reported that the delegations of major countries have requested instructions from their governments to deal with this situation. Before Gromyko used his veto, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria had notified the Security Council, stating that they could not accept the establishment of a Balkan border investigation committee, for the following reasons: (1) The real cause of the turmoil in Greece is internal; (2) The United Nations Charter does not allow the Security Council to exercise control over independent countries; (3) The Charter also does not allow the Security Council to force other countries to accept its proposals.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] It was learned today that after the Soviet Union used its veto in the Security Council regarding the American proposal to establish a semi-permanent inspection group to monitor the Greek border, officials here are now seeking new actions and resources to respond. US representative Johnson has been ordered by the State Department to return to Washington for consultations. It is possible that Greece will individually invite members of the Security Council to send inspectors to monitor, and it is reported that Britain and the United States are currently studying this. However, authoritative sources made it clear that the US government insists on handling the entire Greek issue within the United Nations framework. The United States will argue that the disputes between Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria have already disturbed world peace, and therefore the United Nations organization must take decisive action and propose some new plans to the Security Council.

### World Bank to Support the Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe, President McCloy Declares

[US Information Service, Washington, 29th] International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President McCloy said today that the bank will use its resources to follow Secretary of State Marshall's plan and cooperate with the European economic cooperation determined by the Paris Conference. McCloy emphasized that the bank is not involved in the political aspects of the industrial reconstruction plan. The bank is concerned with stimulating general production, because restoring trade is the top priority everywhere.

He said that because most of the loan applications received by the International Bank cite the need for coal, the bank will pay close attention to the discussions between British and American representatives in Washington on increasing coal production in the Ruhr region. At the same time, the State Department announced that British experts participating in the discussion of the Ruhr coal production issue will leave Britain this week, and negotiations can begin as soon as possible. When asked what impact the war in Indonesia would have on the Netherlands' application for a loan, McCloy said that the application was submitted before the outbreak of the war. He pointed out that the approval of the loan depends on the economic basis, and the bank does not take any position on what is happening in Indonesia. The Netherlands has requested a loan for a three-year economic development plan, but the amount of the loan and the details have not been finalized.

The World Bank Releases a Balance Sheet Report

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The World Bank said today that it has submitted the balance sheet as of June 30, 1947, to the governments of 44 member states. The report shows that the bank's capital is US$1,604,900,000, with a total loss of US$938,647.

### US Mission to Greece Drafts a One-Year Plan

[United Press, Athens, 29th] US mission to Greece leader Griswold recently said at a press conference here that although the plan currently being drafted by the mission is limited to one year, the work we are doing will exceed this time limit in terms of effectiveness. Regarding the handling of the Greek budget, although the case has been started since April 1, it has now been extended to 15 months to accommodate the mission's one-year task.

### Greece Convenes a Military Conference

[Reuters, Athens, 29th] Greek army commanders are scheduled to meet tomorrow in Volos, northern Greece, chaired by Chief of Staff General Vantikos, to discuss the general situation after the recent suppression of bandits. British military mission to Greece leader Major General Rawling and US military mission to Greece deputy leader General Lyner will also attend.

### Britain Convenes a Four-Power Meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers; The United States, France, and the Soviet Union Accept the Invitation to Exchange Views on the German Issue

[Reuters, London, 29th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the Soviet Union has accepted the British government's invitation to hold a four-power meeting of deputy foreign ministers in London in early October to discuss the German issue. The British government's invitation was sent simultaneously to Washington, Moscow, and Paris three weeks ago. The Soviet Union was the first country to formally express its acceptance.

Observers believe that the development of the negotiations between Britain and the United States on the future economic situation of the British-American zone in Germany indicates that the hope of establishing a four-power agreement on unifying the German economy is still very slim. The Soviet Union's acceptance of the invitation to participate has guaranteed in advance that Moscow will not believe that the four-power foreign ministers' meeting scheduled to be held in London in November to discuss the German issue will be changed due to the failure of the four powers to reach an agreement on the basic issues of European economic cooperation. Since the breakdown of the talks in Paris between Bevin-Bidault-Molotov on the Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe, there have been widespread rumors that the foreign ministers' meeting in November will not be held as scheduled, so the Soviet Union's promise to participate in the four-power meeting of deputy foreign ministers is of considerable significance. The British government's letter of invitation to the remaining three powers specifically pointed out that the representatives of the four-power foreign ministers, according to the instructions of the previous Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, should deal with the following three issues: (1) Preparing the procedures for the German peace treaty; (2) The German political organization; (3) The United Nations' rights and compensation in Germany. In addition, it pointed out that the Moscow Conference had requested the Berlin Allied Control Authority to submit reports on certain economic issues. It is not yet known whether these reports will be submitted to the four-power diplomatic meeting in October or directly to the foreign ministers' meeting in November.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Officials formally announced that the State Department has drafted a reply, expressing its acceptance of the British invitation and promising to participate in the four-power meeting of deputy foreign ministers to be held in London on October 1 to discuss the German issue. A spokesperson said that the reply has not been finalized, but it will be submitted to London soon.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Although the French government is still considering the British invitation to the four-power deputy foreign ministers to meet in London on October 1 to discuss the German issue, its expression of acceptance is almost certain. People here also believe that the Soviet Union's acceptance of this British invitation has reopened some of the doors that were closed due to the refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan.

### The European Cooperation Committee Intensifies its Investigation

Questionnaires Sent to the Four Occupation Zones in Germany

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The Cooperation Committee of the Sixteen-Nation European Economic Cooperation Conference held a meeting and decided to send the questionnaires that have been sent to the sixteen member states to the commanders-in-chief of the four-power occupation forces in Germany immediately. British Cooperation Committee Chairman Frank said: The Executive Committee of the Cooperation Committee decided this afternoon to send written questions with the same content to the four commanders in Germany. This resolution has been unanimously approved by the Cooperation Committee. French Foreign Ministry Economic Director A芳 has been elected as Secretary-General, and Italy's Treynorini and Sweden's Hammarskjöld have been elected as A芳's assistants. Their task is to synthesize the replies of the various members, draft a follow-up report on the European economic situation, and submit it to Secretary of State Marshall before September 1. The sixteen member states and the four occupation zones in Germany are required to submit their replies to the written questions before midnight on August 3. Although the content of the questions has not been announced, judging from the general guidance memorandum, it can be known that the German regulatory authorities should provide figures for Germany's steel production and required coal in the next four years.

### The Soviet Union Collects German Assets in Hungary; Britain and the United States Protest to the Soviet Union; The Soviet Union Wants to Establish Closer Economic Relations with Italy

[Reuters, London, 29th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government has protested to the Soviet Union regarding the Soviet Union's collection of German assets in Hungary as compensation. This note has been submitted to the Soviet government by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Peterson. Although the Potsdam Agreement and the Hungarian Peace Treaty have stipulated that all German assets in Hungary should be used as compensation to the Soviet Union, the British government believes that these assets should not be collected immediately before the Hungarian Peace Treaty officially comes into effect. It is reported that the US government has also taken similar actions against the Soviet government.

[Reuters, Rome, 29th] Reliable sources in the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Soviet Ambassador to Italy, Kestilev, has suggested to Italian Foreign Minister Sforza that an Italian economic delegation be sent to Moscow to conduct economic negotiations with the Soviet Union. Kestilev told the Italian Foreign Minister that the Soviet Union hopes that the two countries will establish closer economic relations, and stated that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the ratification of the Italian Peace Treaty is that the four powers can only deposit the instruments of ratification for the Italian Peace Treaty after the Italian Parliament has ratified the treaty itself, so that the treaty can take effect. It is expected that Foreign Minister Sforza will announce the points made by the Soviet Ambassador to the Italian Parliament tomorrow.

[United Press, Rome, 29th] Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 29th that when Italian Foreign Minister Sforza met Soviet Ambassador Kestilev on the 27th, he informed him that the Italian government hoped to ratify the Italian Peace Treaty, and that Italy's participation in the Paris Conference did not have any anti-Soviet intentions. The spokesperson denied reports that Kestilev had expressed that the Soviet Union did not approve of Italy's actions, and said that this issue had not been mentioned.

### Hungary Prepares for General Election; Four Parties Organize a Joint Front

[French News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 29th] The Ministry of the Interior recently announced that Hungary is scheduled to hold a general election on the 31st of the month. The four major political parties participating in the coalition government, such as the Smallholders Party, the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Peasants' Party, have decided to organize a joint front, called the "Hungarian National Independence Front General Election Grand Alliance".

### Royall Departs for Germany; Will Discuss the German Issue with Clay

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] US Secretary of the Army Royall departed for Germany today. The purpose of this trip is expected to resolve the differences in opinion between the head of the US military government in Germany, General Clay, and the policy-making bodies of the State Department. It is reported that the main dispute between the two is over the German industrial production level plan drawn up by Clay and the Deputy Commander of the British zone, General Robertson. It is said that General Clay is quite dissatisfied with Secretary of State Marshall's order to shelve the plan, and with the fact that he did not notify Clay before informing French Foreign Minister Bidault of this action. The main purpose of Secretary of the Army Royall's trip is to prevent internal divisions within the United States on the eve of the joint discussion of German industrial levels by Britain, the United States, and France.

### The Romanian Government Orders the Dissolution of the Peasants' Party

[United Press, Romanian Capital, 29th] The Romanian Interior Council today resolved to dissolve the opposition National Peasants' Party and has been approved by the National Assembly with 294 votes to one. This resolution will be officially announced by order on the 30th, and will take effect immediately. At that time, the party headquarters throughout the country will be taken over by the Romanian authorities, and its property will be liquidated. According to reliable sources, the leader of the party, 孟, was originally being watched in his nephew's house, but is now officially detained in prison. Romanian Minister of the Interior Georgescu recently delivered a lengthy statement to the National Assembly, accusing 孟紐 of leading his party to engage in activities that weaken national sovereignty, endanger peace, and launch civil war. It stated that the actions of the Peasants' Party were in collusion with certain reactionary forces abroad. For example, during the election held in November 1946, the Peasants' Party attempted to create riots and assassinations to prevent the free expression of annual intentions, in order to create a pretext for attracting foreign intervention.

### South Korean Communists Brew Revolution; Extreme Anxiety in Seoul

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] According to United Press Vice President Johnson, the situation in Korea is not bright. The people of Seoul are panicked, and the Communists will encourage revolution in the US-occupied area. Johnson, who participated in a tour of the Far East by the US press corps, reported from Seoul that there was a terrible outbreak of a Korean Communist revolution. The US occupation army in Korea is bound to fight against the Korean Communists. "It goes without saying what the outcome of this conflict will be."

Johnson quoted American soldiers who had retired from European operations as saying that what they saw in the East, only Seoul was the most like a battlefield. Although the two sides are patrolling with troops at the 38th parallel, the Communists in the north are sending 1,000 well-trained party members to the US-occupied area to join the Communists in Seoul to incite riots. Johnson concluded that the struggle between the two ideologies that divide the world is sharper in Korea than in any other country.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Kim Young-gang, chairman of the Korean Affairs Research Association, returned here today after inspecting southern Korea.

### The Japanese Hidden Supplies Case: Communist Party Points Finger at Prince Higashikuni, Implicating 50-60 People

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] Regarding the hidden supplies case, since the Tokyo Metropolitan Police discovered forged seals belonging to Liberal Party Diet member Seito Hiroichi, former Vice-Chairman of the Economic Stabilization Board's Hidden Supplies Disposal Committee, and Tsuki Gaku, a former Ministry of Foreign Affairs official and unsuccessful Liberal Party Diet candidate, in the stamp section of a certain department store in Ginza, the number of people implicated has reached as many as 50-60. Among them are black market peddlers, managers, company presidents, police officers, retired military officers, and officials of various ranks. It is still uncertain whether current cabinet ministers Nishio, Kazuyoshi, and Ashida are involved.

### "Original Dispute Person," Section Chief Liu of the Public Works Bureau, Testifies at the Police Station Yesterday, Provides Written Account

[Our Newspaper] Liu Junfu, Section Chief of the Public Works Bureau, the "original dispute person" in this bloodshed case, went to the police station yesterday to testify and personally described the incident to the Criminal Investigation Section of the police station. The original text is recorded below:

"At 9:30 PM on the 27th, Junfu was invited by a friend and his wife to see a play at the Jin Du Cinema. However, my friends only obtained two tickets, and I had to ask to buy one more. The theater employee said, 'No, when Xuan Tiewu came last time, he wanted to add a few, and I also said no. What department are you from? Who are you?' I took out my service card and politely asked if I could buy one more ticket. He looked at it and said with a sneer, 'No, Xuan Tiewu can't do it. You're just a civil servant.' I replied that his words were disrespectful, saying, 'Director Yi is now the garrison commander, and you keep saying Xuan Tiewu Xuan Tiewu without any courtesy. I'm going to buy a ticket with my own money, and I'm politely asking you, if you don't want to sell it, that's fine, but why be so insulting?' He said, 'What, democracy, I want to say Xuan Tiewu, Xuan Tiewu,' and shouted 'Military Police!' At that time, an armed military police comrade responded and came over. I explained the reason for asking to buy an extra ticket. The military police officer said, 'Listen to me, don't argue,' and asked the employee, 'Can you sell him one?' He said, 'No.' The military police officer said to me, 'Since he won't sell it, go, don't say anything.' I turned around and was about to walk out, and everything was fine, but unexpectedly an officer came up to me and asked, 'What's going on?' The employee said that a civil servant wanted to buy an extra ticket, and I said no, and he blamed me for being rude. I was about to explain the whole story, but the officer pushed me away and said, 'Go, what's there to say?' I said, 'Comrade, we are all civil servants. Please listen to me, okay?' At that time, a police officer interjected, saying, 'Forget it, don't make things difficult for people.' Unexpectedly, the officer got angry and said to the police officer, 'Who asked you to interfere with me? I'm an army officer. Who do you think you are? A police officer is trying to interfere.' The police officer replied, 'I can interfere.' The officer raised his hand and struck the police officer. The police officer retreated to the wall. I kept advising, 'Brother, this is a small matter. Why are you arguing? Don't say anything.' The officer lowered his hand and said to me, 'Go, it's not your business.' It was about 9:40 PM. The play had already started, and I couldn't say goodbye to my friends. I couldn't persuade them as they were arguing, so I left the theater and went home. I didn't know about the conflict that followed. The above account is entirely factual."

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee held a public meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM yesterday, attended by dozens of representatives from relevant agencies. After both the first and second options of the Port Committee's organizational outline were passed on the second reading, a vote was taken to determine which option to adopt.

After being passed on the third reading, it will be presented to the Executive Yuan for approval and then forwarded to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. In order to make the Executive Yuan fully understand, the Reorganization Committee decided to submit a detailed report on the reasons for choosing the first option. It was also decided that Zhao Zengjue, the convener of the original drafting team of the organizational outline, would be responsible for drafting it. According to Director Zhao, he is actively drafting it and expects to complete it by mid-August. Its contents will be based on the following principles: (1) The permanent port authority should adopt the nature of a Public Corporation - with administrative and economic independence, permanence, and sound personnel. (2) The business plan should include possible income and expenditure, as well as engineering construction and other items.

The organization of the Shanghai Port Committee's first option is very large. Its general principles, port area, powers, funding, organization, meetings, various committees, port authority, and other areas have been carefully divided. After being presented to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, preparations for its establishment can begin.

### A Witnessed Bloodshed Incident: A Police Officer Reports to the Speaker, Submitting a Written Report from All Officers

[Our Reporter] Yesterday afternoon, Police Officer Tong Yinzhi, who witnessed the bloodshed incident in Yangpu, accompanied by police officer Fan Baiping from the reporting team, went to the Municipal Council to meet with Speaker Pan, to report the facts of the incident. He also submitted a written report from representatives of all police officers, which stated in part: "On the afternoon of the 27th, police officer Lu Yunheng, number 6588 of the Xin Cheng Branch, was on patrol duty from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM. While passing by the entrance of the Jindu Grand Theater, he saw a crowd gathered outside, obstructing traffic. He immediately stepped forward to disperse them. He then observed three citizens inside the theater arguing with the theater's ticket inspector over two tickets. He immediately stepped forward to mediate. At this time, a military police platoon leader, Li, patted Lu on the shoulder and said, 'I am here, you don't need to interfere.' Lu responded that public disputes were the police's responsibility. Platoon Leader Li pointed to his rank and said, 'I am a platoon leader of the military police corps. I am in charge of not only civilians' affairs, but also you police officers. If you are stubborn, I will give you a good beating.' Lu said, 'I am a police officer enforcing national laws. There is no explicit law that allows military police to interfere with the police, to interfere with police officers performing their duties. You should be reasonable.' Platoon Leader Li became enraged and immediately slapped Lu twice without any consideration, and ordered the other military police to surround and beat him, while patting his chest and saying, 'I am responsible if he is beaten to death.' At this time, the Jindu Grand Theater closed its iron gates, and Lu became a target for attack. Officer Qiu Shusen from the police station happened to witness this situation and immediately reported it to the Xin Cheng Branch by telephone. The branch sent officers twice to negotiate, but without success. When Lu was spitting blood and unconscious, the Jindu iron gate finally opened, and a passerby called a pedicab to take him back to the station. Lu collapsed in the duty room, with blood gushing from his mouth. To avoid escalating the situation, the duty room only sent him to the hospital for treatment. At this time, 11:30 PM, the officers on duty returned to the station one after another, and witnessed the situation. All were indignant. More than twenty colleagues, feeling that the incident was bizarre, went to Jindu together to ask Platoon Leader Li of the military police to explain what happened. Platoon Leader Li refused to answer and fired two shots as a warning. At the same time, he telephoned the military police team on Kangding Road to send reinforcements for suppression. The news spread, and colleagues from the Lao Zha and Huangpu branches rushed to the scene with a sense of condolence. Two trucks carrying reinforcements from the eighth and ninth companies of the military police arrived at the same time. More than one hundred people got out of the trucks and immediately deployed for a bloody battle. At that time, truck number 37521, loaded with fruits, was coming from the west. The deployed military police stopped it from moving forward. The driver, seeing this, was very frightened and tried to accelerate, causing the right front tire to be punctured by a military police bayonet. Colleagues became even more enraged and stepped forward to reason. Unexpectedly, the military police used their rifle butts to beat them. At this time, another military police officer opened fire on the car and the police. Xin Cheng police officer Li Zhengguang fell to the ground in response to the gunfire. At the same time, military police officers on the upper floor of the Jindu Theater also opened fire with Thompson submachine guns from the windows. The military police fired dozens of shots, causing chaos on the road. People were screaming and running, and the sounds of footsteps became a mess."

Presenting Eight Demands

The report also put forward eight demands: (1) Punish the murderer on the spot. (2) Provide generous compensation to the families of the deceased, hold a large memorial service and build a monument. (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the country in the future. Hope the authorities will clearly define the powers of the police and the military police. (5) The 23rd Military Police Regiment should be ordered to leave Shanghai immediately. (6) Provide generous compensation to the families of the deceased and injured civilians, and cover medical expenses. (7) Compensate for all losses suffered by nearby residents as a result of the incident. (8) Punish the Jindu Grand Theater.

### Random Notes from a Traitor's Jail: Permission to Send Watermelons, Limited to One Each Time; Wu Guozhang Rebuked for Smoking; Lin Kanghou Often Loses His Temper

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, this reporter visited the High Court Detention Center, where suspected traitors are being held, and obtained the following tidbits, which are recorded: The traitors' request for watermelon and ice bricks has been going on for more than a day. Previously, the head of the security section, Cheng Ying, rejected the request. However, due to the extreme heat in recent days, the traitors again sent representatives to apply. After consideration, Director Cheng asked the head of the health section, Dr. Chen Cheng, to study the matter together. Since ice bricks are divided into machine-made ice and natural ice, which are difficult to distinguish, watermelon is more hygienic. It is said that permission will be granted to send in watermelons, but the quantity will be limited to one at a time. This is indeed good news for the traitors who want to eat watermelon.

Chen Jicheng, the former principal of Shanghai Middle School and the puppet ambassador to Manchuria, is now the representative of the first floor. The first floor is known as the "convalescent room." Those detained there are all "elderly and virtuous" major traitors, such as Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Zheng Hongnian, Tang Shoumin, Xu Weizhen, and Sun Shaokang. The daily work of the traitors is to glue matchboxes. The prison staff provides the materials to Chen Jicheng every day, and Chen distributes them to each prisoner to work on. According to the manager of a certain match factory, the products are quite well-made.

Wu Guozhang, the husband of former movie star Zhou Manhua, had a craving for cigarettes in the detention center. He somehow managed to get a cigarette and was enjoying it. However, he was discovered by a guard and taken to the security section for punishment. Wu stammered, unable to complete a single sentence. He quickly admitted his mistake. Director Cheng saw that he was quite honest and spared him, but warned him not to do it again.

Among the elderly traitors, Lin Kanghou has the worst temper and often loses it. Su Chengde, who has been sentenced to death, is as calm as usual, and his cultivation is admirable.

### Accused of Supplying Cotton to the Enemy: Wu Guozhang Gets Two and a Half Years

[Our Reporter] Wu Guozhang, the husband of former movie star Zhou Manhua, was sentenced yesterday in the High Court on charges of supplying cotton to the enemy. Wu wore a light blue striped poplin suit and bowed deeply to the court. Judge Liu read the main text of the judgment: "Wu Guozhang, conspiring with the enemy to resist the country, is sentenced to two years and six months in prison, deprivation of public rights for two years, and confiscation of property except for the necessary living expenses for his family." Wu was very depressed after the sentence. The defense lawyer requested that he be allowed bail during the appeal period. The court ordered that a written application be submitted for a separate ruling. Zhou Manhua did not attend the hearing yesterday. It is said that the reason for her absence was that Wu Guozhang had instructed his defense lawyer to say, "Don't let Manhua come, she will be good material for the newspapers."

### Du Yuesheng Invited to Broadcast: Hoping to Complete the Labor Day Movement

Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, was invited by the Shanghai All Circles' Anti-Communist Nation-Building Ten Thousand Yuan Labor Day Congress to broadcast to the citizens of Shanghai from the Shanghai Radio Station on Daxi Road yesterday. He said in part that the National Army has experienced hundreds of battles, worked hard and made great achievements. Today, they still have to go to the front line and bravely sacrifice themselves. What a tragedy! What are they doing for? They are doing it for nation-building. If we do not comfort the National Army who are fighting to quell the rebellion and build the country, how can we justify it to our conscience? The population of Shanghai, including the floating population, is at least four million. What the Congress hopes for today is only one hundred million yuan, which is less than ten thousand yuan per person on average. We use a small amount of money to comfort the National Army, boost morale, end the war as soon as possible, and let the people live and work in peace. Everyone has the same heart, and everyone understands the same reason. Why hesitate? I hope that the citizens of this city, including myself, will work hard to contribute and complete this one hundred billion yuan Labor Day movement.

### This Year's University Graduates Number 20,000: Employment Problems Awaiting Resolution; More Than 1,800 Have Been Selected and Sent to Various Provinces by the Ministry

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education, when answering a reporter's question about the number of university graduates this year and whether there is a unified plan for their employment, said: "There is no mandatory service requirement for graduates of junior colleges and above. However, the Ministry of Education has always paid close attention to the employment of graduates of junior colleges and above. Every year, it sends letters to various agencies in advance, requesting them to hire graduates as much as possible. The agencies list the various talents they need and send them to the ministry, which then orders the relevant schools to select and send them. Therefore, the employment of graduates every year, in addition to those who continue their studies, is no more than (1) introduction by the school, (2) self-employment, (3) selection and dispatch by the provinces, and (4) distribution by the provincial education bureaus (limited to normal school students). In January of this year, the Executive Yuan issued a measure to solve the unemployment problem of college and middle school graduates, instructing that graduates of junior colleges and above should still be handled by the Ministry of Education in accordance with previous methods, and the Ministry of Education has followed the instructions. There are a total of 20,359 graduates of junior colleges and above this year, of which approximately 1,972 are normal school students who should return to their provinces to serve and whose work will be distributed by the provincial education halls and bureaus. As for the employment of other graduates, as of July 7th, the agencies that have requested the Ministry to select and send them include the Air Force Headquarters, the Ministry of Transportation, the Auditing Department, and the provincial governments of Shandong, Andong, Guangxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Suiyuan. The ministry has ordered the schools to select and send 1,802 graduates. In addition, the Ministry of Water Resources can directly select 100 people from various schools, and the personnel needed by the Resources Commission will be handled directly by the commission. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has replied that many clerks are needed in the courts at all levels.

The other five strong teams have completed their schedule and their rankings have been determined. The new army, the Green Team, jumped to fourth place, which is very rare. The strong army, Qunlian Youjia, was quite unsatisfactory in this competition, ranking fifth along with it, which can be called brothers in misfortune.

### Hong Kong Disaster Relief Swimming Beauty Contest: Wu Danfeng Elected Miss Hong Kong

[Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Air Correspondent] For the past half month, Hong Kong seemed to have spent it in the rainy season, but yesterday (the 27th) the weather cleared up and the sun shone all day, so the "Swimming and Beauty Contest to Raise Funds for the Chinese and British Flood Disasters" was held as scheduled. The location was the Naval Swimming Pool, and the time was 3:00 PM.

Last year's Miss Hong Kong, Li Lan, was selected at the Ritz. In reality, whether it was the contestants or the audience, it was far from the crazy situation of last year. However, with each ticket costing ten dollars, it is said that 1,000 tickets were sold, so the amount of charitable donations was quite a lot.

The swimming program had fourteen swimming events to set off the beauty pageant, including two military performance events (originally four, only the rubber lifeboat and rescue performance were held), which were a bit of a highlight. However, the swimming competition program was too bland. Several events had only three participants, and the competitive atmosphere was not high at all. The achievements were: Liu Dibing won the 100-yard freestyle championship in sixty seconds, and Luo Diwei (British Air Force) won the 100-yard backstroke championship with a graceful performance. Other than that, there were very few exciting moments.

The last scene of the water polo competition was a water polo confrontation between Xiangzhong and Junlian. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and the result was a 4-4 tie.

The eye-catching Miss Hong Kong election was held before the water polo confrontation. It was originally reported that there were eighteen participants, but unexpectedly, only four participated in the on-site competition. Fortunately, He Xiuxian and Chen Anni joined temporarily, so Miss Hong Kong was born among these few.

Huang Lili, who was the most popular, surprisingly gave up participating, which was regrettable.

Waiting for the ladies to dress up is a boring thing, especially waiting for Miss Hong Kong to dress up. The six ladies were in the changing room and came out after a thousand calls and ten thousand pleas.

The line of candidates walked around the pool in order of appearance, but He Xiuxian (No. 8), who was tall and beautiful, led the way, followed by Huang Anqi (No. 20), then Bai Lilian (No. 21), Wu Danfeng (No. 25), Zhu Liyan (No. 29), and finally Chen Anni (No. 42).

Walking around the pool, the ladies took delicate steps, and the audience responded with applause. On the open-air stage, the military music was melodious. They circled repeatedly in front of the judges' table to await the evaluation of the ten Chinese and Western judges.

The result of Miss Hong Kong: Wu Danfeng won the Miss Hong Kong title with 359 points. Chen Anni, who participated temporarily, came in second, and Zhu Liyan came in third. Finally, Commodore McFree, the naval commander, presented the awards. Miss Hong Kong Wu's resume: Miss Wu is from Shunde, Guangdong. She is twenty years old, five feet one inch tall, weighs 103 pounds, and is a girl who is interested in broadcasting. She hopes to become a singer. Chen Anni and Zhu Liyan are dancers, and Miss Zhu is from Shanghai. There is still an epilogue, which is that the film company wants to find Miss Hong Kong to appear on the screen.

### Shanghai Oil Business Preparatory Organization: Edible Oil Transportation and Marketing Joint Company

Using Miscellaneous Grains from East China to Obtain Edible Oil from North China

[Our Report] The Shanghai Oil Business Association, in view of the fact that the transportation, marketing, and supply of edible oil in the city are often insufficient, while the supply of miscellaneous grains is quite abundant, but the opposite is true in various parts of North China, decided to form the Shanghai Edible Oil Transportation and Marketing Joint Company in order to adjust the surpluses and deficits of each other and equalize the supply of edible oil and grain in both places. The first preparatory meeting was held at the Oil Business Association at 377 Minguo Road in this city at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 230 members attended, and Gan Simin, a commissioner from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Ji Mingqi, the section chief, also attended to provide guidance. First, Zhang Chao, the chairman of the Oil Business Association, described the motivation for setting up the joint company, saying that the grain administration authorities in this city and various parts of North China also believe that the establishment of the joint company is quite necessary, so it was produced in a timely manner. Then, Gan Simin and Ji Mingqi delivered training speeches respectively, expressing their hope that they would work hard together under the new economic measures of the country to coordinate and meet the food needs of the people in East China and North China, and at the same time achieve the purpose of smooth flow of goods. Finally, Zhang Chao, Xu Zhixiang, Yang Mingzhou, Tang Wentai, Li Fuyuan, and other seventeen people were elected as preparatory committee members, and it was decided to convene a preparatory committee meeting within a few days to discuss the promotion of the matter and draft the articles of association of the joint company. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

It is reported that the joint agency will be named Shanghai Oil Business Association Edible Oil Marketing Joint Company, and the total capital will be roughly set at 1 billion national currency. The investment amount of participating members will be at least 1 million yuan per unit and at most 50 million yuan. In the future, the business route will be to exchange miscellaneous grains from the East China region, including flour, corn, broad beans, sorghum, etc., for edible oil and its raw materials from various parts of North China, including Tianjin, Yingkou, Qingdao, etc.

### Buyers Taking Profits at High Prices: Chinese Stocks Show Another Downtrend

Chinese stocks not only failed to advance yesterday but retreated. Some brokers have reportedly been fined and suspended for two weeks starting next month. Furthermore, rumors that day's notes could not be used for settlement intensified. Active traders rushed to cut their long positions, and younger traders took advantage of the situation to sell aggressively. By late morning, the market ultimately proved unsustainable. Except for miscellaneous stocks that remained stable, all hot stocks significantly declined.

At the opening, only Qinxing showed a slight increase. The rest opened lower. Soon after, Diyong Yarn saw frequent liquidations by brokers numbered 104, 223, 76, and 85, pushing the price down to 233 yuan. Brokers numbered 160, 154, 171, and 157 bought in, resulting in a slight rebound. Brokers numbered 85, 223, 76, 143, 100, 4, and 224 sold again at 229 yuan.

After 9:20 a.m., brokers numbered 180, 171, 97, 218, and 174 advanced to 235 yuan, while brokers numbered 19, 223, 4, 160, and 85 continued to sell. From 10:00 a.m. to 10:20 a.m., the market remained in a prolonged tug-of-war, fluctuating until 10:25 a.m. After that, brokers numbered 16, 154, 45, 50, and 12 all bought in, and broker numbered 160 bought back after selling. Diyong Yarn briefly rebounded to around 240 yuan, but brokers numbered 157, 22, 85, 152, 231, 142, and 219 continued to liquidate their positions.

After 11:45 a.m., Yong Yarn retreated to around 230 yuan. Brokers numbered 152, 160, 155, and 172 remained actively engaged. Brokers numbered 185 and 152 again strongly sold the current Yong Yarn, but the market still looked unsustainable. The price of other secondary stocks continued to decline, with a particularly severe drop in the small-cap stock Huafeng, due to rumors that broker number 107 would abandon its management.

Before the closing, the current Yong Yarn fell to a low of 222 yuan, and the delayed Yong Yarn fell to a low of 225 yuan. The market then closed at 223 yuan and 226 yuan, respectively. After the closing, brokers numbered 222, 8, and 32 sold, and bidding became slightly weaker. Compared to the previous closing price, current delivery shares saw Qinxing slightly increase, Yong Yarn and Xinhua slightly decrease, Jingfu, Zhongfa, and Yonggong each fall by about half a percent, Meiya and Xinguang fall by less than one percent, Huafeng and Xinhe fall by one percent, Guohuo saw little trading but remained flat, Wuhe Underwear, Datong, Liyan Matches, Zhongfang, and Jinglun saw very minor declines, and Shangwu, Zhongsi, Tongyi, and Rongfeng each fell by between half a percent and slightly less than one percent.

In delayed delivery trading, Huafeng and Yonggong fell by slightly less than one percent, and Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell by slightly more than half a percent. Over-the-counter trading saw minor fluctuations in old shares, with the majority remaining flat.

### Jiufu Pharmaceutical: New Shares Listed

The stock exchange yesterday announced three items in the market: (1) Market trading hours will be changed from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. starting today, including Saturdays. (2) Jiufu Pharmaceutical's new shares will also be listed starting today, with the trading unit temporarily set at 10,000 shares. (3) Broker No. 61's agent, Chen Yan, disrupted market order and was fined with a two-week suspension from entering the market, until August 12th.

### Consolidated Bonds Surge: Foreign Stocks Decline

Yesterday, public debt prices surged because Western newspapers made quite critical comments about China's bond repayment, causing renewed anxiety. The C-bond went from an opening price of 8,800 yuan to a high of 10,300 yuan before slightly retreating. Room 555 had supplies, while Room 360, Dacheng, and the Chaozhou group absorbed them. Compared to the previous closing, A and B bonds rose by 700 yuan, C bonds rose by 900 yuan, D bonds rose by 600 yuan, and E bonds also rose by 800 yuan, with a total trading volume of around 3 million.

Foreign stocks were slightly weak yesterday. Paper and rubber stocks both saw declines. Foreign merchants and banks were taking in profits, while securities firms and retail investors were selling. Yisha opened at a high of 80,500 yuan and then rose to 83,300 yuan before slightly stabilizing. Compared to the previous closing, Yeguang and Telephone were flat, Yisha, Wheelock, Shipping, and Steel saw minor declines, British Union and Yifu each fell by half a percent, and Paper alone fell by one percent.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Weaken

Yesterday, cotton cloth sales remained sluggish. Merchants from Fujian even sold off their goods. Major players, seeing the unfavorable environment, were less active. Thus, the market was dominated by retail investors buying and selling. Furthermore, it was rumored that the Economic Police Brigade would start operations on August 1st, causing extreme anxiety. Dragon Head Fine Cloth recovered from 431,000 yuan to close at 434,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,000 yuan from yesterday. Other colored cloths and Shilin cloths saw no significant changes.

Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company opened sales of cotton yarn as usual. The market was weak from the start. As demand was slack, prices gradually declined, but the fluctuations were minor. Furthermore, the prices of securities and other commodities fell considerably, further weakening market sentiment. 20-count lightweight yarn fell from 10.75 million yuan to close at 10.65 million yuan, a decrease of 250,000 yuan. Other yarns also saw small decreases of between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan.

Spot Cotton Weak

Yesterday, the spot cotton market remained weak, with depressed sentiment. Due to the weakness in yarn and cloth, customers were eager to sell, resulting in very soft prices. Yarn factories showed no interest in buying, leading to quiet trading. The quoted prices for warehouse delivery were: L.S.S. 2.16 million, Shashi 2.06 million, Lingbao 2.15 million, Han Fine 1.93 million to 1.96 million, Zhangde 2.00 million, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton 333,000.

Cotton Textile Association Hopes for the Textile Adjustment Committee to Return Advances

[Our Dispatch] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association held a meeting of its standing directors yesterday. During the meeting, it was noted that various yarn factories had advanced significant funds for the purchase and contract spinning of cotton allocated with foreign exchange in the second quarter by the Wheel Management Committee's import quota distribution. The association hoped that the Textile Adjustment Committee would follow the original agreement and promptly return the funds already settled in foreign exchange (totaling over 600 billion national currency) to facilitate turnover. For the unsettled foreign exchange portion, the association hoped that the government would handle it directly to maintain credibility with foreign merchants. The issue of cotton yarn pricing was also discussed. It was generally agreed that unless flexible pricing is implemented and the cost of reproduction is taken into account, the entire cotton textile industry would not be able to survive.

Textile Construction Allocates Yarn

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company, as usual, jointly allocated yarn on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Committee. A total of 596 pieces were allocated to manufacturers, with 97 purchase applications.

### Textile Management Convenes Final Meeting to Discuss Disposition of Remaining Funds Totaling Over 100 Billion Yuan

[Our Dispatch] The former Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has scheduled its final meeting for 4:00 p.m. today at the City Hall to discuss the disposition of over 100 billion yuan in remaining funds from the Committee's previous purchase of cotton yarn for distribution, in order to conclude the matter. During the tenure of the former Premier of the Executive Yuan, the government purchased half of the cotton yarn spun by various factories using their stockpiled cotton, and the proceeds from the distribution were accumulated to develop the national cotton textile industry and promote cotton planting. At that time, a foundation management committee was established. Before and after the establishment of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the former Textile Management Committee repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions on how to dispose of the fund, but no approval has been received. To resolve this matter as soon as possible, the Committee has scheduled its final meeting this afternoon to discuss how to handle it.

### Inland Tianjin Merchants Buying Up: Rice Prices Rise Across the Board Both Japonica and Indica See Increases of 30,000 to 40,000 Yuan

Yesterday, a total of over 3,000 shi of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. Inland Tianjin merchants were actively purchasing, causing prices to soar. The Shanghai market responded enthusiastically, tracking the increases. Japonica rice prices rose sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, while Indica rice prices rose sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. White rice and No. 1 rice both saw increases of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sales in the North market were more active, reigniting the upward trend.

Flour transported from inland areas to the north also saw gradual movement in Shanghai, with continued increases of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran was sluggish and stable. Soybean cakes were tight at the opening but ultimately lacked strength to rise due to sluggish actual sales, remaining flat at noon. Soybeans rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans saw limited supply and demand, remaining high but sluggish. Red beans rose and fell sharply, retreating by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. After consecutive declines, the arrival of broad beans gradually decreased, leading to slight movement and a gradual recovery, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Raw peanuts from Southeast Asia were active and volatile, surging by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sorghum demand exceeded supply, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn also rose along with other commodities, recovering by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

The oil market saw weak sales in other regions. Local demand was moving but not strong. However, sellers held firm, with crude oil, soybean oil, light sesame oil, and rapeseed oil all increasing by 20,000 yuan.

Society Expedites Processing of Rice for Factories, Etc.

Yesterday, the rice market suddenly fluctuated, with prices rising across the board. Wu, the chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, in order to stabilize rice prices, specifically ordered the Allocation Committee yesterday to promptly allocate rice to factories, schools, and other organizations that had applied for rice based on the number of people in each household, and then review the applications, so that the applicant households could obtain rice and avoid being threatened by rice market price fluctuations.

Food Supplies Decreasing Among UNRRA Materials

Recently, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stated that food supplies among UNRRA relief materials shipped to China have been decreasing. In the previous year, rice, wheat, and coarse grains accounted for the majority, but this year, transportation equipment and agricultural supplies will take the lead. From the 21st to the 26th of last week, the agency reportedly distributed various materials in this city, with food supplies totaling only 45 tons. Transportation equipment and agricultural equipment accounted for the majority, totaling approximately 8,400 tons. Fuel was even scarcer, at only 16 tons. In total, the agency distributed 18,804 tons of various relief materials to this city and other locations last week.

### Foreign Lumber Weak

Foreign lumber prices are weak due to continuous arrivals. Although the production cost of fir wood is not low, the market price is difficult to raise due to the summer season.

### Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture: Ministry of Economic Affairs License Received

However, Government Prepared Loan Funds Have Not Been Allocated

[Our Dispatch] Since receiving government support, the China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture has been gradually expanding its business according to the company's planned schedule. The company recently received its official business license No. 4224 from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is reported that the company plans to gradually promote all its products to Southeast Asia before MacArthur opens Japanese foreign trade, in order to win back the original overseas market for domestically produced cotton textiles. However, there are still two difficulties: (1) The government's prepared loan funds for cotton yarn raw materials and processing have not yet been allocated, making it impossible for the company's affiliated factories to start production. (2) It is reported that the cotton textile markets in Southeast Asia are currently mostly occupied by British, American, and Indian products. In terms of price, domestic products appear to be at a disadvantage.

### Rayon Weakens Again: Factory Brokers Still Quiet

Yesterday, rayon prices were fluctuating, ultimately falling by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Broker number 120 traded Gaoshan and Asahi brands with luster in the morning at 24.5 million to 24.6 million yuan, with a minimum of 400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the final price was 4.5 million yuan, with some trading among colleagues. Silk factories showed very little interest, and trading was very sparse.

Yesterday, the market for factory-produced silk remained quiet. High-grade uniform silks only had quoted prices but no transactions. Medium-grade other silks were traded yesterday at a price of 27.5 million yuan, and high-grade other silks were also traded at 28.5 million yuan. A small quantity of 28-part other silks was traded at 17.5 million yuan. Silk factories traded 20 dan of Changtu silk yesterday, with the August delivery price set at 5.05 million yuan.

Yesterday, the market for mesh silk scarves was initially strong but then retreated, ultimately falling by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Huakang brand opened at 10.7 million yuan and was traded, but then fell to between 6.5 million and 6.6 million yuan. After large players dumped their holdings, it fell further to a minimum of 5.2 million to 5.3 million yuan. Multiple parties made efforts to push the price up, and it recovered to 6 million yuan. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it fell again, with the final price being 5.4 million yuan and the forward price being 5.7 million yuan. Dacheng brand opened at 7.2 million yuan and was traded, then traded at 6.5 million yuan, with the final spot price being 5.9 million yuan. Dacheng Gezi Bi Chou opened with a quoted price of 5,500 yuan, then traded at 5,200 yuan, with the final quoted price being 4,800 yuan. Other goods remained stable and unchanged.

Large Quantities of Rayon Shipped from Japan

A large batch of Japanese rayon has recently arrived and is stored in customs warehouses awaiting inspection. According to reporters, the rayon is expected to be fully inspected soon and transported to storage warehouses by the China Trust Bureau. Distribution is expected to begin early next month. The distribution price has not yet been determined, and the China Trust Bureau and the sales agents have been discussing it for days. Technical aspects of distribution are also being studied and improved to prevent abuses.

### Banking Association Bans Same-Day Credit for Negotiable Instruments

[Our Dispatch] The city's banking and commercial association recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that general banks and firms have recently been accommodating requests from various customers to allow same-day credit for negotiable instruments presented for deposit. This has resulted in credit inflation, and during periods of tight credit, banks and firms, due to the same-day credit of negotiable instruments, have often failed to accurately estimate their own working capital. As a result, if a dishonored check is returned, it often easily shakes the security of the bank or firm itself. Therefore, the practice of same-day credit for negotiable instruments should be investigated and prohibited. The Banking Association has recently sent notices to its member banks to comply.

### National Bank Circular Designates Banks: Instructs on Three Key Points for Foreign Exchange Settlement

[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank recently distributed Circular No. 107 to designated banks, stating in brief: It has been reported that some designated banks have been settling foreign exchange before irrevocable letters of credit or purchase commissions have been opened and before all import cargo shipping documents have been provided, based solely on import licenses. If true, this clearly violates the provisions of Circular No. 56 issued by the Bank on October 2 of last year. Therefore, the following three points are specifically emphasized:

1. Designated banks must first verify whether the applicant has the following qualifications before selling foreign exchange:
    (1) The imported goods are within the scope specified in the import license and can definitely arrive at the port within three months, with an irrevocable letter of credit or purchase commission opened.
    (2) The goods have already arrived at the port and have all shipping documents.

2. Designated banks must strictly comply with the provisions of the import license.

3. If there are amendments or supplementary clauses to the import license, they are only valid if they are signed by the relevant personnel of the Import Temporary Management Committee.

Designated banks that violate the above regulations will be subject to penalties.

### Sugar Market Stable

Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively stable with little fluctuation. The association's quoted prices were: No. 20 medium sand, 565,000 to 580,000 yuan per 100 bags; Red bag packing, 565,000 to 570,000 yuan; 24 coarse white, 700,000 yuan per 1,000 bags; Shantou packing, 630,000 yuan; Four and a half white, 660,000 to 665,000 yuan, all showing a recovery. There was no stock of three and a half white. Shantou Qingyang, 420,000 to 415,000 yuan and 410,000 yuan; Cotton red, 450,000 yuan. Xinghua white high, 580,000 yuan; second grade, 510,000 to 520,000 yuan. Xing red, 435,000 to 430,000 yuan. A total of over 300 pieces were traded.

### Woolen Fabric Sales Sluggish

Woolen fabric transactions were quite sluggish yesterday. Wholesale business was affected by continued increases in quoted prices for autumn and winter goods, and actual sales were still pending. At the same time, as the overdraft contract period for banks and firms expires at the end of this month, credit is not easing. Retail business was affected by the successive declines in summer sales. The woolen fabric market on Qipan Street and Changle Teahouse showed no improvement.

### Few Export Tea Transactions

Yesterday, transactions in the export tea market were still sparse. Most exporters in this city were still busy handling the recent shipment of 900 tons of Zhenmei green tea to Morocco, so buying interest was subdued. The attitude of sellers was calm, and prices were similar to the previous day. As for the various domestic sales teas that have been selling well in recent days, sales remained very active in the hot weather. Low-grade black tea was in particularly strong demand in the Wuxi area. Due to the sellers' insistence, prices remained firm.

### Hangzhou Silk Industry Applies for Loans

[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, 29th] The silk weaving, silk fabric, and electric machinery industries have applied to the Joint Four Banks for a production loan of 11 billion to relieve their working capital problems. In addition, the Hangzhou Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Venture, following Shanghai, is also actively preparing to open.

### Civilian Coal Allocation Prices to Be Adjusted Again Soon

The newly appointed Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Zhang Xiwei, left Shanghai for Beijing yesterday to attend a coal production increase meeting convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The civilian coal allocation meeting in this city will be convened after Chairman Zhang returns to Shanghai. It is reported that civilian coal allocation prices will be adjusted again. However, the allocation prices for public utilities will remain unchanged. Because the previous adjustment of coal allocation prices affected public utilities, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will continue to subsidize the Fuel Management Committee and ordered that the allocation prices for public utilities must remain unchanged.

### National Cement Industry Applies for Priority Allocation of Fuel Oil

[Our Dispatch] According to the National Cement Industry Association, the rotary kilns used by cement factories to produce clinker are now mostly fueled by diesel, with a substantial monthly demand. In the past, factories relied on Asiatic Petroleum, Standard Oil of New Jersey, China Petroleum, and other companies for allocation, but the supply of origin has been insufficient. If priority allocation is not given in the future, factories will be on the verge of shutdown due to insufficient fuel. The National Cement Association believes that cement is an important national defense industry, and with the post-war construction boom, cement demand has surged. Government authorities have unanimously placed high expectations on it. Its importance is no less than that of public utilities and transportation. The obligations and responsibilities of the factories to the country are incomparable to ordinary circumstances. Without sufficient fuel, how can production be increased to support construction? Yesterday, the association's Deputy Secretary-General Xi Zhengxi visited Director Deng and Secretary Wu of the Diesel Allocation Committee to personally present the industry's special difficulties and make two requests: (1) For cement industry fuel needs, please consider the national interest and grant priority allocation. (2) In addition to approving the previous diesel purchase orders from oil companies, please allocate the shortfall to maintain production. Director Deng has promised to pay attention to the matter.

The association's Shanghai, China, Jiangnan, Huaxin, Sichuan, Tianxiang, Shunchang, and Jianya member factories require a total of 8,050 tons of diesel per month.

[Another Dispatch] Last year, the cement industry was heavily hit by the dumping of foreign goods. This spring, due to government restrictions on imports, sales have gradually become brisk. In order to maximize supply to meet the needs of all parties, factories have been actively increasing production in recent months. Currently, national production has more than doubled compared to the beginning of the year. Jiangnan, Huaxin, and other factories are also expected to start production within the year. It is projected that by next spring, domestically produced cement can be exported to Southeast Asia. However, recently, cement sales have become weak again. The output of various factories has mostly exceeded demand. The biggest reason for this is that many construction projects have been suspended. It is rumored that a party intends to request permission for the import of Japanese cement. The association and all its members are closely monitoring the situation. If this actually happens, it will affect the national economy and the survival of the cement industry, and they will resolutely oppose it.

### Starting from the Moscow Conference

— Translated by Changsong

Translated from the July 1947 issue of Reader's Digest

Although the foundation for the German and Austrian peace treaties was laid early in the Atlantic Charter, the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Agreements, and the United Nations Charter, the Moscow Conference, originally convened to draft the German and Austrian peace treaties, failed to reach an agreement even on the principles upon which these treaties should be based.

What this conference did accomplish was to put the goals of Russia and the Western nations to a decisive test. And this test proved that while the wartime alliance had won the war, it could not forge peace, leaving the world to linger in a state of uncertainty and frustration.

The origins of this deadlock are now recorded in history. The wartime agreements proposed the establishment of a demilitarized, denazified, and democratized Germany, part of whose territory must be ceded, politically decentralized, and economically dispersed, but which would still be a political entity and an economic unit. It would pay reparations from its surplus industrial capital equipment, but would still be able to survive without external assistance. The wartime agreements also proposed the establishment of an independent and free Austria, enjoying the treatment of a liberated nation, specifically exempting it from making reparations.

In the Moscow Conference, the United States and Britain sought to achieve these goals through a democratic Germany. This Germany would be composed of various states with a degree of autonomy, governed by a federal government with extremely limited powers—ensuring that Germany, without excessive industrial development, could adequately support its already increased population, as excessive industrial development might once again threaten European peace. To demonstrate its goodwill, the United States put forward an unprecedented proposal: that the four powers conclude a long-term alliance to ensure the continued disarmament of Germany, thereby safeguarding the security of all. France's views on this plan were very close, leading to an almost unanimous unity among the Western nations.

Russia, however, held a very different position from the United States and Britain, denying the wartime agreements concerning Germany and Austria. It also sought to impose new conditions on the defeated nations and its victorious allies. It criticized the incorporation of the Saar coal region into the French economic unit as "dismembering" Germany, while insisting on its own and Poland's annexation of nearly a quarter of Germany's arable land, and vehemently advocating the expulsion of the people in that region to the remaining part of Germany. As a result, the Western nations would be forced to rebuild Germany's industry and promote its exports, even competing with their own export industries, or the Western nations would have to spend money to feed the Germans themselves; otherwise, they would only let them starve and push them into the embrace of communism.

At the same time, Russia insisted that Germany should pay reparations of more than 30 billion US dollars worth of goods at current market prices, most of which should be obtained from current production, with half of the total reparations going to Russia. This was tantamount to saying that the Western nations must first invest capital to build up Germany's industry in order to produce so much surplus material, and then allow Russia to seize control of this industry through reparations.

Russia also advocated the establishment of a highly centralized German state, modeled after Russia's own system, governed not only by the party that wins the majority but also by trade unions dominated by the Communist Party and the commonly seen Communist Party line organizations of "democracy" and "anti-Nazism."

Within its sphere of influence, Russia seized all Austrian assets nominally labeled "German-owned," intending to maintain its strong control over Austria through this means. It used the obstruction of the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty as a means to achieve its goal of maintaining troops in Vienna and on the "transportation lines" throughout the Balkans.

Russia's conditions are an undisguised plan to dominate Europe. Its ambitions have created a chasm between it and the West. The current serious situation of the German and Austrian question is by no means the only symbol of the existence of this chasm.

The same chasm is evident in the Balkans. Although Russia had solemnly guaranteed during the war to give liberated Europe the opportunity to elect free governments based on popular will, it is now turning the Balkan countries into possible Soviet republics.

This chasm is also evident in Poland. The free elections promised to Poland by the Potsdam Conference have turned into a democratic farce. And the Lublin Group, under Russia's wings, has even abandoned the pretense of a government that follows the will of the majority.

The chasm is also evident in China. Russia's promise to provide military and moral support exclusively to the National Government in exchange for China's concession of rights to Russia, under the instigation of the United States, has now been thrown to the winds.

The chasm is also evident in Korea. The original plan was to help Korea become an independent and liberated nation, but Russia has kept Korea divided, and seeks to place Korea under its control through methods even more blatant than those used in Germany.

The chasm is also evident in the deadlock over the atomic issue. The United States proposed handing over the atomic bomb under appropriate safeguards for joint control, but Russia has consistently refused. The chasm also exists in the work of the United Nations. Russia's use of its veto power and refusal to participate in the work of various subsidiary bodies has almost paralyzed the United Nations. The chasm is also evident in Russia's efforts to delay the organization of an international security force.

In short, all of the above are molded from a universally consistent model, and this policy model has absolutely nothing to do with security. Its determination is clearly due to two main driving forces—Russia's traditional imperialism and a fanatical communism. The latter sees the world outside the Soviet Union as an enemy and anticipates the inevitable outbreak of world revolution. Indeed, Russia is not only pursuing goals that contradict its wartime guarantees, but its ambitions expand proportionally whenever a potential enemy shows weakness.

Russia's territorial, political, and economic gains are already the greatest any empire has ever acquired after any war, but Russia is still not satisfied and continues to pursue its expansion plans—such as using diplomatic and military pressure in Germany and Austria; using puppet governments in Eastern Europe; carrying out infiltration, fifth column activities, and internal unrest in Greece and China; and deliberately obstructing every effort to build peace. If the intention is to keep the world mired in turmoil and economic hardship until the time is ripe for the implementation of communism, then this is truly the best policy.

The current situation reveals a glimmer of hope. It is a completely credible fact that Russia not only lacks the capacity for war, but also does not want war. Experience tells us that Russia will yield when it encounters genuine resistance, as evidenced by the examples of Iran and Trieste. If the Western nations are to find a way to break the current deadlock, this tactical flexibility of Russia must be a point that Western policy should grasp.

The policy of the Western nations must be based on three basic principles. They must agree to fill the void to prevent further expansion of Russian influence, because the current balance of power has reached such a delicate stage that if another nation submits to Russia's dominance, it could easily lead to a one-sided shift of European continental nations towards Russia. Secondly, the Western world must seek to organize itself and all countries willing to join together to work for peace, trade, and prosperity, while not abandoning the countries now behind the curtain. Because only in this way can the West not only regain its solvency, but also demonstrate to Russia the benefits of joining us. Finally, in terms of policy, all of Russia's legitimate interests must be given careful consideration to avoid excessive hostility, as such hostility will cause danger.

Based on such a policy, there is still hope of breaking the current deadlock, and there is still ample room for Russia and the West to reach agreements and cooperate for their common interests. Moreover, the greatest hope for maintaining the United Nations and the concept of global unity lies only in such a policy.

### Visiting a Scientific Inventor: Hollywood Dreams of Chinese Dance

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this Newspaper

Hollywood Airmail

A few months ago, an old educator in an issue of "Observer's Magazine" loudly exclaimed: "If we in the American education community cannot control Hollywood, then all of America will be swallowed up by Hollywood!" Today, students in American schools are far more interested in watching movies than in attending classes. The intangible education of movies not only surpasses the influence of school education, but also outweighs the effectiveness of parents' well-intentioned family education. Fifteen-year-old children are capable of killing people with guns and erasing all traces of the murder. Eight or nine-year-old girls actually wiggle their butts on the street, imitating South American dances. Old producer Zanuck of 20th Century Fox said, "Hollywood movies defeated the Axis powers. In the future, the responsibility facing Hollywood professionals is how to win peace? How to build a new world that is forever without war, without hatred, and without starvation!"

The Larmore Couple

I put these questions to a "Hidden Dragon Mountain Man" in Hollywood, a scientific genius, a literary figure, and also an artist, Gilbert Larmore. He lives in a beautiful and exquisite small Western-style building by the shimmering Pacific Ocean, built on a hillside by the sea. The day my friend Rouland took me to see him, we first ate at a rural restaurant on the Pacific coast. Many Americans with leisure time drove dozens of kilometers to this place to feel a little sea breeze and then spend their "weekend" here. That evening, Larmore and his wife happened to be there too. My impression of him was a large man with the demeanor of a "modest gentleman," speaking very decisively and forcefully.

He is the inventor of Sonovox. I don't know how to translate this word properly into Chinese! "Sound amplifier" or "electric sound transmitter" is probably what it means. According to Larmore, he noticed this problem about ten years ago. He saw many deaf-mutes who could not speak and felt endless sympathy in his heart. He said: The production of human voice has two sources: one is the "sound" produced by the vibration of the vocal cords, and the sound passes through the throat and the teeth, tongue, lips, etc., in the "oral cavity" to produce "tones." Tones are different, but the sound is the same. If a deaf-mute who cannot speak because the vocal cords are damaged and cannot vibrate, his "sound amplifier" can use artificial vocalization. It is a two-and-a-half-inch-long electric vibrator that is placed between the throat and neck, close to the skin, causing it to vibrate and affecting the vibration of the "vocal cords." The deaf-mute only needs to make various gestures with his mouth, teeth, tongue, and lips, and the sound will come out like a normal person.

Mrs. Larmore performed a demonstration for her husband, and then he explained the principle behind it himself. I said: The principle is very simple, but to invent something, the details are definitely beyond the understanding of an "outsider." His machine is now being manufactured in large quantities in Chicago. He said that there are six million deaf people in the United States, and at least some of them can get great help.

Electric Sound Transmitter

Movie sound transmitters are now slowly being applied to movies, especially supernatural, detective, and horror movies. A person can speak with the "sound" of a dog barking (plus the "tone" of a person), or can speak with the sound of a raging wind. The sound of a dog barking or a raging wind is recorded onto a phonograph record. When the phonograph is turned on, it is connected to an electrical appliance and then connected to the sound transmitter with an electrical wire, which creates this vibration of sound. Mrs. Larmore's performance that day was indeed a bit chilling.

"Electric sound transmitters" have already been widely adopted on radio stations, which are used to broadcast two merged sounds. I saw a radio weekly with a large article praising Larmore.

In fact, Larmore is not really engaged in science. Saying he is a scientist is not as appropriate as saying he is a "writer." He lives in Hollywood, the world of gold, and mostly makes a living by writing movie scripts. He is a person who became wealthy through writing. Although he said that he hates capitalist society, he has a fairly "rich" family.

We talked a lot about various topics. He has a talent for conversation because he thinks quickly and has many extraordinary opinions. He said: "Living on the same planet, there was originally no difference between humans and animals, but later, so-called animals only knew how to use their limbs to use or enjoy materials. Humans can use materials to turn materials into tools, and then use tools to inspire other materials. Therefore, humans conquered animals and became the 'spirit of all things.'"

He cited many names of strange animals from South America and Africa. Many animals are almost like humans, able to stand and walk, and able to have their own communal society, but no matter what, they cannot use materials to become tools.

Larmore never goes to church. He is a broad-minded "skeptic," but he does not deny morality and education. He is not as pessimistic about the development trend of the film industry as those old educators. He said: "This is a progress of human intelligence. The film industry has developed to this day after decades, and we can no longer go backwards and persuade young people not to watch movies. As for the selection and choice of script content, he believes it is a very crucial topic."

He can write a script on average every two months. The script also needs to be promoted to film companies by an "agent." In addition, he also writes for radio stations. The radio industry and the film industry are a pair of twin brothers who make money in Hollywood.

### Close Cooperation is Needed between Chinese and American Film Industries

Hollywood has about dozens of broadcasting companies, all of which are large-scale and large-venue. Singer Bing Crosby's income, movies account for a small part, broadcasting and recordings account for the majority. During my hurried trip to Hollywood, I also visited several broadcasting companies, which have large-scale orchestras and various singing scenes.

There are very few Chinese people engaged in broadcasting work in Hollywood. However, in terms of film technology, there is an amazing genius, "Jim Wong." I don't know what his Chinese name is. In three days, I called him more than ten times, but I couldn't meet him. He is currently a cameraman at Warner Bros. When people in Hollywood talk about "Jim Wong," everyone gives a thumbs up: "The number one cameraman in color photography!"

I did not meet Sun Yu, Li Lili, and their group. They probably arrived there shortly after I left Los Angeles, but I sincerely hope that they can truly lay a foundation for Sino-American film cooperation. I remember meeting Mr. Zheng Yongzhi in New York last October. Zheng very forcefully said that he opposed using the words "film cooperation." At the time, I was quite skeptical of his opinion. After arriving in Hollywood this time, I am even more convinced that cooperation between the film industries of China and the United States is needed.

Cooperation is Not Dependence

Cooperation is not all about dependence. Our equipment and technology are far behind. If we say that we need to build up the Chinese film industry, we must humbly learn from Hollywood. In the past one or two decades, not only has there been insufficient cooperation, but there has not even been a foundation for cooperation, which is why Hollywood has developed all sorts of erroneous views that look down on China. Producer Kennedy of Columbia Pictures hired a Chinese actor as the lead, which was met with a lot of criticism. Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox have made many movies about China, using "foreigners" with high noses and blue eyes in makeup. Hollywood has theatrical talent from all over the world. Why don't we have talent from China? Of course, Chinese actors have difficulties with language and writing when acting in English plays, but this is not an insurmountable problem. The current top American actress Ingrid Bergman, the lead actress in "The Bells of St. Mary's," was born and raised in Sweden. When she first arrived in the United States, she didn't understand any English. Later, with the help of a private tutor and her own hard work, she is now not only fluent in dialogue on the screen like an American, but also her tickets for her stage play performance in New York this March were sold out last November.

Besides Ingrid Bergman, Carmen Miranda, a Brazilian glamorous woman, is also an example. When she first entered Hollywood, she only spoke Brazilian Portuguese, and only a few English words. Now she can not only act in any dialogue, but also sing expressive English love songs. Why can't our domestic top actors be promoted to Hollywood through Sino-American film cooperation? Why can't they show their talents on this world stage? Why do we always let those overseas Chinese actors, who claim to represent China in Hollywood, specialize in playing roles such as servants, errand boys, and rickshaw pullers?

Chinese Dance

One evening in Hollywood, a few American friends invited me to dinner at the "Deauville" cafe. An American film industry insider said that he had never seen Chinese dance. He asked: "Did China ever have 'dance' before?" Another American said: "China has Han and Tang Dynasty 'court dances.' He has seen pictures, and the scene in the pictures is very grand, but he has never seen it in drama and film!"

I am not saying that the overseas Chinese actors' skills are not good enough. In fact, they also want to promote a little Chinese art everywhere. However, because they understand too little about China, their style is mostly Western. What the American audience wants is not a yellow-skinned person acting in their style, but a longing for a little bit of genuine Chinese drama and art.

International understanding and international cooperation are built up bit by bit. We must not let others despise China spiritually before licking the pitiful alms of others. Take Hollywood, for example. It is a microcosm of the international stage. The impression a Hollywood movie gives to people around the world is no less profound than the speech of a diplomat, and no less important than a famous book by a writer. We have diplomats who speak fluent English abroad, writers who write fluent English, and representatives of various English-speaking industrial and commercial sectors, but we have forgotten Hollywood, such an important educational and propaganda institution!

Penetrating the Whole World

Fifty years ago, Hollywood was still an unnoticed barren village on the Pacific coast. Eighty years ago, it was said to be a desert everywhere, and water had to be drawn from small streams in the mountains. Now, in a few decades, it has become the city with the largest flat area in the world, and the most luxurious and noblest city in the world. Municipal experts in Los Angeles predict that the population may exceed New York in five years. They are already designing and building the most modern roads, with no intersections, no traffic lights, and four parallel avenues. There have been no earthquakes for more than ten years, and Hollywood people believe there will be no more natural disasters. Transportation is convenient, and they can fly to New York in seventeen and a half hours. Many big entrepreneurs, they fly from New York to Los Angeles, and then fly back to New York from Los Angeles. They control this propaganda nerve center, and they influence the young people of the whole world!

I lived in Los Angeles and Hollywood for nine days. In early spring and late winter, Hollywood streets are full of the true colors of singing and dancing. Girls wearing long pants hum Spanish love songs, and the streets are full of: palm trees every five steps, banana trees every ten steps, green and lush, and you can't see the desolation and bleakness of deep winter. I spent a lively evening in the "Mocambo" nightclub, surrounded by many men and women. "Danny Kaye," who used to be in the film industry for several years, the milk delivery boy in "Up in Arms." Some people say that he is an elusive person. He had just become famous in the film industry, but suddenly stopped and joined the nightclub!

Nightclubs, bars, cafes, restaurants, in this paradise of drunken money, you can't see sorrow, you can't see worry. The blood and sweat money of the whole world is nourishing the prosperity of Hollywood. The intangible influence of Hollywood is penetrating the whole world bit by bit!

### Lung Disease Treatment Method (Part 2)

— Wu Shaoqing

(B) Early Treatment is Easy to Cure, Late Treatment is Ineffective

Health examinations are the implementation of this principle. Perhaps you will doubt the doctor's diagnosis because you have no symptoms and feel the same as ordinary people. This is a misconception. Many people have lung disease without any conscious symptoms. If you have to wait for the symptoms to become obvious, the disease has usually reached a considerable extent, and it may be difficult to treat. Even if it can be treated, it will require a longer period of time and more major surgery. Therefore, if a lung disease is detected during an examination, do not delay or harbor a mentality of luck, or temporarily wait and see, waiting for symptoms to appear before seeking treatment. By then, it may be too late. Early lung disease can be cured in about eight out of ten people. Late lung disease can be cured in at most three out of ten people. Treating a disease is like putting out a fire. Please do not delay and mislead yourself!

(C) What Should Be Done When You Have Lung Disease

Prevent tuberculosis if you don't have it, treat tuberculosis if you have it. This is a matter of course. The same type of tuberculosis can differ in nature, severity, and the location of the lesion, so the treatment process will also be different, the treatment method, and the length of time required. This requires the doctor to combine X-ray films with other examination results to make a pathological assessment, and then choose the appropriate treatment method. Here, there are about two points to honestly tell the patient's family. (1) When choosing a doctor to treat the disease, you must take the right path and follow the right track. You must not take shortcuts and harbor a "let's try it" mentality, thinking that "injections and medication" can work. So far, there is no recognized effective medicine. Wasting money is a small matter, but missing the treatment period is a great pity. (2) Once a doctor is selected, you must faithfully follow the doctor's instructions and work together to ensure thorough treatment, so that you do not fall short of success.

(D) Several Things to Avoid

(1) Do not do strenuous breathing exercises.

(2) Do not do sunbathing treatment.

(3) Do not practice Tai Chi.

(4) Do not be confused by advertised medicines, and do not try other unscientific treatment methods.

### The Principle of Life

— Ping Fan

Written by Chen Lifu, published by Zhengzhong Book Company in August of the 33rd year of the Republic, 307 pages in total, priced at five yuan.

The general public believes that Mr. Chen's contributions in practical political work are greater than his academic creations because he is a Chinese statesman. Currently, there are two different viewpoints for evaluating others in China: one belongs to the "practical" type as defined by Spranger, and the other belongs to the "theoretical" type. Practical people estimate the value of someone's work based on their actual contributions to national and social construction and do not understand academic contributions. In China, theoretical people often believe themselves to be above the practical world and consider themselves superior, so whether someone with a position in academia participates in practical work, or someone engaged in practical work seeks a theoretical foundation, these detached theorists either ignore their practical work or neglect their academic value. In fact, this attitude of dividing practical work and theory into two separate entities is a terrible phenomenon. We believe that someone engaged in practical work without a theoretical background is merely a mechanical craftsman, while those philosophers who confine themselves to ivory towers and are isolated from reality are nothing more than a form of high-level luxury. An ancient Chinese saying goes: "The highest is to establish virtue, the next is to establish merit, and the next is to establish words." The consistent style of Chinese scholarship has always been to seek the way of "inner sage and outer king." Scholarship, on the one hand, involves self-cultivation and self-restraint, and on the other hand, it lays a theoretical foundation for engaging in practical work to contribute to the nation and society. Leaving aside specialized academic research, solely from the perspective of scholarship, we admire Mr. Liang Shuming and Mr. Zhang Junmai more than pure rationalists and moralists (i.e., friends who purely discuss rationalism and moral principles). Regarding Mr. Chen's views, we believe he belongs to the former rather than the latter. Mr. Chen's theory of Vitalism and The Principle of Life, along with his academic spirit of accepting scientific experience based on Confucian traditions, is invaluable in the Chinese academic world. Whether he applies this theory as a background for his political life or pursues such a supreme principle in his political activities, it does not diminish his contribution to Chinese academic thought.

Mr. Chen's "The Principle of Life" encompasses his entire philosophical system—from his ontology and cosmology to his views on life and society. Due to space limitations, this article cannot provide a comprehensive review. We can only provide a brief introduction and raise a few principled discussions. As for a review of the specialized philosophical content, we will have to leave it for another time.

The author's research starts from the reality of society. He states: "The current war has spread so widely, caused so much bloodshed, and demanded such great sacrifices that it can be called unprecedented... This compels every peace-loving and justice-loving person to exhaust their thoughts to find the root of the disaster and to further investigate whether there is a possibility in the depths of human nature to permanently eliminate the causes of war... The author firmly believes that comprehensive evolution is the security guarantee for human survival, and common survival is the central target of human evolution. Only when all human beings in the world can coexist and thrive can there be common and rapid evolution. As for local exclusive survival, it is merely an obstacle to comprehensive evolution and a threat to permanent peace. If there are factors of discord and inequality within a collective, the foundation of peace cannot be consolidated, and the disasters of war cannot be eliminated."

Now, we will outline several important principles in his system to give a glimpse of the whole.

(1) He accepts the "Principle of Change." All things in the universe are a continuous stream. From the beginning, he quotes several remarks by Confucius praising the I Ching: "How perfect is the I Ching! The continuous production is called change, and the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao. Change is constant, circulating through the six voids."

(2) He does not recognize an unchanging substance outside of this flowing universe. Substance is the essence in this process of change, and its attribute is life, so the substance of the universe can be named "Life Element." It is neither mind nor matter in itself, but mind and matter are two aspects that it manifests. Mind is the dynamic force of the Life Element, and matter is the static force of the Life Element. Motion is development, and stillness is convergence. The creation of all cosmic flows occurs in the transition between motion and stillness.

(3) The substance of the universe is both one and many. The universe evolves and creates all things in the transition. In the evolution of the entire universe, it can be roughly divided into three stages: inorganic matter, living things, and human beings. Each stage of existence has its own characteristics and cannot be confused with one another. Therefore, the substance of the universe can be said to be diverse. However, these three stages are three levels of the same cosmic evolutionary process and are all manifestations of the Life Element. Therefore, the substance of the universe can also be said to be singular.

(4) The characteristics of human beings are: (A) self-awareness and reflection, the ability to consider the past and predict the future; (B) moral life, with virtues of benevolence, justice, tolerance, and respect; (C) artistic appreciation, with a surreal imagination, exploring unknown fields, and seeking ideals.

(5) Life should serve society, because in order to benefit oneself, one must benefit others. Benefiting others is how to magnify the meaning of one's own life. Further, one should strive to exhaust the nature of benevolence so that humans and the life of the universe become one. In human life, there lies a latent possibility for goodness. This possibility for goodness (which Mr. Chen calls "Sincerity") manifests as the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and then, through the eight steps of investigating things, extending knowledge, making the will sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating the person, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world, one can exhaust one's own abilities to complete all things, seeking the completion of one's own personality and the completion of the personality of others.

(6) The evolution of social history is the pursuit of the highest realm of truth, goodness, and beauty of life under the dynamic of coexistence, mutual existence, and mutual evolution of all people. The evolution of human society can be divided into three stages: (A) competition between humans and non-humans; (B) competition between humans and humans; (C) competition between humans and nature. The ultimate goal is a world of great harmony.

(7) The Chinese historical culture can be said to be a consistent component of human cultural history. The qualities of Chinese culture are: (A) taking people's livelihood as the center and adhering to benevolence; (B) taking great harmony as the ultimate goal and basing it on supreme impartiality; (C) achieving moderation and harmony through diligence; (D) valuing propriety and righteousness and originating from utmost sincerity. These are also the highest realms of world culture. These qualities have not been fully developed and promoted in China. Therefore, our current responsibility is, on the one hand, to promote this cultural quality in China, and on the other hand, to seek its realization in the entire world. Only then can it be said that we are "establishing a heart for heaven and earth, establishing a life for the people, continuing the lost learning of the past sages, and creating peace for all generations."

The system of this book is clear and thoughtful, and the writing is crisp and lovely, especially in the remaining parts. It is well worth reading for young people. There are a few points I would like to discuss with the author in principle.

First, we feel that the author's establishment of this philosophical system starts from an ethical perspective. That is to say, he first has an ethical belief, and then establishes his system on this belief, similar to how modern Western philosophy, from Descartes to Kant Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, cannot escape the constraints of Christian faith in an invisible way. For example, the "Life" character used by the author is permeated with an ethical atmosphere, because this "Life" character penetrates to inorganic matter below and includes all human spiritual activities above in the author's mind. If we interpret it purely in the narrow sense of "Life," then inorganic matter is "lifeless" and spiritual activity is "super-life." For example, "Sincerity," which he says is the driving force of life, has a metaphysical meaning. Sincerity exists in the universe, in everyone, and in all things. This applies the "Sincerity" character, which is limited to human activities and has moral significance, to all things in the universe, which have no moral phenomena.

Second, the author's research method is less empirical and more intuitive, which is also because the author's starting point of research is ethical. The author's power of thought is very rich. His main idea comes from his personal experience and insights, rather than starting from analyzing current empirical facts (such as C.D. Broad in England and C. Lewis in the United States), nor from a purely intellectual standpoint of logical analysis (such as Feng Zhisheng in our country and McTaggart in England). The reviewer personally prefers the empirical analysis method.

Third, when the book discusses the view of social evolution history, it rarely applies the materials of current Western sociology and social philosophy. We believe that there is a lot of information in it that can support the author's theory. The author lists a brief table of each stage of human evolution on page 266 of this book, and specifically mentions the progress of survival methods and the evolution of political systems. We feel that the author can further develop this aspect to complete his social philosophy and political philosophy.

### Tales of the Struggles of Scientists

— Zhang Hao

Written by Grove Wilson, translated by Zeng Shi Shi, published by Life Bookstore

It is scientists throughout history who have brought us into this almost legendary world. Today, all unimaginable natural forces have been tamed and utilized by them, and all incredible laws and theorems have been discovered and explained by them. Scientists have not only created a brand new world for us, but have also completely changed our way of life, making human life shift from hardship to comfort, from passive to active, and from slaves of nature to masters of nature. Scientists have created and liberated mankind.

However, no scientific discovery or invention is entirely accidental. That is to say, no scientist's success comes without an endless process of struggle - whether it is a struggle against oneself or against the outside world. The unparalleled fighting spirit of scientists has opened up a smooth path for us descendants, allowing us to enjoy more comfortably. In order to admire the unyielding fighting spirit of scientists throughout history, and, more importantly, in order to provide encouragement and reference for all future scientists, there is no doubt that the publication of the book "Tales of the Struggles of Scientists" has its great and glorious value.

"Tales of the Struggles of Scientists" is a biographical text written in extremely clear and beautiful language. Because it is narrated with each scientist as the center, it is more interesting than any other science book. And because it is narrated in chronological order, it can also be regarded as a history of Western science development. Therefore, more precisely, this is not only a biography of many famous scientists, but also an interesting history of Western science.

The major scientists mentioned in this book mainly include twenty-eight, from Thales, the first scientist in history since there has been a history, to Einstein, who is still alive today. There are mathematicians, zoologists, chemists, physicists, biologists, astronomers… including all natural scientists, but there is a unique characteristic in them, that is: the indomitable spirit of fighting for truth. If I am a real scientific worker, I think there are few people who can remain unmoved by such a great spiritual inspiration.

The content of the book is extremely popular and the narrative is extremely persuasive. Although it is a book of about five hundred pages, I finished reading it in one breath without even realizing it. It is indeed very suitable as a science textbook or extracurricular reading material for middle school students.

Those who aspire to science, go here to learn, for the sake of mankind.

### On Talk Fengzi's Edited *The Human World*

— Nian Hong

In today's dwindling and precarious publishing industry as a whole, it is truly difficult to maintain a literary publication unless its own content has significant weight.

Thanks to the support of a wide readership, The Human World monthly, which does not have strong financial backing, has been able to stand tall under this storm-like economic pressure. Therefore, it can be seen that even at a time when the purchasing power of readers has generally declined, the need for a good reading material is not much different from that of pancakes and fried dough sticks.

In order to satisfy both the tastes of readers and the standards of the publication itself, we see many painstaking efforts on the part of the editor: among several literary works that carry a significant amount of weight, one can find many lighter, lively sketches and essays, allowing readers to slightly relieve the heavy feelings in their hearts; the flexible arrangement and rich illustrations dilute the overly strong literary atmosphere, and in addition to a few woodcuts and comics, the title flowers by Mr. Ding Cong and Mr. Liang Chen add to the liveliness of the entire content form.

From the first issue to the most recent issue (the fifth issue), there is not much difference in form, but there are obvious slight advances and retreats in content. For example, the proportion of novels and poems has decreased almost every issue (from 40% to 20%), while prose, essays, and the like have increased instead. This can also be said to be a clever point on the part of the editor. Among the few literary publications currently available, most of the content focuses on novels and poems, so in the limited space of this small publication, it is easier to please by focusing on short essays and notes rather than working hard on large-scale creative novels, because this is ultimately a "comprehensive" literary publication.

In addition to travel notes and biographies, this publication has another feature—several articles on art—which can be said to be rare and precious in general literary publications today, such as Li Jia's Immortal Statues, Starkovich's Depression, Liu Kaiqu's Soviet Sculpture, Xu Chi's Music in School, etc., which are all quite valuable and content-rich.

Perhaps it is also to cater to the tastes of readers, The Human World still cannot get rid of the star system's method of selecting manuscripts—but occasionally one or two unfamiliar names appear, especially in the last two issues, and this problem has improved a lot.

Afterwards, I hope that this publication can continue to be published, and that it will become stronger and more complete!

### History of Qin and Han Dynasties

— Gong Peixuan

(Written by Lao Zhenyi, published by China Culture Service Society)

This is a small book listed in the Youth Library, so its writing is simple and its narrative is straightforward. The author's intention seems to be to depict the rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties in an accessible style. We can glimpse this effort. However, with the long years of the Qin and Han dynasties and the vast and complex events, trying to describe them in detail with a mere 50,000 words will inevitably feel rough. However, it is indeed a benevolent act worthy of being introduced to readers, as a supplementary reading material for middle school students or as a self-study textbook for out-of-school youth.

We say that this book is worth introducing to readers for the following two reasons: (1) This book describes the rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties in simple language. In terms of narration, it gives people a fresh understanding, and it is easier to read than large-scale works. (2) The arguments are quite correct and the measurement is quite steady, which shows the author's own achievements in the study of Chinese history. Therefore, this book will not mislead readers to a distorted understanding of Chinese history, which is the basic requirement of historical writing.

As everyone knows, each book has its own way of writing, and each author has his own viewpoints and opinions. It only depends on the target audience. Based on the essential point of seeking precision, this book is obviously not up to standard. However, it does have a good point, that is, it can tell you a general concept when you pull everything together. For individual situations, the reader can find it in this entire concept. The book begins with a description of the rise of Qin, which seems too hasty. However, this book is not a study of textual research, so it should be forgiven in this regard. However, when the author begins to describe the rise of Qin, he should at least clearly explain the environment of Qin in the late Warring States period, which does not seem to be an excessive demand from readers.

The focus of this book can be seen from its table of contents, which consists of ten chapters, that is, first describe the rise and fall of Qin, then the Chu-Han contention, then the disintegration of Han, and finally "Academic Beliefs and Material Life of the Two Han Dynasties". The chapter on the rise and fall of Qin begins with a narrative. In terms of the weight of the whole book, Qin and Han should be equal, but looking at the whole book, this chapter on the rise and fall of Qin seems to be a preface to writing the history of Han. The chapter on the Chu-Han contention mentions the Hongmen Banquet, and the author messed up the relationship between Xiang Bo and Xiang Yu. The original text says: "Liu Bang knew that he was no match for them, so he personally went to Xiang Yu's camp to explain, and Zhang Liang, a close friend of Xiang Yu's elder brother Xiang Bo, asked Xiang Yu to intercede." It also said: "At that time, Fan Zeng persuaded Xiang Yu to kill Liu Bang on the spot, but Xiang Yu hesitated after listening to the advice of his elder brother Xiang Bo..." Thus, Xiang Bo was regarded as being in the same generation as Xiang Yu. The original relationship of uncle and nephew was turned into brothers. It is recorded that Xiang Bo was Xiang Yu's younger uncle, and both the Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han are consistent in this regard. The Book of Han was written later and based on Sima Qian's Records, so there is no doubt about it. It can be seen that Xiang Bo was definitely not in the same generation as Xiang Yu. This book calls Xiang Bo Yu's elder brother. I don't know where it comes from? As far as I know, Wang Fuzhi's comments in his Interpretation of Zizhi Tongjian's chapter on Emperor Gao of Han had an impression of Xiang Bo and Xiang Yu as brothers. The original text is: "...(referring to Xiang Yu) trembling with fear, with spears and halberds in his dreams, how could he not deeply suspect the world? However, his suspicion was of no help. Xiang Bo was in the heart of the King of Han; he was his brother..." Perhaps this is the basis for calling Yu Bo brothers. Looking at the tone of Mr. Wang Fuzhi's article, this is just to condemn Xiang Yu for "looking left and right, only at his brothers and in-laws," and it is by no means to list them as brothers in the same generation. It is hoped that the author will correct this when reprinting.

In addition, the reasons for Liu Bang's success should also be analyzed in detail, and this book has not fulfilled its responsibility, which is also one of the regrets of this book.

### The Destruction of Happiness

— Ruo Fei

Reading A. Gide's "Bathsheba"

André Gide's "Bathsheba," one of the essays in the translated "Prodigal Son Returns," is a short piece that I deeply admire. It resembles poetry, yet its conception is more profound; it resembles drama, yet, apart from King David's monologue, it lacks other elements of dramatic composition; it resembles prose, yet its form is poetic, its essence poetic, and certain short verses possess more poetic quality than many others' poems.

Using such peculiar form and expression, Gide vividly and dramatically portrays a human tragedy. This is Gide's artistic achievement, far surpassing the likes of Baudelaire, who merely express simple conceptions through prose poetry. We can say that Gide's prose poetry has clearly entered a new realm.

Bathsheba, a woman's name, initially symbolizes the happiness that slaves seize from solitude. Subsequently, a master possessing greater happiness, resorts to base means to take her over. Bathsheba becomes a victim between the slave and the tyrant.

Here, Gide not only depicts the perverted psychology of King David of Judah, but, more importantly, he treats the King of Judah as a typical tyrant, writing him in a very vivid and refined manner. In a short prose poem, he narrates how a wealthy man disregards his own wealth, obsessively coveting the property and happiness of others, and then destroying it. The depiction of this psychological process is worth an entire novel.

When King David fervently praises Uriah the Hittite's bravery and loyalty, he says:

"In the cave of Adullam, I sought in vain for cool refreshment;

The Philistines were encamped in the valley;

Bethlehem was already occupied by them.

You know there is a well of bitter water in Bethlehem;

That day I longed for the water of the village well;

I wanted to drink from it to be satisfied...

Who then broke through the enemy ranks?

Who risked their lives to bring me a cup of tea!

Who was it? Tell me.

It was Uriah the Hittite."

Although deeply aware of the value of a slave's loyalty, once he becomes infatuated with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, the slave's bravery and loyalty cannot save him from his own doom. As King David said:

"My hands were already full of happiness and wealth,

So that I could not hold any more,

But that little happiness over there,

I was willing to throw away all the rest for it...

It comes from such solitude, this happiness."

All desires stem from this psychological change. A self-centered person is never content. When he tires of his own great happiness, he covets the small happiness of others. As far as Bathsheba is concerned, she is just a small woman, yet in King David's eyes, her charm while bathing in the small courtyard is more beautiful than any other beauty. "I almost suspect that it is her that I want, or perhaps that circle... and that wine, the wine I drank, from his little vineyard!" This is the true face of desire. Did King David really fall in love with Bathsheba? No, he was just bored and wanted to find a way out for his idleness. He loved not Bathsheba herself, but "the shadow attached to her little country"—that small happiness. Outside his own great happiness, he does not allow others to have any happiness, no matter how brave and sincere that person is.

King David finally possesses Bathsheba and says:

"Because the trace of a ship on the sea,

The trace of a man on a woman's deep body,

Even God cannot recognize."

In fact, there is something even more tragic. Uriah the Hittite is fighting in the front lines for King David to attack Rabbah, and in the rear, his wife has become King David's plaything. In order to permanently possess the warrior's wife, King David ordered to the Hittite: "Uriah is the bravest of the three armies, he should be placed on the front line;" while ordering Marshal Joab that when the Hittite approached the city wall, the entire army should suddenly retreat, leaving only Uriah the Hittite alone...

King David effortlessly took the small happiness from his subordinates, and because it was too effortless, he no longer cherished this small happiness. When Bathsheba, dressed in mourning clothes, came to see King David in the dark night, what did the latter say?...

"Go away! Take her back! I have told you that I do not want to see her again... I hate her!"

This is the end. The abominable nature of the tyrant, is deeply exposed by just these few sentences depicting psychological abnormality.

### Should High Schools Implement Subject Specialization?

Reasons for Subject Specialization

(1) Last year, I graduated from Youyuan High School in Suzhou, where the high school department had once implemented subject specialization. Based on my experience with both subject specialization and non-specialization systems, and my experiences after entering university, I have the following opinions on subject specialization in high school:

I advocate for subject specialization, but specialization should not be overly granular. It is sufficient to separate into arts/business and science/engineering streams. The reason is that this division makes the divergence for university entrance clear and the scope is broader. Those pursuing science/engineering and those pursuing arts/business should be clearly separated. Within each stream, they can specialize in many departments in the future. For example, the science/engineering stream includes science, engineering, medicine, agriculture, etc., while the arts/business stream includes arts, law, business, etc.

After specialization, students can make deeper and further progress in one direction. In terms of application, it can achieve significant results, and in terms of personal interest, it can be focused. I always believe that high school should provide a considerable foundation in some subjects, but this is not always the case. Therefore, subject specialization is a way to achieve this goal. If one chooses to enter the workforce after graduating from high school, as long as they choose a career close to what they have learned, their abilities will definitely be much stronger.

I am studying engineering, and I feel that subjects like "Descriptive Geometry" and "Engineering Drawing" in the "freshman" year can be learned in the science/engineering stream after high school specialization.

Some people say that high school specialization may prevent students from accurately choosing the subject they want to study. But if we think carefully, how many people who apply to university actually "apply" to what they "want" to?
— Huang Qinglin, this city

(2) The current elementary normal schools and vocational schools are disguised forms of high school subject specialization. Therefore, I advocate that high schools must implement subject specialization, because "a person's talent is developed through specialization and destroyed through generalization."
— Wang Qian'de, this city

(3) Subject specialization should not be implemented in the first year of high school, but it must be implemented from the second year onwards.

Because the current first-year high school curriculum, whether it is mathematics or biology, is a common subject that should be studied. The first year can be used by students themselves and teachers to conduct a more thorough study of their interests and abilities, and to determine which subject to enter in the second year.

The current shortcomings of the second and third-year general courses in high school are that those preparing to enter the university's science and engineering departments feel that mathematics and physics are insufficient, which makes high school seniors feel difficult to apply to universities.

Those who are preparing to enter the university's arts, law, business, and medical departments feel that there are too many mathematics and physics courses studied in the current second and third grades of high school, and they feel that there are not enough courses for their own needs. Therefore, I think that specialization should start from the second year of high school.
— Guan Xianwu, Nantong

(4) What China currently needs is practical, effective, and targeted education that meets the needs of national construction. If so many years are spent on studying superficial and impractical theories, then it is unnecessary. Therefore, for the sake of the future, it is urgent to change this school system to break through the difficulty of seeking knowledge and to meet practical needs.
— You Cheng, this city

(5) In our country, which lacks talent, we can enable every young person to have a skill, so that they will not be threatened by unemployment as soon as they enter society, and we can also avoid the suffering of a lack of specialized talent everywhere. This is not only the luck of tens of millions of young people across the country, but also the luck of the country and society. But most young people are unable to enter university. Can we not give them some practical skills and watch them become unemployed?
— Tan Dezhen, this city

(6) It may be better to change the junior high school to a four-year system, and the senior high school specialization to also be four years. Then, the high school graduates after eight years will not create "talents" who are neither literary nor military.
— Rong Xicun, Ningbo

(7) Students hope to specialize, and the attitude of the school authorities is almost the same, but they hope to make it more specific.

Subject specialization in high school has long been an established practice in some places, such as in some schools in Hunan. The method is to choose one of arts or science from the second grade onwards. However, before the education system changes, for example, even if high schools specialize, and entering university still requires taking science subjects, what is the use of this?

I hope that the education system of the authorities can be coordinated with reality.
— Zhang Diou, Nanjing

(8) Today's high school has completely become an institution for taking university entrance examinations. Apart from the greatest purpose of taking university entrance examinations, it seems that it has no other purpose in itself. Because you have to take integral calculus, algebra, and geometry to enter university, you study integral calculus, algebra, and geometry; because you have to take social studies, economics, physics, and chemistry to enter university, you study social studies, economics, physics, and chemistry. He did not take into account whether these are in line with the needs of students? Is it helpful to the profession? This has created the tragedy of today's learning is not used.
— Chen Liangting, this city

(9) If I specialized in high school, if I wanted to study medicine, I would focus on the literary aspects, such as Chinese language and literature, chemistry, and biology. I can reduce a lot of unnecessary troubles in mathematics and physics.

A person who studies medicine feels that high school needs to specialize. I think people who study engineering, science, or law must have the same feeling.
— Wei Zandao, this city

(10) Judging from the general economic situation of Chinese society at present, how many out of ten high school graduates can continue their studies for further education? Therefore, I agree that the current secondary school education system should be supplemented by a subject specialization system.
— Liu Yijin of Dashi, high reward for flood relief

(11) The specialization of agricultural science is most needed. Farmers account for the majority of our country's population. After graduating from ordinary high schools, farmers' children will no longer engage in rural service improvement. Because what they have learned is not what they use, the level of rural education cannot be improved today, and the agricultural science is declining. Therefore, high school specialization is extremely suitable in middle schools in rural towns.
— Lu Zhixin, Nanjing

(12) I absolutely hope that high schools will specialize, and adopt a subject selection system, which is indeed a matter of urgency.
— Jin Guan, this city

(13) In a nutshell, many malpractices, speeding, and truancy can all be said to be the result of the current unreasonable high school curriculum. If a subject specialization system can be implemented, allowing them to each have their own place and learn in peace, their grades will naturally be satisfactory.
— Zheng Hongji, this city

(14) As for the method of specialization, we advocate that we still use the past method of "arts" and "science" subjects. This is the case in European countries such as Germany and France. As for the multi-subject secondary schools (including vocational or normal subjects of various subjects) in the American or Soviet style, it is not the normal senior high school, and we do not advocate adoption.
— Xu Jijing, Changzhou

Reasons for Opposing Subject Specialization

A I am studying natural sciences, and I am now working in a factory. I dare not agree with subject specialization in high school. My opinion is:

(1) High school subject specialization is prone to causing "learning is not suitable" - a person's interests; it is not possible to determine within a short period of time. Many students are still hesitant when preparing to enter university after graduating from high school, and do not know which subject to choose? Even students studying in university often find that the subjects they have chosen do not match their interests. If a junior high school graduate is asked to study a specialized subject, there will be no satisfactory results; random choices are enough to cause future regrets, which is a waste of time.

(2) High school specialization has the disadvantage of "caring about this and losing that" - If it is said that high school specialization is because four years of university is not specialized enough, or because people who study business and literature say that geometry and trigonometry are not useful, then I say that specialization should be implemented in elementary school, or there is no need to go to school, go to factories as workers, and go to stores as apprentices, that is truly learning what is useful and very specialized. But this is the method of training craftsmen. Good scientists and industrialists are not made this way. They should have knowledge of all aspects, and have sufficient knowledge of natural sciences, social sciences, and business sciences, so that specialized training should be discussed after the foundation of general knowledge is laid. Without a good foundation, specialization is "craftsman".
— Ming, this city

B Secondary schools already have specialized schools, which can be seen everywhere. Students can apply for advanced or transfer schools as their interests dictate. In general, the test questions for university majors belong to general subjects. Obviously, it is not suitable for high school majors. They must be grouped for the exam, and it is difficult for most to follow. Moreover, the teaching process of university majors goes from shallow to deep. High school majors inevitably have a sense of repetition, and it is necessary to study at the same time as those who have entered general subjects. There will inevitably be familiarity, unfamiliarity, and speed. There are many disadvantages in teaching. If students cannot enter the university majors due to their financial resources, they must learn specialized knowledge and skills early in order to learn and be useful. It is also not in line with the trend. Try to watch the daily newspapers, the companies, commercial agencies, institutions, and groups published on the newspaper, which are very restricted. Specialized talents are limited to universities or university majors and above. Therefore, high school specialization, the academic qualifications of scholars, from the perspective of the general society, still feels that the creation is insufficient.
— Qiu Jie, Nantong

(Editor's Note: Those who oppose specialization also include Mr. Chen Kaijia of Jiangdu, Mr. Xu Nanrong of this city, Wanshi, Zhongkai, Zhao, and Ning Zhenrui, seven gentlemen. Because their opinions are roughly the same, they are omitted.)

### Coordinate with the Needs of National Construction and Strengthen Professional Training

— Xu Dongqi

—Subject Training is Essential

To meet the needs of national construction, we must strengthen professional training, because semi-proficient "generalists" can hardly achieve the goal of applying what they have learned. What is urgently needed today is: to cultivate a large number of mid-level talents to engage in the country's revitalization and construction; and to cultivate their skills to live independently, so subject training has become essential.

From a moral point of view, the advantage of specialization lies in economy and expertise, as well as reducing the risk of unemployment. Finally, it can promote the completion of the great cause of national construction. However, its shortcoming is that it is biased towards various subjects and various departments, and it is not easy to obtain a general understanding. In addition, there seem to be no other shortcomings. However, this alone cannot be considered a reason why specialization should not be implemented, right?

The method of selecting courses in secondary schools has been tried out for a long time. From the second academic year of high school, students are divided into Group A and Group B. There are required courses and elective courses; the teaching hours of each subject vary depending on the group. What we are proposing now "Subject Training", is only a further step in the method of selecting courses; it is closer to "professionalization" and is a preparation for the division of labor and cooperation in society. (Dang Shu)

### I Propose a Compromise Solution: Add Courses to High School and Allow Elective Courses

— Dan Meng

The shortcoming of the current three-three system of secondary schools lies in the fact that students with different personalities are given a uniform educational system and are given injected objective education, which fails to follow the development of each person's specialization and interests. Although vocational education, such as industrial schools and commercial schools, is bound by tradition and has little effect.

If secondary schools adopt a subject specialization system, the drawbacks will easily cause students to fall into an unsound foundation. To avoid this foresight, adding courses and allowing elective courses will be a worthwhile strategy to consider.

It is probably inevitable that the three-three system will be reformed into a six-year system. In this way, the waste of adding shelves on the bed can be avoided. Under the unified plan of the six-year system, the implementation of adding and selecting courses is not only possible, but also necessary. In addition to English, Chinese, and civics, which are required courses, the teaching methods of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and history and geography should be unified, and there is no need to teach them twice in junior high school and high school. Elementary physics and chemistry, elementary history and geography, arithmetic, algebra, and plane geometry can be forced to be read; high school physics and chemistry, history and geography, solid geometry, and analytic geometry can be listed as elective courses. Moreover, the purpose of setting up these courses was originally to facilitate entrance to a certain department of the university, and it is completely useless to students who do not wish to choose a certain college, so it should be abolished.

What courses should be added? The general principle is to combine the basic specialized courses, which generally have to be repeated in the first year of university, into the later stages of secondary school. Then it will have advanced physics and chemistry, advanced history and geography, and other mathematics. In addition, the extra time can be used to add other elective courses, such as general theory of law, political science, bookkeeping, journalism, economics, commercial overview, selected poems, selected texts, literary writing, mechanics, electricity, outline of machinery, general outline of medicine, overview of agriculture, and a greater number of homework, which students can choose to read by themselves. Fortunately, their interests lie in their career will be determined afterwards. And when they find that they are incompatible, it is easy to switch. It is also stipulated that each student must choose several kinds, then they can actively find their own way out.

Although this cannot create specialized talents, but only sow seeds, but even if secondary school specializes, the talents who study it are also generally poor. Then it is better to adopt this method, which can be much more flexible and allow each young person to have the opportunity to search for their own interests. (Suzhou)

### Introducing a High School with Subject Specialization

— Yi Ding

Whether high schools should specialize has become a focus of discussion. In the end, which is better or worse, each has its own views. I will now introduce a high school with subject specialization and introduce its general situation as follows, which I think can be used as a reference for the education community:

Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School was founded in the 16th year of the Republic of China. It was initially divided into normal, ordinary, and commercial subjects. Later, it was changed to science, engineering, and commerce subjects until today.

Science is roughly similar to ordinary subjects, but mathematics and physics are more important, while history and geography are listed as non-major subjects. Teaching focuses on experiments. Physics, chemistry, and biology all have laboratories, where students experiment in groups. Currently, due to time and teaching progress, Science One experiments on biology, Science Two experiments on chemistry, and Science Three experiments on physics, with two or three students in a group for experiments. Science focuses on further education, and because the level of mathematics and physics is higher, those who are admitted to the National University's School of Science and Engineering account for an absolute majority.

Commerce and Engineering can be listed as vocational subjects, but some also continue their studies. I will now give a brief introduction to the Commerce and Engineering subjects:

The first grade of commerce has bookkeeping, typing and other subjects and related business common sense aspects. The second grade will further study commercial geography, commercial theory, cooperative studies, management, and there is a consumer cooperative for experimentation. Commerce Three's experimental management is "Shangzhong Bank", and it studies statistics, accounting, and national trade. In addition to interning at Shangzhong Bank, Commerce Three students can also intern at foreign firms or banks.

The engineering curriculum is relatively heavy. In the first and second grades, algebra, geometry, analytic geometry, and trigonometry are studied completely, and engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and drawing are added. Intern at Shangzhong Factory. The third grade adds courses such as mechanical principles, automotive science, and aircraft science, and the internship is also heavy. Therefore, engineering students have as many as eight hours of classes every day, and in addition, they have to do homework and practice, which makes them feel unable to handle it. This point is also a shortcoming of engineering. The signer believes that it is really necessary to appropriately extend the length of study.

The above is a simple introduction to the science, engineering, and commerce subjects of "Shangzhong". If you scholars want to make a more detailed study, you can consult the following two gentlemen: Principal Dr. Shen Yizhen and Director of Academic Affairs Mr. Lu Keyi.

The school address is Aojia Lane, Hu Min Road, Shanghai.
