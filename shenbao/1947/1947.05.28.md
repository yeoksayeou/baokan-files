### Summons to a Banquet for Kuomintang Councilors: President Chiang Delivers Sincere Instructions, Clarifying the Unwavering Original Intention to Seek Peace

[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] Kuomintang President Chiang summoned all Kuomintang councilors to a banquet at the Lishi Society at 7:30 PM on the 27th. Over a hundred people attended. During the banquet, President Chiang first delivered a sincere and tactful speech, emphasizing that the government had never abandoned its desire for peace and would strive to achieve it. Secondly, regarding military matters, he believed that the war situation had made some progress. As for economic issues, there would be a review of the implementation techniques of the emergency economic measures plan. Subsequently, Chen Cheng, who had just returned to Nanjing from Xuzhou, attended and reported on military affairs. The banquet ended around 9 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] During the banquet for Kuomintang councilors on the evening of the 27th, President Chiang delivered a brief speech, stating roughly: The nation has undergone eight years of war and absolutely needs peace. To achieve this goal, the government has been making continuous efforts with a spirit of generosity and tolerance since the victory of the war. However, whether peace can be achieved depends entirely on the attitude of the Communist Party, that is, whether the Communist Party can prioritize the nation and the people and demonstrate its sincerity in seeking peace. On the government's side, if there is a glimmer of hope for peace, it will never change its original intention to seek peace. He hoped that everyone would share this understanding.

[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] On the eve of the Political Council's discussion of peace proposals, Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan invited ten people, including Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Xu Deheng, He Jihong, Fan Zisui, Jiang Hengyuan, Wang Menglin, and Zhu Yiqing, to discuss and solicit their opinions on the peace issue at around 6 PM on the 27th. It is reported that Liang and the other ten had conducted discussions before meeting with Zhang. Their opinions were reported to Chairman Chiang by Zhang Qun on the night of the 27th and instructions were requested, which were then relayed to Liang and others. They will still attend the plenary review committee on the 28th as usual. Chairman Chiang has also scheduled a luncheon with Liang, Xu, and others on the 28th for further discussions.

Council Sends Telegram to Mao Zedong and Others, Inviting Them to Nanjing to Jointly Plan National Affairs

[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] The telegram from the Political Council to the Communist Party councilors, inviting them to come to Nanjing to attend the meeting, was first broadcast by the Central Broadcasting Station at 12:00 PM on the 26th. The telegram was drafted by the secretariat based on the temporary emergency motion of one hundred people, including Xiao Yishan, passed by the General Assembly on the 26th. At the same time, a telegram was also sent to Wu Yunfu, the chief Communist Party representative, requesting him to forward it. At 9:30 AM on the 27th, at the twelfth meeting of the Political Council, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen first announced the telegram to the General Assembly and explained that in order to notify the Communist Party as soon as possible, it was first broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station that evening. At 3:00 PM on the 27th, the Central Broadcasting Station jointly broadcast it again with the National Broadcasting Station. The General Assembly fully agreed with the telegram and its handling. The telegram was officially released by the Political Council, and the original text is as follows:

To Mr. Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, Huang Biwu, Zhou Enlai, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yingchao, Chen Shaoyu, and other gentlemen: The General Assembly today believes that peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the country, and the members of this council should make a final effort to resolve the national crisis. It is resolved to send a telegram inviting the Communist Party councilors to come to Nanjing to attend the meeting and jointly plan national affairs. This telegram is hereby sent for your consideration, and please reply with instructions. National Political Council, You (26th).

### Overview of the National Resources Commission's Enterprises

[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] When Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the National Resources Commission (NRC), reported on the work of the NRC to the Political Council on the morning of the 27th, he pointed out that the purpose of the state-owned industrial and mining enterprises run by the NRC was to gradually build up national capital and establish the economic foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood, which is completely different from the so-called "bureaucratic capital."

### 90% of Industrial Equipment in Northeast China Was Dismantled and Removed

The enterprises operated by the National Resources Commission can be divided into ten categories: electricity, coal, petroleum, steel, other metals (including tungsten, antimony, tin, etc.), machinery, chemicals, cement, and sugar. The following is a description of five categories:

(1) Electricity: A. Northeast: The degree of electricity development in the Northeast region by the Japanese was very high. The total power generation of its hydroelectric and thermal power plants was over 2 million kilowatts. However, after the Soviet army entered, most of it was dismantled and removed. Subsequently, the Communist army followed and entered, and the loss of power equipment was extremely heavy. Currently, only Xiaofengman has 140,000 kilowatts, Fushun has 30,000 kilowatts, and others have 30,000 kilowatts, totaling 200,000 kilowatts. Ninety percent has been lost, which is truly regrettable! B. North China: The power centers of North China are Tianjin, Beiping, and Tangshan. The Japanese built long-distance power lines to connect them. According to the original Japanese plan, North China could have 120,000 kilowatts of electricity. However, by the end of the war, only 60,000 kilowatts had been completed. After our reorganization, it has been increased to 90,000 kilowatts. Unfortunately, due to the poor original equipment and the diverse sources of machinery, everything is not ideal. The situation may improve after the American equipment arrives. C. Taiwan: The original power capacity was 320,000 kilowatts. However, the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant was destroyed by bombing during the Pacific War. When we took over, only 40,000 kilowatts remained. After reorganization, there are now 180,000 kilowatts, which is sufficient for the entire province. The total power capacity of the country is about 900,000 kilowatts, of which about 570,000 kilowatts belong to the National Resources Commission, accounting for more than 63% of the total. Given the size of China, this amount of electricity is definitely not enough. The United States has 50 million kilowatts of electricity nationwide, and England also has 14 million kilowatts. We must continue to work hard in the future. It should be mentioned that the Three Gorges water conservancy project on the Yangtze River can supply more than 10 million kilowatts of electricity after completion, and the price is also very low. Unfortunately, this project requires 3-4 billion US dollars, which is not allowed under the current financial situation. We have to reluctantly suspend it and use the remaining resources to build other small-scale power plants.

### Communist Army Captures Coal Mine, All Equipment Destroyed

(2) Coal Mines: A. Northeast: The major coal mines taken over by the National Resources Commission include Fushun, Benxi, Xi'an, Beipiao, and Fuxin. However, due to military reasons, these five mines could not be continued, or due to poor equipment, accidents occurred from time to time, and production was sharply reduced. It is already difficult for each mine to produce 5,000-6,000 tons per day. B. Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi: The coal quality of this mine is excellent and is the only large mine in the north. Its quality is higher than that of the Kailuan Coal Mine. We were planning to reorganize it after taking over. The mine has been captured by the Communist Party. Although it was later recovered, most of the machinery was dismantled and important parts were destroyed. It is now mined using indigenous methods, producing only a few hundred tons per day. C. Ji-Lu Area: The Zhongxing Coal Mine in Shandong and other mines in Hebei were mostly destroyed by the Communist army.

(3) Petroleum: We extracted oil in Gansu during the war. In the past, we could produce about 4 million gallons per year. However, because the wells were too close to each other when drilling, it has now dropped to 200,000 gallons per year. It is expected to increase to 300,000 gallons this month, and it can continue to increase next month. The total amount for the year should not be less than last year. In addition, in the Northeast, before the end of the war, the Japanese considered setting up a synthetic oil refinery in the Northeast. After we took over, we do not plan to do so for the time being. In addition, the crude oil refinery is currently being repaired and is expected to produce oil in the second half of the year. In Taiwan, the oil refinery built by the Japanese in Kaohsiung was not completed and the war stopped. We are now building it in three phases and expect to complete it before the end of this year. The crude oil purchased from foreign countries is shipped in three batches of 6,000 tons each. It is expected to arrive before the end of this month. In total, our current gasoline production is only enough for the country for two months a year, and continued efforts are needed.

In total, the estimated output of the petroleum industry this year is 12 million gallons of crude oil, 18 million gallons of gasoline, 15 million gallons of kerosene, 16 million gallons of diesel, 33 million gallons of heavy oil and fuel oil, and 180,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Gasoline production is about 20% of the country's needs.

(4) Steel: A. Northeast: The two major plants in Benxi and Anshan were dismantled by the Soviet army and destroyed by the Communist army, leaving them in ruins. Anshan currently produces only 60 tons per day, but it can be greatly increased next year. It is hoped that a large part of the steelmaking machines can be obtained from Japanese reparations, so that our country can also manufacture its own steel rails in the future. B. Shijingshan and Tangshan in North China also have considerable output. The current difficulty is the lack of machinery. If we want to establish a new foundation, we should seek help from reparations. In terms of output, the products of the National Resources Commission's plants account for 100% of the country's total.

(5) Cement: Before the war, the total cement production in the country was about 1 million tons. After the victory, we took over two factories in the Northeast, Benxi and others. The production of the Benxi Cement Plant is limited due to electricity supply problems, and the machinery of the other plant was dismantled. The two plants are expected to produce 50,000 tons of cement this year. The two plants in North China are expected to produce 140,000 tons this year. The three plants in Taiwan can produce 150,000 tons this year and are expected to increase to 400,000 tons next year. The total cement production in the country is 700,000 tons, and the National Resources Commission produces more than 300,000 tons, accounting for about 45% of the total.

Weng then briefly reported on the general situation of the enterprises operated by the National Resources Commission. It is said that the organizational structure of the National Resources Commission's enterprises can be divided into two categories: (1) enterprises solely invested or jointly invested with other government agencies, the organizational methods of which are divided into limited liability companies and factories/mines; (2) enterprises with private shareholders participating, which all adopt the joint-stock company method in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. There are a total of 70 units in the first category of enterprises. As of the end of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), the book value of their fixed assets was approximately 849 billion yuan. There are a total of 23 units in the second category of enterprises, and the value of fixed assets is more than 190 billion yuan. If calculated at market prices, their value is more than this.

The National Resources Commission pays attention to specialized technical skills in the selection of staff. There are a total of 32,000 staff members and 220,000 workers, totaling 250,000 people. The salaries of staff members do not exceed 30% of the salaries of civil servants. The prices of the National Resources Commission's products are all lower than market prices. Some enterprises, such as electricity, coal, and petroleum, are subject to government price restrictions. Other steel, sugar, etc. are subject to considerable restrictions by the National Resources Commission. For example, the market price of pig iron in Shanghai is about 3 million yuan per ton, while the National Resources Commission only sells it for more than 1.8 million yuan. The market price of steel products is more than 7 million yuan, while the National Resources Commission only sells it for 3.5 to 4 million yuan.

### Last Year's Surplus Funds All Submitted to the National Treasury

In terms of the overall business performance of the National Resources Commission's enterprises, the total operating income last year was 267.7 billion yuan, the expenditure was 239 billion yuan, and the surplus was 28.5 billion yuan, which has been submitted to the national treasury. It is hoped that this year's surplus can reach 50 billion yuan. The National Resources Commission pays all statutory taxes on the enterprises it operates.

Weng then analyzed the fundamental policy of the National Resources Commission. It is said that the National Resources Commission focuses on operating and constructing large-scale basic industrial and mining enterprises, and does not hope to take on too many factories that were urgently needed during the Anti-Japanese War and those taken over after the war. It is not necessary for the government to continue to operate these, and they will be transferred to private or local governments. A total of 26 units have already been transferred, including alcohol chemical plants and power plants. Sixteen units are ready to be sold, five of which are paper mills that can produce 100 tons of paper per day.

Finally, Weng said that the future work of the National Resources Commission will be on the one hand to repair the disabled and gradually put them into operation, and on the other hand to consider the need to establish new enterprises. Of course, there are various difficulties in carrying out this type of work. The economic situation across the country is unstable, income and expenditure cannot be balanced, and those who handle affairs cannot feel at ease, which is just one aspect. However, since they have taken on this responsibility, they are obliged to do their best to achieve success.

### List of Political Council Review Committees Determined, Review Work Begins Today, Administrative Reports All Completed Last Night

[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] The reporting stage of the current session of the Political Council was fully completed on the evening of the 27th, and it was decided to start the review work from the 28th. The administrative reports heard by the General Assembly began on the 21st and lasted for seven days, with thirteen meetings. In addition to the Land Administration and Health Departments reporting to the Review Committee, there were fifteen reports, including political reports, which, together with the written reports of the five Yuan, were sent to the respective Review Committees for review. The list of members of each Review Committee was proposed by the Presidium and passed at the thirteenth meeting on the afternoon of the 27th. The first Review Committee is composed of councilors Du Gou Ruo and others, and the conveners are Wang Zemin, Chen Shaoxian, and Liu Xing.

The second special seasonal committee is composed of Guang Sheng and others, and the conveners are Yan Shutang, Jiang Yiping, and Duanmu Kai. On the morning of the 28th, a joint plenary review meeting will be held first to review various proposals related to peace talks.

[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] The twelfth meeting of the Political Council was held at 9:30 AM on the 27th. Chairman Zhang Boling and Deputy Secretary Lei reported that as of last night, a total of 301 councilors had registered, and 209 people attended today. It was reported that the telegram from the General Assembly to the Communist Party councilors to attend the meeting in Nanjing had been broadcast. After the report, the Work Report of Chairman Weng Wenhao of the National Resources Commission was heard. Weng added a detailed analysis on the work situation, business overview, and work policy. Afterwards, the councilors raised about 30 written and oral inquiries, mostly focusing on the work of the National Resources Commission in the Northeast and the future construction plans in the Northwest and Southwest. Weng selected the main points to answer. The meeting ended at about 12:15 PM. The general situation of this morning's meeting was good, and there were not many inquiries from the councilors. The atmosphere was particularly calm. The thirteenth General Assembly was held at 3:30 PM, with 219 councilors attending. Chairman Wu Yifang first listened to the work report of Director Huo Baoshu of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), followed by the councilors raising 33 written and oral inquiries, which Huo briefly answered. After a ten-minute break at about 6 PM, Chen Qitian, the new Minister of Economic Affairs, continued to report, and the meeting adjourned at about 7 PM.

### Political Council Snippets

— Our Reporter Yu Zhenyi

When Weng Wenhao reported on the work of the National Resources Commission, his Zhejiang Lanqing Mandarin, coupled with a barrage of place names and numbers, was very difficult to understand.

The machinery and equipment left to us by Japan was not small in number, but those in the Northeast were first moved away by the Soviet Union, who were "fighting for a few days," and then many were destroyed due to the war. Weng repeatedly said "Unfortunately" more than once when reporting such facts.

The councilors addressed Weng differently in their written and oral inquiries. Some called him Minister Weng, some called him Chairman Weng, and some called him Mr. Weng. Some councilors asked the National Resources Commission about the affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

One councilor asked why the government did not find a way to mine gold in several western provinces, where gold is everywhere, in order to curb inflation. Chen Baoyin said that Xikang, Jilin, and other places have atomic energy elements, which should be mined to meet the needs of the new era.

Chen Yaodong asked: "The Capital Power Plant usually cuts off power by district, but on the day the Political Council meets, it is brightly lit. How coincidental!" He advocated that bureaucratic capital across the country should be investigated, and the investigation work should start from Nanjing, especially from the Capital Power Plant.

The situation of work in the Northeast was the main focus of inquiries. Gu Gengye said that some staff members sat in cars, running around the streets, eating, drinking, and dancing, neglecting their proper duties, eating "big fish and meat every day, with lavish food and wine," and still saying "eating coarse tea and simple meals every day, working hard." It's really letting the country down.

Weng's answers were quite witty. He said to some things: "As far as I know, it's not that serious." He promised to "check" on the outrageous affairs of the Northeast personnel, and pushed away all the matters of China Textile Industries Corporation and other things that were not under the jurisdiction of the National Resources Commission.

The UNRRA work report was trivial and disorganized, full of dull numbers, and some councilors were snoring in their seats. The facetious said that what the Political Council meeting needed was "stimulants and relief supplies," not "sleeping pills."

The councilors gave UNRRA several strange names in their written and oral inquiries. Some called it "Relief Headquarters," some called it "Distribution Agency" or "Friction Agency."

Many councilors pointed out that UNRRA uses milk, canned food, and rags to pick up the old and poor, which cannot cure hunger and cannot keep out the cold. It is truly a waste without benefit."

Yu Nanqiu appealed for the people of Hunan, saying that the local famine victims use tree bark as the best poor grain. Yu Ruzhou, a councilor from the Northeast, also "brought tears to the meeting," hoping to provide more relief.

He Jihong said that some people blamed Jiang Tingfu for not being able to do business, but UNRRA is now selling materials under the leadership of Director Huo and exchanging them for cotton to resell to China Textile Industries Corporation, which is completely a business eye.

A series of inquiries suddenly turned the extremely silent atmosphere of the meeting lively. Yan Shutang sang "Three Hates for Director Huo" on the stage, (1) hating him for unfair distribution, (2) hating him for not knowing the priorities, and (3) hating him for not being thick-skinned enough, winning a lot of laughter and applause.

Wu Wangji gave a grand speech in Zhejiang Mandarin. He said that the office staff of an UNRRA branch is as many as several thousand, more than the staff of the provincial government. The organization is huge and wastes money.

The UNRRA inquiry was completed at 6 o'clock, and there was still a report from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Everyone was extremely anxious, but under the capable handling of Chairman Wu Yifang, the agenda progressed smoothly with verbal and bell prompts. The entire work was completed within an hour, and the title of "the most capable chairman of the Political Council" is well-deserved.

Chen Qitian, the new Minister of Economic Affairs, gave a report that can be called simple and clear. In just 18 minutes, he explained his attitude and the future policy. It was indeed the shortest of the reports of the officials in this conference.

One councilor hoped in a written inquiry that Chen would "break the bureaucratic style and give the people a fresh start." There were only eight written and oral inquiries today, the fewest inquiries of any ministry, which proves that the councilors are generally polite to the new minister.

### UNRRA Business Report

Director Huo Baoshu of UNRRA attended the Political Council on the afternoon of the 27th to give a brief explanation of UNRRA's extensive operations. Huo pointed out that the total fund of UNRRA is only 2 billion US dollars. Although the supplies finally decided to be allocated to China have accounted for one-third of the total fund of UNRRA, they are still not enough to be distributed to various provinces and cities.

All business activities of UNRRA must be based on the basic agreement signed between the Chinese government and UNRRA. The treaty stipulates that China has the obligation to faithfully fulfill the resolutions of the UNRRA General Assembly. UNRRA has the right to consult and supervise the handling of supplies transported to China. Therefore, UNRRA consults with UNRRA on the handling of each event. The distribution, transportation, sale, and use of supplies are all handled through consultation by various committees organized by the UNRRA Joint Headquarters.

The total tonnage of supplies supplied by UNRRA to China is approximately 2.7 million tons, of which relief supplies account for approximately 45% and rehabilitation supplies account for approximately 55%. Various supplies are shipped in batches, and it is increasingly felt that they are not enough for distribution.

After the supplies arrive, some are used for relief and some are used for rehabilitation. Those used for relief are emergency relief, work relief, sending refugees back to their hometowns, and social welfare. As of the end of April this year, 1.4 million people have been sent back to their hometowns. 280,000 tons of food and more than 20,000 tons of clothing have been distributed for emergency relief work. The work relief projects give priority to water conservancy, followed by road repair, and then small-scale textile and health projects. There are more than 120 water conservancy projects, large ones such as the Yellow River, seadikes, the Yangtze River, embankments, and the Pearl River water conservancy, most of which have been completed. The benefited farmland is approximately 60 million mu, and the benefited farmers reach 30 million people. As for social welfare undertakings, more than 3,000 units have been organized, either directly by UNRRA, jointly by UNRRA and social organizations, or completely entrusted to social organizations. A total of 150,000 tons of food has been allocated, benefiting 5.5 million people. Regarding the use of medical equipment, UNRRA has subsidized more than 1,600 health agencies and public and private hospitals, and allocated more than 15,000 units of hospital bed equipment.

The rehabilitation supplies include transportation equipment and industrial, mining, and fishing equipment. UNRRA has transported 200,000 tons of transportation equipment. The world is currently short of transportation equipment, and it is not easy for UNRRA to obtain it. The rapid recovery of transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Hankou railways is due to the supply of UNRRA equipment. Industrial and mining equipment includes electrical machinery, power plant, and coal mining equipment. There are many types of agricultural and fishing equipment, and the more notable ones are more than 100 new-style fishing vessels and more than 1,000 plowing machines.

Finally, Huo mentioned the relief in the Communist area, the restoration of the Yellow River flood area, and the funding problems of UNRRA. He said, "Last year, the disasters in Hunan and Guangxi provinces were serious, and work relief projects in various places also needed food. Most of the food was used to rescue disaster areas and carry out work relief. Not only did the Communist area not get much, but the northern provinces also got less. In February and March of this year, more than 20,000 tons of supplies were rushed to the Communist area, which was more than what other areas received during the same period.

The soil in the Yellow River flood area will become a desert, and the restoration work is urgent. The highest authorities and local people are enthusiastic about advocating the restoration of the flood area. The UNRRA Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu branches have been concentrating their efforts on handling the work in the flood area since April 1. Although UNRRA's funding accounts for a considerable proportion in the national budget, it is still not enough to support the many operations. In order to help us complete the scheduled plan, UNRRA has approved the conversion of supplies that cannot be delivered after May 31 to cotton to be transported to China and sold to supplement UNRRA's funding shortage.

Huo's report prompted the councilors to raise 12 oral inquiries, all of which were answered satisfactorily.

[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] Director Huo of UNRRA was heavily attacked by various parties during his report to the Political Council on the 27th, especially the councilors from the Northeast. The councilors from other North China provinces also raised serious questions about UNRRA's failure to transport enough food to the disaster areas. Northeast councilors Han Chunxuan and Yu Ruzhou loudly appealed, hoping on the one hand to improve the various malpractices of the UNRRA Northeast Office, and on the other hand to transport a large amount of supplies to provide relief. He Jihong, Sun Shengwu, and others appealed for the disaster victims in North China, hoping to allocate grain as soon as possible to provide relief. Disaster relief is as urgent as fighting a fire and cannot be delayed any longer. In addition, some councilors also asked for help for Shandong, and their speeches were extremely sorrowful. Yan Shutang and Wu Wangji and others criticized UNRRA's organization and efficiency, believing that UNRRA's distribution was unfair, did not know the priorities, and wasted money. Huo replied that UNRRA was prepared to distribute more food to the north. However, it can be said that of the 1.9 million tons of supplies transported to China by UNRRA, 1.1 million tons were grain. There is not much left now. There are tens of thousands of tons of rice planned to be distributed to the southern provinces. In addition, there are tens of thousands of tons of noodles planned to be used to provide relief to Lu and Yu. Currently, UNRRA has not yet passed the danger period. It is hoped that the central government, local governments, and public and private organizations can cooperate. It is hoped that the councilors can appeal to foreign countries. UNRRA has made a request, but it is difficult to say whether it is promising.

### Wu Shangying Arrives in San Francisco; Will Continue Visit to Washington and Ottawa

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 27th - Radio broadcast: Wu Shangying, the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan and leader of the Chinese delegation tasked with harmonizing relations between China, the United States, and Canada, arrived here today from Japan. Mr. Wu stated in a speech that his primary mission is to clarify the status of foreigners in China since the abolition of extraterritoriality in 1943. Regarding the anti-American demonstrations that occurred in various parts of China a few months ago, he stated, "This kind of emotional impulse does not originate from the people's true feelings, but is agitated by a few individuals with ulterior motives engaging in reckless propaganda." The delegation will continue its visit to Washington and Ottawa.

### Weng Wenhao's Response to Inquiries

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 27th Dispatch] The councilors of the参政会 (National Political Council) concentrated their written and oral questions, which were presented to Weng Wenhao in the morning of the 27th, on two major issues: (1) the working situation of the 资源委员会 (Resources Commission) in Northeast China and other regions, and (2) how to continue the development of industrial construction in Southwest and Northwest China and other regions.

The councilor from Northeast China, Cui Chuiyan, and others, pointed out painfully that the performance of the 资源委员会 (Resources Commission) in Northeast China was quite unsatisfactory. Someone once said that if the Northeast were managed by the Japanese, it could recover to the state it was in on August 13th in three years, but if it were managed by the Chinese, it would revert to the state it was in on September 18th in three years, which is heartbreaking to say! Currently, the 资源委员会 (Resources Commission) only takes over complete factories, but ignores the incomplete ones. It is hoped that the authorities will not simply follow past practices, for that would be fortunate for the nation!

Pan Lianru raised an inquiry about the issue of principles, asking why the report did not mention regional allocation, and also inquired about what plans there were for dispersing factories in this atomic age. Another councilor also asked whether the government was planning to mine uranium to meet the needs of the times. Mr. Weng responded to each question one by one.

### United Association of College Students of Specialized Fields Presents Four Demands to the Executive Yuan

### Illegal Activities of Zhongfu and Yangzi Companies Thoroughly Investigated

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 27th Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to Shanghai to secretly investigate the illegal profit-making activities of Zhongfu and Yangzi companies, and the results have been obtained. This case was once questioned by councilors to Minister of Finance Yu, who stated, "This case is being handled under the orders of Chairman Chiang, and the investigation results will be reported to Chairman Chiang." These companies and others violated import and export control regulations in Shanghai, privately transporting foreign goods and making huge profits. It is now learned that the personnel sent by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to Shanghai for secret investigation have returned to Nanjing, and have jointly completed a lengthy report of over a hundred pages, which has been submitted to Chairman Chiang for review.

### Mo Dehui Arrives in Shanghai; Feels Unwell Due to Storms En Route

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Mo Dehui, a member of the National Government Committee, returned to Shanghai from Taiwan on the Zhongxing ship at 7:30 p.m. on the 26th. Due to physical discomfort, he was admitted to Zhongshan Hospital for recuperation. Mr. Mo told reporters yesterday, "I left Keelung Port on the Zhongxing ship on the morning of the 24th. Less than sixty miles out, we encountered a storm, and the ship's engine malfunctioned. It was repaired for more than ten hours before restarting, and then it stopped twice more due to malfunctions. Just as we encountered a violent storm and waves, the whole ship was in panic. Some passengers asked Mr. Mo to call Chairman Wei to send a ship for rescue. The situation at the time was extremely critical, and there was a life-threatening danger at any moment. Thinking about it now, it feels like another world. I spent three days at sea in the storm, vomiting continuously, and almost fainted several times. Therefore, after arriving at the port last night, I was too exhausted to move. After landing at 9 a.m. on the 27th, I went straight to this hospital for recuperation. My blood pressure is now above 180, and I need to rest for a while before I can go to Nanjing." He also said, "In my personal opinion, Zhang Xueliang's restoration of freedom is not far away, because Mr. Zhang has recently been studying the history of the Ming Dynasty with great concentration, which is extraordinary. Therefore, he has gained the government's understanding, which may reduce the term of his confinement." Kong Xiangxi also went to visit Mr. Mo around 7 p.m. last night.

### The Reformist Faction of the Democratic Socialist Party Issues a Declaration and a Letter to Party Members

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to convene an organization committee today. A certain key member pointed out that the number of attendees is sufficient to meet the quorum, making it legitimate. However, the reformist faction believes that only the Standing Committee has the power to convene the organization committee, so Zhang Junmai's individual convocation is illegitimate. They have decided not to participate, and said that Wu Xianzi has always regarded convening the organization committee as unnecessary, and will not participate.

It is also learned that the reformist faction of the Democratic Socialist Party issued a declaration of the reform committee and a letter to party members last night, accusing Zhang Junmai of authoritarianism and disrespect for the powers of the Standing Committee. They also said that they will convene a national congress in the short term to re-decide policies and strengthen the organization, and that from now on, they will not recognize any decisions made by Zhang Junmai regarding the Democratic Socialist Party.

[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 27th] Former Lieutenant Colonel Evans, while serving as a US military civil affairs officer in Taiwan, stole gold coins and bars worth US$100,000.

### Letter to the Editor

I read the news item "The Situation in Northern Jiangsu is Gradually Stabilizing" on the first page of your newspaper on May 20th, which stated, "The remnants of the Communists near Dongtai and Caoyan have been repelled by the National Army earlier this week, and Dazhongji has also returned to the control of the National Army." After the fall of Dazhongji, hundreds of people and public officials were killed or humiliated, and no less than several thousand were displaced without food or clothing. The Communist troops either gathered or dispersed, and as of today, have not moved an inch away from Dazhongji. How could it have been returned to the control of the National Army? The displaced refugees have nowhere to go. We only hope for the National Army to thoroughly suppress the bandits. I submit this situation with sincerity and ask that it be published in the corrections column. I offer my most fervent prayers. Represented by Zhu Yao, representative of over 1,570 displaced refugees in the Ninth District of Dongtai County. May 22nd.

(Editor's Note: At the same time as this letter, we also received a letter from Wu Zhicheng, the mayor of Dazhongji, with content similar to the above letter, so it is omitted).

### Yu Hongjun's Financial Report (Continued from the Previous Day)

(4) Stabilizing Finance

Stabilizing finance is the most important measure at present. Based on the implementation over the past year, the following can be reported:

(1) Managing Foreign Exchange: During the recovery period, in order to encourage the import of goods and stabilize economic life, the foreign exchange market was opened in March 1946, and the Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange were implemented, setting the exchange rate for the US dollar at 2020. Since then, various essential goods that had been lacking domestically have been adequately replenished, but due to the low exchange rate, the import of other non-essential goods has also been encouraged, and some foreign goods have competed with domestic products. On the other hand, exports and remittances from overseas Chinese have shrunk due to the unfavorable exchange rate. Therefore, on August 19th of the same year, the exchange rate for the US dollar was adjusted to 3350 in an attempt to improve the situation. However, after several months, because the domestic economic situation had not stabilized and export trade still needed to be further promoted, when the government announced the Emergency Economic Measures Program in February of the following year, the exchange rate for the US dollar was changed to 12,000 in order to restore the normal state of the economy and rescue the domestic industry and commerce. All these measures were suitable adjustments to adapt to the environment at the time, in comparison to the domestic and foreign purchasing power of currency.

(2) Using Gold: After the victory, the effects of using gold can be described as follows: 1. From March of last year to February of this year, in the one year period, the amount of legal tender returned to circulation due to the Central Bank selling gold was approximately 1 trillion yuan; 2. Whenever prices were about to fluctuate, the Central Bank would release a large amount of gold to absorb the rising prices of legal tender and commodities, thereby alleviating the situation. Overall, in the one year period, because purchasing power was transferred to gold, the phenomenon of hoarding and speculation was relatively reduced; 3. Last year, the black market exchange rate fluctuated with commodity prices, which greatly affected the credit of the currency. Fortunately, the price of gold rarely changed. Because of this, the black market exchange rate did not fluctuate violently. However, while gold policy can be effective for a time, it is not a fundamental solution. To stabilize the economy, especially since the end of last year, speculative capital from all over the country has flocked to Shanghai, and gold has become the target of speculation. If the Central Bank does not sell a large amount of gold, the price of gold will rise daily, stimulating commodity prices. If it intends to fight speculators with all its strength, the sacrifice will be great, and it will only increase the profits of those who seek profit. Therefore, the government's use of gold policy had to change direction. After the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures Program, the buying and selling of gold was prohibited, and black market transactions were strictly prohibited, in order to isolate the price of gold from commodity prices and reduce the factors of commodity price fluctuations. It seems that these are all measures that are suitable for the times.

(3) Controlling Interest Rates: The Ministry has always handled interest rate policies in accordance with the following principles: 1. The National Bank will provide low-interest loans to finance agricultural, industrial, and mining production, but strictly verify their use to prevent fraudulent arbitrage; 2. The general deposit and loan interest rates of banks will be negotiated by the local banking associations, taking into account the actual market situation, and reported to the local Central Bank for approval and announcement. Although times have changed, the above principles still seem applicable today. However, in a state where commodity prices and interest rates are mutually cause and effect, it is impossible to expect any one-sided method to be effective in either suppressing commodity prices or suppressing interest rates. Moreover, controlling bank interest rates is one thing, and controlling high-interest loans in general society is another. Banks are legal organizations, making them easier to control, while lending in general society has no fixed form or method, making management extremely difficult. However, if the latter is ignored and only banks are the object of control, the result will be twofold: 1. Forcing speculative capital to leave legitimate financial institutions and flock to the black market; 2. Forcing banks to secretly collect deposits at high interest rates, operate illegally, and create false accounts. Therefore, over the past year, in order to cooperate fully and achieve practical results, effective measures have been taken on both the passive and active sides. On the passive side, there are measures such as approving interest rate methods, strictly cracking down on illegal financial institutions, and investigating and prohibiting speculative trading. On the active side, there are measures such as guiding speculative capital to flow into legitimate financial institutions, reasonably supplying funds to legitimate industry and commerce, and expanding treasury bond sales, with the aim of relieving agricultural and industrial production from the oppression of high interest rates.

Editorial

### Striving for the Direction of Peace

The National Political Council passed the temporary emergency motion proposed by Councilors Xiao Yishan and 99 others on the 26th, requesting the Council to quickly hold a plenary review meeting to discuss peace proposals and requesting the Congress to telegraph Communist Councilors in Beijing to attend the meeting and discuss national affairs together to resolve the national crisis. This telegram inviting the Communists to resume peace talks has been sent by the Secretariat of the National Political Council, and the Council will begin reviewing the peace proposals proposed by the Councilors starting today. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, there are as many as eighteen peace proposals to be submitted to the plenary review committee for discussion. Not only is it clear evidence that "peace is the unanimous desire of the people," but the enthusiasm of the Councilors in calling for peace can also be seen. The main task of this National Political Council is to appeal to both the government and the Communists for peace and to jointly agree on a practical and effective peace proposal so that peace talks can resume immediately to break the current political deadlock. Therefore, the whole country has great expectations for the convening of this National Political Council; we sincerely hope that this National Political Council can truly bring peace to the people.

In the current environment, although the people want peace and stability, and even long for peace as much as a severe drought longs for rain clouds, the possibility of resuming peace talks still seems very slim. As far as the government is concerned, in order to relieve the suffering of the people and save the national crisis, it naturally hopes that the country can immediately turn hostility into friendship. Perhaps its desire for peaceful reunification is more urgent than anyone else, as Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng said: "The National Political Council is a civil institution, and it is natural for the Councilors to propose peace requests. The government also sincerely hopes for peace." Therefore, whether peace talks can resume depends entirely on the Communists' thoughts, and the key to whether domestic peace can be realized rests entirely in the hands of the Communists. As for the Communists' attitude? They have ignored the notice of the meeting of the National Political Council, and have not made any indication regarding the appeals of the people of the country. Now that the National Political Council has once again invited Communist Councilors to Beijing to discuss national affairs together, the Shanghai Municipal Council also telegraphed Mao Zedong yesterday, sincerely advising him, but it is not certain whether the Communists can "accept it gladly." The people of the country are now shouting the lament of "unable to live," asking the Communists to have mercy and leave them a ray of hope. How can this wish be realized? The Councilors probably do not have much confidence in this, and the hundred Councilors who proposed the temporary emergency motion also know it very well. In their temporary emergency motion, they also frankly stated: "Although judging from past facts, the future is not optimistic, but knowing that it is impossible to do it, we should do it, and this should be the final direction of the Council's efforts."

The difficulty in achieving domestic peace is as described above, but we still have to continue to work hard in the spirit of "knowing that it is impossible to do it." Because although the current domestic situation is extremely complex, it is also very simple from another perspective. Similarly, although achieving domestic peace is very difficult, it can also be said that it is not difficult. Our nation has always emphasized sincerity, with the so-called "sincerity can move metal and stone." As long as we have the spirit of perseverance, man can conquer nature, and nothing cannot be accomplished. Moreover, our country's politics has always valued the way of benevolence, and those who advocate taking the way of force often fail in politics. If the Communists are obsessed with their own views, blindly insist on being obscured by the prejudices of one party and one person, and cannot prioritize the country and the nation, they will not only lose the essence of being a political party, but will also inevitably be abandoned by their relatives and unable to exist. Therefore, the Communists cannot completely ignore public opinion, whether they are willing to do so in their hearts. As long as the people of the country stand up and speak at this critical moment, express the suffering of their own lives, and at the same time solemnly express their desire for peace and stability, the overall situation may not be irreversible. All institutions representing public opinion, such as the councils of provinces, cities, and counties, should also convene emergency meetings at this time to discuss solutions to achieve domestic peace, represent the people, unanimously demand peace from the Communists, immediately lay down their arms, and reopen peace talks with the government. The Shanghai Municipal Council has already issued a telegram calling for this, and it is hoped that the councils of all provinces, cities, and counties will rise up in response. Finally, they can all convene meetings in the shortest possible time and express their views on peace and stability. At the same time, they will elect representatives, gather in the capital, and join the representatives of the National Political Council to demand peace from the Communists, so that the Communists can understand the direction of public opinion in the country today and have to respect it.

In short, it is time for the people of the country to unite and demand peace from the Communists! We still have a ray of hope for the Communists, believing that the Communist figures, as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will not isolate themselves from their compatriots and be regarded as non-human beings. Now is the last opportunity for the Communists to reflect. Time does not wait for us, and it passes quickly. Where to go and what to do, the Communists should make the final choice. We sincerely hope that the National Political Council and the provincial and municipal councils' appeal for peace movement will be successful!

### How to Improve Control Measures

The newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Chen Qitian, also expressed his intention to improve control measures in his inaugural speech. Although his purpose and methods have not been specifically explained, there is no doubt that its improvement is a matter of public concern, judging from the current control situation.

Strictly speaking, there are currently no systematic control measures; the control measures that we see, apart from foreign exchange, imports, gold, and foreign currency trading, are relatively thorough, while the others are scattered and fragmented, as if they are not very serious. There is neither a comprehensive solution that combines theory and practice, nor a consistent policy. Sometimes it is a storm, and the measures are very strict; sometimes it is intentional or unintentional, ignoring and not asking, as if nothing happened. Here are a few examples, classified as follows, to see a glimpse of the current controls:

(1) Regarding production, in addition to the original state-owned enterprises, such as yarn, cloth, silk, oil, and other industries, a part of the supply is operated by the state; at the same time, the free development of private enterprises is still allowed. On the surface, they are advancing side by side in a posture of free competition, and there is no sign of any control.

(2) Regarding transportation and sales, such as soybeans in the Northeast, sugar in Taiwan, and fuel management, they all have the nature of monopoly or semi-monopoly. However, the scope of control is often limited to the area within its control; it cannot be popularized to the whole area. In other words: wherever it cannot or does not want to control, it is inevitable that it will give up control. For example, sugar in Taiwan is limited to sales to Shanghai, and coal is limited to what can be purchased; whether it is enough to meet the needs beyond the limits, and how to find ways to adjust if the needs are not met, are all ignored, so the word control really seems to be somewhat unworthy of its name.

(3) Regarding distribution, many enemy and puppet materials are directly or entrusted to other agencies to be auctioned or distributed by the government, such as yarn, cloth, medicine, and artificial silk. In addition, daily necessities for people's livelihood should be quantitatively distributed by various material supply agencies according to law, which of course also belongs to the scope of control. The disadvantage is that it is distributed when there is stock, and it is ignored when there is no stock. As a result, the black market is rampant, often controlling the official price; the function of control is completely lost.

(4) Regarding finance, since the establishment of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, the government's control over financial business has been gradually strengthened. The Emergency Economic Measures Program has a chapter on strengthening the control of financial business, which imposes very strict restrictions on the deposit and loan interest of financial institutions of officials and businessmen. The crackdown on newly established institutions is particularly strict, but underground money houses are everywhere, almost becoming an open secret. Although state banks have a variety of loans for production, export, and other purposes, it seems that they have made their best efforts; however, industry and commerce still have to seek financing in the black market, so that the market black interest rate often hovers around 20%. Some banks and money houses, without the entrustment of the government, arbitrarily engage in the purchase and sale of goods, and even engage in speculative trading; these also exist in many places. As for the escape of funds, the flooding of overseas remittances, and the mischief of official capital, they are especially blatant and have no scruples. It can be seen that the control of financial business has not had much practical effect.

(5) Regarding commodity prices, the means adopted in this regard are price limits, price negotiations, distribution, subsidies, and strict prohibition of price increases, manipulation, hoarding, and speculation. The relevant agencies in various places have tried every means to carry out these policies without being able to implement them fully; however, the rising wind is becoming more intense, the black market is becoming more rampant, and almost all price stabilization methods have become mere formalities. The so-called commodity price control has long been at the end of its strength.

Originally, the economy is based on circulation as a principle, and all man-made restrictions are difficult to be effective. Countries such as Britain and the United States, whose laws are said to be strict and whose handling is particularly serious, still find it difficult to eliminate the black market. Moreover, our country's control, in the horizontal direction, is mostly limited to one area; it is not possible to do everything at the same time, and in the vertical direction, it is inevitably influenced by various relationships to take convenient and temporary measures, and it is not possible to completely plan from beginning to end. In terms of the technical aspects of implementing restrictions, it is also inevitable that they are too subjective, unwilling to put themselves in the position of those with vested interests, and leave a step back for them, so that the general good merchants are forced to obey the law, and sincere cooperation is not possible. Under these circumstances, even if there are honest and upright cadres who follow the rules and short-sightedly and earnestly promote it, they may not be able to fully achieve the expected results. The competent authorities, and also knowing that it is a very complicated and laborious work, and also only make small calculations, or mix in other side effects, hoping to completely achieve the effectiveness of this control with the official language of this order, then the number of successes and failures need not be seen after the fact. If Minister Chen of Economic Affairs really wants to improve control measures, the above-mentioned facts should not be ignored.

### Attlee Delivers Speech Defending Bevin's Foreign Policy; Britain Considers Changing Policy Towards Europe

[Our Dispatch] London, Broadcast on the 27th: British Prime Minister Attlee delivered an important speech at the Labour Party Congress today, denouncing all the slanderous attacks by opponents. It is said: "Bevin's foreign policy is neither following the United States nor anti-Soviet. Democratic socialism is the path to peace, prosperity, freedom, and happiness. Britain is now showing this to the world. Britain will never be inferior to others, and what it seeks is cooperation with all countries. We express our great confidence in Bevin and his work."

[Agence France-Presse, Margate, England, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech at the Labour Party Congress this morning, supporting Foreign Secretary Bevin's policies and refuting "the accusation by those who rely on a certain foreign country that we rely on a certain foreign country." Attlee expressed confidence in the work of the entire government. In terms of foreign policy, he emphasized the importance of economic negotiations, referring to Britain's economic agreements with Poland and Hungary. Attlee accused the Conservative opposition of lacking any general plan to compete with the Labour Party. At the same time, the Congress elected members of the Executive Committee this morning, and they are the same as those elected in the previous session, including Health Minister Bevan, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, and Lord President of the Council Morrison.

[United Press, London, 26th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain is now considering changing its policy towards Western Europe in order to improve relations with the governments of countries controlled by the Communist Party. For example, based on this new policy, Britain has recently recognized the governments of Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania, and is trying to improve relations with Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. At the same time, Britain will also assume its new mission in Eastern Europe to enhance the status of social democratic parties in those countries. The signs of Britain's policy change can be seen from the following points: (1) The government has decided to send the former leader of the Labour Party, Noel-Baker, to lead a goodwill delegation to visit Yugoslavia; (2) The government has also decided to send Labour Party Secretary-General Philipp to Romania in June to contact the country's social democratic party; (3) The government has invited Bulgaria to send a diplomatic delegation to Britain; (4) Britain has agreed in principle to conclude a commercial treaty with Poland and has decided to renew the British-Polish economic agreement. In addition, the decision of Britain and the Soviet Union to conduct commercial negotiations is even more significant. On the diplomatic front, Britain has also proposed to amend the Anglo-Soviet Twenty-Year Military Alliance Treaty. According to Foreign Office officials, the new draft treaty proposes to extend the alliance to fifty years. Based on past experience, if Britain and the Soviet Union improve relations, it will naturally promote friendship with Eastern European countries.

### British Labour Party Congress Approves Conscription Act in Peacetime; Shows Anti-Bevin Forces Weakened

[Reuters, Margate, 26th] The British Labour Party Congress today approved the government's conscription policy by a vote of four to one. The debate on conscription was quite heated, as pre-war pacifism still holds potential power within the Labour Party. A motion was put forward opposing the loss of freedom for party members under the Conscription Act, specifically pointing out that those conscripted under the Act's final period would not be free from military responsibility until 1961, a full sixteen years after the end of the war.  Woolley also supported the motion, stating that Britain had formed a military alliance with the United States and that the implementation of the Conscription Act was the result of Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to the United States. Labour MP Davies spoke even more vehemently, protesting against the government's militarization of the country in peacetime, and pointing out that the Labour Party had not indicated this action to voters during the election campaign.  Professor Lass, the outgoing chairman of the Labour Party, responded on behalf of the Executive Committee, stating that the government must have the power to defend Britain, and that if conscription were not implemented, only the old-fashioned recruitment system could be used, or special rights given to the army to make it a special class to attract recruits. As a result, the motion opposing the Conscription Act was defeated by 2,332,000 votes to 571,000 votes.

[Associated Press, Margate, 26th] The Labour Party today voted in favor of the Conscription Act in peacetime to support British foreign policy and curb communism. This indicates that the anti-Bevin forces within the party have clearly weakened, and the "rebels" who believe that the policy excessively follows the United States and is hostile to the Soviet Union have now been overwhelmed. The Labour Party Congress also included two proposals on the agenda to condemn Britain's policy toward Greece and reject the Truman Doctrine's aid to Greece and Turkey, which will be discussed and then voted on. Multiple proposals fiercely criticizing British policy toward Palestine were removed from the agenda and replaced with a single comprehensive proposal reaffirming the Labour Party's view that the Jews should have a "nation" and occupy a majority of the population in the Holy Land.

### Gandhi Again Demands Britain Withdraw from India

[Reuters, New Delhi, 26th] Today was Gandhi's day of silence. At the prayer meeting, Gandhi did not speak personally, but had someone read his speech, demanding that Britain liberate India's villages and withdraw from India according to the British Cabinet Mission plan of May 16, 1946. The speech also stated: As long as British power remains in India, India cannot manage its own affairs. Britain's task is not to change India, but to withdraw before the promised deadline. I and Jinnah have already issued a joint declaration calling for not using violence to achieve political goals. If the whole country ignores this document and continues to use violence, bloodshed will inevitably occur after Britain withdraws, and the whole world will certainly condemn India.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 26th] Gandhi lost his most treasured watch, which he had carried with him for 25 years, on the way from Patna to Delhi. Nehru visited Gandhi today.

New Cabinet Tries to Avoid Communist Party

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 27th Broadcast: Italy's premier-designate today obtained the approval of most of his Christian Democratic Party members to try to form a government without the participation of the Communist Party and left-wing figures.

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 27th Broadcast: Gasperi began organizing a new Italian cabinet, excluding the Italian Communist Party. Gasperi said that the current political crisis will choose one of two methods: (1) organize a Christian Democratic Party cabinet and absorb some nominally independent experts; (2) form a cabinet composed of the Christian Democratic Party and a few left-wing parties. Gasperi said that he could not achieve his goal of a national unity government.

[Reuters, Rome, 26th] The Italian government crisis still has no hope of resolution. The opposition between Christian Democratic Party leader Gasperi and Socialist Party leader Nenni seems to be the main problem. Gasperi's proposal to expand his former coalition cabinet encountered strong opposition from Nenni, because expansion would put Nenni's left-wing orthodox Socialists on an equal footing with Saragat's breakaway Socialist Party. Nenni spoke in Venice over the weekend, accusing Gasperi of being a tool of the reactionaries and should be fully responsible for this crisis. The discord between Nenni and Gasperi has greatly hindered the work of forming a new government, so it is still difficult to predict whether Gasperi will be able to achieve his wish to expand his original coalition cabinet to accommodate the left and right wings of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party from the middle-of-the-road party.

### Large Batch of Nazi Henchmen Executed in Mass Hangings

[United Press, Rendsburg, 27th] Twenty-two Nazis who massacred humans at the Neuengamme concentration camp were hanged in Rendsburg Prison today, with each execution taking seven minutes. Another twenty-seven concentration camp officials and guards are scheduled to be hanged tomorrow. This is the largest mass execution of war criminals by the Allied forces to date.

### Authorities in the British and American Occupation Zones of Germany Agree on a New Economic Recovery Plan; Establishing an Economic Committee and Giving Germans Broad Powers

[Reuters, London, 26th] Reliable sources: The talks held in Berlin by General Robertson, commander of the British military district in Germany, and General Clay, commander of the American military district, will be officially announced tomorrow. The communiqué is expected to include the charter for the economic recovery of the two districts. The agreement established by the British and Americans to implement last year's economic merger agreement between the two districts includes the following three points: (1) Establishing a German Economic Committee for the two districts. Reliable sources say that the organization of this committee and its relationship with the state governments have been agreed upon by the British and Americans. This committee will be the most powerful German political organization in western Germany to date. (2) The German industrial level agreed upon by the four powers on March 4, 1946 has been revised. The British and Americans have now decided to allow Germany to produce 10 million to 12 million tons of steel annually, which is the amount proposed by Foreign Secretary Bevin at the recent Moscow Conference. The original four-power agreement stipulated that Germany could have the capacity to produce 7 million tons of steel annually, with actual production limited to 5.8 million tons annually. Within this number, the production level in the British military district is only about 4 million tons, and the actual production is still far lower than the maximum level stipulated by the four powers. Reliable sources say that the aforementioned 10 million to 12 million tons is the actual annual steel production of the British and American districts. In addition, a definitive list has been drawn up of factories in the two districts that can be dismantled for reparations. Similar increases have also been decided for the production of other industries besides the steel industry. This step is tantamount to the beginning of the economic recovery of western Germany. (3) Stipulating that resources in the occupied areas are allowed to be used in a freer manner to import industrial raw materials. It is said that the Robertson-Clay agreement only needs to make some minor final decisions in tomorrow's final talks to be completed. London diplomatic circles generally believe that this agreement shows that the British and American authorities have done their best to prevent the German economic situation from continuing to deteriorate in the transitional period before the establishment of the final four-power agreement.

### Pakenham Returns to England to Submit a Report to Bevin

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] Lord Pakenham, Minister for British Occupation Zone Affairs in Germany, returned to London by special plane from Germany tonight with his secretary Jones. After getting off the plane, he refused to issue a statement about his mission in Germany. It is expected that he will go to Margate to meet with Foreign Secretary Bevin to report on his inspection of Germany.

### The United States Decides to Join the International Refugee Organization; House Foreign Affairs Committee Approves

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today unanimously passed a bill approving the US government's participation in the International Refugee Organization. The bill differs from the bill passed by the Senate in two respects. The Senate approved $75 million as the United States' contribution to the International Refugee Organization for the 1948 fiscal year. The House reduced it to $73 million. The committee also stipulated a provision that part of the fund could continue to be used for the American Relief and Refugee Assistance program until the International Refugee Organization began to perform its duties.

### Hoover Responds to Taber; Advocates Making Peace with Germany and Japan Soon

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] Regarding the War Department's proposal to allocate $725 million in the next fiscal year to purchase food to assist Germany, Japan, and Korea, Chairman Taber of the House Appropriations Committee sought the opinion of Hoover, Chairman of the Food Emergency Council. It is now known that Hoover has replied to Taber, advocating that the United States should sign peace treaties with Germany and Japan as soon as possible. The letter also condemned the Soviet Union for obstructing the world's economic recovery and stated that if the next four-power foreign ministers' conference still fails, Britain and the United States can sign peace treaties with Germany in their occupied areas.

### The Soviet Union Orders the Abolition of the Death Penalty; It is Not Stated Whether it Applies to the Soviet Occupation Zone

[United Press, London, 26th] The Soviet Union tonight promulgated a decree abolishing the death penalty, making it the first country in the world to ban capital punishment after the war. According to an official report published by Moscow Radio, although there are still aggressors attempting to provoke wars, the Soviet Union believes that the world has obtained a guarantee of lasting peace, so it has taken this extraordinary action, which is also the result of the Soviet people's loyalty and patriotism. From today, cases sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union will be changed to a maximum term of 25 years in prison. The authorities did not state how many death penalty cases there were, and whether this decree applies to the Soviet occupation zones such as Germany and Austria. The Soviet Union has also never announced the death penalty cases that have already been sentenced in the occupied areas and the number of traitors who have been executed during and after the war.

### President Truman Submits to Congress the American Military Cooperation Act; Aimed at Consolidating Peace in the Western Hemisphere

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Truman today asked Congress to enact legislation for full military cooperation with Latin American countries, including the sale of arms, standardization of weapons, and training of naval and air force personnel. The President's message, read in both the House and Senate, pointed out that "this military cooperation can also be extended to Canada, whose cooperation with the United States on common defense is currently of particular importance." This is the first time that the President has mentioned Canada in the Western Hemisphere defense plan. Canada is neither a member of the Pan American Union nor a signatory of the Chapultepec Treaty, so Canada has not participated in previous discussions on Western Hemisphere defense.

The President's message also said: "The American Republics, in the Chapultepec Treaty and the United Nations Charter, have accepted new responsibilities for mutual defense and the maintenance of peace. The cooperation stipulated in the Chapultepec Treaty makes it necessary for the American Republics to standardize military training and equipment to the greatest extent, based on the recommendations of the American Defense Bureau. Any action stipulated in this case should be in accordance with the articles and spirit of the United Nations Charter. The United States has advanced technical knowledge and economic and military resources, so this responsibility should be borne by the United States. The supply of weapons and military equipment to other American countries has reasonable and limited purposes. The US government will never endorse or participate in the unrestricted distribution of armaments to prevent unnecessary arms competition. The US government should make military development for the purpose of maintaining peace and security, and make the equipment of the army, navy, and air force not exceed the scope of security needs."

Convening a South American Conference to Draft a Defense Pact

The bill proposed by the President will empower the President to conclude the following agreements with other American countries: (1) to train the army, navy, and air force personnel of these countries; (2) to maintain and repair the army, navy, and air force equipment owned by these countries; (3) to transfer weapons, ammunition, and war equipment to these countries under conditions consistent with the needs and national interests of the United States. The President also said: This plan will be included in the US policy of encouraging Latin American economic development. The improvement of living standards and the promotion of social and cultural welfare are prerequisites for international peace and security. In the implementation of this case, other countries should not be hindered from their economic development due to the increase in military burdens. At the same time, it will also prevent any family from using these weapons to oppose the peaceful and democratic principles upheld by the United States and other American countries. Countries that obtain US weapons must not transfer them to third parties. The President also revealed that he would convene a Latin American conference in Rio de Janeiro to draft a Western Hemisphere defense pact.

Strongly Urge the Government to Abandon Imperialist Policies

Another resolution on colonial policy urged the government to abandon its past imperialism and develop the welfare of the colonies to compensate for past mistakes. The case has been accepted by the Executive Committee, and the content requires: (1) Colonial governors should be responsible civil administrators; (2) Indigenous people should be allowed to participate in higher administrative and technical positions; (3) Experts and administrators should be appointed by people who sympathize with the local residents; (4) People of color should be treated equally with white people and given equal opportunities. To achieve this goal, the general educational level should be improved; (5) The development of morning industries should prioritize promoting the employment of indigenous people and improving their living standards. Indigenous people should have full freedom to organize trade unions; (6) The socialist policies of the Colonial Department should be explained in detail to all relevant officials so that they can be implemented quickly.

### Reactions from Both Houses

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Congress did not immediately respond to Truman's call for military cooperation with Western Hemisphere countries. Both the House and Senate seem to feel that his request can wait for some time, but both houses' leaders believe that this plan can be considered in due course.

### Wallace's Speech

[Agence France-Presse, Portland, Oregon, 27th] Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace is now traveling around the United States to promote the peace movement. He delivered a speech here, predicting that the current one-party government in the United States will continue to devote itself to making Europe an anti-Soviet armed camp, which may force Britain, France, Scandinavia, and other European countries to enter the Soviet Union's labor scope.

### Before Massive US Aid to Europe, Economic Cooperation in Europe Should Be Intermediated First; US Plans to Convene a Special International Conference

[United Press, Washington, 26th] When it was raised in the Senate to convene a special congressional meeting this fall to discuss the US far-reaching aid plan being drafted by the State Department's Policy Committee, another request surged in the Senate, arguing that the United States must promote economic cooperation among European countries before spending another tens of billions of dollars to assist European recovery. Democratic Senator Fulbright and Republican Senator Lodge, who are known as "internationalists," have recently agreed with people in Congress who advocate the establishment of a European Commercial Union. Fulbright, who had vigorously supported the US aid to Europe, said in a recent speech: Unless proper steps are taken to enable European countries to be economically independent through economic cooperation, he may no longer support new aid plans worth billions of dollars. He also said: "Without this development, we will be in a state of bailing water with a sieve." Democratic leaders are now inquiring about opinions on convening a special congressional meeting this fall. They believe that a new aid plan with a vast scope will inevitably cause more protracted disputes. The debate on the aid to Greece and Turkey bill has been delayed by five weeks compared to the scheduled date (end of March), and the debate on the new aid plan will be much longer than that.

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] According to Associated Press statistics, the United States has spent approximately $26,684,831,000 on relief and reconstruction of the post-war world from the end of World War II to the end of this year, which is less than 8% of the $1,500 billion spent by the United States on warfare and winning the war.

### The Liberals Firmly Refuse to Participate in the Government; Japan is Preparing to Form a Three-Party Cabinet; The Opposition Between Conservatives and Innovators is Becoming Overt

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Regarding Katayama's plan to form a four-party coalition cabinet, due to the strong attitude of the Liberal Party, he has to proceed towards the formation of a coalition cabinet by the Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties. The Socialist Party held an important meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 7:15 pm on the 27th, attended by important cadres such as Katayama, Nishio, Mizutani, and Hirano. As a result, an agreement was reached on the direction of organizing a new cabinet, but the content has not been publicly announced. It is reported that the work of organizing the cabinet will focus on the Democratic Party, especially on winning over the Ashida faction. So far, the opposition between conservatives and innovators has become overt, and the impact on the future of Japanese politics cannot be ignored.

[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] Japan's new Prime Minister Katayama told reporters on the 27th that Japan needs a coalition cabinet. If other political parties continue not to cooperate, he will immediately organize a cabinet without opposition parties. Katayama's remarks shattered the hopes of some members of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, who hoped that Prime Minister Katayama would resign after failing to organize a four-party coalition cabinet. Katayama also said that he believed that he had the power to organize a one-party cabinet, but hoped that other political parties would not force him to take this step.

The Democratic Party May Split Internally

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] The tripartite summit meeting at 3:00 pm on the 27th was aborted again due to Yoshida's sudden return to Oiso's hometown. The Liberal Party's determination to retreat to the opposition party seems quite firm. Under this new situation, the Democratic Party's movements are worth noting. At 11:00 am today, the party held a cadre meeting.

### The German Politburo Under Soviet Control

— Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department

The Soviet Union is establishing a political organization in Berlin, directly connected to the Kremlin, to manage the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany in place of the Red Army. All organizational steps are currently underway, and once formally established, the current military occupation will be replaced by purely civil administration. The purpose of establishing this institution is to ensure the dominance of the German Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone.

Soviet authorities, fearing that they cannot universally win popular support in Germany, are making every effort to ensure that the local Communist Party gains an advantage before taking over German administration.

The organization of this institution is roughly as follows: The central organization of the new German governing body is a politburo modeled after the Moscow organization. Lieutenant General Makarov will be directly dispatched by the Kremlin as a representative to the German Politburo. Mr. Makarov will be the technical assistant to Marshal Sokolovsky, the military commander of the Soviet-occupied zone, responsible for handling all political and economic issues.

The nominal head of the German Politburo is Nadolski, who is not well-known abroad and is in contact with the Secretariat of the Soviet Communist Party.

The Politburo has the following missions: (1) To restore credibility among the German people as soon as possible; (2) To encourage the activities of opposition parties to demonstrate freedom within the Soviet-occupied zone; (3) To improve relations with the United Nations. To strengthen the Communist Party's power, a large number of German leaders have been transferred. Communist veterans Ulbricht and Pieck are plotting behind the scenes, and Pieck's agent, Grotewohl, is preparing to use various tricks to win over German opposition figures.

The origin of the German Politburo lies in the visit to Germany by Beria, a senior Kremlin official. He went to Potsdam for surgery, but during his three-week stay in Germany, he met with Soviet and German leaders in the Soviet-occupied zone. Beria laid the foundation for preparations for the withdrawal of the Allied occupation forces and the eventual transfer of administrative power to the Germans.

The establishment of a new political organization in the Soviet-occupied zone is related to the large-scale withdrawal of Soviet troops in recent months. The number of Soviet troops stationed in Germany has now been reduced to approximately 200,000. Although the Soviet Union's military strength in Germany has thus been weakened, the Soviet Union is striving to strengthen its control through political means.

The Soviet strategy in Germany is a combination of political maneuvering and propaganda.

A political truce between the Christian Democratic Union and the Soviet-backed Socialist Unity Party seems to be an important goal of the Soviet ruling authorities. If these two opposing parties can cooperate in a friendly manner, the Soviet Union can promote Soviet-style democracy. The Soviet Union's real control is behind the scenes, through the Minister of the Interior of the Soviet-occupied zone.

The political strategy in the Soviet-occupied zone is consistent with the current policies promoted by the Soviet Union in Hungary and the Balkans, namely, to strengthen the political control of the local Communist Party before the withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces.

In order to express goodwill towards the German people, the Soviet Union has allowed an increase in food rations and the supply of clothing, shoes, and other consumer goods.

According to recent reports from journalists who have traveled in the Soviet-occupied zone for several days, the lives of Germans in the Soviet-occupied zone seem to be more comfortable than those of Germans in the western occupation zones. However, for political reasons, anti-Soviet sentiment is extremely high. Germans living in the Soviet-occupied zone resent the strict Soviet politics and express envy for the free lives of Germans in other occupation zones.

The question is how the Soviet Union will fulfill its promises. On the surface, the purpose of the new Politburo is to achieve German unification, but in reality, it continues to conduct anti-Western propaganda. The paper supply to newspapers of the opposition Christian Democratic Union has been reduced by 50 percent, but other newspapers in the Soviet-occupied zone have not been reduced. The Soviet Union's real goal in Germany is simply to expand Soviet power. The Politburo may be a more friendly institution, but its mission is nothing more than to help achieve the above goals.

### Vietnam National United Front Alliance Issues Declaration Supporting the Government

[Saigon, Agence France-Presse, 27th] Viet Minh Radio today broadcast a declaration of the "Vietnam National United Front Alliance." Observers believe this is a response to accusations of reactionary elements. The declaration stated: This alliance only recognizes the Ho Chi Minh government and denies that any other party has the right to maintain relations with foreign countries. National unity is extremely important to the Viet Minh's war of resistance. So-called national unity means that Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China are ruled by a central government. If the Viet Minh wants true independence, it must become a democratic republic, establish its own national assembly, establish its own government, send its own diplomatic representatives, and have the right to handle internal affairs, finance, economy, and national defense. This alliance will cooperate with France in friendship within the framework of the French Union, based on freedom and equality, it said.

[Saigon, Agence France-Presse, 27th] Well-informed sources said today that the government of the Republic of Vietnam recently submitted several written proposals to the French government, which are currently being studied by the French side and will be answered soon. The contents have not yet been announced.

### A Famous Native Female Lawyer Will Be Invited to China

She lectured in the United States this year. She comes from a famous Turkish family, and her father was one of the leaders of Turkish nationalism in the former Ottoman Empire.

### The First Meeting of the Holy Land Investigation Committee, Trygve Lie Encourages Representatives, The Committee Has Full Power to Conduct a Thorough Investigation

[Lake Success, United Press, 26th] The United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee held its first meeting today, beginning the work of organizing the committee itself and discussing whether to go to refugee camps in Europe for an on-site investigation. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie delivered the opening address, saying: The eleven-nation committee should remember that they represent the beliefs and hopes of millions of people, and that millions of people's faith in the United Nations' ability to carry out this important task depends on the results of the committee's work. Lie pointed out that the committee has the greatest power to seek facts and investigate everything concerning the Palestine issue, the only limitation being the time issue. The committee must submit a report before September 1, so that the member states of the United Nations can study the contents of the report before the regular session of the General Assembly is held in mid-September. At the beginning of its work, the investigation committee knew that the Arab countries insisted that the scope of the investigation be limited to Palestine only. Before the establishment of the committee, the Arab countries had notified in writing that they opposed the committee going to Europe to investigate the refugee camps. There are now various indications that they will receive support from several countries, presumably led by India (also a member of the investigation committee). However, several other neutral countries, such as Sweden, Guatemala, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, have indicated that the European Jewish refugee problem should be related to the entire Palestine problem. The Zionist Organization has not expressed its attitude towards this matter. Dr. Hu Shih-tse, Assistant Secretary-General in charge of trusteeship affairs and representative of China, recently confirmed that the Zionist Organization had requested that observers be sent to accompany the investigation committee. The Zionist Organization guaranteed full cooperation and requested that its representatives be allowed to accompany the investigation committee and maintain contact with the committee.

### American Psychiatrist Invents New Inhalation Therapy That Can Cure Stuttering, Alcoholism, and Other Symptoms

[Chicago, United Press, 26th] Dr. Meduna, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois, claimed today that the department has been using inhalation therapy to treat alcoholism, stuttering, and other mental illnesses for three years, with about half of the 75 cases being cured. All symptoms such as hysteria, spastic colitis, stuttering, tension, anxiety, emotional unrest, and chronic poisoning can be treated with this method. First, the patient lies on a hammock, covers the nose with a mask, and inhales 15 to 35 times, 30% carbon dioxide and 70% oxygen. In less than an hour, the patient wakes up from a nap and can return home within five minutes. If necessary, treatment is given four times a week, as little as five weeks, as many as 30 weeks. It is not difficult to recover. This procedure seems to have a dual effect, one is to reduce the tension of the brain structure, and the other is to stimulate its relaxation, so as to restore the normal balance of function.

### First Meeting of the Senate, the Mayor Gives a Detailed Analysis of the Explosion of Famine and the Student Unrest, the Focus of the Report is on Stabilizing Social Problems

[Reported by This Newspaper] The third session of the first Shanghai Municipal Senate held its first meeting at 3 pm yesterday, with the Mayor reporting on the government's administration. Senators raised questions on civil affairs, police, society, finance, and land administration, which were answered by the respective bureau chiefs. The main points of the Mayor's report and the senators' questions at yesterday's meeting focused on stabilizing social problems, especially the rice price.

Mayor Wu's administrative report stated briefly that there was already a written report on the routine administration of the municipal government, so he made a special report on the three major current problems of food, workers' lives, and student unrest:

(1) Food problem: Since coming to Shanghai, I have been concerned about the rice price problem every day. Recently, unfortunately, there has been student unrest, which I have been dealing with all day, so I have not had time to take care of the rice crisis, but today the rice price has fallen, and I am now trying my best to suppress it. It happened that three rice crises occurred last year. At that time, the methods of banning hoarding and speculation and throwing out rice in large quantities were adopted, so the three rice crises were stabilized after throwing out less than 200,000 dan of rice in total. However, the situation this year is different. The first time occurred after the gold rush. Recently, since the beginning of April, although 200,000 dan of rice have been thrown out, and about 11,000 dan of rice are still being thrown out every day, the crisis has not subsided. The original plan to deal with it in the same way as last year has not been effective.

Lack of Food Sources

The main reason for the large amount is the lack of rice sources. The rice from the Jiangbei area could be supplied to Jiangnan in the past, but now most of the Jiangbei area is disrupted by the Communist Party, which either steals the stored rice or prevents production, so the area that used to supply rice has now become an area seeking rice. At the same time, Shanghai has always relied on areas such as Bengbu, Wuxi, and Suzhou to supply rice, but now rice shortages have also occurred in these areas, resulting in the current phenomenon. It is estimated that Shanghai needs 500,000 dan of rice every month, but only 300,000 dan can be supplied at present. At the same time, the general public is afraid that there is not enough rice and grain, and often store some in preparation, which is also a reason for increasing the quantity demand. The municipal government is now prohibiting the export of rice from the city on the one hand, and requesting the Ministry of Food to increase allocation on the other hand, which is believed to alleviate the serious situation. In addition, rice merchants are allowed to trade freely, and the method of rationing rice is based on the roster, with strict investigation, so that abuses do not occur.

Workers' Livelihood Problems

(2) Workers' livelihood problem: I am very happy and grateful for the workers' peace of mind, hard work, and diligent production. However, if we want to stabilize workers' lives, we must raise the issue of the cost of living index. I am very much in favor of raising the wages of the workers, but it must be based on the principle of "not exceeding the burden of the production industry." The municipal government has now consulted with the Social Bureau, the General Labor Union, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Industrial Association to decide on a compromise to unfreeze the cost of living index. We believe that the slogan of unconditional unfreezing is detrimental to the workers and will only lead to unemployment.

The reason why the method of compiling the cost of living index cannot be made public is to avoid disputes. The current compiled index must be reviewed by the Review Committee, which is jointly organized by the municipal government, the Senate, the Social Bureau, the Industrial Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and two representatives from the General Labor Union, and is absolutely fair. The method is to investigate the price of goods once every Wednesday. The average of the prices on the last Wednesday of the month and the other three Wednesdays is the cost of living index. After compiling it on Thursday, it will be passed by the Review Committee on Friday and published at the end of the month.

There are Two Points in the Student Unrest

(3) Student unrest problem: We are very protective of young people. I believe that 90% of young people are excellent, but the fact is that some students violate the law and are manipulated and used by others. According to my personal experience, I have found two points, and I dare to determine that there is a background: (1) In a very short period of time, many different events occurred and became related events. (2) The various phenomena seen in the student unrest seem to have the same technique. The government's method is (1) to require stability, and (2) to protect young people (that is, stability first, schooling first). We have to deal with young people who violate the law according to the law. If the school resumes classes, I hope that parents will persuade their children. I am very grateful for the two cases resolved by the Senate.

### Many Questions Raised on the Food Price Problem, Why Has the Amount of Rice, Wheat, and Foreign Exchange Decreased, How Much Benefit Will Rice Rationing Actually Bring, Wu Kaixian Answers Each Item

[Reported by This Newspaper] The rice price problem is of most concern to the senators. More than a dozen senators raised questions and suggestions to the municipal government:

Shi Zongde raised the issue that the government's approval of the amount of rice and wheat in the second phase of the track entry quota was 13 million US dollars less than in the first phase (the first phase was 20 million US dollars). This is also a major reason for the rise in rice prices, so the government is required to (1) immediately relax foreign exchange, (2) find ways to purchase rice in Sichuan Province, and (3) open warehouses to thoroughly check the inventory.

Zhao Yangxiong raised the following: (1) How many people have actually benefited from the municipal government's implementation of the rice rationing method? (2) The rice rationing method was announced ten days ago, but it has not yet been implemented. When will it be implemented? If the investigation work is insufficient, can more personnel be added to complete it as soon as possible? (3) Rice rationing must be fair and reasonable. Why are other government organizations and institutions not given rice rationing in addition to ordinary public education personnel?

Yao Baozhen raised the following: (1) How to solve the rice problem for ordinary citizens other than public education personnel and citizens? (2) Does the mayor think it is feasible to purchase foreign rice? (3) It is reported that foreign rice and Sichuan rice have arrived. Can the mayor negotiate with the relevant authorities to allocate it to the city as soon as possible? (4) Please pay attention to the technical problems of rice rationing.

Incoming Rice and Grain Cannot Be Fully Distributed

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, then answered each item of the above questions as follows: (1) The purchase of Sichuan rice should be uniformly handled by the Ministry of Food according to the central government's regulations. (2) The rice from other places or overseas is for national use and is distributed by the Ministry of Food. Shanghai is only a place of import, so it cannot request that all of it be allocated to the city. It can only make suggestions and requests to the Ministry of Food to increase the allocation or allocate it first. (3) Although Jiangzhe area, Sichuan, and Hunan have had a good harvest, the amount of assistance needed in other places disrupted by the Communist Party is still very large. (4) We will definitely deal with the rice weevil problem. As long as the investigation is true, we will deal with it strictly and with determination. (5) Whether the establishment of the Food Adjustment Committee will definitely lead to a price drop cannot be guaranteed, but we will do our best to do it, not only not to let it rise, but also to make it fall.

Granting Rice by Headcount Cannot Be Adopted

(6) Occupational workers are not excluded from rice rationing, but there are some restrictions. For example, rickshaw drivers who do not have a fixed employer should be given rice rationing. Those who have an employer but do not provide meals should also be given rice rationing. Only those who have an employer and provide meals will not be given rice rationing. (7) Granting rice by headcount is the most perfect method, but the reason why it is not adopted is that the amount of rice is limited and cannot be distributed equally. At present, we can only rely on our strength to give priority to those who need relief the most, and then gradually expand it. We hope that in the future, everyone in Shanghai will be able to receive one dou of rice per month, but at present, everyone can only receive three sheng per month.

Director Wu also answered Fang Rusheng's question, "The Factory Inspection Law has been promulgated for ten years, why has it not been implemented?" He replied that this inspection law is handled by the Public Works Bureau. If the Social Bureau needs to handle it, the Ministry of Social Affairs can be asked to discuss with the municipal government to set up a Mining Industry Inspection Committee.

### "Burn, Strike, Beat, Chaos, Delay, Blame, Push, Forget", Recover the Racecourse, Prevent Mass Demonstrations, The Mayor Answers One by One

[Reported by This Newspaper] Other questions in yesterday's meeting included Zhang Zhongyuan asking: What is the progress of recovering the racecourse? Tao Baichuan suggested: (1) Before the racecourse is recovered, first negotiate to open it for citizens to rest. (2) I heard that there will be a general strike and demonstration in the city on June 2. How will the mayor prevent it? I would like to hear about it. He also suggested that the Senate send representatives to establish a committee to act as a liaison and enter various schools to do guidance work to assist the mayor in solving the major problems. Chen Gaoyong described the current situation as: "Burn, strike, beat, chaos," and the municipal government's handling of affairs as "delay, blame, push, forget." Wang Weiwen said: There is no fixed location for paying various taxes to the Finance Bureau, which is extremely inconvenient for the people. The procedures are complicated, and the handling is unsystematic, and improvements are required.

Mayor Wu replied: (1) Regarding the strike and demonstration on June 2, strict measures have been prepared, but it is not convenient to announce them publicly. If the senators wish to inquire, we can exchange opinions at another time. (2) I very much agree with and express my gratitude for the suggestion that the senators organize a committee to assist in the guidance work. (3) Regarding the recovery of the racecourse, after discussion, the other party believes that if the Jiangwan suburban area is exchanged, it can be agreed in principle, but repair fees must be paid. As for the use of the interior of the racecourse, because it is now leased by the US Military Sports Association, it must be exchanged with an area in the western suburbs of Shanghai with convenient transportation before it can be done. However, a formal plan must wait until the person in charge of the racecourse returns to Shanghai from the country before it can be carried out. It may not be easy to open it as a park, because its houses and land have been leased separately, but the municipal government will do its best to negotiate. (4) The "burn, strike, beat, chaos" is obviously manipulated by thugs. The municipal government will definitely try its best not to "delay, blame, push, forget."

Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Office, because Jia Dechao asked, "Director Zhang seems to have a suspicion of monopolizing the election. I am afraid he wants to be the elected mayor," expressed his deep feelings. He said, "I have no ambition to be the mayor, and I am already at this age, and it is simply impossible in fact. As for the use of people, I will definitely be responsible for handling it according to the law. The last time a certain official violated the law, I even went to court to prove that he violated the law." Others such as Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, also successively answered the questions.

### More Than a Dozen Petitioners

[This Miscellaneous News] More than a dozen people went to the Municipal Senate to petition yesterday, including: (1) The parents of the eleven arrested students of Datong University, requesting that the students be released on bail. (2) The Shanghai Liquor and Dishes Industry Association requested that the starting point of the banquet tax be quickly adjusted according to the current price ratio. At the same time, the Finance Bureau changed the government order, ordering merchants to pay the banquet tax on behalf of the sales of beer and soda, and the merchants could not pay the compensation. A letter was sent to request the Senate to consult and still maintain the original case in the autumn of last year. It also requested the deletion of the words "cold drinks" in the draft collection rules for the surplus banquet tax to prevent disputes. (3) The Zhabei District People's Representative Council requested to stop Wang Qingji from illegally levying the finger quota for the private construction of public toilets, and to transfer him to the judicial organ for strict handling. It also requested that his illegal bid of 360 million yuan be confiscated and transferred to reward private schools and municipal health construction. It also requested the government to issue an order to abolish the donation of paper for private services. (4) The Shanghai Yuhang Bank came to petition because it could not open after the emergency economic measures plan was announced. (5) The Silver Building Industry Vocational Union requested to restore the sale of jewelry gold. (6) The Rickshaw Driving Industry Vocational Union requested to ban illegal and falsely established rickshaw companies. (7) Wang Zhuzhai represented the request to issue licenses to unlicensed rickshaws. (8) The Laohuzhao in Yangzhou Road Sanfang requested the promulgation of the rules and regulations for the Laohuzhao industry. (9) Peng Chusheng and other representatives requested to issue vendor licenses. (10) Four student representatives of Chengde Elementary School requested to preside over the public announcement because the school building was forcibly occupied by soldiers. (10) (1) The Caoyi Elementary School also came to petition because the school building was forcibly occupied by the Changning Road Sub-Bureau. (12) The pre-war residents of Ruikangli, Ruifengli, and other five alleys in Jiaxing Road requested to return to their residences.

### Chen Zhihong's Coffin Transported to Shanghai, Died in a Plane Crash Before His Ambition Was Fulfilled

Martyr Chen Zhihong came to Shanghai from Chongqing in 1944 to participate in the defection work of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department. On January 7, 1945, he personally led the pseudo-air force personnel, along with three enemy aircraft, to depart from the Changzhou enemy airfield and drive back to the interior. He knew that the aircraft was flying over the Xiaofeng County area of Zhejiang Province, when suddenly snow and ice covered the sky, and the direction could not be distinguished. Unfortunately, the aircraft that Martyr Chen was riding in crashed on the Tianmu Mountain, and he died heroically. Now, the family of Martyr Chen personally went to the area at the beginning of this month to find his remains, which were transported to Shanghai for burial yesterday afternoon. The air force personnel who defected that year and the representatives of the party and youth organizations in the city went to the Suzhou River to respectfully welcome the coffin. The remains of the pilot Liu Bingqiu, who died in the same plane crash, were also transported to Shanghai by the Chen family.

### Widening of Tianmu Road Section, Northern Engineering Completed

[Reported by This Newspaper] The section of Tianmu Road from Zhejiang North Road to Henan North Road in this city has always been the main road for entering and leaving the North Railway Station. In the past, before the concession was abolished, the area was the dividing line between the concession and the Chinese area, and jurisdiction could not be unified. The Public Works Bureau then followed the suggestions of the Jinghu Railway Bureau and the Municipal Senate and actively widened and reorganized the area. Because the southern part of the area involved more civilian houses, it was decided to start with the 21-meter width of the North Railway Station, and the 14-meter width of the southern part would be expanded in the second half of this year to allow the public sufficient time to move. The northern engineering was completed on the 19th of this month. The road is quite magnificent after the renovation, and there is no danger of congestion as in the past. The southern engineering is also being planned, but the demolition of houses still needs the understanding of the public.

### Xiamen-Manila Route, Hailong Wheel Will Resume Sailing

The Xiamen-Manila route of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been suspended for a long time. In order to strengthen the passenger and cargo transportation business between South China and various parts of Southeast Asia, the company has decided to resume sailing by the Hailong Wheel in the short term. The Hailong is currently being fitted with berths on this route.

### Zhabei Charity Organization Reorganizes Business

The Zhabei Charity Organization was greatly affected by the "August 13" war, and many of its houses were destroyed, resulting in the suspension of various businesses. Now, the board of directors of the organization has requested the Social Bureau to organize a reorganization committee to actively adjust the affairs of the organization. Recently, in addition to sorting out the houses and bases of the organization, the routine charitable activities such as burying exposed corpses, transporting and burying the Yizhong, and giving away wooden coffins are still being strengthened and effectively handled. In the blink of an eye, summer is approaching, and the burial work is crucial to public health. It is hoped that if citizens find anything, they will immediately call the organization (60774) or (61104), and they will go to collect and bury it at any time.

### US Memorial Day to be Marked with Memorial Ceremony

On the 30th, the United States Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers, US military and American expatriates in Shanghai will hold a grand memorial ceremony at the bottom of the Jing'an Temple Road Cemetery at 8:30 am. US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, Chennault and others will attend, and Mr. Chen will deliver a memorial speech.

### Senate Appeals for Peace in Telegram: Urges Communists to Abandon Prejudice of Relying on Military Strength; Requests Government to Order Ceasefire and Await Unified Reorganization within a Limited Time

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the temporary emergency resolution passed the day before yesterday, the Secretariat of the Municipal Council sent telegrams yesterday to the leaders of the National Government and the Communist Party, appealing for peace. It also sent telegrams to the National Political Council, the councils of various provinces, cities, and counties, and various legal entities, urging them to unite and promote the realization of peace. This telegram was amended and passed by the General Assembly yesterday. The original telegram to the National Government and to Mr. Mao Zedong are as follows:

To Mr. Mao Zedong: After the victory in the War of Resistance, our country was honored as one of the four great powers, and we were fortunate to have the foundation of the country re-established, with the prospect of national construction. However, you led the Communist army to rebel against the government, causing chaos within the country, with flames of war everywhere, causing suffering to the people and weakening the country's strength. In the past, the government longed for peace and repeatedly invited you to discuss matters, but you, relying on your military strength, failed to overcome your prejudices, resulting in years of peace talks without a ceasefire. The responsibility for this continuous war that harms the people and the country is obvious to all and cannot be concealed by one hand. Now that constitutional government is about to be implemented, any political party can legally participate in politics, and the government sincerely hopes that you will work together to plan the country's future. Therefore, it has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resolve the current domestic disputes through political means. However, in recent days, the situation has become increasingly tense, with frequent war reports, indicating that your attitude is becoming more extreme. If this continues, the country will cease to exist, and when the nest is overturned, no egg can remain intact. You are also a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, how can you lack a sense of national identity? Please rein in your horse at the edge of the cliff, time is running out. In view of this, this council, at the first meeting of the third session of the first congress, passed a unanimous resolution by all senators, willing to offer its final advice to you and the Chinese Communist Party, deeply hoping that you will prioritize the country and the people, resolutely abandon the prejudice of relying on military strength to dominate, and then lay down your arms and declare a ceasefire, so that transportation can be restored and peace talks can be reopened. It is also hoped that you will come to Beijing to discuss and resolve national affairs, turning hostility into friendship, and eliminating violence for peace and harmony. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. Otherwise, if you stubbornly cling to your prejudices and use military force to harm the country, you will be held responsible, and the people will no longer forgive you. What to do, please consider carefully. Shanghai Municipal Council, sincerely.

To the National Government in Nanjing: The construction of the country must be based on unity, and the prosperity of society must be based on stability. Since the victory, the government has longed for peaceful unification, and the people have longed for rest and recuperation. However, the Chinese Communist Party has occupied territory with its troops, making progress inch by inch, destroying discipline and losing national integrity. It has never been sincere in ending the war, resulting in years of peace talks being abandoned, the flames of war becoming increasingly fierce, the country's reputation declining, and the people's livelihood becoming difficult. We, the members of this council, looking at the overall situation, are extremely worried. Therefore, at the first meeting of the third congress, we unanimously proposed an emergency motion to send a telegram to the government, urging it to set a deadline for the Chinese Communist Party to lay down its arms as soon as possible, await unified reorganization, send representatives to Beijing, and resume peace talks. The central government should still regard them as a political party, cease fighting on the spot, and not pursue them. Otherwise, the government should concentrate its efforts and issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion, so as to end the military affairs as soon as possible, promote national unity, and lay the foundation for lasting peace. Recorded in the minutes. In addition to sending another telegram to the Chinese Communist Party to offer a final admonition and urge them to awaken, we hereby send this telegram for your review. We respectfully request that you heed the situation and adopt our suggestions. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiluan, Vice Speaker, and all the senators, sincerely.

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Xia Zhongming, former Deputy Minister of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, accused of being a traitor, was sentenced yesterday morning at the High Court. Judge Xiao, accompanied by Prosecutors Qiu and Ding, took their seats, and the bailiffs brought Xia Zhongming to the court. Xia was wearing a blue cloth long gown, his back slightly bent, and his complexion still good. After Judge Xiao inquired about the defendant's age and origin, he stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Xia Zhongming, colluding with the enemy, plotting to rebel against his own country, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for the family." Then he sat down and explained the reasons for the judgment, saying: "During his tenure in the puppet government, the defendant engaged in espionage work, arrested employees of the Bank of China, causing a major bloodbath, and sent people to assassinate Zhu Zuotong, the publisher of the China-America Evening Post, and Yu Hua and Qian Hongye, the two criminal court judges of the Shanghai Second Special District Court. In the 34th year, he organized the Fuxing Company, serving as the general manager, and purchased military grain and materials for the enemy, his crimes are serious, so he is sentenced to the maximum penalty. If he does not agree with the judgment, he may apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days after receiving the judgment." The defendant was quite calm when he heard the judgment, while his wife and daughter in the audience sobbed incessantly. Defense lawyer Chen Zhen requested the court to allow the defendant to meet with his family, but Judge Xiao refused and ordered the bailiffs to immediately return the defendant to the detention center.

### Kong Xiangxi to Visit the United States in Autumn; Discussed Overseas Missions with Reporters Yesterday; Plans to Visit Europe and Nanyang

[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Kong Xiangxi told reporters yesterday when they met with him that: "I will go to the United States in July. In addition to a medical examination, I need to handle the following matters: (1) I am the chairman of the board of directors of Yenching University and Mingxian College. These two schools have relationships with the United States, and there are some matters that need to be dealt with; (2) I am the person in charge of the Sino-American Cultural Association. The purpose of the association is to promote friendly relations between the two countries. The publisher of the American Life magazine, Luce, once donated houses to help Chinese students study in the United States. Also, some people in the United States have recently launched a world citizen movement, and I am one of the initiators. All of these matters need to be discussed in the United States." Mr. Kong also said: "In the future, I plan to visit Europe and Nanyang once. Currently, domestic industry and commerce cannot supply goods to overseas Chinese in Nanyang due to funding and other reasons, which is a pity. In the future, I hope to use the funds of the Bank of China to assist domestic industry and commerce and transport goods to Nanyang through remittance methods." Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Mr. Kong believes that the Communist problem should be resolved through political means. The government has always hoped for peace and believes that if the Communist Party sends representatives, the government will be willing to reopen peace talks. Discussing the current student unrest, Mr. Kong said: "If students are dissatisfied, they can send a small number of representatives to make requests. There is no need for a full-scale strike. Young people are full of energy and are easily exploited. I hope that young people will cherish their studies in this difficult situation." Also, Mo Dehui brought back a letter from Zhang Xueliang to Mr. Kong from Taiwan this time, and he expressed his gratitude for his concern. When reporters asked if the central government intended to reuse Mr. Zhang after he regained his freedom, he replied: "The current environment is complicated, and I am afraid that he will be exploited.

### Speed Up the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets; Deadline for Submitting Property Ownership Documents by the End of the Month; All Unclaimed Assets Will Be Confiscated by the State

The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area has received and seized enemy and puppet assets. Some of them have already been auctioned off, but some of them cannot be processed due to property rights disputes, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also received continuous claims from citizens or people of allied countries, stating that certain properties are not enemy or puppet assets and belong to them. Now, the office believes that all enemy and puppet assets should originally be owned by the government. For those who claim the right to the enemy and puppet assets and request their return, it was previously stipulated that they should submit property ownership documents within a limited time, but some have not yet submitted their documents. Now, in order to strengthen the handling of enemy and puppet assets and to respect the property rights of citizens or people of allied countries, the deadline for submitting property ownership documents has been extended to the end of this month, with four days remaining.

### Impersonating Social Bureau Staff, Forging Ration Coupons to Collect Money; Many Fabric and Dyeing Factories Deceived

[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Bureau has recently received reports that someone is forging the bureau's seal and issuing false material ration coupons to extort money. The person is about thirty years old, of medium build, with a thin, dark face, long hair, speaking with a Shanghai accent, wearing a Melton Zhongshan suit, and carrying a black briefcase. He claimed to be named Wu and went to small fabric factories in the Jin Shenfu Road area last week, claiming: "The Social Bureau is about to distribute materials. Each factory can receive real objects once a month, calculated at the market price in January of this year." He also asked whether each factory had registered with the Social Bureau for industry and commerce. After saying this, he took out a material ration coupon with a stamped seal and instructed them to fill it out and submit it to the Social Bureau. Each ration coupon cost 30,000 yuan. The factories, believing that he was a staff member of the Social Bureau and that there were cheap materials to be rationed, believed him at the time. After a few days, they learned that the Social Bureau did not have a material ration coupon, and they realized that they had been deceived. After receiving the report, the Social Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate with the Lujiawan Police Station. The victims include Dafeng Fabric Factory, Huachang Fabric Factory, Yongyi Fabric Factory, Datong Medicinal Cotton Fabric Factory, and Zhongfu Dyeing and Weaving Factory.

### Painter Wang Yachen Sues Tenant for Eviction; Reason for Recovering for Own Use Insufficient, Dismissed

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of "Goldfish Painter" Zhu Yachen suing Zhang Shengsong for eviction due to the termination of the lease was ruled by the district court yesterday. The main text of the ruling was: "The plaintiff's claim and the request for provisional execution are dismissed, and the litigation costs shall be borne by the plaintiff." It is said that Wang did not accept the ruling and will appeal to the High Court. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff and another painter, Xu Langxi, jointly founded the Xinhua Art College and the Xinhua Art Normal School, with Xu Langxi and the plaintiff serving as principals, respectively. They were approved for registration by the Ministry of Education in the 21st and 24th years, respectively. The school addresses were the buildings at No. 15, 16, and 18, Lane 155, Jianguo Middle Road. Later, they automatically suspended operations during the enemy-puppet period and rented the front building and bathroom pavilion on the second and third floors of Building 18 to the defendant for residence, with a term of three years, from February 15, 33rd year to February 14, 36th year, and a lease agreement was established. After the victory, the Ministry of Education approved the resumption of the school, but because the lease term had not expired, and they had applied to the "Housing Allocation Committee of Various Agencies in Shanghai of the Executive Yuan" for housing allocation, they did not achieve their goal, and the school affairs are still suspended. When the lease term expired, the defendant refused to move out, so Wang sued the district court. Judge He Xianzhang of the district court rejected the claim based on Article 100 of the Land Law, saying that the plaintiff's reason for recovering the property for his own use was not sufficient.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: The news item "Small Owner of Enamel Factory Injures Son of Gambling Table Boss in Car Accident" published in your newspaper on the 27th is inconsistent with the facts. Mr. Dong Shuying is the assistant manager of our company. Our company is a joint-stock company. It is inappropriate to say "small owner". On the day in question, Mr. Dong was traveling by car from the main factory on Jumen Road, Nanshi, and was passing by Zhonghua Road, which is a one-way traffic area from south to north. The tricycle involved in the accident was coming from north to south. In order to avoid the car, it turned and overturned in front of the car three feet away. There was no contact with the car at all. The passenger was injured when the car overturned. I hope you will correct this. Sincerely, Yifeng Enamel Factory Co., Ltd.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

(I) Resolving Legal Disputes

Jian Heng asks: I have several legal questions and seek your answers: (1) In the 25th year of the Republic [1936], A borrowed 800 national currency units from B, with an annual interest rate of 18%. A title deed was provided as collateral, with a term of one year. Upon expiration, B demanded repayment from A, but A repeatedly delayed and has not repaid anything to date. What crime has A committed in law? Is it fraud? (2) When filing a lawsuit, can I demand repayment of 2,000 times the original amount? (3) Is it reasonable in law for the interest to exceed the principal?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] (1) Failure to repay a debt upon maturity is not a criminal act. (2) Suing for repayment of a debt is a civil lawsuit. The court fairly determines the amount of compensation; there are no legal provisions specifying a multiple of the principal or interest. (3) Interest not exceeding the principal is found in the Qing Code, but there is no such provision in current law. However, the right to claim interest expires if not exercised within five years, as stipulated in Article 126 of the Civil Code.

(II) Inheritance of Estate

Wang Yusheng asks: I previously read in your newspaper's legal inquiries that the Inheritance of Estate Regulations stipulate that property allocated more than five years ago should not be included in the estate. However, I do not know from which year the five years are calculated. The property I currently own was a gift from my late father in the 32nd year [1943]. I wonder if it will be included in the estate.

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] Article 8 of the Estate Tax Law states that property divided or gifted within five years before the death of the deceased should be regarded as part of the estate and taxed uniformly. It can be seen that the five-year calculation compares the date of division or gifting with the date of death.

Shortly after leaving the school gate after the meeting, they suddenly clashed with some students outside the gate, throwing stones at each other. Gunshots were heard twice in the chaos. Upon hearing the news, the Xinshi Street Police Precinct sent personnel to suppress the situation and sent sixteen injured people, including Zhang Xiwu and Chen Shanshu, to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment, and took three students suspected of committing the crime to the precinct for interrogation. Due to insufficient evidence, they were released on bail pending trial at 2:00 p.m. yesterday.

### Table Tennis League

The Band Team Lost to Taishan

In the second Shanghai Table Tennis League, four games were played the night before at the Jingfen and Postal ballrooms, respectively. The First Division League Municipal faced the Second Division China and Zhongyou teams. When the time came, the China players had not arrived, and the League Municipal generals won the victory without moving their swords. In the battle against Zhongyou, Zhongyou won the first battle. Initially, the League Municipal did not dare to be careless. The attack was quite smooth, and it won five consecutive rounds. As a result, it defeated Zhongyou with five to two. In addition, the Second Division White Team was ambitious and actually defeated Zhejiang Xing with a straight seven, standing undefeated alongside the two strong teams Jingwu and Hualian in the same division. The soldiers of the White Team are all newcomers, and with this record, they can also be proud. In the second act, the Third Division Band Team competed with Taishan. The former won five battles and five victories, and its momentum was strong. The latter had lost to Xinsheng Hong once, and its reputation had been lowered a lot, so the battle was extremely laborious. The Band Team unfortunately lost its normal performance due to the loss of the handball master Fan Songqing, which led to the poisonous hand of Lu Shitang on the other side, losing the foundation for victory. It was even more a pity that the team leader Chen Pengyao in the final group could have won but did not win. As a result, Taishan defeated the Band Team with a score of four to three, and there was still a chance for the team to win the championship. The Band Team missed a good opportunity, not because its skills were not good, but because it lacked experience.

There will be three more games tonight. In the Fourth Division, Seed Post A will meet the rising star Qingniao. Although Post A can be sure of winning, on the individual side, it may be difficult to win all. In addition, the Hualian female generals will play against Chunmao. Although the Hualian females have won six battles in Yingbei, each performance is not weaker than the Textile Fourth Dongchang team. The peak of Chunmao athletes' ball is only slightly higher, and if they do not fight hard tonight, they may be disgraced by the female generals.

According to the person in charge of the Civil Aviation and Maritime Joint Venture: The agency has recently signed a contract with the China Trust Bureau to transport a large amount of rice purchased by the China Trust Bureau from Nanyang, Burma, and Siam to Shanghai to supply the city's needs. It is reported that the total amount is over 400,000 tons. If all of it is transported, it can sustain the city's food consumption for one and a half years, so there is no need to worry about the shortage of rice in the city. The joint venture has initially decided to transport 400,000 bags (equivalent to 40,000 tons), transported by Changxing, Huimin, and other four ships. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Yangon at the beginning of next month, and all of it is expected to be delivered by mid-July. Currently, various procedures such as ship departure are being processed.

[Another report] The National Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chen vessel, after arriving in Calcutta, returned to Yangon on the 22nd of this month and is currently loading a portion of the Xian rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau from Burma, totaling 7,000 tons. It is expected to be loaded by the end of this month and will return to Shanghai as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs.

People still felt that credit was tight and it was difficult to rally. Ewo Silk opened at 65,000 yuan. Financial and Guangdong gangs were selling, while securities and foreign merchants were buying. Ewo Shipping saw a low price of 62,500 yuan, and then gradually recovered.

### Tight Credit Forces Retail Closings - Chinese Stocks Continue to Decline Yesterday - Limited Trading, Uncertain Prospects

Chinese stocks continued to decline yesterday amid tight credit and retail closings. However, there were many rallies, trading was limited, and the future was uncertain. As a result, except for Chinese Underwear's new shares, which were absorbed by all parties due to their low price and closed at the limit, the remaining shares continued to decline.

Apart from Huafeng Enamel seeing a relatively high opening price in the morning, the rest were timid and weak. Numbers 235, 14, and 148 were sold, and Deyong Yarn continued to fall to 6,930 yuan after opening.

### Newspaper Import Quota: Publishing Industry Appeals for Relaxation

The publishing industry in this city recently telegraphed Secretary-General Shao of the Nanjing National Senate to forward to the presidium of the Senate, requesting the National Government to relax the import quota for newspapers for this quarter. The original telegram is excerpted below: "To Secretary-General Shao of the Nanjing National Senate, transferred to the presidium: The Import Quota Allocation Office decided today that the national newspaper import for May, June, and July will only be increased by 30% compared to the previous period. It is estimated that the newspaper import will be far from sufficient for consumption. The publishing industry feels it is difficult to maintain. We sincerely request your association to forward to the National Government, approving an increase in the newspaper import quota, so as to alleviate the difficulties. The Chairman of the Shanghai Booksellers Association, Li Bojia, and the Chairman of the Shanghai Newspaper Publishers Association, Li Zikuan, respectfully submit."

### Export Promotion Executive Committee to Meet Tomorrow

[Our report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee was originally scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM yesterday. Temporarily, because the committee members Liu Gongyun and Chief of the Secret Investigation Department Chen Junren went to Beijing a few days ago, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting, and no formal resolutions were made. The committee has now rescheduled the meeting for tomorrow. In addition, the secretariat of the committee recently hired Wang Nianzu as the deputy director. Mr. Wang has already assumed his duties.

### 449 Applications to Transport Zhangjiagang Cloth to North China

[Our report] The Textile Control Commission is handling the matter of transporting controlled yarn and cloth to the ports of Northeast and Hebei. Currently, 449 foreign manufacturers have applied for registration. The committee has begun reviewing the applications and will begin accepting applications for the transportation of yarn and cloth to the north in a week.

### Actual Sales of Rayon are Weak - Uniform Price Decline - Factory-Processed Silk and Fabric are Weak

Yesterday, the actual sales of rayon in the market were weak because silk factories had temporary allocations that could be used. Furthermore, due to the relationship between those in the industry and their cash flow, they urgently wanted to sell their goods for cash, so the opening price of No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang was 17.4 million yuan, and it fell all the way down to 7 million yuan at the close, a sharp drop of 1.1 million yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the cash flow was leveled, and the holders were unwilling to sell at low prices, so the asking price rose again, and finally it was sold for 7.5 million yuan, which was still 600,000 yuan less than the previous day. Dongyang and Xu characters also rose and fell accordingly.

Yesterday, the factory-processed fabrics were quiet again, and the asking price was slightly weaker. A grade of B-level fabrics sold for 20.85 million yuan, 150,000 yuan less than the previous day. A few packages of Tanheng striped fabric were also sold for 18.5 million to 8.8 million yuan. No transactions were heard for the remaining grades.

Yesterday, the price of silk and quilt covers in the city was about 200,000 yuan lower than the previous day. A Huajiang quilt cover was sold for 7.7 million yuan. Dacheng checkered wall crepe opened at 30,700 yuan and finally sold for 500 yuan, a decrease of slightly less than 1,000 yuan from the previous day. A Huajin crepe was wanted for 14,000 yuan in the morning, but due to the decline in rayon, it was sold for 3,500 yuan in the afternoon. Due to the busy silkworm season in the countryside, Sheng goods were rarely shipped, so the market price in the producing area rose instead. The selling price in Shanghai remained at the original price due to poor appetite.

### Yarn Market Sees Both Rises and Falls

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw tight cash flow at first, and the holders in the market were very willing to sell. The buyers' appetite was flat, so the opening price of 42-count Lanfeng dropped to around 12 million yuan, and the opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 6.7 million yuan. Afterwards, as actual demand came in, it rebounded. The final price of 42-count Lanfeng yarn rebounded to 12.1 million yuan, and the final price of 20-count Shuangma was 6.8 million yuan, which was still 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day for 42-count and 32-count yarn. However, 20-count special Shuangma Jincheng rose by 50,000 to 150,000 yuan. The prices of other 20-count Tiannv Sunlight and other brands and 16-count yarn mostly fell.

### Rationed Flour - Still Difficult to Distribute Today

[Our report] The distribution of low-priced flour has been slightly delayed due to the back-and-forth of official business between the Social Bureau and the Flour Association, so it is feared that it will still not be possible to distribute it as scheduled today. According to people from the Flour Association: If the official business arrives at the association today, it is hoped that they can contact the Central Trust Bureau and resume distribution within one or two days.

Another report: The municipal authorities plan to adopt the same measures for flour transactions as for rice and edible oil, approving free buying and selling and changing the price negotiation system. They are also preparing to open a flour market and implement open trading, which is currently being planned by the industry association.

Yesterday, flour continued to be allocated to digest stale goods, a sharp drop of 20,000 yuan. Bran fell sharply, with another reduction of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Bean cakes were heavily sold, falling back by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and Yingkou cakes plummeted by more than 10,000 yuan. The oil market had more supply than demand, and the price decline was the most severe. Raw oil and soybean oil plummeted by 40,000, 50,000, or 60,000 yuan, while rapeseed oil and sesame oil also fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, and clear oil also fell by slightly less than 40,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were very sluggish, and suddenly fell by 20,000 yuan. Few asked about corn, and it plummeted by 20,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed suit and fell by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil plants had acceptable appetite, and the situation was stable. Mung beans had a sluggish appetite and were in a state of fatigue. Sesame seeds moved slightly in foreign firms, with high prices set and secondary products sluggish. Broad beans were flat and stable, and red beans fell back by 20,000 yuan along with other items. Grains fell across the board.

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday stating that the "Measures for Handling the Registration of Various Companies in Recovered Areas" originally extended the deadline for companies to convene shareholder meetings to the end of December of the 35th year of the Republic. However, due to inconsistent implementation across different regions, further extensions are still necessary. While the deadline for companies within the city to convene shareholder meetings remains the end of December of the 35th year of the Republic as per the original order, those with special circumstances that genuinely prevent them from convening on time may, before the end of June of the 36th year of the Republic, list the reasons and report them through the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for verification and transfer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for discretionary extension. The maximum extension period shall not exceed three months from the date of application.

### Sugar Market Initially Tight, Then Declines

The sugar market saw continued tightness yesterday morning, but prices fell uniformly in the afternoon due to certain rumors, with declines ranging from ten thousand to several thousand yuan compared to the previous day. The Guild's market price for Peruvian sugar reached a high of 432,000 yuan, with a midday price of 427,000-428,000 yuan, falling to 420,000 yuan in the afternoon. No. 24 coarse white sugar initially reached 475,000 yuan, falling to 460,000 yuan in the afternoon. Semi-refined white sugar was at 440,000-430,000 yuan. No. 20 medium white sugar was at 395,000-387,000 yuan in the morning, falling to 380,000 yuan in the afternoon. Taiwan red sugar was at 345,000 yuan, later falling to 325,000 yuan.

### Saying the Import Control Will be Revoked, the Import Control Committee Has Not Heard Anything

Reports that import controls will be lifted and that merchants will be free to import goods have garnered significant attention from all parties. According to Yang Ti, Director of the Secretariat of the Import Control Committee, he has not heard anything about this matter and has no opinion. According to sources, this matter is of great importance and will affect domestic finance, economics, and finance, so the authorities will not act rashly and are studying effective implementation methods. Business people have expressed their hope that the government will take into account the nascent domestic industry and not allow the market to become a dumping ground for American goods.

### Stagnant Tea Exports, Merchants Appeal to All Parties

The environment for tea, one of our country's main exports, is deteriorating. The reason is that foreign prices have been reduced significantly, making the difference between those prices and the production costs of Chinese tea almost impossible to bridge, resulting in prolonged frozen exports. In particular, most of the aged tea from the 35th year of the Republic remains unsold, and tea merchants, aware that the harvest and production season for new tea this year is approaching, are actively appealing to the authorities for assistance. At the same time, they are sending telegrams overseas, explaining their plight and asking for appropriate concessions on tea prices to revitalize Chinese tea and prevent tea merchants from reaching the brink of ruin. As for domestic tea sales, the local merchants are actively trying to move their goods, and their morale is high. Although sellers are trying to raise prices, the sluggishness of the foreign tea market is preventing them from doing so, resulting in a continued stalemate. However, the market is somewhat firmer than before.

### Cigarettes Continue to Decline, Yongtaihe Starts Distributing Goods

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened weakly and continued to decline. Due to Yongtaihe Tobacco Company's large-scale distribution of goods, credit tightened, and there was a lot of reselling in the market.

Old Knife brand cigarettes were stagnant and dropped sharply by 325,000 yuan. Five Flowers brand cigarettes also fell slightly by 140,000 yuan. Prices for other Chinese cigarette brands were also sluggish.

### On the Eve of the Survey Team's Departure, Idle Chat: The Three-Peace Ocean, the Maritime Defense Outpost, Red Head Island

— Taipei, 24th Dispatch, Our Special Correspondent Mu Yun

Looking at the national map, Red Head Island is just a speck scattered on the eastern sea of Taiwan, a true outpost of maritime defense in the Pacific, like any small bird island in the Bashi Channel among the Tuan Sha, Xisha, and Nansha Islands.

The Japanese had put some effort into this island, and after the restoration, the Taitung County Government renamed the island Orchid Island and established a township office. Because the 49-nautical-mile voyage was difficult to overcome, apart from the aborigines sending people to Taitung by small boats, the county government and even the government tried to send someone there until this spring, when the Communications Department had ships that periodically traveled back and forth between the small islands along the eastern coast. Recently, scientists in Taiwan have become interested in this bird island, and they are trying to confirm the accuracy of the Japanese research with the latest research and surveys. It can be said that researchers from all relevant fields have been gathered to carry out a comprehensive and three-dimensional survey of the island, which should be a major event in the academic world this year.

Red Head Island is Purely an Aboriginal Base

Europeans knew about Red Head Island earlier than we did, around 1726. It is the "Tan Ma Yan" mentioned in the Records of Various Foreign Peoples published in China during the Song Dynasty. The name Red Head Island appeared in the Taiwan Sea Envoy Record by Imperial Censor Huang Shujing of Taiwan in the 61st year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. Foreigners call it Batel Tabaga, meaning Tobacco Island. The so-called "Red Head" refers to the shape of a Chinese boat with a red head floating on the sea. However, some say that the top of the island is blood-red when viewed from the coast of Taitung on a sunny day; others say that it is because the hair of the island's aborigines is red.

The only characteristic of the island is its purely tropical climate, with little temperature difference throughout the year, a minimum of 20 degrees and a maximum of 36 degrees indoors, and sometimes exceeding 40 degrees outdoors in midsummer. July to October is the typhoon season, with strong winds of 40 meters per second at that time.

From a geographical point of view, it is a monotonous coastline, an aboriginal base formed by underwater volcanoes in the third century, with a plane like a fist that never comes into contact with the outside world and no pier to dock at. Within 45.7 square miles around it, the mountains surrounded by Red Head Mountain (547 meters) in the northwest and Dasen Mountain (440 meters) in the southeast make Red Head Island a unique and primitive area.

The Yamei Tribe Spends Life in Peace

The most precious thing on the island is the Yamei tribe, the most uncivilized tribe in Taiwan. From an anthropological point of view, it is related to Batan Island in the Philippines, and its physique is very similar to the Malay system, with many brown spots similar to those of the African or other races. The Malay eyes have a black iris, and the hair is also black, very similar to the Taiwanese aborigines. But it is also the only backward nation in the world.

The geographical environment determines the conservatism of the Yamei tribe. The attack of foreign enemies is isolated, so that among the 1,600 or 1,700 people of their own tribe, they maintain a peaceful and warless life form, without a ruling chief, without class, and live a primitive individualistic lifestyle under true freedom and true equality. Their social system is very simple, and deep superstition keeps them maintaining their original moral concepts, without the headhunting style of ordinary mountain tribes. People affectionately call them the people of Shangri-La who do not know Qin and Jin, who are right here.

There is no currency system here. The more than 30 currency systems in Shanghai are regarded as waste to them. They adopt the most primitive transaction method—barter. Mainly exchanging iron rods, cloth, salt, matches, soap, and buttons for night pearl shells, seaweed, and aboriginal products. They especially love buttons.

Respecting Women's Rights and Freedom of Divorce

The Yamei tribe is also a nation that does not drink alcohol or smoke, but only likes betel nut. Most of them use sweet potatoes, chestnuts, raw ginger, coconuts, bananas, sugar cane, etc. as food. The seasoning is very simple, only salt. Mountain goats, pigs, and chickens are needed during sacrifices and weddings. They respect women's rights the most. Women can freely divorce. Remarriage is possible three or four times, but it is impossible for men, and they never leave their place of birth for life.

Death is extremely terrifying to them. No one dares to touch it except men. During the funeral, the men are fully armed, solemnly handling the matter, and sending it to the jungle by the sea and burying it in shallow soil.

The entire island only has small walking paths along the coast. They engage in simple agriculture and animal husbandry, raising pigs and goats. Speaking of goats, Little Red Head Island is really a goat pasture. They can be self-sufficient and do not need external supplies.

They live in thatched houses with "three floors", only one floor is exposed, and two floors are under the rocks. The main purpose is to avoid storms, but this sentiment is different from the caves in Yan'an and the Northwest.

They don't wear clothes, everyone is healthy, and it is a safe zone in the world without pulmonary tuberculosis reactions!

Major Threats: Wind, Malignant Red Worms

Red Head Island is marked with the bloody seal of the Japanese conquest. It was on October 4, 1903, when an American ship lost its way and five of them escaped to the island, and their clothes and belongings were looted, which later led to a diplomatic dispute. Subsequently, the Japanese attacked the island on January 27 of the following year, surrounded the aboriginal community, arrested dozens of principals, and removed the houses.

At the same time, the Japanese also established a police station, with three police officers handling matters between the aborigines. There was an aboriginal children's education center, which lured them into school with sweets, sugar, rice, clothes, etc. There is also a weather station. Now, in addition to the weather station being restored as an indicator for measuring fish, the rest are probably not things that can be repaired in a short time.

The biggest threat to the island is typhoons, followed by malignant malaria. The Japanese repeatedly wanted to develop it, but ultimately failed because they could not overcome natural disasters. The Geological Survey sent people to investigate, and three of them sacrificed their lives. There is also the most terrible red worm, commonly known as the red head worm. This worm loves to bite the armpits and lower body. It feels painful after two or three days, and there is a red thorn inside. It will heal if it is taken out. If it is not taken out, it will cause a high fever and endanger life. The Yamei tribe has a unique custom of prevailing in plucking hair. The armpits and genitals are plucked with skillful techniques using stones between the limbs. This is a strange custom, perhaps to overcome the poison of the red head worm!

Two Doctors Launch an Academic Atmosphere

The Red Head Island Survey Team is scheduled to depart from Keelung on the 25th on a 150-ton motorized sailboat. Oceanographer Ma Tingying and medical expert Chen Lijie are responsible for leading more than 50 researchers from various departments to conduct a systematic and classified study of the island for a long period of three weeks, including meteorology. Tropical diseases. Agriculture. Geology. Ocean. Animals and plants. As well as professors and scholars of medicine. Anthropology. Folklore, among whom several are Japanese professors, and one is a German professor Schhwabe who studies the flora and fauna of hot spring areas.

Ma Tingying and Chen Lijie are both doctors who studied in Japan. They both firmly believe that the holding of this survey team, although not a pioneer in the Chinese scientific community, has mobilized 50 or 60 people to collectively go to the desert island to conduct painstaking research for a period of time, but it is still breaking new ground. These workers are tired of politics, especially the chaotic reality. They gather together with common interests and common goals and attack science, hoping to create a new atmosphere in the academic world.

Taiwan has a working environment and conditions suitable for research. For Red Head Island, a zone that cannot be relaxed in terms of national defense and science, it will obviously gain valuable results and improve its international status through the research, investigation, reports, and performances of the group.

"The Pacific Ocean is ours!" They shouted this slogan and took risks to move towards the Red Head Island work area, the forward position of the Pacific National Defense. The reporter here respectfully wishes them a successful return!

When the aborigines take a boat, women and children are absolutely prohibited from approaching, and it is even forbidden to bring any women's supplies, and a respected person must steer the boat. (Sent by our special correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### A Wisp of Smoke Increases Tobacco Leaf Production and Cultivates National Tax Revenue

— Kaifeng, 18th Dispatch, Ji Fan

According to statistics for the 35th year of the Republic, the total output of various types of tobacco leaves in our country is about 1.5 billion pounds, while the output of flue-cured tobacco that can be used to manufacture cigarettes is only more than 95 million pounds. According to this calculation, only 600,000 cases of cigarettes can be manufactured. If one-tenth of the country's population smokes cigarettes, each person should maintain each cigarette for 15 hours to be sufficient, which is practically impossible.

According to general estimates, our country needs at least 2 million cases of cigarettes every year, so a large number of finished cigarettes and raw tobacco leaves have to rely on imports, and more than 90% come from the United States. In the 35th year of the Republic, excluding cigarettes, the import of tobacco leaves alone reached 34.8 billion yuan, or about 22 million US dollars. Calculated at today's exchange rate, the average amount of national currency flowing out of the country every minute is 530,000 yuan.

This year, according to the Economic Commission's announced quota for tobacco leaf imports, the first and second phases each last for three months, each at 8 million US dollars, and the average amount of national currency flowing out every minute is 750,000 yuan, and cigarette imports are not included. This wisp of smoke, in an imperceptible moment, has formed one of the biggest loopholes in our country, which cannot be ignored.

Although tobacco is not an absolute necessity of life, it has become an indispensable item in daily life, which is an undeniable fact. Moreover, national tax revenue reached more than 260 billion yuan in the 35th year of the Republic, or 600,000 yuan per minute. It is estimated that it will reach more than 1 trillion yuan this year, or at least 2 million yuan per minute. Therefore, tobacco is also an important source of national tax revenue.

The Tobacco Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in order to increase production, improve quality, eliminate loopholes, and cultivate tax sources, has launched a large-scale tobacco production improvement work. If the situation is stable, it may be possible to achieve self-sufficiency within three years, and it is hoped that there will be a surplus for export to earn foreign exchange. According to the investigation, Henan has the highest output and quality of flue-cured tobacco in our country, followed by Shandong, and then Anhui. This year, because the situation in Shandong is not stable, the work of the Tobacco Production Improvement Department will be carried out in Henan and Anhui provinces first, while only small-scale experiments will be carried out in Qingdao, Shandong, and most of the efforts will be concentrated in Henan. According to preliminary estimates at the beginning of this year, the situation is very good, and the cultivated area can reach about 800,000 mu, an increase of 20% to 30% compared with last year. The future of tobacco production is very optimistic.

### Tropical Orchards

— Special Correspondent Chen Zheng-yu, Fuzhou, 14th Dispatch

The weather is slowly getting warmer, and we will think of eating sweet fruits to quench our thirst. Although Jiangnan is a land of fish and rice, its fruits are ultimately inferior to those of Fujian, which is closer to the tropics. The southeast of Fujian is blessed with a suitable climate and soil, allowing fruits to thrive. The area producing fruit accounts for nearly one-third of the entire province, earning it the name "Tropical Orchard." The variety of fruits and the richness of their production are almost unparalleled by Taiwan and Guangdong. Every year, various fresh fruits or dried fruits are supplied to provinces across the country, amounting to tens of thousands of loads.

Fruit Varieties and Seasons

The fruits produced in Fujian number dozens, among which the most famous are oranges, tangerines, longans, lychees, pomelos, peaches, plums, loquats, bananas, persimmons, star apples, olives, star fruit, jujubes, sugarcane, waxberries, grapes, mangoes, hawthorns, water chestnuts, etc. Some are even rare fruits in the country. These fruits are produced in rotation each year, as seen in the following fruit seasons: January for oranges; February for ripe bananas; March for loquats; April for waxberries to quench thirst; May for peaches and plums all over the land; June for red lychees; July for longan season; August for abundant star apples; September for persimmons to appear; October for fragrant pomelos; November for tangerines heralding winter.

Fuzhou – Fuzhou Tangerines

Among Fujian's fruit exports, Fuzhou tangerines are the most important. Fuzhou tangerines are produced in Fuzhou, Linsen, Fuqing, and other places. They have thin skins, plentiful juice, and are sweet, superior to Shantou tangerines, maintaining their position as the "King of Tangerines." Before the war, the average annual production was 350,000 dan. The best quality ones were transported and sold to Beijing and Shanghai. Tangerines are produced in winter. After the Beginning of Winter, the tangerines are delicate and red, ready to drop. The market appearance of Fuzhou tangerines almost signifies the approaching New Year. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to grain panic in Fuzhou, Fuqing, and other places, farmers were forced to cut down tangerine trees and plant rice, causing the production of tangerines to decline sharply. After November of last year, only nearly 10,000 dan of Fuzhou tangerines were shipped to Shanghai each month. The price per dan ranged from 60,000 to 100,000 yuan. The Sanshan Guild Hall at the 16th Wharf in Shanghai is the trading place for the export of Fuzhou tangerines. Besides being eaten fresh, the peel of the tangerine is removed with a knife, dried in the sun, and called "Tangerine Peel," which has an extremely fragrant and sweet taste. Shanghai Daoxiangcun uses it to make medicine.

Longan and Lychee

Putian is abundant in lychees and longans, hence the name "Lychee City." There is a popular saying, "Pick ten thousand longans, eat three hundred lychees," expressing a grand enjoyment. Putian's lychee varieties are excellent. Although Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou also produce lychees, their quality is much inferior. This tree is an evergreen tree, as tall as twenty or thirty feet, with a crown like a canopy. The leaves are pinnately compound. It bears fruit in June. This fruit fears frost and snow, and is only suitable for planting in subtropical or tropical regions. If a west wind rises during flowering, it will be difficult to bear fruit, and it is especially sensitive to musk, which will cause all the flowers and fruits to fall. Lychees are not suitable for long-distance travel because they are easily perishable. The people of Putian make them into dried lychees, commonly known as Yuanxiang, which are transported and sold to Jiangnan and North China. Before the war, the average annual production was 30,000 dan. If calculated at the current price of 1,000 yuan per catty, it is worth 300,000,000 yuan. However, in the year after the victory, the production declined sharply, with only more than 4,000 dan produced, causing lychee drying merchants to suffer heavy losses.

Zhangzhou – Wentan Pomelos

Pomelos are also evergreen trees, taller than tangerines, suitable for planting in malarial areas. Zhangzhou produces the most, followed by Xiamen. Zhangzhou's pomelos have thin skins, sweet flesh, and plentiful juice, worthy of being called the best in the world. The larger ones are called "Pengshan," and the smaller ones are called "Wentan," enjoying great fame and selling in the province and in Nanyang and Hong Kong. In the past, women in southern Fujian used a planing knife to take down the pomelo wood from the pomelo tree to use as hair gel, commonly known as "Beauty Gel," which is a celebrated tale.

Others include the oranges of Fuzhou and Lianjiang, which are currently being planted in large quantities; the olives of Linsen, which are crisp when bitten and transported and sold to Jiangnan; the Kun peaches of Fuzhou, which are of excellent quality; the plums of various counties in eastern Fujian, made into "Li-gan," transported and sold at home and abroad, called "Jiayingzi" by Hong Kong people; the persimmons produced in Linsen, Yongtai, and other counties, besides being eaten fresh, are made into persimmon balls and persimmon cakes, peddled and sold in various places; the black jujubes, loquats, water chestnuts, sugarcane, and other fruits of various counties in southeastern Fujian were all exported before the war, with an annual value of more than one million yuan.

An Orchard

Fruit is one of the main sideline products of the rural areas of Fujian Province. Farmers plant fruit trees during their leisure time to supplement their insufficient income from farm work. Planting fruit requires changing soil and fertilizing every year to be successful. There are prosperous and lean years for fruit production, alternating with each other. Judging from the desolate fruit production situation in Fujian last year, this year's fruit production in Fujian should be a prosperous year. However, the rural economy has been suffocated recently, and most farmers do not have the ability to buy new seedlings and fertilizers to propagate their orchards, and there are concerns about insect pests, which greatly damage the benefits of fruit production. What can farmers do? In the southeastern part of Fujian, during the Anti-Japanese War, because the area was a coastal hub, 80-90% of the transportation routes were destroyed, resulting in fruit products in the fruit areas of Xianyou, Putian, Fuqing, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and other places being all over the ground, unable to be transported out in large quantities, left to rot, and goods discarded on the ground, which is very regrettable. If problems such as transportation, refrigeration, and fertilizers can be solved, Fujian can indeed become the number one orchard in the country.

### Regarding Chinese Naval Students in the UK

To the Editor: I recently read a communication from Chinese naval students in the UK on page 7 of your May 11th issue, and its content is quite accurate, being largely the same as what my younger brother reported in his letter last spring. My younger brother left Chongqing for India and then transferred to the UK in November of the 34th year (of the Republic), as one of the first group of fifty officers. He is currently training at the Royal Naval Gunnery School in Chatham, near London. Once he has completed his studies, he will serve as a gunnery instructor for the second group of students who arrived in England this spring. He is expected to sail back to China on the "Zhendan" ship this summer. According to his understanding, the names of the ships should be corrected as follows:

(1) Renown ("Reputation") 35,000 tons, 6 15-inch guns, is one of the three British battlecruisers. Another, the Hood, was sunk in the Atlantic by the German ship "Bismarck." Another, the Repulse ("Resistance"), was sunk in Singapore by Japanese aircraft. The "Name Accurate" ship has been decommissioned and is used exclusively for naval training, and is not the "Adventure" aircraft carrier.

(2) Aurora ("Dawn") is the original name. It was renamed "Zhendan" after being given to our country, and is a light cruiser of 5,720 tons. (The following omitted) Respectfully, Gao Guangyu (May 12, Kunming)

### Reader Opinions - Regulations

(1) This column is absolutely open, and the author is responsible for the content. However, avoid being lengthy. (2) Do not attack private individuals, and do not submit the same manuscript to multiple publications. (3) Contributors must clearly state that the manuscript is for "Reader Opinions" and must truthfully provide their name and address, but may use a pen name when published. (4) No payment will be made for manuscripts. (5) The newspaper has the right to edit submissions. (6) No reply will be given regarding whether a submission will be published. (7) The newspaper may, if necessary, forward submissions to relevant authorities for reference.

To the Editor: At noon on the 17th of this month, a young man dressed in work clothes and carrying electrical repair tools claimed to be sent by an electrical supply store to repair the meter, and directly entered the third floor of No. 51, Tengfeng Lane, Sichuan Middle Road, my residence. At that time, it was the meal preparation time for the entire building, and the tenants refused because there was no problem with the lights on the third floor. He then returned to the second floor and stole the sub-meter prepared by the tenant and fled without a trace. Because the sub-meters of the second-floor tenants were installed at the door of the rooms, and it happened that no one was entering or leaving the household, it was stolen, it is estimated that it was worth about 400,000 yuan at the time. I am deeply afraid that after the scoundrel succeeds once, he will inevitably use his skills on a large scale in the future. Upon investigation, most of the companies, landlords, and firms in Tengfeng Lane have strict rules, yet it still happened. Other lanes are even more unthinkable. I hope that the relevant authorities will pay close attention and hope that citizens will be vigilant at all times to avoid losses. (Jun Ran)

At the end of Alley 934 (Moufuli), Tanggu Road, Beizhan District, garbage is piled up like a mound, and it is littered all over the place, but it has not been cleared. As summer approaches, the sunlight steams it, and the foul smell is rampant, mosquitoes and flies breed, and it is a source of germs, which has a great impact on health. It is hoped that the health authorities will clear it up urgently. In addition, the lid of the trash can is damaged, and it is hoped that the authorities will move this can to a suitable place in the alley. This is especially what I hope for. (Ge Airen)

### Yixing Hospital is Too Short of Medicine

I am a small civil servant. Since I returned to Yixing to visit relatives on May 6th last year, who knew that at noon on the 8th, my seven-year-old child suddenly developed a fever when he returned home from school. A child's fever is not a serious matter, so I gave him some anti-inflammatory tablets and told him to sleep. He didn't moan at the time, but the fever was very high at night. On the morning of the 9th, I took him to Yixing Public Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, he had scarlet fever and needed to inject scarlet fever serum, but the hospital did not have this medicine in stock and told me to buy it myself. Who knew that I ran all over Yixing City and private Western medicine clinics, but there was no such medicine. The car to Wuxi had already left, and it would take two days to take a boat, so I decided to take a bus to Wuxi for treatment the next day. In the afternoon, my child's condition worsened, his eyes rolled upward, and he had convulsions. In my anxious state, I asked a neighbor to find a traditional medicine practitioner to give him acupuncture, but the practitioner just shook his head and said there was nothing he could do. I had no choice but to send him to the Public Hospital again and ask the director to find a way to rescue him, injecting penicillin and cardiotonics, but it was ultimately ineffective, and he died in the hospital at 8 pm that afternoon. I checked the cause of my child's death, and it was not because the disease could not be cured, but because Yixing did not have the medicine to treat him. If Yixing Public Hospital had the scarlet fever serum, why would my child die? It is heartbreaking that such a fat and healthy child died in one and a half days. My child's death is not a pity, but the lack of medicine in Yixing Public Hospital is such that how can tens of thousands of children in Yixing be rescued if they get an infectious disease? Are we just waiting to die? This is a big problem. Children are the future masters of the country, and we can no longer spoil their little lives. I want to appeal for all the children in Yixing, asking the kind-hearted philanthropists among my fellow villagers in Shanghai to donate some special medicines for infectious diseases, such as scarlet fever serum, meningitis serum, diphtheria and other medicines, to Yixing Public Hospital, in order to benefit the people. At the same time, I hope that the responsible person in the hospital will also prepare these medicines. In short, my child was sacrificed because of lack of medicine. I don't want other children to suffer the same unfortunate fate as my child, so I can only appeal with tears and pain on behalf of the tens of thousands of children in Yixing! I also hope that hospitals in other second-class cities will also strive to be well-equipped! (Wu Jusheng)

### There are Nails in the Trees in Zhongshan Park

To the Editor: There are many cedar trees to the west of the Fanshi Pavilion in Zhongshan Park. The park manager has densely nailed iron nails to the trees because children climb the trees. This kind of method that is invisible to the eye and hurts when touched, I urgently hope that the Public Works Bureau will find a way to improve it, and please pay attention to the parents of children in this city, in case of accidental contact, not only will it be a thorn injury, but there is also a danger of falling. Even in terms of trees, it is also feared that it will easily lead to withering. (Qian Nengxun)

Spring and Autumn

### The Climate of Spring

— Bao Yu

Secretary Wu ran out of his house, and seeing the sun was already high, he knew it was late, so he quickened his pace.

His body was quite thin and weak, with his two shoulders appearing high. He probably hunched over his desk writing for too long. He had a flat head, and wore an old woolen hat, making him look like a scarecrow. That thin, long stalk—his neck—swayed, making people worry it would break.

He wore a black cotton robe, and the sleeves, collar, and hem of the robe were frayed. The bottom of the sleeves and the seat of the pants were shiny, like a clock face. There were two seams in the middle of the robe, because the robe was too short, and cloth was specially added to lengthen it. Wide borders were sewn on both sides because the robe was too small, and cloth was specially added to expand both sides.

The March sun shone on his body, making him feel warm, and he had walked a long way quickly, so beads of sweat crept stealthily into his vest and on his cheeks.

"It's warm, I can't wear the cotton robe anymore!" As soon as he thought this, his pace couldn't help but slow down. He was concerned that the pedestrians on the road had all taken off their winter clothes, and the cotton robe had become a rare thing.

The more he walked, the more he felt that what he was carrying on his body was not a cotton robe, but a wooden yoke. As long as someone on the road glanced at him, he always felt that the gaze cast was a mocking and contemptuous look.

Three modern women walked towards him. They were all wearing short spring clothes, and one of them even exposed her fat arms. The three of them walked side by side. In Secretary Wu's eyes, they were simply three powerful armies, coming to confront him. He didn't have the courage to move forward, and his feet hesitated.

As they approached him, Secretary Wu was in a hurry to give way, and a burst of panic caused his body to sway from side to side involuntarily, causing the three women to burst into laughter.

"They're laughing at me, they're laughing at me, they must be laughing at my clothes..." He muttered to himself, and his cheeks were already burning.

He ran into the office panting, and saw that many colleagues had changed their clothes. Especially the "office flower" sitting by the window—a female comrade—was only wearing a thin, bright red lined robe today, with her chest held high.

He took off his old woolen hat, wiped away a handful of sweat, and sat down with his head buried, pulled out a small writing brush, and prepared to copy official documents, but his whole body was on fire, and his heart couldn't be quiet no matter what. The beads of sweat on his forehead dripped directly onto the official document paper. The black words on the official document all changed…clothes…spring…three women…red lined robe…and other words, jumped into his eyes.

"Hey, Comrade Wu, do you want to make a uniform?" The office flower walked up to him and put a notice soliciting the making of uniforms and a piece of woolen sample in front of him: "It's very cheap, 300,000 to make a set of uniforms. Big staff members can pay it back in two months, and small staff members in three months..."

"Yes! Yes! Let me take a look!" He picked up the notice and the woolen sample and looked at them back and forth for a while. The office flower was impatient and retreated back to her window seat.

——My monthly salary is only 140,000. After deducting 100,000 each month, I only have 40,000 left. Can this 40,000 yuan cover the family's expenses?

——If I don't make it, then I'll never be able to make it!

He thought and thought, thought for a long time, but still couldn't decide. He kept rubbing his scalp with the penholder, and a lot of dandruff fell down.

In the end, he returned the notice to the office flower.

"How is it?" the office flower asked, opening her bright eyes and glancing at his black cotton robe.

"I... I'll consider it again..." He stammered these words and twisted his thin neck.

"I know, old Wu is afraid of his wife. He must go back and submit it to his wife for approval!" A colleague next to him deliberately teased him.

He smiled miserably and returned to his seat.

Whenever the seasons changed, it was almost always a time that made him anxious.

Because the season changed, the climate also changed, and the clothes he wore had to change as well.

But he was just a small secretary, and the salary he received each month was used to support his wife, daughter, and himself. Filling the three stomachs was already very difficult, so where would there be extra money to make clothes?

There was no way, he could only rely on this black cloth robe, passing through four autumns, four winters, and three springs.

Every time the seasons were about to change, he would always have a hope: I must change my clothes next season, but hope and reality were out of sync. In fact, this black robe seemed to have formed an inextricable bond with him, unwilling to leave him.

On the one hand, he hated this robe very much, and even cursed it. On the other hand, it was, after all, a long robe. To continue mixing in the "long robe team," he still had to cherish it.

"The mouse has a layer of skin, and I have a black coat. If my black coat gets a hole torn on a nail, then I won't be able to mix in!" He had thought this way.

Sometimes he envied those coolies: "They are so good, wearing short clothes, it doesn't matter if they are a little tattered! What's the use of long robes?"

Although that's what he said, he couldn't run into the office wearing short shirts and trousers after all.

Now, the weather is getting warmer day by day, and people mostly welcome the spring season with smiling faces. Only he, his heart is more and more depressed every day.

This season, he still can't make new clothes. He is still wearing this black robe, preparing to spend the fourth spring, but the cotton inside has been removed, and the cotton robe has become a lined robe.

The climate in spring is changeable. One night, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the weather suddenly turned cold. Secretary Wu didn't have time to put the cotton back into his robe. He reluctantly resisted the cold, but after resisting for two days, he fell ill.

### Friendship – Postscript to "Freedom Talk Monthly"

— Lü Baihua

Teaching, writing, and editing magazines seem to be what I like to do from the bottom of my heart. Perhaps it stems from a quest for emotional resonance in friendship, but I feel lonely when I leave it. "Night Talk" was only edited for three months and was discontinued for some reason. A year has passed, loneliness has invaded me, mingling in the circles of car dust and coal smoke, whiling away the time, without knowing why.

This was a chance encounter. A friend wanted to start a magazine, and I surprisingly agreed. Chance became the main reason for "surprisingly", but I just wanted to throw my empty heart, which had been lonely for a long time, back into the warm stove of friendship. But I have to run around for a living during the day. I didn't want to spoil the fun. When the setting sun slanted over the river, or when dusk shrouded the treetops, I could still find the edification of friendship. In this way, "Freedom Talk" was produced.

It can also be said that I should mark an unforgettable page in the short course of my few dozen years of life, because in this world only friendship is warm, warm and even great. During this period, in addition to the natural help of several old friends such as Zhao Jingshen, Wei Jinzhi, Hu Shanyuan, Qian Juntao, and Chen Bochui, and the words "Inside the summary, Mount Sumeru mustard seeds, pen flying rain, wind thunder" inscribed by Ye Xiaweng, Zikai sent a special draft from Hangzhou. New friendship gave me unparalleled encouragement, and the casual chats during the draft pulling process seem worth recording.

First of all, I thought of Shi Zhecun. Zhecun and I are spiritual friends. He has unique creations in both new and old literature. When he was transferred to the inland, he wrote many old poems, and so did I. During these eight years of departing from sorrow and depression, I compiled "A Speck of Dust" and sent it to him to read. At that time, he was about to go to Xuzhou to finish the unfinished classes of Jiangsu College. He wrote to me saying that the "Ode to Rolling Back the Soil" "directly extracted the essence of Jiangxi," which I dare not accept, but I have always treasured the Xuan paper note he used, with its strong and unrestrained ink treasure. Because the yellow fragrance was already deep, I first went to his Jinan dormitory. In the faint light, he pulled out many poems for me to read, one by one. The paper for writing poems was specially prepared, as if it had the sign of "Wu Xiang Temple." A few days later, I received his manuscript, which was "Notes from Wu Xiang Temple," about poetry criticism. He said that next he would write lyrics, or songs, and wanted to have a systematic discussion of this kind. Next, I met Dai Wangshu. Wangshu was as heroic and unrestrained as Zhecun when talking about the sky, and so amiable. He was teaching at both Jinan and Normal College, which was very tedious, but he definitely agreed to help. He knew about my work during the day and strangely said, "How did you step into such a circle?" Yes, I am whiling away my time in a circle full of commercial atmosphere, so I feel lonely and want to pick up my pen again. I responded with a smile as usual, but this answer was not spoken.

Shanghai rarely sees Xie Bingying's articles. I wanted her to write some news. Before receiving her Beijing news "This is Not Spring", she replied that she would definitely write to me. With just this sentence, I felt deeply happy, because she was editing several publications and had to teach, so she was really too busy. "This is Not Spring" also mentioned "Qingge asked her if she wanted to return to Shanghai." Ms. Zhao Qingge was burying her head in writing a novel and had stopped contributing to external publications for a long time. She was also kind enough to rush a piece for me. When I was sitting upstairs reading Xiao Tianhan's poem, I really wanted to write one as well, but I only remembered the rhyme "Qingge is as agile as a strong man".

Soon, although the drafts were almost ready, other difficulties arose. Although "Freedom Talk" was published, my heart still sank, returning to loneliness. I was afraid of failing the warmth of friendship in vain.

### Father of Modern Drama - Ibsen

— Yan Zhewu

Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906), the father of modern drama, had his 41st death anniversary on May 23rd of this year. The brilliance of this solitary pioneer's thought still shines brightly before our eyes today.

Ibsen was Norwegian, but he spent more of his life in exile in foreign lands. It was not until his old age, when he turned seventy, that he received a warm welcome from his compatriots, which moved the old man so much that he smiled through his tears. Indeed, Ibsen was a pioneer of his time. He opposed all the corruption and deceit of the established society and championed freedom and truth. He personally declared war on unreasonable laws, morals, religion, and marriage. Throughout his life, his plays prioritized expressing his thoughts. He fought, continued to move forward, and never retreated. The stubbornness of society continued its vulgar attacks. He wanted to heal this sick society and create healthy descendants for the future. His works are absolutely devoted to humanity, freedom, and happiness, and he is truly a pioneer of free thought in Europe!

Originally, a prophet is always initially rejected by the masses, even considered a rebel. Later, when society decays to the point of collapse and needs to be rebuilt, this rebel is often welcomed as a deity. Therefore, one of the reasons Ibsen's thought leaned towards individualism was because he sensitively saw the impending collapse of the old society and pointed out its source of disease. Unfortunately, people at the time were accustomed to established etiquette and instead accused him of heresy. As a result, he produced the extremely individualistic heroic theories that "the most powerful person in the world is the most lonely person" and "the minority party is often right, and the majority party is often wrong," which seem to be anti-democratic. In fact, his arguments were precisely to debate against the blind attacks of society at the time. And this "individual" must be a prophet, and the so-called "majority" must refer to the ignorant masses. He felt that the masses of society at the time were blindly following, and his personal insights were not accepted by the masses. Individual will, freedom, and happiness were all obscured and corroded by hypocrisy and vulgar deceit. Therefore, he developed free thought.

His four major social problem plays pioneered realistic drama! "A Doll's House" is a famous work that shook the world for women's rights, but because society counterattacked him, he wrote "Ghosts" to answer. As society attacked him even more, he wrote "An Enemy of the People" to answer again. When society resisted him even more intensely, he finally wrote "The Wild Duck," saying, "Don't expose hypocrisy, or your happiness will also be destroyed at the same time." But the facts tell people: "Life is like flowing water, its meaning and value lie in rushing forward mightily. The wild duck of the open sky, once hit, sinks to the bottom and never rises again;—the one raised in the back building, washing in the water in the trough, is content and forgets its origins, alas!" This is a great satire on people who are content with hypocrisy and deceit and forget freedom and happiness!

Ibsen's life was one of struggle. Due to the stimulation of the objective environment and the stubbornness of his inner personality, he fulfilled his great will to seek human happiness through resistance. Although he is the father of realistic drama, his early and late works still have romantic overtones because he praised nature, pursued truth, and advocated individuality and personality. Therefore, commemorating the master of modern drama, Ibsen, in such a hypocritical and chaotic society still has great significance!

### The Wall

— Zang Zan

A bird's home is a high rock standing in the sky, a treetop dissolving into the sky, or a bird rack hanging in the air. Only smaller birds raised by people live in cages, but they still get sunlight and breathe air. But what about people? People live in houses surrounded by high walls and walk on roads between walls.

One day, my friend and I went to the city to buy a train ticket because he was leaving the city for the north the next day. After buying the ticket, we took one last tour of the streets until dark (my friend and I had not been in this city for long, and now he was leaving again. There were new encounters and new hopes everywhere. I couldn't leave here with him, and of course, I couldn't keep him here). We tried to find roads that we didn't usually take, and the darker we walked.

Like dark clouds setting off lightning; lights setting off the night. In the night, what was clear became unclear, what was ugly became beautiful, and what was old became fresh. We wandered through the blind man's qin music, the lights of the small food stalls, and the storytellers and singers... We forgot the time until midnight.

— Perhaps not midnight — until we lost our way.

The colder and lonelier we walked, the closer we came to a high wall, tall and long, with no end in sight. We walked far away from the wall, the wall exuding a terrible chill, as if it could fall down at any moment—no one believed that such a high wall could last. But we couldn't deny that this was a new encounter. Was it a rich man locking himself inside? But why didn't he even build a door or window? (Just a wall.) And why was it made so high? After circling the high wall a few times, we finally found a door—like a city gate, with words written on it:

"Prison"

In front of this dark gate, without hesitation, we immediately found an alley across the street and slipped in, not daring to make a sound.

As if walking into a nightmare, everything around us had been arranged by demons. Walking out of this unknown alley, there was another high wall, another gloomy gate, with a bright light on the door, white and green. An armed soldier stood upright in the bright light, another prison:

"Military Prison"

We no longer had the courage to go forward; not only were we afraid of running into prison, but we were also afraid that my friend wouldn't be able to get up early for his departure tomorrow. We asked the first passerby we met, and he told us the way home—it was still an unfamiliar road. We walked with our heads down, not speaking, just thinking, and knowing that we were both thinking about the same thing, wanting to find something to say, but afraid of disturbing each other's thoughts.

Ahead was another row of high walls, this wall was older and more empty, as if inside was just a wilderness, where even small grass could hardly grow, a wilderness that would never be exposed to sunlight... But we did hear sounds inside, like wind, like sighs—but not like a single person's sigh, but the sighs of thousands of people; low and numerous. We looked for the words on the gate, which were written in gold on a blood-red background:

"Seminary"

Ah! That was not a sigh, that was not the sound of the wind, it was the sound of praise, the sound of bells. The sigh was our own.

We kept walking, it was probably past midnight, and we walked to the road we knew. Along the way, we encountered many similar high walls, some were residences, some were temples, and some were still prisons.

The road home was long and required crossing a large meadow. Fortunately, it was a familiar road. In the field, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The first sentence, my friend said:

"It's all walls, all walls."

I was sad. I felt lonely. Tomorrow, my friend would take the train and then the ship to the ocean.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 520

— Ye Jingfeng

"What kind of 'morality' is that... In other words, isn't China misled by this kind of morality?" Tsurumi spoke with the eyes of a Japanese 'military nationalist' education.

"If you say that, I have to ask a question: Who gave you the right to kill... whether it's an individual or a country?"

"For individuals, of course, there are national laws to exercise power..."

"Then, for countries, there are also international laws to exercise power,... But who established international law?... Now who is diligently abiding by international law? Who has recognized the existence of international arbitration, except under false pretenses?"

"That's right, so we need to manufacture weapons to strike weapons, and use war to quell war!" Tsurumi used Japanese militaristic aggression and sophistry to thwart Shouyi's theory. "You alone want to uphold justice with empty hands, but in today's world, we have reached the era of military power first, and might makes right. You alone stubbornly adhere to the 'no interaction until death' approach of the pre-Christian era, acting as a state of etiquette. To put it nicely, you are performing the role of a 'martyr'; in fact, you are inviting others to invade, simply waiting to become a subjugated people!"

"Do you think that going so slowly, step by step, turtle-like, ox-like, can keep up with the times?" In Tsurumi's imagination, he seemed to see the Japanese army sweeping over like a dark cloud, about to turn China into a mess. Korea further away, the Northeast closer, and even closer, North China after the Lugouqiao Incident, are examples.

"Even if it's too late, we have to do it this way... Mencius said: 'If a disease of seven years is to be cured with artemisia of three years, unless it is accumulated, it will never be obtained in a lifetime.' You must know that the stages of culture must naturally be taken step by step. You can only choose to take the fastest path, but you cannot distort, skip, or cross. Little Japan has made this mistake of distortion and crossing. Do you think that a savage nation, bare-chested, with a brain full of cannibalistic ideas, can be considered a civilized nation just by putting on a Western-style tuxedo? Should they invade others?..."

"Practicing martial arts is also the same: you must start from the basics, first strengthen your internal organs before you can train your muscles and skin. According to you saying 'it's too late,' it seems that you should first learn a few killer moves... Of course, you can learn them successfully; once you fight, you may be able to knock someone down immediately, but your own internal organs will also be greatly injured, even fatally. In case you can't knock someone down with one blow, it will be even worse..."

"Shh!"...

While Shouyi was driving and talking, he was also paying attention to the situation along the road. At this time, he suddenly heard a sharp whistle from the roadside, knowing that it was the signal of his own people, and knowing that he was close to Hongzhen, he slowed down the speed of the car, and also made a "shh" sound to release the signal.

As soon as this signal was released, he immediately heard "shh... shh..." two responses not far ahead. This response indicates that he has reached the warning range. Shouyi heard this signal and immediately braked the car; because the area was deserted and it was late, there were no pedestrians coming and going, so he turned the car around on the road and parked it by the roadside. Just as he was about to greet Tsurumi to get out of the car, he suddenly caught a glimpse of shadows shaking under the eaves in front.

### Ibsen's Debut Work

— Li Shimin

Henrik Ibsen started working as an apprentice in a pharmacy at the age of fourteen. In 1848, Europe was in the midst of a surge of revolutionary thought, and the young Ibsen, only twenty years old, admired this kind of thinking very much. In order to praise the revolution, he decided to engage in creation. Therefore, every night he wrote manuscripts by candlelight until late at night before stopping writing. After two years of work, he completed his debut three-act tragic poem—"Catilina." In 1851, with a heart to become an artist, he left the life of a ten-year ink slave and stepped out of the pharmacy. After that, he first entrusted the book "Catilina" to a friend to publish anonymously at his own expense. But after publication, only more than thirty copies were sold.

### Random Talk in Solitude

— Wang Cong

When I was a child, when I was still in elementary school.

Quite by chance, I came across two lines of poetry in the Investiture of the Gods. These fourteen characters were deeply imprinted in my mind. The poem says: "I originally entrusted my heart to the bright moon, who knew the bright moon would shine on the gutter."

To this day, I still can't remember what kind of remarkable sorrow I had at the time? At a young age, I was deeply aware of the vicissitudes of human life.

I think those who love to think deeply must be sentimental. And in this bizarre human world, there are many problems that cannot be solved, nor need to be solved.

Ugly reality cannot accommodate solemn thoughts; how far the life of carnal desire throws the activities of the soul.

The childhood living environment can often give people different imaginations. For example, Mussolini was the son of a blacksmith. The blacksmith's workshop became his imagination. He once said to Ludwig: "The anvil and fire inspired me with a passion to cast things according to my own will."

I think the reason why this demon king is a demon king may be because he lacks philosophical concepts like Kant to guide his passion.

Passion is like fire, it should be used properly.

Don't reject words because of the person.

The Devil also has a rather moving story:

"One night, the old man was burning in the fire, and he saw a family enjoying a rich dinner peacefully in the garden of a hotel by Lake Geneva. He was surprised that he actually had a begging thought, and resolutely ran away, although he didn't have a penny at the time. At this time, he wrote a very moving letter to his friend: "I have given up all memories, even ideals."

Later, recalling the past, he looked at the distance sadly, and he said to a foreign friend: "Hunger is a good teacher, almost as good as an enemy... As a socialist, the future is open to me. Prison is a good school, prison is like the sea. People can learn patience at sea."

So he listed the eleven prisons he had entered in four countries, and called them a rare place to exercise his body.

What I am talking about naturally refers to the story before Mussolini's thoughts had not yet fallen, before he had not yet thrown himself into Faust's embrace.

Free Talk

### Chaplin's Satire

— Xu Dan

Chaplin's new film "Monsieur Verdoux" has recently been released in the United States, and will probably be shipped to China soon. "Reader's Digest" issue 151 has a detailed introduction to this film. In this film, Chaplin reversed his past comedic style, but paid special attention to the portrayal of characters' personalities and tried his best to emphasize satirical scenes of reality. What I am interested in in "Monsieur Verdoux" is because I was reminded of the famous "Shen Wuye" in the "Man-Demon Case" from Chaplin's satire.

What kind of person is Monsieur Verdoux?

According to the introduction of "Reader's Digest," we can know that he is a middle-aged French bank clerk who lost his job in an economic depression. He loves his wife and children very much, but in an economically paralyzed state, he cannot find a job to ensure their safety, so he found a way out for himself: to be a murderer. The targets of his sacrifice are foolish and wealthy women. His work is not easy, he pursues them, marries them, and then murders them. Although this kind of work is disgusting, he also gets some pleasure from it. Every time he completes a "money-making" job, he returns to his lovely home to relax until the bread problem forces him to come out and do the killing again.

This is a person who has not completely lost his "humanity," very much like Balzac's great thief "Vautrin." The latter did not want to do the crime of murder, but in a society like Paris where "those who steal a country become nobles, those who steal a hook are punished," he finally took theft as his lifelong career.

A kind person, a strong person, a person who has not completely lost his mind, when he discovers the unreasonableness of the money-worshiping society, wants to survive, but does not know how to get bread; has hatred, but cannot see the target of hatred, and does not know how to vent his anger. In this situation, he may naturally attack the weak or the foolish. Is Monsieur Verdoux Chaplin's fantasy character? No, although Chaplin exaggerated Monsieur Verdoux's personality, there is still a realistic basis after all, otherwise, the starting point of this satirical film would be too illusory, what is there to talk about satire?

Not long ago, the Associated Press of America reported a dramatic murder news, in which the behavior of the protagonist, brewer Harris, had the style of Monsieur Verdoux. Harris killed another girl, Pansy, in a chance encounter because his girlfriend broke the appointment. Indeed, he had his motive for revenge, but he actually chose an innocent victim to start with, which was really beyond the expectations of ordinary people.

If you don't see the target clearly and take revenge randomly, you may inevitably make a big joke. Monsieur Verdoux's pity is not in his revenge doctrine, but in the fact that he became a "murderer" but still tried his best to maintain his "conscience."

"Shen Wuye" may also be a revenge doctrine. She was first a concubine of a certain celebrity, then abandoned, and then appeared in men's clothing, and also collected many concubines of wealthy families. It seems that how others played with her at the beginning, now she also plays with them.

This is just my speculation, "Shen Wuye" may not be willing to admit it, but after reading the review of Chaplin's film in "Reader's Digest," I naturally had this association.

### What's It To You?

Girl A: I have a toothache.

Girl B: If I were you, I would definitely find a dentist to pull it out.

Girl A: If this were your tooth, I would have pulled it out long ago.

### Telephone Operator

Man A: Your girlfriend must have been a telephone operator before.

Man B: How do you know?

Man A: You say ten sentences and she won't answer you ten sentences.

### Reading Mr. Feng Zikai's "Remembering Master Taixu"

— Huang Hua

Before Master Taixu passed away, society can be said to have mixed praise and criticism for him; countless people worshiped him wholeheartedly; but there were also many who misunderstood him, suspected him, and even slandered him and framed him; the author is one of those who once misunderstood him. I remember around the tenth year of the Republic of China, when I was the chief writer at the Shibao Hall hosted by Mr. Di Chuqing, the senior poet Mr. Chen Ziyan once included several of my five-character poems in his book "Zunzhaishi Poetry Talk" and published them in the Shibao's supplementary literary weekly. Later, the Haichaoyin magazine hosted by Master Taixu reprinted these poems. I was very unhappy when I saw this issue of Haichaoyin, and wrote two sentences on its cover, saying: How can the mouthpiece of a political monk reprint my poems? From this point, you can imagine my concept of Master Taixu at that time.

In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Master Taixu's chariot was in the lower courtyard of a certain temple in Shanghai. A Buddhist friend invited me to see him together. At that time, my concept of Master Taixu had gradually changed, because I had corresponded with him once and found him to be kind and amiable. But I still said to that friend: Is Master Taixu like ordinary old masters, wanting people to kowtow and worship? He said, no! no! Master Taixu is very easy-going. So I went with him, and after meeting him, my feelings can be said to be the same as those of Mr. Feng Zikai. From then on, I followed Master Taixu for more than twenty years, until he passed away.

Master Taixu's wisdom is truly unparalleled in the world. He is proficient in both worldly and otherworldly methods. No matter what question you ask, he has an appropriate answer. No matter what you do, he has careful planning.

Master Taixu is the culmination of Buddhist studies. His attainments are above Zhizhen Fazang, and his theories are more complete than theirs. He is indeed the one who understands Buddhism most correctly and obtains the true essence of Buddhism.

Master Taixu's compassion is also unprecedented. He can be said to be the embodiment of causeless compassion, all of which is compassion, like fire is all heat. The great Buddhism takes great compassion to save the world as its foundation. When it comes to saving the world, it cannot be isolated from the world. If you leave the world, it is like leaving the well to save the people inside the well. How can you save them? Master Taixu's involvement in politics and society is the manifestation of his great compassion. It is a pity that there are too many shallow-minded people in society.

Mr. Feng said, "How could Chongde produce such a person?" Let me say further: How could the modern world—especially China—produce such a person?

Recently, I have a poem "Reading Master Taixu's Posthumous Poems," which is now attached here for Mr. Feng and the general readers to give their opinions: "Compassion and wisdom are empty for thousands of years, a great master of humans and gods, practicing the Bodhisattva path, until the time of Nirvana, how eager is the heart to protect the teachings, how can the world know the lonely mind, come again and leave a great wish, wiping away tears to read the posthumous poems."

### Two Chapters of Reminiscence

— Ning Po

In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Russo-Japanese War broke out in Chinese territory. Russia was defeated, and after the war ended, Japan verbally said that it would withdraw its troops, but the army was still stationed all over Manchuria and had no intention of retreating. At that time, Mr. Zhao Erxun was the General of Shengjing. Only Japanese Prime Minister Saionji came to Shenyang to inspect. Zhao knew that the Japanese warlords and political leaders had different opinions, and also knew that Saionji had an authoritative position as a "gentle faction." So he deliberately held a celebration and wrote two poems to him. The last two sentences of the first poem: "Old and rustic, I feel sad and desperate, I try to make a plan before you with borrowed chopsticks." The last sentence of the next poem: "Thousands of chapters are connected, the day will tilt, when a basket of flood is about to burst: let's hold hands and look from a high place on the Heqiao, the divine state is close at hand, don't be different." Saionji was moved by the poem, so he agreed to fulfill the promise of withdrawing troops. Thus, "poetry can defeat the enemy," making it a good story of General Zhao's diplomacy.

Gao Mingqu Danian of Guangdong, with the ambition of restoring the Ming Dynasty, led his troops to fight against the Qing soldiers. He was defeated and died in the chaotic army. Before his death, he said to his family: "I went out to fight against the enemy, and unfortunately, I died and my body was exposed in the battlefield, then bury me on the south side of Nanpeng Mountain, and do not offer sacrifices in spring and autumn, so as not to be known by foreign races, so as to calm my grave." After the war, his family picked up his remains and buried them on the sunny side of the mountain. Throughout the Qing Dynasty, Qu's tomb was desolate and lonely, and no grass grew. After the Xinhai Revolution, after the restoration of the old things, the green grass in front of the tomb flourished, and later generations called it the "unconquered Qing" tomb. Qu had five poems of mourning the past in Yamen during his lifetime, and one of them is recorded here: "Regret the past dynasty's affairs, I came to the riverside, the universe has a pulse, the country has three ministers, passionate loyalist's ambition, caring for the lord, until now the stones on the cliff, the wind and rain wash away the barbarian dust." Using national heroes to sing about national heroes, it is appropriate that the words are passionate and慷慨.

### A Record of Listening to Piano Music at the Lyceum Theatre

— Ni Qiuping

On the 25th, at the Lyceum Theatre's third municipal symphony concert, I found the Mozart Violin Concerto in A major to be very satisfying.

The soloist for this piece was the principal violinist, Riskin. His technique with both hands was excellent. His left-hand vibrato and trills were both beautiful, and his shifts were quite accurate. His right-hand bowing was very clean; the staccato notes, both up-bow and down-bow, were particularly outstanding. The up-bow was definitely a flying staccato, and the down-bow used some unknown method, with very precise speed. This type of bowing is usually considered a difficult path by violinists, and he played it with such success, making it truly commendable. The only drawback was the volume, which was too weak. However, with Professor Foa acting as conductor and Ma Sihong away on a foreign visit, soloists are scarce. Mr. Riskin's solo was indeed sufficient to replace them.

The cadenza in this concerto was composed by Professor Wittenberg. He is a famous German violinist who once played with the renowned pianist Schnabel in Europe. Due to the persecution of Jews in Germany, he wandered to Shanghai. Here, I truly lament the misfortune of this musician.

The municipal orchestra knows that audiences enjoy solos, so in the next performance, they will also present a cello solo by Dukson, along with other symphonies, which is of course something everyone will be very happy to know.

### How to Improve Traffic

— Ning Shen

The authorities have put in painstaking efforts to improve traffic issues, but the traffic congestion situation has not seen much improvement. Now the authorities are again starting to improve traffic. Therefore, I offer a few small opinions on this issue, which are described as follows: (1) The traffic police's directing seems to still follow the legacy of the British concession era. They must wait for the vehicles on the longitudinal roads to finish passing, and even wait for vehicles coming from afar to pass, before releasing the vehicles on the transverse roads. As a result, the waiting vehicles gather more and more. Once released, they are bound to compete and rush forward, making traffic even more chaotic, worse, and more difficult to control. This situation also exists in Calcutta, India, under British rule. Therefore, the training of traffic police should be thoroughly reformed, and traffic direction should prioritize efficiency.

(2) Restricting non-motorized vehicles on roads with heavier motorized vehicle traffic may not be necessary. If so, it will inevitably make the traffic on another road parallel to this road even more congested. The traffic on Jiujiang Road after Nanjing Road banned non-motorized vehicles can serve as an example. Therefore, roads with heavier motorized vehicle traffic can follow the Nanjing method and divide the lanes for motorized and non-motorized vehicles separately.

### Introducing "The Secret Agent"

— Fang

"The Secret Agent," which premiered at the Jinmen Grand Theater, is a historical film of the Polish Restoration Movement produced by the Soviet Ukrainian film factory. A characteristic of this kind of restoration struggle is underground activity. Therefore, this film also uses underground heroes engaged in secret activities as the main line of the performance, unfolding an epic of arduous struggle against the enemy and for the restoration of the country. The lead actor, Soviet famous actor Demohovski, played seven roles in the entire play. The development of the play is always exciting and tense.

### Dangerous City

— Qin Shouou

Hearing the words "Jincheng River," the man seemed to wake up slightly, and like a startled wild animal, he looked around anxiously. Suddenly, he burst into loud cries.

"Ah! Jincheng River, Jincheng River! Coming out of Changsha, it cost me more than twenty silver bars to get to Jincheng River. But," he suddenly raised his head, stamped his foot and shouted, "These bastards! They set fire in the middle of the night, burning my wife and children to death, and all my luggage was burned. Their consciences are so dark! They only wanted my gold, so they set the fire! Now, my family is destroyed, what's the use of gold? I'm going to throw it away! I'm going to throw it away…"

Saying this, he turned around and ran wildly eastward as if flying. Zhu Zhaonian wanted to stop him, but was too late.

He stared blankly at the back of the madman, and for a long time, he did not have the courage to go into the town again. On such a ruin, wouldn't trying to find a ride be like dreaming? But he saw two or three locomotives and a dozen freight cars wiggling on the railway line over there, so he aroused some hope again. He thought that this crowded and slow railway that everyone dared not try, might still be available for his own use today.

Stepping on the ashes all over the ground, Lao Zhu quickly walked to the old site of the former train station. – That was relatively easy to recognize, because the terrain was relatively high, and there were still some rubble to be found. On these broken rubbles, countless disaster victims who survived the disaster, and thousands of ragged wounded soldiers, were crowded like maggots; all kinds of debris and tattered clothes were scattered around the crowd, and a pungent stench could be smelled from afar. Some people were already sick and were lying on the ground, emitting bursts of piercing groans.

"Isn't this hell?" Lao Zhu thought in his heart, and his pace began to slow down.

Now, he could still see the scenes on the wiggling trains; the rooftops, inside the awnings, and on the steps were all full of people. Needless to say, the most unexpected thing for him was that some people were actually using wooden boards to build on the axles under the carriages, and lying flat there. Fortunately, the speed of the car was slower than a person's walking. If it were slightly faster, none of these people would be able to live.

On the dark brown track, there was also an unprecedented spectacle. All kinds of strange things were thrown there, among which the most were piles of reddish-yellow human feces; it no longer looked like a railway track, but like a garbage dump in a big city.

In fact, the train was not really moving forward. It rolled for a while like a cow, and then suddenly rolled back. The station and car staff were so chaotic that they all looked like newbies who just started working on the first day. Scolding and fighting were constantly being staged.

Zhu Zhaonian was stunned by this strange phenomenon in front of him, and for a quarter of an hour, he couldn't decide what he would do. He felt very empty in his heart, and a kind of negative thought that he had never had before suddenly penetrated his brain, and he even wanted to find a place like Peach Blossom Spring immediately, just to hide himself.
