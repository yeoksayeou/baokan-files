### Prospects for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference

The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to open today in London. The convening of this conference follows closely after the conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly, at a time when the European continent is turbulent and restless, and is of concern to peace-loving people around the world. The Foreign Ministers Conference originated from the Potsdam Agreement. Since the end of the war, the meeting held this time in London is the seventh. In the past six Foreign Ministers Conferences, the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement seems to have not been fully implemented, and often ad hoc measures were taken due to time and place. For example, in the Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow, only the three major powers participated, and China and France were absent. Later, in the meeting held in Paris, only the four major powers participated. Only the first Foreign Ministers Conference held in London was a Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Looking at the past achievements, the achievements of the Foreign Ministers Conferences held in the past are not as good as generally expected. The exchange of opinions between the great powers has turned the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference into an excellent propaganda arena for different opinions. Under this meaning of somewhat a war of nerves, the Foreign Ministers Conference seems to have somewhat lost its original meaning.

This Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference convened in London is a continuation of the two Foreign Ministers Conferences held in Paris and the Foreign Ministers Conferences held in New York and Moscow. Although the two Foreign Ministers Conferences convened in Paris established the Five-Nation Treaty and convened the Paris Peace Conference, they failed to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues. At the Fifth Foreign Ministers Conference held in New York, the German and Austrian issues were still shelved and no achievements were made. At the Sixth Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow, opinions became more divergent, and no concrete agreement was reached on practical German issues. Therefore, the main topics of this Foreign Ministers Conference convened in London are still the German and Austrian issues: the independence of Austria and the peace treaty with Germany. On the issue of the peace treaty with Germany, it also includes the issue of reparations, how to revive the German economy, and the issue of the German political organization. If these specific issues cannot be agreed upon, then the drafting of the peace treaty with Germany is simply a dream.

The issue of reparations for Germany is closely related to the issue of Germany's economic recovery. The Soviet Union wants to obtain 10 billion US dollars in compensation from Germany and is willing to use industrial production and machinery as collateral. It is questionable whether this is enough to affect Germany's economic recovery. This is also why the four powers have not been able to reach an agreement. The United Kingdom and the United States believe that although the Allied countries can demand reparations from Germany, the German people must first be able to maintain their own lives and no longer rely on foreign aid. If they are unwilling to wait for Germany's economic recovery and forcibly demand reparations, it is tantamount to demanding reparations from another Allied country. In terms of Germany's political organization, the United Kingdom and the United States advocate adopting a federal system, while the Soviet Union advocates centralized power. On these issues, there is a great difference between the views of the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union. Unless one party does not adhere to its preconceived notions and has a spirit of compromise, it seems ideal to want to reach an agreement.

Not to mention anything else, when the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference had not yet opened in London, the reports from the news agencies already had a strong pessimistic color. Even the agenda of the conference failed to reach an agreement. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the one hand, and the Soviet Union on the other, will each put forward their own agendas. On the eve of the convening of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, also severely criticized Western countries at the Allied Control Council meeting. Based on all of this, the future of the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference does not seem optimistic. If this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference fails to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues, then the iron curtain in Eastern Europe will inevitably become a new Great Wall below, and the so-called two worlds will become more obvious and real. In fact, the German people have also prepared for this final split. According to reports, German authorities estimate that if the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference fails and the Soviet Union drops the iron curtain, 2 million to 3 million refugees will flow from the Soviet military-occupied zone to the British and American military-occupied zones. The Soviet military-occupied zone and the British and American military-occupied zones are currently strengthening border defenses. It can be seen that if this Foreign Ministers Conference fails to achieve anything, it will inevitably have a serious impact on the situation in Europe thereafter. What we cannot forget is that in France and Italy, the recent surging labor strikes and riots may also have their reaction.

Indeed, as U.S. representative Dulles said at this London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, this is truly a time for decision, a time of decisive action. What decisions will be made in London, we can only see the development of the situation thereafter. Judging from past experience, whenever a decision needs to be made, the Soviet Union may slightly change its heart, or rather, the Soviet Union may not insist too much on its views, so as to delay, and therefore, some kind of agreement may be reached. Therefore, the success or failure of this London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference hinges on Molotov alone. However, the Soviet Union's basic position remains unchanged. Temporary delays may be one of the means to achieve its goals. On the eve of his attending the Foreign Ministers Conference in London, at a meeting of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall frankly pointed out the Soviet Union's intentions and finally mentioned his attitude towards attending this Foreign Ministers Conference. Secretary Marshall said: "No matter how others provoke me, I will always try to avoid making statements for propaganda purposes. My purpose is to concentrate on finding a basis for an agreement to end the current deadlock and accelerate the advent of a new era of peace." Although this may be a kind of diplomatic rhetoric for diplomats, we hope that this Foreign Ministers Conference can truly find a basis for an agreement under the reefs, so that the current deadlock can be ended. The main topic is still the German and Austrian issues: the independence of Austria and the peace treaty with Germany.

### Admiral Towers Returns to America by Ship: He Completed the Yellow River Blocking Project; He Dedicated Half His Life to China

[Our Own Report] The world-renowned "Yellow River Blocking" project, whose designer and supervisor, Chief Engineer Towers (seen in the country), after completing the greatest masterpiece of his life in the past year and ten months, will leave China on the "General Gordon" on the 26th (tomorrow) to return to his hometown - California, USA. Although Mr. Towers is already sixty-seven years old, his energy is still like that of a young man in his twenties. He has never been tired of hydraulic engineering, which he has always loved in his life. He does not want to retire yet. This time he is only going back to visit his family. On the one hand, we want to thank Mr. Towers for his great contribution to China, and on the other hand, we still hope that he will return to China, where he has lived for twenty years, because China needs talents like Mr. Towers so urgently in the future.

Mr. Towers first came to China in 1919, when he was responsible for the field investigation of the Canal Conservancy Commission. Until 1938, his work was interrupted due to the impact of the war. In those nineteen years, Mr. Towers traveled through most of China, built many roads, organized engineering equipment for the Red Cross and other relief agencies, and overcame countless floods of the Yellow River.

In December 1945, Mr. Towers came to China again in the name of Chief Engineer of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and continued to use his greatest strength to fight against the Yellow River breach. Regardless of the complexity of the political situation, and unafraid of repeated failures, he used the financial and material assistance provided by UNRRA, led 350,000 old and brave workers, and rushed to the 5,000-foot breach at Huayuankou, Henan. Finally, after spending 3.8 million man-days, 5,000 tons of UNRRA flour, 2.75 million cubic meters of earthwork, 43 million catties of sorghum stalks, 150 million catties of willow branches, 60 tons of white lead wire, 1,000 tons of native hemp rope, 2.5 million bags of UNRRA sand, 150,000 cubic meters of stone, and various machines supplied by UNRRA, this 5,000-foot breach was completely filled. And the greatest strength was the perseverance of Engineer Towers, as well as UNRRA, the Executive Yuan, our government, and the hard-working workers.

Today, two million mu of fertile land in the Yellow River basin have been reborn, and China can obtain an additional two million tons of food each year. More importantly, millions of compatriots in the flooded area will no longer be displaced. Mr. Towers' contribution this time will make us deeply admire him, and his enthusiasm for loving China will especially make us eternally grateful. We pay our respects to him and wish him a smooth journey!

### Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, Li Bojin: Full Text of the Judgment Reason (Part 2)

And Chen Jianxin's confession after being arrested also detailed that the New Tide Society was established in the first half of the 34th year of the Republic of China and was invited to participate. Its organization had no fixed form and was increased or decreased according to needs. It had a president, Chen Jianjin, who also served as liaison, Huang Shimin as accountant, and Kuang Bojin as academic publication. Yu Zisan was responsible for liaison at Hangzhou Hui School. The distribution of other members: Peng Changhu in Nanjing, Li Zhiyan, Huang Shimin, Chen Jianxin, Xue Ximeng in Shanghai, Wang Xia and Zhao Zhikang in Taiwan, Xiang Xiewu in Wuxi, He Dakan in Changzhou, Liu Yifang in Wuxing, etc. His record of conversation on October 28 of this year:

Record of Conversation with Chen Jianxin

"Question" When did your thinking begin to lean to the left? "Answer" When I was a freshman in the Department of Agricultural Economics, I was influenced and my thinking turned to the left. "Question" What is the position and purpose of the New Tide Society? "Answer" To promote democracy and study agricultural academics. "Question" Then are all the activities of the New Tide Society concentrated on politics? "Answer" This is because some people in our organization are interested in politics. "Question" If you are interested in politics, why not be objective and adopt materials from all aspects, but specialize in collecting left-wing theoretical materials? "Answer" It is also because young people feel depressed now. "Question" Are your current activities, such as spreading reactionary poison and controlling student union representatives, completely consistent with the purpose of your New Tide Society? [Answer] This is indeed wrong. Our actions have caused some damage to the country and the nation. "Question" Now the country needs stability and society needs construction. You, as college students who are the backbone of the country, are actually heading down the path of destruction. You have received the education of the Three Principles of the People and are cultivated with public funds from the government. Are you worthy of the country? "Answer" We are indeed unworthy of the country. "Question" Since the position of the New Tide Society is incorrect and reactionary, which party's leadership did all its past activities accept? "Answer" The various activities of the New Tide Society seem to be influenced by the Communist Party invisibly, and may also turn to the Communist Party in the future. "Question" This cannot be erased with such abstract statements. Political activity is an expression of action and is by no means empty imagination. Your activities are invisibly directed by reactionary parties. Please tell us frankly. "Answer" We really have no party ties, but our activities and forms are indeed completely similar to the Communist Party. "Question" If the New Tide Society is a normal social group, why do you take the form of secret activities, and why do you have to worry about security in your announcements? "Answer" Because we ourselves have a kind of fear invisibly. The books we read are mostly left-wing. Our various activities are indeed similar to the Communist Party, so it is no wonder that it will arouse your suspicion.

Chen Jianxin wrote a letter of repentance on October 27 of this year, stating that Chen Jianxin came to Hangzhou and was banned, and felt that his previous behavior was uncontrolled and his thinking was wrong. From now on, he is willing to reform himself, work for the country, and seek glory for the nation.

Record of Conversation with Huang Shimin

Also, Huang Shimin's record of conversation on October 29 of this year: "Question" What is the purpose of the New Tide Society? "Answer" The purpose of the New Tide Society is to discuss academic issues with each other internally and promote democracy externally. "Question" What movements have you had? "Answer" We participated in the Minming Incident, which was a student movement in Kunming. "Question" What are the members of the New Tide Society like? "Question" Most of them sympathize with the Communist Party.

Record of Conversation with Li Bojin

Li Bojin's record of conversation on October 28 of this year: "Question" Who is the person in charge of the New Tide Society? "Answer" It is inconvenient for me to say. I don't want to implicate other classmates. "Question" Was participation in the New Tide Society proposed and passed through a meeting, or in other ways? After considering for a long time, then "Answer" Please don't press me too hard, etc. Although the words are evasive, the content is consistent with what Yu Zisan said.

Correspondence between members in various places

Moreover, Wang Xia, a member of the Taiwan branch of the society, wrote to Chen Jianxin on September 12 of this year, stating: As for the organizational issue, I think your decision is very perfect and does not need to be changed. You must be responsible for the contact. Shanghai is the center of friends' coming and going, and it is also very close to Hangzhou. Friends passing through Shanghai must report here. As for the contact, I will suggest some more opinions. I hope to write a simple report on the recent situation, occupation, residence, and mailing address of the members and send it to each friend. Because in my feeling, now the communication between friends is only with Changhu, Shimin, you, and Zisan, (omitted) but at the very least, if I have free time, I can open the mailing list and talk to each friend in a few words to increase the contact between each other. At the same time, I don't know how many new members have joined, and it seems that a simple introduction is also needed. The monthly fund is not restricted by domestic remittance, of course, there is no problem in paying it monthly. We here may be an exception, because we can only remit money to the mainland once. No matter how much you have, you can't remit it a second time within this month after one remittance. Therefore, we here have to do it this way: remit it once every three or four months, (omitted). Peng Changhu wrote to Chen Jianxin on September 11, stating: I feel that compared with the Scientific Age Society, my view of the New Society is that its nature is just as I thought, of course it cannot act at present, and it is not yet time to act, but its nature is still to act. The purpose of all work is still to promote action. (omitted) The development I am talking about is social development. Under the topic of rural areas, more friends can be absorbed, rather than the development of work. If there is no fixed goal and center, the development of the society will be very difficult, (omitted). Peng Changhu wrote to Chen Jianxin on September 30, stating: I don't have much disagreement with the assignment of personnel and forced reading, etc. What I want to ask you is another question, what do you think the society should do, that is, what should the purpose and work of the society be? My question may seem redundant, but it is actually very important. Our society is undoubtedly a group that promotes democratic movement, (omitted) Ximeng said that he does not agree with the method of reading and reporting because of safety reasons. I think this is probably not very convenient for you. People who report can write their addresses, (omitted). According to the contents of these letters, the New Tide Society is indeed engaged in secret work and is an external organization of the Communist Party, which is even more obvious.

### Four Powers Discuss Treaty With Germany And Austria: Foreign Ministers Meeting Opens Today; U.S. Willing To Strive To Avoid East-West Split

[Our Own Report] London, 24th (broadcast): French Foreign Minister Bidault arrived in the United Kingdom at 4:20 pm today and landed at Southampton Airport. Also arriving were Foreign Secretary Mieuville and Chief Economic Advisor Alphand. French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gérald, arrived here yesterday.

[Our Own Report] London, 24th (broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin visited Prime Minister Attlee at 10 Downing Street this afternoon for an hour of talks. According to well-informed sources, the two leaders discussed making a final decision on the position that the United Kingdom will take at the Foreign Ministers Meeting. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are scheduled to visit Attlee tonight, and the French Foreign Minister is scheduled to visit tonight or tomorrow morning. This is a necessary diplomatic courtesy.

[United Press London, 24th] About 500 secretaries and experts from the four-power foreign ministers' delegations were busy with final arrangements today in order to open the foreign ministers' meeting here tomorrow. This meeting may be the last effort for the four countries to unanimously discuss the Treaty With Germany And Austria. After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived here by plane yesterday, the Soviet Embassy announced that Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky would be the deputy representative to assist Mr. Molotov in the discussion. Mr. Vyshinsky will come here as soon as the UN General Assembly mission is completed. Other representatives in the Soviet delegation include the commander of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, Zarubin, and the Soviet representative to the Foreign Ministers Meeting, Smirnov.

[Reuters London, 24th] According to a Berlin report, Molotov said when he left Berlin for England yesterday that the Soviet Union has not given up hope of resolving the differences of opinion between the East and West on the German and Austrian issues through compromise.

[Associated Press London, 24th] Authoritative sources have learned: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall is firmly opposed to any proposal to sign a separate treaty with Germany, even if the four foreign ministers' meeting fails to reach an agreement again. According to officials close to Marshall, the proposal that Western countries should draft a treaty with Germany without the participation of the Soviet Union is close to fantasy. This proposal ignores the facts and is inconsistent with the basic daily goals of U.S. policy. A separate peace with Germany will permanently split Europe, and U.S. policy should ultimately lead to the reunification of Europe to restore its centuries-old appearance.

[Our Own Report] New York, 24th (broadcast): Washington report, U.S. Senate President Vandenberg left his seat as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee today and first began debating the emergency aid to Italy, Austria, and Greece, arguing that Congress should quickly approve the $795 million emergency appropriation to prevent the continued spread of communism. He said that in the United Nations organization, the new aggressive forces are using veto power to obstruct matters and force their attached countries to follow suit. In Europe, a minority of countries are creating chaos through strikes and other improper activities in order to promote the rise of communism.

Vandenberg said: The Soviet Union is working hard to make the U.S. aid to Europe plan fail. The U.S. must catch up quickly in order to stabilize Europe so that the "final conflict" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will not really happen. Mr. Vandenberg urged to accelerate the passage of the president's aid to Europe plan, but he expressed his regret that the president mixed the prevention of inflation with aid to Europe, believing that this would cause "wrong reactions" among the people.

### Italy Prepares To Form Coalition Cabinet: Two Moderate Left-Wing Parties Express Willingness To Cooperate; Italian Republican Left-Wing Party Expresses Willingness To Cooperate

[United Press Rome, 23rd] Two moderate left-wing parties hinted today that they may be immediately prepared to join Prime Minister Gasperi's Christian Democratic government. One of the two parties is the Republican Party led by Baziatis, which is small in scale but has hope, and the other is the Socialist Workers' Party led by Saragat, which broke away from the pro-communist Socialist Party led by Nanni eight months ago.

A joint communique from the two parties stated, "The two parties have decided to jointly review the conditions for shifting the government's axis to the left, guaranteeing democratic freedom, protecting public security and peace, prohibiting the resurrection of the fascist movement, and finding ways to solve the most urgent economic problems." Afterwards, Baziatis told the press that this move meant that we were prepared to start organizing a government to deal with the current difficult situation under the best conditions. Ba. proposed a conditional temporary cooperation plan until the elections in March next year to save the Christian Democratic Party from the anti-republican alliance and the critical situation.

[Associated Press Rome, 23rd] In its continued war against the government, the Italian Communist Party seems to have shifted its strategy from street bloodshed to demanding that Italian workers control Italian industry. Some sources said that the reason why the political riot ended was that it clearly could not force the government to resign, let alone create a large-scale massacre of workers to be used for propaganda.

### Japanese War Criminals Conspire To Seize Power: Allied Headquarters Discovers Huge Secret Organization

[Reuters Tokyo, 24th] Although Japan seems to be moving towards democracy on the surface, revolutionary forces are brewing to overthrow all the reforms made by the occupying authorities after the withdrawal of the occupying forces, and then seize power.

Important officials in MacArthur's headquarters have unanimously agreed that the existence of this dangerous force is more closely organized and widespread than the anti-British and American Black Dragon Society before the war. In fact, it is equivalent to a "secret government." It is believed that this organization reaches all parts of Japan, with an important figure in charge of everything, and a ten-member committee is responsible for promoting it. Most of these important personnel come from the purged military and chaebol classes, and their lower-level staff are all over the place. The central idea of ​​these people is extreme nationalism. However, it is a very difficult task to determine the names of these people, because their actions are secretive, and even people in the circle do not know who is responsible for them. However, it has been confirmed by MacArthur's headquarters that anyone who participates in this organization must take a blood oath, and other things are still under investigation. In the most recent weeks, two members of the organization have been arrested.

Nishio Said He Has Not Heard Of It

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 24th] According to a Reuters telegram, a widespread underground movement has recently occurred in Japan. The so-called "underground government" threatens Japan's reforms based on the occupation policy. It is generally believed that this underground organization was naturally formed by the chaos at the end of the war, and cannot be eliminated until economic stability is restored. Also, a certain official in Japan said that this "secret underground government" was organized by former Japanese army and navy officers. Chief Nishio said in this regard: I don't believe that there is a secret political organization in Japan. The government has not heard of this. It is undeniable that former army and navy officers are dissatisfied with the current state of political unrest, but there is currently no so-called secret government organization and strength. In the local black markets, there are those who have power and want to expand their scope by violence, but this does not have any political power.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 24th] It is expected that the Coal Mine Nationalization Bill will be successfully passed as planned, except for the major chaos that occurred in the meeting place again, and the first draft of the so-called "socialist policy" will be born, followed by the "socialization" bills for agriculture and various industries will also be submitted one after another to complete the legislative process.

### Matsui Ishigen Attempts To Shirk Responsibility

Defends The Nanjing Massacre Case Vigorously

Defendant Matsui defended the Nanjing Massacre, saying that it was far from the truth to say that the Japanese military staff headquarters ordered or condoned the massacre of Chinese people during the battle for Nanjing. I have always been known as a friend of China and have tried my best to advocate Sino-Japanese friendship. In 1937, I hurriedly took command and led the expeditionary force. Throughout the battles of Shanghai and Nanjing, I always instructed my subordinates to protect Chinese culture and history and encourage Chinese civilians to stay at home to avoid causing hostility towards Japan.

### Bank's Sale Under Fire for Alleged Fraud: Police Summon Lin Peizhong

[Our Reporter] The Bachuan Bank at 731 Nanjing East Road, currently undergoing liquidation, has recently been accused of fraud in connection with the sale of its assets. Zhou Xincheng, a local resident of Lane 516, No. 514 Xin Dagu Road, filed a complaint with the police, alleging that Lin Peizhong and Peng Qicao, the persons in charge of the bank's liquidation, colluded to commit fraud and conceal assets.

### Carpenter Secretly Reports Corruption in Receiving Property

Court Holds Preliminary Hearing for Two Customs Officials: Serious Circumstances Warrant Further Investigation

[Our Reporter] Ding Guitang, Deputy Inspector General of the Jianghai Customs; Liu Gongyun, former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau; Chen Shouzhi, Section Chief of the Nuclear Award Section; Wu Rencang, Director of the China Industrial and Mining Corporation; Lu Shishang, former Chief of the Material Group of the Third Front Army; Customs officials Huang Guojie, Lin Xuequ, He Hengshan; and Deputy Inspector General Qian Zongqi (a total of nine people) were secretly accused by Sun Zhuting, Zhu Shengyao, and Cao Haishen at the end of last year to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, alleging corruption in the receipt of a large quantity of pig iron and iron ingots stored in the warehouse of the enemy property Ruichang Hardware Store. After the case was referred to the local District Procuratorate for investigation, it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Ding, Liu, Chen, and Wu. Lu Shishang, being an active-duty military officer, should be investigated by a military organ. Huang, Lin, He, and Qian were prosecuted for embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the Second Criminal Division of the District Court by Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu. The defendants Qian Zongqi, who is now in Brazil, and He Hengshan, who is also not in Shanghai, did not appear in court. The informer Sun Zhuting first testified that he was a carpenter and had worked in the warehouse for over a week at the end of 1945, during which he learned of the corruption. There were a total of over 2,000 tons of pig iron, weighed by Lin Xuequ, but only 912.5 tons were reported on the inventory list. Lin Xuequ testified that although he weighed the pig iron, there were only 912.5 tons, of which 127 tons were wrapped in straw mats, each roll weighing 58 kilograms, totaling 2,195 rolls. The rest were in bulk. Huang Guojie testified that he handled the receipt of the materials on December 11, 1945, totaling 912.5 tons of pig iron and 408 iron pipes, and completed the inventory list on January 8, 1946, sending it to the Enemy Property Handling Bureau and the Third Front Army for signature.

The court ordered that the case was of great importance and required further investigation, adjourning the hearing to a later date. The two defendants were remanded in custody.

### Plotting Escape, Resorting to Arson at Reformatory: Four Women of Loose Morals Conclude Trial, Sentencing Scheduled

[Our Reporter] Dong Acui, Wang Jinxiang, and Wu Yueying, all women from Ningbo who had previously worked as unlicensed prostitutes, and Tang Xiaomei, who attempted suicide by drowning, were detained at the Shanghai Women's Reformatory at No. 602 Taixing Road after being arrested by the police. Due to their loose morals and unfamiliarity with reformatory life, they repeatedly attempted to escape, but to no avail. At 4:00 PM on the 28th of last month, Tang Xiaomei suddenly proposed setting fire to the reformatory in order to take advantage of the chaos to escape. Dong and the others applauded the suggestion, praising it as a "good idea."

After careful discussion, at 8:50 PM that evening, Wu Yueying secretly took tinder, straw mats, and other flammable materials into the matchbox storage room to start the fire. Dong Acui, Wang Jinxiang, and Tang Xiaomei stood guard outside. Soon, thick smoke filled the area. Dong and the others, seeing that the plan had succeeded, attempted to flee together. Fortunately, the fire was discovered early, and the reformatory staff bravely extinguished the blaze. Apart from a slightly burned empty matchbox, no major disaster occurred. Dong and the other four were apprehended and transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Dong and the others confessed to setting the fire. The District Procuratorate prosecuted them under Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The case was heard yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Eighth Criminal Division of the District Court by Judge Xie Zhiying. The complainant, Chen Nianci (reformatory administrator), did not appear and was represented by another administrator, Zhang Qingkun, who testified that he indeed saw the defendants starting the fire upstairs on the day in question. Two other women in the reformatory, Ding AE and Lin Cuiying, both testified that they witnessed Wu Yueying hiding the tinder at 7:45 PM. Defendant Dong Acui stated that she carried a bundle of grass paper and went upstairs with the other three defendants, where Wu Yueying started the fire. However, the other three defendants denied the above facts. The court ordered the conclusion of the debate in the case and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 1st of next month.

### English Princess's Wedding Photo: Features Barely Recognizable

·Arrived after multiple transmissions via international radio·

[Our Reporter] Princess Elizabeth of England married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten in London on the 20th of this month. On the 22nd, the Shanghai *North-China Daily News* featured a picture of them taken during the wedding ceremony. The caption indicated that it was a radiophoto from the Associated Press. This photograph aroused a great deal of interest. On the one hand, everyone was impressed by the speed of the transmission, but on the other hand, they felt that the result was not ideal, as the facial features of the two people in the image were so distorted that they were almost unrecognizable.

The reason for the blurriness of the photograph is that it was not transmitted directly from London to Shanghai, but from London to New York, from New York to San Francisco, and then from San Francisco to Shanghai. After so many transfers, differences had already emerged by the time it passed through San Francisco.

Old Equipment, Poor Results

How did the Associated Press obtain this photograph? In fact, the international radio station of the Ministry of Communications in the Sassoon House received this radiophoto. The international radio station contacted San Francisco on the night of the 20th. The weather conditions at the time were very suitable for transmitting radiophotos. When they inquired again at 5:53 AM on the 21st, the weather was still good. The first photograph was transmitted at this time, but it was extremely blurry. Therefore, they requested San Francisco to transmit it again, and the second photograph was received at 6:15 AM.

Wireless radiophoto transmission is not a new invention. During China's War of Resistance, Kunming had such equipment. The equipment currently at the international radio station was brought back from Kunming. Because the equipment is old, it was in the testing phase. The poor quality of the Princess of England's photo was mainly due to the old equipment. Recently, the international radio station has ordered a new set of equipment from the United States, which has arrived in the city. Once import procedures are completed, it can be installed, and the radiophoto business will officially open around the end of the year.

Equipped with Transmissions to America

The international radio station also has equipment that has not received attention and has therefore not been fully utilized. This equipment involves McCormick, the head of the *Chicago Tribune*. After McCormick's visit to China this time, he never expressed his views on China. However, McCormick did broadcast to the United States twice at the international radio station on the 14th and 20th of this month. McCormick used the international radio station's "Program Transmission Service" to broadcast to the United States from Shanghai. The broadcasts from Shanghai were relayed by RCA Wireless Radio Company in the United States to various broadcasting companies in the United States, and then distributed to radio stations nationwide, allowing the entire United States to listen.

This equipment existed before the war and was restored last year after the victory. However, to date, only a few foreign reporters have come to broadcast. The international radio station believes that government agencies such as the Central News Agency's International Propaganda Office could make greater use of this equipment as a tool for foreign propaganda.

[Our Reporter] The National Assembly regional elections began counting ballots yesterday at the Municipal Council. At 9:00 AM sharp, Mayor Wu personally presided over the opening ceremony of the ballot counting. The ceremony was simple and orderly. In his address, the Mayor said that the ballot counting was an important key to constitutional government, and that we should learn the new process of democratic politics, hoping that everyone would take the matter seriously. After the address, the ballot boxes were opened and counted under the supervision of the senators. In addition to the 45 administrators, 12 employees of the Civil Affairs Bureau were temporarily transferred to work in groups. With a full day of effort, a total of 130,474 ballots were counted, of which 940 were invalid. As of 6:30 PM, when the ballot counting ended, the candidates with more votes were as follows: Qian Dajun 938 votes, Pan Gongzhan 6,894 votes, Liu Weichi 9,360 votes, Fang Zhi 3,496 votes, Jin Zhenyu 1,087 votes, Jiang Huaisu 10,821 votes, Wang Zikui 13,730 votes, Mao Zifeng 1,117 votes, Chen Qitian 1,154 votes, Jin Houcheng 1,013 votes, Xie Qingbai 1,065 votes, Zheng Ziliang 993 votes, Jin Jiulin 4,491 votes, Du Yuesheng 15,211 votes, Gu Jinzao 4,033 votes, Xu Liang 4,318 votes, Lu Yinggeng 3,517 votes, Yin Zhiling 21,194 votes, Qian Xinzhi 10,623 votes. The number of ballots counted yesterday accounted for only one-seventh of all ballots, and the ballots counted were arbitrarily selected, possibly biased towards several districts. Therefore, the results obtained are not sufficient to represent the overall situation of the general election. Ballot counting will continue from this morning. Due to technical difficulties in the ballot counting, the current manpower is insufficient to cope with the situation. It has been decided to increase five groups from today, together with the original eight groups, for a total of thirteen groups for ballot counting.

### Newspaper Reporters as Spectators

[Our Reporter] The professional group elections began counting ballots at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday without any ceremony. Mayor Wu arrived at the venue around 9:00 AM and first instructed Chen Boliang, director of the ballot counting office, to read out the "Detailed Rules for Ballot Counting" and the "Criteria for Determining Invalid Ballots" to the 25 ballot counters. During the reading process, a representative of the department store workers' union presented a piece of paper requesting a title for the union's "inaugural issue of a special publication." The Mayor happily obliged. Then, the Mayor personally opened the ballot box of the fourth polling station of the labor union group with a key and removed the seals. The ballot counting work then began. The Mayor repeatedly instructed everyone to take the matter seriously and then left. The atmosphere inside the venue was solemn. The supervisory personnel did not all attend. Newspaper reporters and several candidates who came to the venue to observe were all barred from the second floor as spectators.

Hundred Ballots Stacked Like Banknotes

There were a total of 54 ballot boxes, all sealed horizontally and vertically. Due to manpower and time constraints yesterday, only a portion of the farmers' association, fishermen's association, labor union, and industrial and mining groups were opened. After the ballots were extracted, they were not read aloud. Instead, the ballot counters sorted them by the method of counting banknotes, stacking them in piles of 100. The supervisors then checked the total number. In the future, all ballots will be sent to Nanjing for national statistics, except for those from local groups. The opened ballots must still be sealed in boxes for six months for legal verification.

### Ballots with Simplified Characters or Homophones Not Deemed Invalid

Very few ballots were deemed invalid among those opened yesterday. Half of them were blank ballots. Others were region election ballots mistakenly cast in the occupational group ballot boxes, or ballots with erasures, which were invalidated according to law. As for ballots with candidate names written in simplified characters or homophones, they were not deemed invalid this time. The results of yesterday's ballot counting have not yet been fully tallied. Among those already tallied, Ye Xianggao topped the list with 35,170 votes in the labor union sector.

### Meeting to Review Technical Gains and Losses

[Our Reporter] The heads of the civil affairs sections of the city's district offices met yesterday to review the technical gains and losses of the electoral campaign. They all advocated that for the Legislative Yuan elections, national identification cards should be used instead of voter registration certificates to obtain ballots. If this cannot be done, they hope to reissue voter registration certificates to citizens. They also advocated that the voter registration list be revised based on the voters who voted in the National Assembly elections, and that the list be publicly announced in advance. Those who do not object within the deadline should be deemed to have waived their right to vote. Chen Minshu, head of the Regional Election Section, said that the implementation of this suggestion would have three major benefits: 1. the procedures would be simple, 2. there would be no duplication of voting rights, and 3. with national identification cards to claim voting rights, there would be no impersonation. However, there are currently two difficulties: first, how to ensure that national identification cards are widely obtained, and second, under the new method, regional voters and occupational group voters cannot be separated, which would cause administrative inconvenience. The above opinions will be compiled into recommendations and submitted to the central government for approval and implementation.

### Treatment Methods, Approaches, and Active Measures - Typographical Errors Are All Considered Invalid Votes

During yesterday's vote counting, a large number of invalid ballots were discovered. Besides blank ballots and altered ballots, the most common errors involved mistaking Fang Zhi (方治) for "Fang Zhi" (方治), "Fang Fa" (方法, meaning "method"), "Fang Hao" (方浩), and "Fang Huo" (方活). Secondly, there were errors where Pseudo-Fan Gongzhan (僞藩公展) was mistaken for "Fan Gongzhan" (藩公展) and "Fan Gongzhan" (藩公展), and Qian Xin Zhi's (錢新之) writing was mistaken for "Qian Yongming" (錢永銘). In addition, there were many invalid ballots selecting individuals who were not candidates. Among these, Chairman Chiang received a particularly notable number of votes, it is said.

### Xiang Sheng Taxi Company Car Encounters Robbery Again

Driver is Alert, Losses are Small

[Report from This Newspaper] At 11:25 PM on the 23rd, a person wearing a short black overcoat and yellow uniform went to the Sixth Branch of the Xiansheng Taxi Company on Xizang South Road to rent a car. Driver Du Meichang (杜美昌) was instructed to drive car number 20438 to transport the passenger. When the car reached the intersection of Fuxing Middle Road and Taoyuan Road, the passenger asked the driver to stop. Another person, wearing the same clothing as the first, jumped out from beside a nearby power line pole, boarded the car, and told Du to drive to Zhongshan Hospital near Fenglin Bridge. Du noticed that the two people were behaving strangely and became suspicious. He drove to the Xiansheng Fourteenth Branch on Lin Sen Middle Road near Shaanxi South Road, feigned a reason to get out of the car, and entrusted the eleven thousand yuan in cash and a wristwatch to the company for safekeeping before getting back in the car to drive. Unexpectedly, when the car reached Fuxing Middle Road via Shaanxi South Road, one passenger suddenly pulled out a pistol and threatened Du while the other passenger drove. When the car reached Taiyuan Road on Xujiahui Road, the area was deserted. They stopped the car and searched Du, only finding American dollars, a five-cent American coin, and a flashlight. The two became disappointed and drove to Yongnian Road, turning onto Zhongzheng South Second Road, attempting to rob passengers on passing pedicabs, but gave up due to the passengers not being wealthy. Later, they drove the car to near the Police Club on Shaoxing Road, intending to rob pedestrians, but were dissuaded by the other passenger, who told them not to act rashly, fearing military police ahead. They then drove the car back towards the Cathay Theatre, telling Du to drive. When they reached Chengdu Road, they threatened Du not to report the incident to the police before jumping out and fleeing without a trace. Du reported the incident to the New City Police Station, requesting an investigation.

### Police Chief Orders Investigation into Car Owner Who Intimidated Patrol Officer

[Report from This Newspaper] In the case of Xu Xinqin (徐心芹), an editor at the Central Daily News, suffering a broken arm when the taxi she was riding in was hit by license plate 13352, Zhao Chongshi (趙崇士), the owner of vehicle 13352, intimidated Patrol Officer Song (宋) from the Huangpu Branch who was dispatched to investigate the accident scene, saying loudly, "Commander Guan is my friend, Yu Shuping (兪叔平) is my student, and Zhang Shi (張師) is my old subordinate." When reporters inquired with Police Chief Yu Shuping, Yu firmly denied knowing Zhao Chongshi and said that it was clearly an act of deception and bragging. He had instructed the Huangpu Branch to investigate thoroughly. Yu also indicated that since the branch had already dispatched a patrol officer to investigate the scene of the accident, the branch would submit a report to the headquarters for further handling.

### Enhance the Self-Defense Awareness of the People of Jiangsu Province - Defend Greater Xuzhou - Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei Divided into Military Regions to Implement Military Measures

Xuzhou is the gateway to Jiangsu, the northern gate of the capital, and a strategic point on the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and 隴海 (Longhai) Railways. Its importance is inextricably linked to the safety of the lives and property of 30 million people in the 36 counties of northern Jiangsu and neighboring counties in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Today, all the people of Jiangsu must mobilize all manpower and material resources, with the spirit of sacrifice from the eight years of war, to defend Greater Xuzhou and achieve self-defense and the defense of our land.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, This Newspaper, 22nd] Chairman Wang Maogong (王懋功), who had just returned yesterday from Xuzhou after discussing suppression matters, received local and out-of-town reporters in the provincial capital on the 22nd. Because his remarks are aimed at awakening the awareness of the people of Jiangsu, the reporter has recorded the main points of Wang's conversation as follows:

Since returning from Xuzhou, I know that everyone is eager to know everything about Xuzhou. I will now explain in three points:

The military situation in northern Jiangsu: Since Liu Bocheng (劉伯誠) followed Chen Yi (陳毅) and Chen Geng (陳賡) into the Dabie Mountains, attempting to establish a base area to disrupt our military heartland, following the example of Sui Ning (睢寗), they have now reinforced their forces to seven columns, successively capturing Pei County, Xiao County, and Dangshan, and threatening Xuzhou. The situation is tense. Therefore, I made the trip to Xuzhou. Everyone should know that Xuzhou is the gateway to Jiangsu and the northern gate of the capital, with great control over the military situation in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. I went to Xuzhou and instructed the commissioners and county magistrates on the proper way to suppress the bandits. After staying in Xuzhou for a day, I can say that I am a little more at ease about Xuzhou. I discussed with Commander-in-Chief Gu (顧) to ensure that military and political efforts are coordinated and that the affected areas receive relief. For example, during the battle of Dangshan, all senior party and government officials in the city heroically sacrificed their lives, with only the county magistrate escaping. The self-defense forces also suffered heavy losses. All city defense works were completely destroyed. The tragic situation is beyond description. Xiao and Pei counties also fell into the hands of the bandits once, and all food and clothing were completely burned and destroyed. Therefore, all follow-up matters must be handled properly.

Regarding the defense of Xuzhou: Xuzhou is the northern gate of the capital and is related to the safety of 30 million people in the 36 counties of northern Jiangsu and the neighboring counties of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Therefore, it is extremely important to strengthen the defense of Xuzhou. Recently, with the return of Commander-in-Chief Gu, the people of Xuzhou have become more stable, and I believe that the fleeing bandits will suffer a crushing defeat. Recently, there are no traces of bandits within 100 li of Xuzhou. Our victory is certainly not in doubt. In less than two months, the bandits have twice raided, with forces of seven or eight columns each time, attempting to move around in northern Jiangsu. If the bandit Liu is not destroyed, we will continue to suffer. The best way to deal with this is to strengthen the defense of Xuzhou to consolidate the outskirts of the capital, protect northern Jiangsu, and establish a military center for Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Commander-in-Chief Gu and I both agree that this issue is extremely important. However, Xuzhou was occupied for eight years during the War of Resistance, and has been repeatedly harassed by communist bandits since the victory. The central government has taken into account the poverty of Xuzhou and has allocated 1.4 billion yuan to establish the defense of Xuzhou. In fact, the defense line of Xuzhou is as long as 140 li, requiring 20 billion yuan. After discussing with Commander-in-Chief Gu, he also confirmed that the people of Jiangsu are suffering, and plans to request the central government to allocate another 10 billion yuan, and to raise 20 billion yuan from the business community in Xuzhou. It has been agreed that the Huadong Coal Mining Company will donate 10 billion yuan. The price of flour will be increased by 20,000 yuan per bag, which will raise 45 billion yuan. Banks will donate 3 billion or 2 billion yuan, with the minimum being 1 billion yuan, totaling more than 30 billion yuan. Each bag of flour will be increased by 20,000 yuan, which will raise about 10 billion yuan. There are also goods stranded in Xuzhou, and discussions are underway with the railway bureau to handle them on behalf of the owners, which will also raise a sum of money. In order to raise funds, I asked for assistance from all sectors in Xuzhou and explained to the people of all sectors that I could take responsibility for requesting the central government to give Xuzhou supreme glory together with Commander Gu. What made me most grateful was that when the numbers were presented at the time, they were all happy to donate, which shows that they still have confidence in me and are fully aware of the importance of Xuzhou. I very much hope that our Jiangsu—especially Jiangnan—will emulate this spirit, and that the city defenses of the Yangtze River, the lake defenses of Taihu Lake, and the city defenses of various counties will be firmly established. For your own lives and property, when the communist bandits come, they will rob the assets of the rich, burn your land and houses, and even kill your lives. We have to do the math. For all of our lives and property, we should contribute a small part of our property. I hope you (referring to the reporters) will publicize this point more. This is a worthwhile thing. I am ordered by the central government, and of course I am equal to the housekeeper of this province. I also have a pair of hands and a pair of feet, but when the bandits come, you are still playing cards, drinking, and living a drunken life. I should remind you to stop playing cards and drinking, and quickly distribute work to protect yourself.

I will also report on a little bit about the six-province joint defense conference. The six-province joint defense conference was held in Nanjing very secretly, so the news media in the capital knew nothing about it. Here is a simple report to everyone on the results of the discussion: Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei have been divided into military regions to implement all military measures. Local self-defense teams must be properly organized by the end of November. Organize an intelligence network, and all towns and villages should complete all their telephone networks by December 25. Establish household registration and Baojia system to prevent bandits from entering. Township heads who are double-dealers will be killed without mercy. As for Jiangsu, it has been divided into military districts, with Jiangnan as a garrison area and Jiangbei as a pacification area, so everything is a military system. When necessary, military law may replace the judiciary, and ordinary laws cannot restrain the strategy of bandit suppression. The most hateful thing is the scattered bandits and so-called underground personnel in Jiangnan. I have ordered all counties to clear the scattered bandits by the end of November. If there are still bandits in a certain place, only the township heads and commissioners will be questioned. If there are bandits between villages, the county magistrate is responsible. If there are bandits between counties, the commissioner is responsible. In this way, the previous situation of ineffective joint defense can be prevented. At the same time, I have also informed all counties along the river in Jiangbei to urge the self-defense teams to prevent communist bandits from crossing the river to the south. The ships in Jiangbei also have a ship management office to manage them. The necessary crossings should be closed, and ferries must be inspected. Every time communist bandits arrive, they must collect people, food, clothing, etc. We should be especially prepared for this. All materials and non-combatants must be moved to safe areas in a planned manner in case of emergency. (Reporters from This Newspaper, He Xianglin)

### Thorough Reissuance of National Identity Cards - Township and Village Chiefs Must Not Be Careless

National identity cards in all counties of Jiangsu Province will be reissued uniformly according to the formats issued by the ministry. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has instructed all counties to complete the reissuance by the end of this year. During the reissuance, a thorough investigation should be conducted first, and the cards should only be issued to those who are indeed law-abiding. If there are any omissions that lead to the cards being used by undesirable elements, the township and village chiefs in charge will be punished as if they were aiding the communists.

### Sixty-Seven Japanese and Ryukyuan Smugglers Awaiting Repatriation

[Airmail Dispatch from Taipei, This Newspaper, 22nd] A reporter visited the First Precinct of the City Police Department yesterday to interview the detained Japanese and Ryukyuan prisoners. According to Director Li (李) of the precinct, in addition to the more than forty people who were transferred to the Provincial Police Department for forced repatriation some days ago, there are currently sixty-seven people, most of whom smuggled to Taiwan. The Japanese and Ryukyuans have not been able to forget Taiwan. Because they cannot live in their own country, they risk their lives to smuggle to Taiwan, hoping to make a profit. There are also some who are acting for other purposes. However, the police局 has no legal provisions to punish or employ them other than detaining them and sending them back to their home countries.

### Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Li Bojin: Full Text of the Reasoning for the Verdict

(Continued from the second page)

In summary, the defendants were all members of the New Tide Society, and the New Tide Society was an external organization of the Communist Party. It strived for representation in student self-governance organizations at all levels within Zhejiang University, participated in the All-China Student Federation led by the Chinese Communist Party, and engaged in various secret activities such as instigating student movements, recruiting members, circulating left-wing medical reports, and producing reading reports. It can be determined that the defendants participated in the Communist Party and took on the role of logistical planning. The defendants' defense in this court that the New Tide Society was an academic group with no connection to the Communist Party, and that the Communist Party's New Tide Society was a separate organization, is inconsistent with their recorded statements. The various activities of the New Tide Society seemed to be unconsciously influenced by the Communist Party, and it was said that in the future, they might turn to the Communist Party, and that the determination of our activities and forms was completely similar to the Communist Party. Furthermore, if the New Tide Society had no connection with the Communist Party, why was it not registered as an academic group with the government and schools, and why was it working secretly, constantly worrying about safety? As for the certificate presented from the Training Department of Zhejiang University, proving that Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and others founded the New Tide Wall Newspaper in the Meitan branch of Zhejiang University in the spring of the 34th year, and registered with the Training Department of Zhejiang University, regardless of whether the certificate was given on a temporary basis, its evidentiary power is weak. Moreover, it is a certificate for the New Tide Wall Newspaper, which is only a part of the New Tide Society's work activities, and is a separate matter from the entire New Tide Society. Even if it was indeed registered with Zhejiang University, it is only limited to the New Tide Wall Newspaper being posted at Zhejiang University, with permission obtained, and cannot include the New Tide Society distributed in various places as having obtained legal registration. Furthermore, according to the defense, Yu Zisan's recorded statement on October 29 of this year was fingerprinted, but since Yu Zisan is dead, there is no way to verify it, and the authenticity is beyond doubt. According to the recorded statement, fingerprints were also affixed to the recorded statement, but Yu Zisan and each of the defendants also signed and affixed their fingerprints on the recorded statements of the 25th of the same month. Furthermore, Yu Zisan's signature has been verified and is consistent with his recorded statement of October 25 of this year and the attached inventory of personally claimed items (Evidence No. 50), and it cannot be said that there are any flaws to hastily accuse the record of being untrue. Furthermore, although Chen Jianxin refused to sign the recorded statement of October 28 of this year, the content of his statements was mostly evasive, revealing the truth. How can one expect to escape responsibility simply because he did not sign? Furthermore, since the defendants engaged in secret activities and provided support, they cannot obstruct their crimes by claiming that the deadline for applying to register to withdraw from the Communist Party has not yet passed. The Communist Party's armed disturbances in North China and Northeast China are aimed not only at seizing power, but also at destroying all organizations of the country. It is clearly attempting to undermine the national system, seize territory, change the constitution by illegal means, subvert the government, and implement its rear-end close-lying Communist Party members who incite student and worker movements, as well as all reactionary work, disrupt social order, and echo remotely, which is its entire plan to harm the Republic of China. Based on this judgment, although the defendants engaged in secret activities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places, since they have a connection of criminal intent with the Communist Party's rebellious acts, they should be held responsible for the crime of rioting and internal strife under the first paragraph of Article 102 of the Criminal Law, and there is no doubt about it. Considering that they share the implementation of the crime as co-principals with the intention of committing a joint crime, they should be considered co-principals. They are distinct from accomplices who only engage in acts outside the elements constituting the crime with the intention of assisting others. The original indictment considered the defendants to be accomplices under the first paragraph of Article 100 of the Criminal Law, which is hardly appropriate and should be changed. The defendants are all young people who, feeling distressed, mistakenly went astray. After being arrested, they all showed remorse. Considering their attitude after the crime, a lenient sentence within the legal limit is imposed. Based on the above arguments and conclusions, according to the first paragraph of Article 291 and Article 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 28, the first paragraph of Article 101, the first paragraph of Article 100, Article 57, the second paragraph of Article 37, Article 38, the first paragraph, and the first and second clauses of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. The case was executed in court by Prosecutor Li Peng of this court, with Zhang Qipeng, Zuo Ti, and Li Fen presiding over the criminal first division of the Zhejiang High Court. (End of full text)

### Ministry of Education Stipulates Three Principles as Standards for Distributing Fishing Vessels; Allocation to be Made in Stages Based on Actual Needs of Fisheries Departments in Various Schools

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Cao Chu, Director of the Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education, was recently ordered to go to Shanghai to participate in the fishing vessel allocation meeting, and a preliminary decision has been reached. The report to the Ministry of Education briefly stated that the Ministry of Education proposed a total of thirteen units for senior high schools and vocational schools, and it was agreed to issue them as requested. However, the first phase of fishing vessel allocation is thirteen vessels, of which the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will receive two vessels, and how the remaining eleven vessels should be allocated to various schools will depend on determining the actual circumstances of the vessels' performance ranking and whether they need to be used in fleets. As for the methods of storage and use of each vessel, the required expenses, and how to send dedicated personnel to Shanghai to be responsible for supervision and liaison during allocation, all should be discussed and planned in advance, etc. The Ministry of Education has now stipulated three principles: The allocation of fishing vessels should be determined based on the existing facilities and the original level of manpower and resources of the fisheries departments in various schools. The relevant departments have been instructed to investigate and properly propose handling measures. Whether the allocation to universities should be delayed is still under study. Efforts will be made to determine the performance, tonnage, etc. of each fishing vessel as a reference for allocation. All fishing vessels are not intended to be allocated to various schools at the same time, but rather to be allocated in stages based on the actual needs of the fisheries departments in various schools.

### A Problem in Children's Education: How to Stop a Child from Crying (Continued and Concluded)

— Chen Heqin

The sixth is "illness." A child will cry when he is sick. Parents must check the child's temperature at any time and study the cause of the illness and the part of the body that is affected. It is best to consult a doctor immediately. Do not prescribe medicine randomly without knowing the cause of the illness. The seventh is "discomfort." Children also cry when they are uncomfortable. For example, if a diaper is wet, it must be changed immediately, otherwise the child will feel uncomfortable and cry.

If we want to prevent children from crying, we must study the cause of their crying, whether they are hungry, in pain, thirsty, cold, hot, sick, or have something else that is making them uncomfortable. Once we understand the cause of their crying, we can find a way to relieve it. Adults can rest assured, and children can be healthy and well.

I have already talked about the physiological causes of crying. Now I will analyze the psychological causes of crying in children. The most important are three points:

The first point is "fear." Children often have this situation. For example, they are afraid of hearing strange sounds, or children do not want to go to sleep at night, and adults deliberately threaten them by saying that a cat or a dog is coming, causing the child to develop a fear psychology, or they hear stories about gods and ghosts. But later, as long as the child hears this kind of sound, sees some cats and dogs, or mentions these stories and nouns, he will cry.

The second point is "suggestion." There are many things that children do not feel, but they often cry due to the suggestion of adults. For example, a child falls and does not cry or feel any pain. Some adults prefer to say "Don't cry, little baby," "It doesn't hurt, little baby," and other such nonsense. As a result, the child who was not crying will start to cry, and the child who was not in pain will start to cry out in pain.

The third point is crying as a "habit." Children's bad habits are all cultivated by adults. For example, when a child wakes up and sees that no one is around, he will cry, and adults often do this, not going to pick him up until the child cries. If this happens the first time and the second time, the child will develop the habit of crying when he wakes up. To avoid this bad habit, it is best not to leave him. When he wakes up, pick him up and say a few words such as "Baby, are you awake? Good boy! Let's get up..." Then, when he wakes up, he will wait for an adult to pick him up and will not cry. For example, when eating, children always like to do it themselves and do not want adults to give it to them. If you do not agree, he will cry. If you are afraid of him crying, you let him take it himself. Then later, anything he cannot get will be threatened by crying. Therefore, when adults encounter such situations, they must harden their hearts. If he wants to cry, let him cry. Only when he stops crying and understands that he cannot take it himself will you give it to him. Then there will be no such habit.

Why do children often cry? Just ask why adults do not take care of them. At the very least, it is because adults are not taking care of them well. Children do not like to cry. It is because of natural physiological and psychological demands. Therefore, I say that children cry because adults are not managing them properly.

Here, I hope that parents with children will always study how to reduce children's crying and always study how to avoid children's crying. Otherwise, if you hear children crying all day long, adults will suffer, and children will cry too much, which will also affect their health.

### Cotton Spinning Adjustment Committee to Hold Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution; Chairman Yuan Xin Assumed Office Yesterday; Future Price Negotiations Will Consider Manufacturers' Production Costs

[Our Newspaper] Yuan Liang, the newly appointed chairman of the Textile Business Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, officially assumed office yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, accompanied by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Minister Chen convened all senior staff members of the committee to introduce them to Mr. Yuan individually. Mr. Yuan then, at the request of the press, made a statement highlighting four key points: The trial measures for the joint distribution of cotton yarn have been jointly approved by Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, Vice Premier Wang, Minister Zuo of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Director-General Zhang of the National Bank. The Textile Business Adjustment Committee, as the implementing agency, will act accordingly. Regarding implementation techniques, further consultations will be held with relevant parties. The purpose of establishing joint distribution is purely to meet the needs of these extraordinary times, and we sincerely hope for the cooperation of all manufacturers. China's industry is still in its infancy, with only the cotton spinning industry having a certain foundation. The government has no intention of destroying the cotton spinning industry. Besides addressing the people's clothing needs, the difficulties of yarn mills must also be considered. The current focus of the Textile Business Adjustment Committee is to find ways to alleviate raw material shortages. Due to transportation issues, domestic cotton cannot be supplied in a timely manner, so efforts will continue to be made to order imported cotton to supplement the supply. Simultaneously, active measures should be taken to eliminate impurities in domestic cotton. It is hoped that an ample supply of raw cotton will reduce the production costs of yarn mills. Cotton yarn and cloth exports should be limited before domestic self-sufficiency is achieved. It seems appropriate to focus on exporting items such as pigs and minerals to earn foreign exchange. In the future, cotton yarn price negotiations will be based on production costs plus reasonable profits, with the principle of maintaining yarn mills' re-production costs.

[Our Newspaper] After the Textile Business Adjustment Committee announced the trial measures for cotton yarn distribution yesterday, reporters visited several leaders in the cotton spinning and replication industries, and summarized their opinions into two points: According to regulations, cotton yarn replication factories and households in Shanghai and other locations must report to the Textile Business Adjustment Committee to register. However, strict restrictions should be placed on the establishment date, credit standing, and other information of the factories and households applying for registration. The joint distribution measures are being piloted in the Shanghai area. Since the distribution targets now include replication industries in Shanghai and other locations, it will be difficult for Shanghai's yarn production to meet the needs of the national replication industry. Furthermore, the existing quotas for the replication industry in the Shanghai area will be sharply reduced. All of these issues require careful discussion and handling when formulating detailed implementation rules.

### Textile Business Adjustment Committee Price Negotiations Remain Unchanged; Cotton Yarn Market Flat and Weak; Fabric Market Shows Some Activity, Transactions Scarce

[Our Newspaper] The Textile Business Adjustment Committee's cotton yarn price negotiations remained unchanged yesterday, with 20-count yarn maintaining its original price of 25.5 million yuan.

The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 1,838 bales, equivalent to 2,958.5 bales of 20-count yarn, with 706 purchase orders.

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was initially flat, then weak. Ultimately, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell sharply by 2 million yuan compared to the weekend, to 46 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns, such as 20-count, 16-count Bright, and 32-count and 40-count yarns, also fell, ranging from 500,000 to 1.45 million yuan.

The cotton fabric market opened with a seemingly flat but actually weak trend. As actual sales remained slow and floating inventory increased due to tight credit, many longs took profits, creating strong selling pressure in the market. Sentiment turned bearish, and prices fell. As a result, various grades of fine cloth fell by 12,000 yuan compared to the weekend, but the Dragon Head and Yang Crane grades rose by 5,000 yuan. The Four Gentlemen grade experienced a steep drop of 30,000 yuan. Due to the high cost of dyes, the sales of Shilin cloth remained good, and the price rose by 120,000 yuan, while the base prices of other cloths remained firm.

Raw Cotton Prices Trend Downward

Yesterday, the raw cotton market was weak in the morning due to few deliveries, and prices declined. In the afternoon, the market sentiment slightly improved as the cotton yarn market saw higher bids, and some dealers bought on dips, stabilizing prices somewhat. However, due to the excessive gains, and the apparent overpricing of cotton yarn under the Textile Business Adjustment Committee's distribution program, making it difficult to meet costs, yarn mills were reluctant to purchase. As a result, prices fell by around 200,000 yuan, with 1,200 bales traded.

### Cotton Arriving Without Import Permits; Transportation Control Committee Formulates Handling Measures

[Our Newspaper] The Peruvian Office of the Transportation Control Committee issued the following measures on the 24th for handling cotton arriving without import permits or already shipped before the announcement: All cotton already registered under Announcements Nos. 2, 4, and 9 of this Committee, and either already arrived or shipped from overseas before September 30, will be handled according to these measures. All registered cotton, regardless of whether or not it requires foreign exchange, will be purchased by the Textile Export Committee on behalf of the government under the conditions stipulated in these measures. Whether or not foreign exchange needs to be paid for the purchased cotton will be based on whether the importing manufacturer indicated in their original registration application to this Committee that payment had been made. All finished products made from the purchased cotton will be exported by the government. The government will purchase the cotton, fairly allocate it based on applications from various yarn mills, entrust the yarn mills to spin the cotton on its behalf, or exchange the cotton for yarn and cloth at a set price, which will be returned to the government on schedule. The grading standards and exchange ratios will be determined separately. The yarn mills that originally imported or ordered the cotton will have priority in spinning or exchanging the cotton. However, the quota for the government's entrusted spinning to each factory should be limited to 10% of each factory's export production volume. The labor and material costs or the amount to be valued for the government's entrusted spinning or exchange of cotton yarn and cloth will be determined separately by the Textile Export Committee. The government will pay for the cotton purchased without foreign exchange in ten monthly installments. The price will be based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price listed in the importer's original application to this Committee and verifiable with the original invoice. The government may also order the provision of other supporting documents. The unloading fees, storage fees, and other expenses already paid by the importing manufacturer will be reimbursed by the government in national currency based on the actual payment receipts submitted. The payment method for the government's purchase of cotton for which foreign exchange has already been paid will be handled in accordance with Announcements Nos. 3 and 7 of this Committee.

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, with the police department's economic division deploying personnel to monitor each market, conditions were good. The prices of daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cloth, rice, and edible oil all declined slightly compared to Saturday of last week. However, the black market for gold and currency and the Huagu stock market rose again in the afternoon. According to Cao Maoliang, the head of the economic division, starting today, they will focus on cracking down on the black market for gold and currency. Although the rise in Huagu stocks can attract idle funds, it indirectly affects other prices. Therefore, in the future, personnel will be deployed to closely monitor it.

### Government Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Rise

### National Bank Official Denies Issuance of New Large-Denomination Banknotes

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, rumors circulated in the market about the National Bank issuing banknotes with larger denominations, claiming that samples had already been discovered, describing them in detail and causing widespread speculation. Reporters specifically inquired with the National Bank official, who stated that there was no such thing. The official also stated that the National Bank had issued two types of new banknotes at the end of last week: new 10,000 yuan banknotes printed by Zhonghua Book Company's flat printing and 500 yuan Customs Gold Unit notes printed by American Bank Note Company. Samples of both types of new banknotes have been sent to various commercial banks. The rumor that samples of new banknotes with larger denominations have been discovered may be due to this misunderstanding.

Woolen Fabrics Rebound

Both wholesale and retail prices of woolen fabrics all rebounded yesterday. White-edged Melton rose to 700,000 yuan, Zhanghua flannel was quoted at 1.15 million yuan per yard, and Zhongfang black and gray overcoating was sold for 1 million yuan. Most dealers are optimistic about further gains. Transactions require spot payments or three-to-five-day checks. While the approaching cold winter is a factor, the soaring black market prices of gold and currency are also a major reason. Large wholesalers in Teahouse and Chessboard Street, such as Xie Da Zheng Yu, are most optimistic about flannel. Overcoating and thick fabrics are more active, and Hailong long-haired velvet is extremely popular. Silky feather yarn and satin-backed silk, sleeve linings, French linings, and other items also saw large transactions. Many people from both inside and outside the industry are going to Hankou to purchase woolen fabrics.

### Review Committee for Handling Goods Arriving with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Established Yesterday; Subcommittee to Negotiate and Decide on Distribution Prices

[Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau's Review Committee for Handling Goods Arriving with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange held its establishment meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Central Bank's conference room. Director-General Zhang of the National Bank presided over the meeting. Discussions continued until about 6:00 PM, and the important resolutions are recorded as follows:

Regarding distribution prices, the pricing will be based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price plus a percentage based on the market price. The exact percentage to be added will be determined by a separate Distribution Price Subcommittee, which will invite relevant trade associations to participate in discussions. If the originally designated user of the goods applying for purchase is not a factory user, they should be allowed to purchase with priority if they can present documents such as contracts and verify that they are a direct user. However, if the originally designated user is a retailer but can present documents verifying that they are transferring the goods to a direct user, they should also be allowed to purchase with priority if it is verified to be true. The Central Trust Bureau's Purchasing Materials Division will handle the business of this Committee concurrently. The organizational regulations of this Committee were passed.

Spring and Autumn

### A Discussion on Novel Techniques

— Wei Yi

The Author Who Doesn't "Show Their Face"

The techniques of novel writing are constantly evolving. The most significant change is that in earlier novels, the author would "show their face," while in modern novels, the author has disappeared. In the novels of Fielding, Scott, Thackeray, and George Eliot, the author can be seen everywhere, instructing the reader and explaining the causes of the characters' successes and failures in detail to elaborate on their philosophy of behavior. As for modern novels, although there are occasional opportunities to make a point, the author themselves does not appear in the story and never inserts a sentence. Instead, the characters express their own thoughts and actions, and the story itself explains everything. This is a characteristic of modern novels. Only in this way can the novel be distinguished from history, philosophy, and science, and form its own camp; otherwise, it is merely their appendage.

Fielding was more cautious and often wrote his thoughts in the introduction. Scott, Thackeray, Trollope, and Meredith freely expressed their opinions in their books, reducing the dramatic tension. What readers want to know is real-life experience, and the author's instructions are superfluous. However, many great writers of the 19th century made this mistake. The more critical the moment, the more meaningless it feels when they explain it in a few words. Technically speaking, it can also be said that they were simply trying to save effort and unwilling to write in detail.

Victorian novels had three obvious trends: The author used a didactic tone to moralize. The author liked to discuss the characters in the book with the reader, with bias, hoping that the reader would adopt the same attitude. Influenced by scientific fervor, they wanted to explain the actions of the characters in the book, so that we would know that a certain phenomenon was in accordance with the universal laws of human nature. These three advantages can be said to be interrelated. However, by the 20th century, techniques shifted direction, and they were no longer so popular.

From this, it can be seen that the methods of telling stories in these two eras are very different. In Victorian novels, the author was lecturing about the characters in the book, rather than letting the characters express themselves. This method was as rigid as a formula in algebra, leaving no room for imagination. Modern novelists, on the other hand, are reluctant to say much themselves, only letting the characters express their thoughts. Techniques differ, and methods have changed.

### On Yuan Dynasty Opera and Kunqu Opera

— Zhao Jingshen

Unfortunately, how Yuan Dynasty opera was actually sung has now been lost. In the late Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, He Liangjun hired Dun Ren, the only old musician at the time who was proficient in northern tunes, to teach the female performers in his family to sing Yuan Dynasty dramas (see He Liang's "Congshuo by Four Friends of the Latter Period," Volume 37). This was probably the last echo of Yuan Dynasty opera? We can only vaguely understand how Yuan Dynasty opera was sung from the more than ten Yuan Dynasty tunes that have been preserved in Kunqu opera. However, it is already "Kunqu Opera Singing Yuan Dynasty Tunes," not the original way of singing Yuan Dynasty opera.

What I want to try to explore now is how this small part of Yuan Dynasty opera has been preserved to the present, and what method it used to preserve it. My personal view is that the beautiful melodies of these ten or so Yuan Dynasty tunes themselves are one reason, but a more important reason is that Yuan Dynasty opera was absorbed by Ming and Qing Dynasty dramas and even palace operas. Yuan Dynasty opera has maintained its life's continuation in the position of a hermit crab.

In earlier selections of songs, such as "Zhu Tou Bailian" and the imperial collection "Stringed Instrument Yuan Yin," "Jiaoxiao Ji Fang Xian" is recorded. This tune is from the third act of Luo Guanzhong's "Fengyun Hui" in the Yuan Dynasty, commonly known as "Visiting Pu." It begins with the words "Crystal Palace Jiaoxiao Tent," hence the name. This "Jiaoxiao Ji" is not Shen Jing's "Jiaoxiao Ji," but simply a clever name. Also recorded is "Four Prefectures Record Single Knife," which is actually Guan Hanqing's "Lord Guan's Single Knife Meeting" from the Yuan Dynasty.

In the "Laifeng Guan Selected Legendary Tales," "Fengyun Hui" is mistakenly titled Qiao Mengfu's "Golden Vine Record," and "Dao Hui" is also titled "Four Prefectures Record." Wu Changling's "Journey to the West" is titled Xia Junzheng's "Northern Tang Monk." The two tunes selected, "Journey to the West" ("Xinshuilin," just left the Buddha's building) should be related to "Old Muslim chanting Buddha in the East Building," and "Farewell" ("Dianjiangchun," for the first time) should be related to "Tang Sanzang taking the scriptures from the West."

From the above two selections of songs, it can be known that Guan Hanqing's "Dao Hui," Wu Changling's "Journey to the West," and Luo Guanzhong's "Visiting Pu" were still very popular in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties.

By the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, many dramas were absorbed into the palace operas, and then divided into scenes and spread, so the changes became more numerous. Like tangled silk, the threads became more complicated. I strongly suspect that "Ascending Peace Treasure Raft" and "Compassionate Vow" accommodated Wu Changling's "Muslim" and "Northern Farewell," and also accommodated Yang Jingxian's "Piezzi," "Recognizing Son," "Fat Gu," and "Borrowing Fan."

Similarly, I hypothesize that "Zhaodai Xiaoshao" accommodated "Ji Liang" and "Wutai," "Dinging Springs and Autumns" accommodated "Dao Hui," and "Qingzhong Ji" accommodated "Sweeping Qin." We have already seen this in "Kunqu Opera Extract." There is a combined edition of "Golden Sable Record Legendary Tale."

The performers don't care who wrote the play. As long as it is from the same dynasty and narrates the same person, they can forcibly put them together; but this makes it difficult for us who study the history of drama.

We should be happy that Yuan Dynasty opera can still be performed today. It is said that the Amai Chu Xian Lu No. 9 Police Station will be hosting a Kunqu Opera performance by the Xian Dian Society to raise funds for the Kunqu Opera Ancestral Temple for four days (26th to 29th, opening at 7:30 PM every night). The first two days will feature Guan Hanqing's "Single Knife Meeting," Zhu Kai's "Haotian Pagoda," "Wutai," and Kong Wenqing's "East Window Incident," "Whipping Qin." In addition to Yuan Dynasty opera, they will also perform Wang Tingna's "Lion's Roar Record," "Combing and Kneeling," Xu Lin's "Tanji Record," "Beating Son," Xu Zichang's "Water Margin Record," "Live Capture," Ruan Dachu's "Swallow Letter," "Dog Hole," Fan Xizhe's "Wild Goose Feather Armor," "Stealing Armor," Qiu Guohu's "Firing Bullet," "Mountain Pavilion," Cao Yin's complete "Life After the Tiger's Mouth," Hong Sheng's "Hall of Longevity," "Xu Pavilion, Alarming Change Buried Jade," Li Yu's "Eternal Reunion Drumming," "Hall Marriage," as well as Yi Sheng's "Borrowing Boots," Siping Tune "Thinking of Mortal World Going Down the Mountain," and martial arts opera "Ganyuan Mountain," which is simply a living history of drama.

### Small Town

— Qin Ling

Two years ago, in the autumn, I arrived at X Family Market in Changshu for my job. This secluded small town initially caused me much embarrassment and unease, but in the end, my departure surprisingly brought tears to many eyes.

After disembarking from the steamer at the pier of X Family Market from Changshu, one had to climb up some sandy slopes. Upon reaching the main road, many rickshaws were waiting to pick up passengers. Because I disliked the rickshaws' bumpiness, I settled my luggage and asked Lao Rong, the teahouse attendant sent to pick me up, to lead the way. I followed behind him on foot. On both sides of the winding sandy road, cotton fields, peanuts, sorghum, and millet stretched out in patches. Grasshoppers chirped long and weakly. The autumn twilight sun shone feebly on the earth. Our footsteps made a "scrape, scrape" sound on the sand. I experienced the real countryside for the first time and witnessed the great power of the land. By the time we reached the town street, the shadows of dusk were quite heavy. Several donkeys were tethered in front of the mill, busily moving their jaws to chew fodder. In front of the tofu shop, freshly made tofu skins were hung in rows. The iron shop had a roaring furnace, and the spinning machine whirred loudly… a unique atmosphere enveloped this small street. In groups of two or three, village girls leaned against doorways chatting. When our group passed by, they cast surprised glances:

"Where are they from?"

"Such style!"

"Looks like a ghost!"

These words, mixed with laughter, came like sharp thorns. I lowered my head to examine my attire: a white gauze jacket, a black cheongsam, white leather shoes. It didn't seem like I had any dazzling urban colors. So, was it my glasses or my hairstyle that offended them? Thinking about the long period I would be living among these people, I felt a bit dejected. It was in this mood that I arrived at my workplace. After meeting the factory director, I was settled in my designated room. It had a slightly earthy, damp smell. In front of the window was a pond with several willow trees planted around it. Thus began my rural life.

The first local person I interacted with was Mrs. Zhang, the landlord of our factory house. At the age of twenty-five, she already had three children. She had studied for a few years, could handle accounting, and also managed the farm chores. Therefore, her husband could leisurely sit in the teahouse all day, go to the wine shop, and perhaps even go to the city to watch a play every three or five days. Consequently, she earned a reputation for being capable and virtuous. Opening the waist door at the back of her house's main hall led to the small courtyard in front of our office. She loved to poke half her head out and call:

"Mr. Qin, (a shortened form of 'teacher' here). Come over here and sit for a while!"

As soon as I went over to her place, she would heap corn, taro, pumpkin seeds, and dried beans in front of me, insisting that I eat them all. I wasn't particularly fond of the local produce, but her sincerity made it impossible not to force myself to try them. Flipping through her sewing box and the well-preserved children's books and newspapers published in 1937, I secretly admired this rural housewife. Her family also had a phonograph for entertaining distinguished guests. The records already had a bit of a scratchy sound. When she saw us, her children would pull on her mother: "Listen to the foreign opera!" Then, a record of foreigners laughing loudly would start spinning. The children and mother would laugh along. The laughter attracted neighbors, who would laugh along heartily without even knowing why. Their laughter made me unable to restrain myself, so I joined in with a burst of laughter. She always took my hand and said:

"I really like you. I don't have a younger sister, would you like to be my sworn sister?" I nodded to indicate my acceptance of her suggestion, but until I left the small town, she still called me "Mr. Qin," and I always called her "Mrs. Zhang." She didn't believe I wasn't married:

"A girl in her twenties, not married yet? You must be working here because you're bored and lonely in the interior."

She drew her own clever conclusion. I didn't argue with her. If she didn't believe me, so be it. Originally, early marriage was the custom here. Girls of fifteen or sixteen were already becoming mothers. If life is a drama, then they are all talented actors.

Life in the small town was as calm and peaceful as a pool of autumn water. This was perhaps due to the townspeople's tranquil nature. Taking the town street as an example, the entire town had only two streets, front and back. Five or six out of ten shops on the two streets were teahouses, restaurants, and wine shops. People who went to the early market would bring a pot of clear tea and a quick breakfast, conveniently discussing business. It had practically become a custom. Therefore, the teahouses also sold sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, steamed buns, glutinous rice cakes, and so on, never worrying about being deserted all day. The restaurant display windows were filled with piles of fresh fish, meat, chicken, and duck. You might worry that they wouldn't sell out in a day, but every day, so many customers went in and out, maintaining the restaurants' prosperity. Moreover, the town's wine shops were quite interesting places. Once autumn arrived, crabs, braised mutton, peanuts, and green beans accompanied the mung bean liquor on the market. The waiters shouted and bustled about, while the customers wore rosy smiles. Were they idle? Sit down and take a slow sip. Those who weren't idle could lean against the counters along the street for a quick drink. Even if they were wearing bamboo apron and blue gowns, they were still qualified to eat and drink. Facing the old, yellowed plaques of Pine and Crane Restaurant, Six Dynasties Residence, Taibai's Wind, Ruan Ji's Yanze…, your thoughts are pulled back thousands of years.

However, the small town's prosperity was built solely on "eating." And behind this prosperity were also terrible shadows. Interspersed between the restaurants and teahouses were also nests of prostitutes and brothels. The abnormal trade of souls and bodies spread with a rather alarming force. Peel off the small town's outer shell, and inside is a rotten, base, disgusting corpse. Compared to its naturally fertile land, it is truly a lamentable contrast.

Nevertheless, the small town itself also gave me much warmth and amusement. Although my room was so simple, on moonlit nights, when the sparse willows and pale moon caressed my small window, the pond was like my mother. To it, I poured out so many repressions and unhappinesses. The bamboo fence covered with bright red wolfberries, the small wooden bridge lightly arched over the stream, and the sandy soil of that expanse of green field and blue sky all received my诉说。 In the year or so of rural life, I was able to endure it peacefully, and I cannot but thank their comfort. All the memorable people and scenes, may they be safe and enduring.

### Orchid

— Lu Shixiong

### Records to Bring a Smile

— Kai Gong

Except for Ren Houbai, named Junsu, who loved learning and had quick wit, he was humorous and good at debate. He often made defamatory jokes, which many people loved to associate with. He wrote "Records to Bring a Smile" in two volumes, all humorous stories. Sadly, the original book has been lost. The "Taiping Guangji" occasionally includes excerpts. Here is one excerpt to give a glimpse. "A Shandong man married a woman from Puzhou, who was often thin. The woman's mother had a very large neck tumor. After several months of marriage, the woman's family suspected the son-in-law was not skilled. The woman's father hosted a grand banquet for relatives to test him. He asked: 'The young man studied in Shandong, he should understand principles. The swan and crane can cry, what does this mean?' He replied: 'The angel made it so.' He asked again: 'Pine and cypress are green in winter, what does this mean?' He replied: 'The angel made it so.' He asked again: 'The tree by the road has bone bumps, what does this mean?' He replied: 'The angel made it so.' The woman's father said, 'The young man does not understand any principles, why did he stay in Shandong!' So he teased him: 'The swan and crane can cry because their necks are long, the pine and cypress are green in winter because their hearts are strong, the tree by the road has bone bumps because the car broke it: how can the angel made it so?' The son-in-law said: 'The toad can cry, but does it have a long neck? Bamboo is also green in winter, but does it have a strong heart? Your wife's neck has such a large tumor, how can the car have broke it?'"

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Old Brother, you don't even know how much I suffered this time." He Jian defended himself, "That damn bastard put me through hell! ... Do you know how many days this whole trip was? ..."

"Seven days, maybe." I answered casually.

"No!" He Jian glanced at his watch, "It's 0:25 now, it's already crossed into another day, I say it's nine days..."

"How nine days?" I wasn't very focused. Seven days or nine days, these two numbers didn't mean much to me.

"Counting from July 31st; today is August 8th, 0:00, including both ends, how can it not be nine days?" He Jian tried to clarify.

"Okay, nine days then... so what?" I wondered why he was so concerned about such a trivial matter, so insignificant.

"No," He Jian took a few puffs of his "Fushima" brand cigarette, and grinded it into a pile of ashes in the ashtray as if grinding ink, then lit a new one again: "You might think it's insignificant, but you don't know the suffering in it - both physical and mental - look at me!"

Hearing his words, I really looked closely at his face. He Jian had indeed changed shape. His usually rosy and full cheeks were now blueish-purple, and had shrunk a lot, looking like after an illness, or after sleepless nights. His eyes, which were always bright and shining, had become sluggish, and his eye sockets had sunken; along with his dashing eyebrows, they now seemed to droop, and at first glance, they vaguely looked like the character eight. Yes, he had indeed changed shape a bit, and had lost some weight.

"Didn't that old man, that old what? ... old 'Turtle'?" (referring to Konoe) Yes, didn't that old guy issue an order, telling me to return to Tokyo for training?" He Jian looked at me, his eyes wide.

"Yes." I moved my gaze from his face to his hands; because at this time he was grinding a second cigarette again.

"Training for what?" This was probably another Guanwai speaking habit, almost every sentence had a question mark like he was eating raw rice. He Jian asked, and immediately answered himself: "Training, it's probably a euphemism for a military court! Old Brother, you think I can stay calm after receiving this order?"

I didn't say anything, just cracked a smile, showing my teeth, to express sympathy and give him some sympathy.

"Damn bastard, it's like two drummers, banging wildly in my chest, you can imagine how bad it tasted." He Jian raised his voice and said in one breath.

"It definitely tasted bad!" I replied. No wonder he insisted on turning seven days into nine days; he must have suffered a lot during these "nine days."

The above is the opening dialogue of our conversation. Immediately afterwards, after taking a few deep breaths and puffs of cigarettes, He Jian told me the whole story, in great detail.

### Close the Door Behind You

When the northwest wind rises, everyone feels a chill, and the small red strips of paper with "Close the Door Behind You" appear as needed; especially in the busy entrances and exits of the office, if the building is already old, and the mud on the walls is peeling off, presenting an indescribable mysterious color, then on that door, or next to the door, is pasted a narrow white strip of paper, with four characters crookedly arranged on it, and if you look closely, isn't it "Close the Door Behind You"!

The day the Siberian cold air mass, or simply the cold wave from Japan, invades this city, is the time when these small strips of paper appear. Great is the change of weather; insignificant is the power of words!

Assuming that our country's science is advanced, and production is not backward, all the office doors must be equipped with freely opening and closing springs, no matter whether you run in or out, just move your body, slip past the door, and with a bang behind you, no, not a loud sound, the door will automatically close. However, it is not easy to talk about, this kind of new equipment, may not be universally realized in a short time of ten or eight years.

If material resources are insufficient, human resources are sufficient. Big hotels, restaurants, and dance halls use waiters to open doors. Guests don't have to bother lifting their hands and feet, entering and exiting freely, without any concerns, which is worth promoting. However, these places are mainly for spending money, and the wool comes from the sheep, so the enjoyment of the customers is still their own contribution. A few places can do this, but extending it widely will definitely not work.

It is better to ask for oneself than to ask for others. We might as well first explore why some people are unwilling or unwilling, not used to, or even unable to close the door? Here, we feel that if we want everyone to close the door, we must first start with cultivating good habits. Westerners say: "An old dog can't learn new tricks". Good habits must be cultivated from childhood: middle-aged people are busy with food and clothing, or confused by fame and fortune, who has so much free time to practice closing or opening doors. Not to mention old people, if you mess it up, he says, what if I don't close it? What can you do about it. Only by teaching our next generation, and practicing "small hands close doors" from childhood, can we still save the situation!

Because of the "Close the Door Behind You" strips of paper, I thought of other such folk strips of paper, which further proves the lack of spirit of words and the omnipotence of science. For example, "Jiang Taigong is here...", "Taishan Stone Dare", "Emperor...Emperor...", "Selling Severe Cold...", and even "XX Please Step Forward", "Spit Phlegm into the Urinal" etc., all show that the level of folk education is too poor, too casual, and too lacking in self-esteem, and good habits are not cultivated from childhood. We should never laugh at these strips of paper, we only feel that everything should be introspected, don't gloss over the surface, and aim too high.

One door after another, there are really many kinds of doors. Lao Tzu said: Mysterious and mysterious, "the gate of all mysteries" and the mysterious female gate, is called the root of heaven and earth. The words are so great. Now that the door of democracy has been opened, the election campaign is in full swing, and the National Assembly and Legislators are well-matched. The ancients created characters, using one leaf as one household, and two leaves as a door. Countless disputes in the world arise from prejudice, dividing bushels and breaking scales so that the people do not compete, and when there is no boundary in the chest, prejudice will be eliminated, and the open door policy of Monrow will be realized.

Westerners also have signs on the door saying "Please Knock". This is the opposite of "Close the Door Behind You". The Chinese people do not seem to pay much attention to the privacy and freedom of individuals. They often rush straight in, invading other people's studies and bedrooms, as a sign of intimacy and friendship. Western men and women, although they can strip naked on the beach without any scruples, are very particular about this. No matter whether they are family or friends, when they encounter someone closing the door, they must first knock lightly on the door, and only when they hear a "please" from inside can they enter. The office is of course no exception.

Ge Hong said: "... or there are those who do not inform the host, but rush forward together, and before the strict decorations can be identified, they no longer peek and listen, breaking doors and closing locks, jumping over walls and drilling through cracks, like the arrival of a raid. And if the concubines and concubines hide too late, they even search for hidden places, and pull them out on the spot, which is also a strange thing. For the gentleman's residence, he does not even cover up the imperfections of his family, so when entering the door, he raises his voice, and when ascending the hall, he looks down, and what reason is there to be abrupt to other people's families? ..." Zhi Chuan was a person of the Jin Dynasty, more than a thousand years ago, and at that time people already had the good habit of raising their voices when entering the door, but at the same time they could not avoid breaking doors and closing locks, and were unwilling to allow others freedom to retreat. So which came first, bad behavior or etiquette? This and the question of which came first, the chicken or the egg, seem to be equally difficult to answer.

Although the door is set up, closing it often can reduce many troubles. Entering the public door, bowing as if in fear, and not standing in the middle of the door, and not stepping on the threshold, are also all manifestations of attentive politeness. Confucius said: You is playing the zither, why is it for my door... Confucius said: You has ascended the hall, but has not entered the room. Zilu really asked for it himself, playing the zither did not conform to the elegant odes, and was thus ridiculed by the master. If they went elsewhere to play music, and did not approach the old gentleman's door, perhaps this unpleasant thing would not have happened. The sage attached importance to his door, and would never be careless. How many people are qualified to be listed in his door? Otherwise, they would look longingly at the high walls, unable to enter. Even if they became old party members with white hair, they would still be seen as outsiders.

Today's people only seek practical benefits, and do not necessarily investigate the style of the door. Once a tile is turned over, someone will respectfully press the head of the rich and powerful family onto it. From then on, the golden door and jade hall will be smooth sailing. The door is high, and the courtyard is like a market. But if you mess it up, and it suddenly collapses, it will immediately become empty.

Today, everything is expensive, and people's livelihoods are declining. Pessimists only have two invisible doors, the first is that there is no door to appeal to, and the second is that there is no door to enter the ground. There are great difficulties, and small difficulties. Although they are willing to "close the door behind them", what can they do if there is no door? The speaker said that those who come to speculate in gold banknotes and stocks are all opening living doors, hitting every door, and their joy can be imagined. The American loan is rolling down the mountain, and is still far away; only the sound of the stairs is heard, but no one is seen coming down. The government and the public are waiting on tiptoe, with no door to open, let alone close. If President Truman officially announces it, the wind of speculation may be slightly curbed, but now they can only sigh at the ocean and lick their lips as they pass the butcher's shop.

### Saying Yes But Not Really

— Feng Ren

There is a note in the Qing people's notes about Wang Mingsheng, roughly saying: "When Wang Mingsheng was not yet successful, he was poor and ran around the capital to big families. Every time he entered someone's house, he would make a gesture of holding something in his hands, and made a 'hiss, hiss' sound. People were surprised and asked him, and he said: 'I am inviting the wealth of the Mo family into my arms.' That's how greedy and despicable he was. However, the poems and articles he wrote were full of integrity and did not resemble his behavior. When people asked him about this, he would say: 'Reputation only lasts for one generation, but poems and articles will be passed down for hundreds of generations. After hundreds of generations, the reputation will gradually disappear, and my poems and articles can be passed down.'"

Words and actions are often inconsistent. You should be careful of people who speak eloquently, and pay attention to their behavior. Qian Qianyi's articles were passionate and inspiring, even surpassing Shi Kefa. If later generations only read Yin Rugeng's great work "Tragedy of National Subjugation", how could they have imagined that he would be the number one traitor in North China.

### Life on Earth

— Broken Wheel

The total time of Earth's existence, as generally estimated by people, is only a rough number. However, the length of time is undeniable. The appearance of human beings on Earth, however, is a recent event.

The ancestor of human beings is called Pithecanthropus, which means ape-man or monkey-man. It proves that human beings evolved from the animal world, and there is no longer any question about this.

In the relatively ancient strata, no traces of human beings or their tools have ever been found. This is powerful proof that human beings appeared later on Earth.

But before there were human beings, there were already birds and beasts. Because this is also a fact obtained from the strata; and it proves that whether birds or beasts, they were all formed by reptiles. For example, on the banks of the Don River in Ukraine, near Voronezh, many petrified trees have been found, and the stones are filled with the remains of many ancient marine animals. At the same time, what is even more interesting is that it tells us: the place where the Don River now flows was a sea millions of years ago, and ancient marine life developed in the sea. And in that sea, the animals that lived at that time were called sea hedgehogs. At the same time, there were also arm-bone animals.

All these secrets are told by the silent stones.

Life on Earth seems to have started from fish, but it is not like that. Before fish, in the ancient ocean, there were many animals that were simpler than fish. Such as sponges, corals, jellyfish, and special shrimp, etc. However, going deeper into the strata, there are even earlier animals that are even simpler, so simple that they do not resemble any modern animals.

The strata prove that life on Earth originated very early, and started from very simple organisms.

### How to Use Your Eyes

— Xiao Wen

Few people know that sad thoughts can hurt us. And joyful, happy thoughts create happy eyes. Because the eyes are very sensitive organs, closely related to the brain and nervous system; negative emotions such as worry, fear, and anger can seriously damage the eyes. People who are accustomed to worrying will eventually cause great damage to their eyes.

Relaxing the eyes is the most effective way to improve vision. Now you can try it yourself: remove your glasses, sit down facing a book or a calendar with numbers, close your eyes gently for a while, cover your eyes with your warm, gentle palms, but do not press hard, then place your elbows on your knees or on the table in front of you, so that your body and mind are relaxed, and do not think about anything for a while—turn your head slightly to both sides. Then open your eyes and blink slightly, and you will find that the things you just looked at are now brighter and clearer.

Some people are always tense from head to toe. This extreme nervousness also affects the eyes, which is very bad. And the way to relax the eye muscles is to blink often. The so-called blinking refers to the gentle and quiet opening and closing of the eyes, and must not be done quickly or impetuously. Healthy eyes often blink quickly and unconsciously.

Children's eyes are always blinking lightly and quickly, so their eyes are very bright, while the eyes of elderly or stressed people, the so-called staring, refers to the eyes being honest and fixed, staring unnaturally, thus making the eyeballs become blurred and uneasy.

Blinking is sufficient to keep the eyes moist and smooth, which is necessary for healthy and comfortable eyes. So when you use your eyes, remember to blink from time to time, this is a good way to avoid staring.

### Underground Steel Plant

— Bin Zhi

During the war, there were many underground factories in the caves of our country's southwestern border area to prevent enemy aircraft from bombing, but the scale was very small.

Since the war became three-dimensional, countries have tried to move many factories underground, so as not to become targets for enemy aircraft bombing. Especially after the appearance of the atomic bomb, there is an even greater need for adequate protection. Because the stagnation of industry is more serious than the failure on the battlefield.

The United States has begun planning to build large-scale underground steel mills and chemical plants. Taking steel as an example, the United States has produced a total of 100 million tons in the past 20 years, which is a major resource for economic and military needs. There are plans to build a large underground steel plant in Utah, which can produce one percent of the country's steel within two years after the war. The construction of this factory requires the excavation of 50 million cubic feet of rock, and there can be a large workshop 1,500 feet long. There is complete ventilation equipment, which can supply hundreds of tons of fresh, healthy air per minute according to the needs of the workshop, and there is sufficient water source, which can draw thousands of tons of clean water from underground per minute. The implementation of this plan is estimated to cost 30 million US dollars.

Ideally, at least half of the steel mills in the United States should be moved underground in order to maintain the need for steel during wartime. That would require 1.5 billion yuan, and it would take five years to design. But another problem has arisen, although the factory can be hidden, the vast mine is still unavoidable. Eighty-five percent of the iron ore in the United States may be bombed and production will stop after the outbreak of war. The railway for transporting ore is also easily targeted by the enemy. The United States is now anxious about these two points.

Miss America

### Racial Prejudice of Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

The country that shouts the slogans of freedom and equality the loudest is also the country with the most profound racial discrimination. This racial discrimination has deep-rooted reasons beyond prejudice.

America is the country with the most complex races, forming self-contained systems, even without interaction despite being neighbors. Except for European expatriates whose living habits are not much different from Americans, the cunning and untamed nature of blacks, the licentiousness and laziness of Mexicans, and the drug trafficking and smuggling of Orientals all affect the safety and purity of America. Americans' temper is such that if they say someone is good, they are good to the heavens, and if they say someone is bad, they are bad to hell. Therefore, once you lose credibility with Americans, you will be looked down upon by them for life. They have always looked down on people of color, listing them as inferior races. In fact, since people with strong armor and sharp weapons conquered most of the world, people of color have fallen into the abyss of poverty, and everything has declined. Taking the Chinese, who are relatively able to stand up among people of color, as an example, they are not enough to be compared with them. Aren't the corrupt and ubiquitous upper-class Chinese the scum of people of color? You can't blame people for being prejudiced.

Their knowledge of the Chinese ultimately comes from books and newspapers. What good things are there to expect from the descriptions of the Chinese in books and newspapers? Their impression of Mexicans is even worse. Miss America never associates with Mexicans, and they also do not want Chinese people to associate with Mexicans. They often advise Chinese boys not to have entanglements with Mexican girls. They say Mexican women are the most fickle, like fierce flames when passionate, but once they change their minds, they become strangers.

They simply hate blacks to the bone, regarding them as poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. Wherever blacks live, Americans not only no longer reside there, but even white people no longer walk on that street. Blacks are excellent in intelligence, but their morality is indeed a problem. There are often cases of black men raping white women. According to general criticism, blacks are extremely ferocious and lustful, and their sexuality is unstoppable when it is aroused. Black men and women have no restraint on sexual desire. You rarely see healthy black girls, but whether this is due to excessive lust is difficult to say for sure, or it may be slander by Americans. However, Miss America has a considerable affection for Chinese students. According to research results, Chinese people value love and have patience. Miss America's racial prejudice is overcome by the resilience of Chinese men. (10)(5)

### Chen Shangze's Life or Death Unknown, Longing for His Early Return

Editor: My husband, Chen Shangze, is from Guanqiao, Dongyang, Zhejiang. He is 27 years old this year and enlisted in the army in 1939, assigned to the First Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 34th Provisional Division of the Army (Battalion Commander Zhang Zuoshen). Since 1941, when he was in Shengxian County, I received one letter from him, but there has been no news since then, and his life or death is unknown. His parents rely on him, and his wife waits for him, hoping for his return. If any kind-hearted gentlemen, superiors, or colleagues know of his whereabouts, please notify us on his behalf. We will be eternally grateful. If he himself sees this notice, I hope he will return home as soon as possible, or send a message, so as not to be waiting in vain. With regards, Chen Zhu Cuiou of Dongyang (Address: c/o Mr. Zhu Changshi, Xikou Zhuan, Silukou, Yongkang, Zhejiang). Reader's Mailbox

To Mr. Yu Yanzheng of Shanghai: The letter you sent is unclear and impossible to speculate. I hope you will consult an ophthalmologist for examination, and do not take drugs indiscriminately.

To Mr. Liu Ping of Wujin: This is due to excessive secretion of sebaceous glands, causing acne due to poor excretion. It is a common phenomenon among young people and is not a disease. "Xini Jie" is a medicine for treating scabies, how can it be used randomly! Pores cannot be shrunk, and it is not necessary.

To Mr. Yang Huai of Shanghai: The space in our newspaper is limited, and your letter cannot be published. We are very sorry!

To Mr. Ma E of Shanghai: It seems that there is no law to rely on for your matter.

To the Peiping Suzhou Middle School Alumni Association in Peiping: We have received your letter and have forwarded it to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for handling.
