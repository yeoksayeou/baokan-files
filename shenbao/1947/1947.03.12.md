### China's Internal Affairs Not to be Interfered With, Opposes Inclusion in Meeting Agenda - Foreign Minister Wang's Statement on the Soviet Moscow Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the Moscow Conference on the 11th:

Foreign dispatches report that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has suggested that the China issue be included on the agenda of the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Chinese government has not yet received any official notification regarding this matter. However, regarding this issue, the Chinese government had previously made a sincere statement in its note to the four foreign ministers, stating that the agenda of the Moscow Conference should be strictly limited to discussing the German and Austrian peace treaty issues. Any addition of other topics must be decided upon in advance through consultation among the five foreign ministers. This position of China has received the support of the British, French, and American governments, and the Soviet government, in its own note, has not expressed any disagreement on this point.

It is an undeniable fundamental principle that the internal affairs of any member state are absolutely not to be discussed in a foreign ministers' conference, and such issues must not become the object of agreement among other member states.

Under no circumstances can the Chinese government agree to include China's internal affairs on the agenda of a foreign ministers' meeting. [Another dispatch] American Ambassador Stuart R. Smith called on Minister Wang Shijie on the 11th to discuss matters.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] President of the Legislative Yuan, Dr. Sun Ke, stated in an interview with our agency today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's suggestion that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers discuss the China issue in Moscow is an "unfriendly act, at the very least containing an insulting attitude." Any suggestion to discuss the China issue without the participation of Chinese representatives will certainly be opposed by China. China firmly opposes any international interference in China's internal affairs, be it by the United States, the Soviet Union, or any other country. China is not an international colony. US Secretary of State Marshall's statement that the China issue should not be discussed without the presence of Chinese representatives is quite correct. When asked whether Molotov's unexpected suggestion indicated that the Soviet Union would openly support the Chinese Communists, President Sun replied, "Perhaps that is the intention, but in any case, this suggestion constitutes interference in China's internal affairs."

### Molotov Proposes Discussing the China Issue - Marshall Says the US Cannot Agree

[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 11th Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their second meeting at 8:00 AM (Eastern Standard Time) on the 11th. Molotov rejected the suggestion that China be invited to participate in the meeting, arguing that China did not participate in the 1945 Moscow Three-Power Agreement. On the other hand, Molotov firmly demanded that the China issue be included on the agenda. Furthermore, the Soviet side stated that Marshall had in principle agreed that the foreign ministers' conference could discuss the China issue, which the US side denied on the 11th.

[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 12th, 2:00 AM Broadcast: At the second meeting of the foreign ministers' conference, Molotov again requested a discussion of the China issue. It is reported that this foreign ministers' conference must discuss the Far East issue. If the previously agreed points can be observed, it will not only benefit US-Soviet relations but also contribute to the restoration of internal peace in China.

[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters here this afternoon that the United States would oppose the four powers discussing the China issue at this foreign ministers' conference without China's participation.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 10th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov dropped a diplomatic bomb at the opening session of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference today, proposing that the China issue be included on the agenda. US Secretary of State Marshall, looking surprised, immediately stated his opinion, saying that he could not express his attitude on this suggestion until the 11th, and adding that this issue could not be properly discussed without the participation of Chinese representatives. Molotov, however, believed that the participation of Chinese representatives was unnecessary. He then argued that the China issue could be included as a supplementary topic for discussion. When Molotov raised the China issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault remained silent. Following Marshall's suggestion, it was decided to postpone further discussion until the 11th. It should be noted that China is one of the five powers in the Potsdam Foreign Ministers' Conference, yet the Soviet Union is now insisting on excluding China from participating in any international conferences. For example, after Japan's surrender, when the first four-power conference was convened in London in September 1945, the Soviet Union was the first to refuse China's participation. At the second meeting held in Moscow, only Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union participated. China did not participate in the third meeting held in Paris to discuss the peace treaty with the Axis satellite countries, nor in the fourth meeting held in New York. As for France, although it did not participate in the December 1945 meeting, Molotov has no intention of refusing French representatives from participating in discussions on the China issue.

Full Text of the Proposal

[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] The full text of Molotov's proposal, made at the first meeting of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, to add the China issue to the agenda is as follows:

"The Soviet delegation has a proposal regarding the agenda of the conference."

"As is well known, at the 1945 Moscow Conference, the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed on the necessity for China, under the leadership of the National Government, to implement unification and democratization, to cease the civil war, and to reorganize the government on a broad basis, so that all democratic elements should be included in the various organizations of the Chinese democratic government."

"The foreign ministers also agreed to adhere to the principle of non-interference in China's internal affairs."

"Regarding the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops stationed in China within the shortest possible time after the completion of their missions, the US and Soviet foreign ministers also reached detailed agreements."

"However, since the 1945 Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the situation in China has not improved. Therefore, the Soviet government proposes that the foreign ministers' conference should hear a report from the participants of the previous Moscow China agreement on how they have implemented their resolutions."

The communique concluded by stating that US Secretary of State Marshall had "agreed to include this issue on the agenda," but he requested that it not be discussed immediately, "in order to study the procedures for discussing this issue."

### Opening of the Shen'an Road

[Central News Agency, Andong, 11th] The Pan'an Railway officially reopened on the 10th, restoring the state before the 24th of last month. At 8:00 AM and 9:30 AM, two passenger trains departed from Andong Station one after another, carrying many passengers who boarded with great excitement to head west. However, this time the Shen'an route still requires two days, and passengers will inevitably have to spend a night in Gongyuan or Benxi. Direct trains will definitely be realized by the end of April at the latest.

### Ambassador Gu Issues Statement - Expresses Surprise at Soviet Foreign Minister's Suggestion, Believes This Action Violates the UN Charter

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun, in his formal statement today commenting on Molotov's suggestion to include the China issue on the agenda of the foreign ministers' conference, stated: This matter is quite surprising, as the suggestion was not discussed with China beforehand. Gu stated: Non-interference in the internal affairs of a country is a principle already stipulated by international law and included in the UN Charter. Gu continued: China already does not understand why China was not included in the Moscow conference, as according to the Potsdam Agreement, China is a member of the foreign ministers' conference. However, regarding its own issues, according to international etiquette and friendship, China should have been consulted first, and in any case, any discussion regarding China should invite China to participate. Currently, the governments of the participating countries of the Moscow conference are also well aware of the strong feelings of the Chinese people on this matter. It would be inconceivable for the conference to proceed with any discussions directly related to China without China's participation.

However, this spring offensive by the Communist army has revealed the shortfalls. Shortcomings include failing to capture Songhua River , head fort, and failure to use new weapons. These are good examples. The National Army may not attack Harbin at present.

### Authoritative American Public Opinion Advocates for Substantial Aid to China - Hopes Our Country Will Eliminate Obstacles to Peace

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] According to diplomatic sources, the attitude of authoritative American public opinion towards the China issue seems to have undergone some changes recently. For example: (1) The New York Times editorial stated that China urgently needs US assistance, and the purpose of US assistance should be to increase the self-sufficiency and productive capacity of the Chinese people. (2) The Los Angeles Times pointed out that the CCP can only forcibly promote communism through military force, but its plunder of agricultural products and oppression of farmers runs counter to its purpose. The Chinese government only needs to implement the constitution and carry out reorganization, even without the participation of the Communist Party, and Americans believe that it will definitely make progress and are still willing to provide assistance. (3) The Chicago Daily News editorial emphasized that Chairman Chiang must first strive to unify China before he can begin his construction work, and the US policy towards China should only know to aim at assisting the construction of a new China, regardless of what obstacles it encounters, it must always persist in order to achieve thoroughness. Judging from the discussions of the above newspapers, Americans have almost become impatient with the CCP's destruction of Chinese peace, obstruction of Chinese unification, and indirectly hindering the development of international trade. Their desire for China to reorganize its government and complete unification is becoming increasingly urgent.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 11th] Reliable sources claim that the American Committee for a Free China has today submitted a letter to President Truman and other dignitaries, urging the US government to reconsider its previous decision and allow the Chinese government to purchase military supplies and ammunition worth $75 million. The committee pointed out that after the failure of US mediation in China, the Chinese government must recover the Northeast and Taiwan. Therefore, the United States should no longer refuse to provide military equipment, which is necessary to restore domestic order and recover territory, which is what the late President Roosevelt guaranteed to China according to the Cairo Declaration.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] It is widely rumored here that the Soviet side may notify our side on the 12th that the Soviet army will evacuate Jinzhou and Dalian. It is also heard that the Soviet side in Dalian once told our compatriots that Dalian and Jinzhou and other places would be returned to our side on the 15th of this month.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 11th] According to a Shenyang dispatch: According to the agreement between China and the Soviet military authorities in Lushun, the Chinese government is scheduled to take over Dalian on March 15. It is heard that the first batch of special police teams to enter Dalian to maintain order were specially trained in Shenyang for several months. They are now awaiting final notification from the Soviet side. According to military sources here, there are some indications that the Communist army may prevent the National Army from entering Dalian.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] There may be a new situation in Dalian and Lushun in the near future, because people in relevant circles have this argument based on (1) the grain and food in Dalian and Lushun is about to run out, and (2) the moving work in a certain area has reached a considerable extent.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Northeast Headquarters Chief of Staff Dong Yingbin, Liaoning Province Chairman Xu Zhen, and Northeast Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Su Jianfei flew to Beijing at 9:00 AM on the 11th. The purpose of this trip is purely to ask the highest authorities for instructions on important issues such as the takeover of Dalian.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Proposal - The Ministry of Finance May Not Issue Large Denomination Banknotes - Amendment to the Commodity Tax Regulations Draft

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] At the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting this morning, after 40 minutes of heated discussion and debate, it passed the proposal of members Lou Tongsun, Tan Tiwu, Dai Xiujun, Liu Tong, and others to suggest that the Supreme National Defense Council strictly order the Ministry of Finance to immediately stop issuing banknotes with a face value of 10,000 yuan and absolutely not issue banknotes with a face value of more than 10,000 yuan. The reason for this is that the government's various efforts to stabilize prices over the years have not yet achieved the expected results. The issuance of the new customs gold coupons of 250 yuan and 500 yuan has not been long, and recently the issuance of large denominations of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan of legal tender has been seen. The efforts to stabilize prices cannot avoid having an offsetting effect, and may even be sufficient to stimulate price increases. It is difficult to implement the original intention of the economic emergency measures program and achieve the preliminary goal of stabilizing prices and securing the market. Therefore, it is proposed to suggest that the Supreme National Defense Council strictly order the Ministry of Finance to immediately stop issuing banknotes with a face value of more than 10,000 yuan, and absolutely not issue banknotes with a face value of more than 10,000 yuan thereafter, in order to save the economic crisis. At today's regular meeting, chaired by President Sun, in addition to the above case, (1) the report of the Legal System Committee on reviewing the draft regulations on free education subsidies for the children of revolutionary anti-war meritorious people, (2) the report of the Legal System Committee on reviewing the draft amendment to Article 8 of the Organizational Law of the National Government Military Participation Office, (3) the report of the Economic Committee and the Legal System Committee on reviewing the draft amendment to the Organizational Regulations of the Technical Workers Training Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, (4) the report of the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee on reviewing the draft amendment to the various articles of the Commodity Tax Regulations, (5) The Finance Committee and the Legal System Committee reported on reviewing the draft Organization Law of the Ministry of Finance .

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The draft amendment to the various articles of the Commodity Tax Regulations was passed at the 317th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th. The most important point of this amendment is that the ad valorem tax rate on cotton yarn has been increased from the original 5% to 7%. The Ministry of Finance originally wanted to increase it to 10%. During the review, the legislators agreed that the ad valorem tax rate on cotton yarn was only 3.5% last year. Now, in order to increase tax revenue, it should be appropriately increased, but if it is raised to 10%, it will be too high. The decision was made to change it to 7%. During the discussion at today's meeting, Yu Zhenying opposed the increase. Finally, it was decided to pass it according to the review opinion. Liu Youchen, a new legislator and social leader, believed that the ad valorem tax on cosmetics of 45% seemed too low and advocated raising it, but after discussion, it was still passed according to the original plan.

### Establishment of the Textile Management Committee - Without Legislative Procedures

### Lei Zhen Stays in Shanghai

Waiting for Jiang Yun's Telegram from Hong Kong

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lei Zhen did not travel yesterday because he was waiting for a telegram from Jiang Yuntian, and he hoped that members Wu Xianzih and Li Daming could fly to Shanghai from Hong Kong. However, if there are no other important matters, he will decide to return to Beijing today. The sole mission of Lei's visit to Shanghai this time was to urge the Democratic Socialist Party to send someone to Hong Kong to invite Wu Xianzih to Shanghai to discuss matters. Because Wu's position is important, if he does not oppose joining the government, the Democratic Socialist Party can submit a list of participation in the National Government and the Executive Yuan in a very short period of time.

[Another dispatch] Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party and Jianweichu Yi An, who was released, took a plane to Hong Kong at 10:00 AM yesterday to invite Wu Xianzih and Li Daming to Shanghai to discuss the major plan of joining the government. Before leaving, Jiang told Gao Zhen to send an urgent telegram to Shanghai after arriving in Hong Kong to report everything. The date of return to Shanghai is either today or this Friday. It is heard that Zhang Junmai and Xu Chuanlin both wrote letters to Wu Xianzih, urging him to visit Shanghai. According to relevant sources, Wu Xianzih may come to Shanghai this time, but he strongly advocates joining the local government at the same time, and believes that joining the central government alone is an "unwise" move.

### The Ministry of National Defense Will Hold - Group Wedding for Officers

### The Case of Principals of All Levels of Schools - Concurrently Serving as Public Opinion Representatives - Heated Debate Erupted During the Legislative Yuan Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] A heated debate arose during the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 11th when discussing the case of principals of all levels of schools concurrently serving as public opinion representatives. Situ De and others believed that the atmosphere of officials should not invade the public opinion organs, and that principals of public schools should not concurrently serve as senators, etc. Chen Hong held a dissenting opinion, believing that there were not many intellectuals in various places, and those who held the position of principal must be enlightened and prestigious people. If they were asked to resign as principals and serve as representatives, their lives would become a problem. In fact, many university presidents have served as members of the National Political Council. Why be so generous here and stingy there? Jian Guansan also believed that if there were no such enlightened people participating in the public opinion organs, they would inevitably be completely controlled by local tyrants, and that this matter involved too much and should be delayed for discussion. The majority of the audience agreed and decided to delay the discussion of the case.

Subsequently, Mr. Wu Guozhen reported on the situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai.

Editorial

### Oppose Interference! Protest Insults!

On the first day of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Molotov requested that the China issue be included on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference. What is the Soviet Union's intention? It is truly perplexing, not only beyond our expectations but also unanticipated by US Secretary of State General Marshall, who had to express surprise. Molotov's proposal is tantamount to throwing a bomb into the diplomatic world, shaking the peace of the entire world, not only arousing the indignation of the people of our country but also causing righteous people around the world to feel injustice.

When Molotov made this proposal, he explained it at the Foreign Ministers Conference, saying: "At the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union unanimously agreed that China should implement democratic politics and maintain unity under the leadership of the National Government, with the broad participation of all democratic elements in the various government agencies, and should immediately stop the civil strife; at the same time, the three foreign ministers solemnly declared their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. In addition, the US and Soviet foreign ministers also established an agreement that both countries were willing to withdraw their troops from China as soon as their obligations and responsibilities were completed, without delay. However, since then, the situation in China has not improved. Therefore, the Soviet government proposes that the representatives of all countries participating in the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference should report to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the results of the implementation of this resolution."

This kind of specious argument cannot stand up to scrutiny, whether legally or morally. As Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke told a reporter from the Associated Press, Molotov's proposal was "an unfriendly act, or at least an attitude that insults China." Regarding the Soviet Union's intention, let us set it aside for now and state our views from a legal perspective.

First, on the eve of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, our foreign affairs authorities had already notified the four foreign ministers, expressing the hope that the agenda of this Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference would be limited to European issues, and that if any agreement on China or the Far East was to be established, the consent of the Chinese government must be obtained in advance. The four governments did not express any objection to this, which can be regarded as tacit consent. Now, Molotov suddenly demands that the China issue be included on the agenda and resolutely refuses to invite Chinese representatives to participate. What reason is there to speak of?

Second, according to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, the so-called Foreign Ministers Conference is composed of the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. China is qualified to participate in all previous Foreign Ministers Conferences. However, as of now, China has only participated in the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference once, and that conference ended unhappily due to the Soviet Union's opposition to China's participation in discussions on European issues. China did not participate in the subsequent Second Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow, nor did it participate in the Third in Paris and the Fourth in New York due to Soviet opposition. In December of last year, US Secretary of State Byrnes advocated inviting China to attend the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, but it failed to materialize due to the Soviet Union's objections. In February of this year, when the Four Foreign Vice Ministers Conference discussed whether China should convene a meeting on the German peace treaty, the Soviet representative Gusev, disregarding the opposition of the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, insisted on his consistent position of not recognizing China as the convener of the German peace conference. All of this shows that the Soviet Union's attitude towards China not only violates the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement but also openly insults China's international status. Therefore, Molotov's proposal is a deliberate tactic to insult China.

Third, this Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference is fundamentally different in nature from the previous Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference. The 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference was convened after the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference ended unhappily. Its purpose was to enable the three powers to reach an understanding and coordination on all international issues, thereby opening up the stalemate in Europe and the Far East. Therefore, the issues discussed were very broad, almost touching on all post-war issues. However, the agenda of this Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference had already been decided at the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference last year, with the drafting of peace treaties with Germany and Austria as its sole topic. Now, Molotov suddenly raises the China issue, which is tantamount to neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial. Its impact will not only arouse the indignation of the Chinese people but also break the harmonious atmosphere in the international community on the eve of the conference, making this Foreign Ministers Conference even less likely to succeed. It is certainly not a wise move.

From this perspective, Molotov's proposal has no basis in law, needless to say. Furthermore, examining the content of his proposal reveals Molotov's specious arguments. According to the communique issued by the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the portion concerning the China issue stipulates three points: (1) The foreign ministers of the three countries exchanged views on the situation in China and unanimously agreed that there should be a democratic and unified China under the leadership of the National Government, with the broad participation of domestic democratic elements in the various government agencies, and civil war should be stopped immediately; (2) The foreign ministers of the three countries reiterated their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs; (3) The US and Soviet foreign ministers agreed that the troops of both countries in China should withdraw from China as soon as their obligations and responsibilities were completed, without delay.

Regarding the first point, the common opinion of the foreign ministers of the three countries on China is precisely what our government and people have been hoping for day and night. The Chinese government had already been moving towards this goal of peaceful unification before the December 1945 Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and it spared no effort to seek peace and compromise, conducting peace talks with the Chinese Communists in an effort to achieve peaceful unification through political means. However, after more than a year of peace talks, they ultimately broke down due to the Chinese Communists' insistence on conditions and their ambition to seize power by force. As a result, the intended goal has not yet been achieved. However, in order to demonstrate its spirit of doing its best, regardless of the attitude of the Chinese Communists, the government continues to move towards this goal. Now, apart from the Chinese Communists and the Democratic League, most of the domestic democratic elements have joined the government, and "the broad participation of domestic democratic elements in the various government agencies" will soon be fully realized.

As for the second level, the foreign ministers of the three countries solemnly declared their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. We must point out that Molotov's proposal is clear evidence that the Soviet Union has failed to fulfill this promise. The Chinese people have their own way of solving the China problem and do not need Molotov to worry about it. As for our country's request for the United States to mediate, it was out of our country's own free will, so we welcomed the United States to China to mediate. When it declared that it would give up mediation, we did not force it. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as the United States interfering in China's internal affairs. Now, at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, our foreign affairs authorities have already stated that they do not want the China issue to be included on the agenda, but the Soviet foreign minister insists on raising it and resolutely refuses to allow Chinese representatives to participate in the discussion. Is this not interfering in China's internal affairs? How can it be confused with the United States mediating in our domestic disputes?

Regarding the last point, the US troops stationed in China have gradually completed their mission and have already been withdrawing from China in batches. What about the Soviet troops? Not only has their mission long been completed, but their withdrawal from China should also have been implemented long ago. However, the Soviet troops in Lushun and Dalian remain stationed there! Therefore, we must point out that the country that has violated the declaration of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference is not the United States, but the Soviet Union itself!

In short, why does the Soviet Union want to oppose our country's participation in international conferences everywhere? Why does Molotov dare to insult China to this extent? These questions are certainly worth our deep reflection and vigilance. However, the Soviet Union's repeated insults to its former allies are absolutely intolerable to the people of our country. Although we cherish the friendship between China and the Soviet Union very much, we cannot accept insults submissively. Therefore, we must loudly call out: Oppose international interference and protest Molotov's insulting attitude, so that the Soviet authorities can also understand that the national spirit of China cannot be humiliated!

### Ministry of Finance Formulates Measures for the Disposal of Foreign Deposits, Encouraging Depositors to Report to the Government Voluntarily

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 11th] The issue of using private deposits abroad has been addressed by the Ministry of Finance, which has formulated measures and submitted them to the National Defense Supreme Committee. Once the National Defense Committee approves them, they will be promulgated and implemented. It is learned that the principle of these measures is to encourage depositors to voluntarily report to the government within three months after the measures are promulgated, then apply to foreign banks, and immediately deposit the original currency into the Central Bank of China domestically. If depositors have legitimate needs, such as purchasing production machinery, starting businesses, or for their children to study abroad and travel expenses, they can apply to the government for approval and withdrawal in accordance with legal procedures. At the same time, the measures also stipulate penalties for depositors who fail to report within the specified time limit. It is also learned that the total amount of our deposits abroad may exceed US$300 million, with the largest amounts in North and South America, followed by the United Kingdom, and then Switzerland and other countries.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting: Both Serious and Humorous - A Record of the Debate on the Suspension of Issuing Large Denomination Notes, Lou Tongsun's Impassioned Speech, Zhou Yizhi's Humorous Anecdotes

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 11th] The proposal to suspend the issuance of large denomination notes (10,000 yuan) was raised at the routine meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th, sparking an interesting debate that led the entire venue to argue over this important issue concerning people's livelihoods in an atmosphere that was both serious and humorous. Some members, due to differing opinions, glared at each other and refused to yield. Finally, thanks to the calm analysis and impassioned speech of Lou Tongsun, the original proposer, it was passed by a majority vote.

This important proposal was jointly submitted by twelve legislators. After the proposal was raised, Lou Tongsun, the original proposer, explained that the government's issuance of large denomination notes had its own financial reasons, but one of the reasons was that the printing cost of 1,000 and 2,000 yuan notes was too high. However, we should point out that the impact of the state's suffering for printing small denomination notes is insignificant compared to the economic losses suffered by the people due to the issuance of large denomination notes. People often rely on intuition to deal with economic problems, and large denomination notes are enough to stimulate people's minds, so they should be issued with caution. Lou also pointed out that Dai Xiujun and others had suggested that the Legislative Yuan formulate an issuance law to limit the amount of legal tender issued.

Dai Xiujun then spoke, explaining that while there is a need for the rule of law in politics, there should also be the rule of law in economics. If an issuance law can be formulated, it can have a great stabilizing effect.

At this point, the opposition faction rose to refute. Wang Yuxiang pointed out that large denomination notes are convenient to carry and the printing cost is also low. In this era of malignant inflation, the issuance of large denomination notes is not a major problem.

Chen Xiaocen believes that the main problem at present is how to balance the budget. Without this plan, simply starting with the suspension of issuing large denomination notes is tantamount to burying one's head in the sand.

Zhou Yizhi told a "joke" to illustrate the convenience of large denomination notes. He claimed that recently, four or five people went to a dance hall in Shanghai, expecting that less than one million yuan would not be enough to enjoy themselves. They felt it was inconvenient to carry, so they planned to pack it in a small box and carry it by car. After dancing, the driver would count the money and pay the bill. If there were large denomination notes, this would not happen.

Wei Tingsheng also believes that this proposal is a "stopgap measure among stopgap measures," tantamount to removing the patient's thermometer from the bedside for fear of stimulating the patient.

Chen Ruxuan and others disagreed, pointing out, "If it is said that this move is burying one's head in the sand, then issuing banknotes without reserves is not even more of a case of burying one's head in the sand?" If this proposal can be adopted by the government, it will surely have the effect of stabilizing people's minds. There is no reason to oppose it hastily."

Lou Tongsun rose again to speak, refuting Yizhi and others' argument about convenience of carrying, pointing out that one should not be greedy for personal convenience and ignore the adverse psychological impact it has on the national economy. During the War of Resistance, the story of the issuance of 500 yuan notes affecting people's minds and stimulating prices is something that those who were in the rear at the time should remember. Even in recent events, the issuance of 250 yuan and 500 yuan Customs Gold Units (關金券) ultimately led to the recent surge in gold prices. These tragic lessons should not be forgotten. We must not fail to do this just because it is "a small good thing." We should do everything that is beneficial to daily economic phenomena, let alone something that is so easy to do?

Zhong Tianxin cited the situation in Shantou and Guangzhou to explain that many places across the country still use small denomination notes. In Shantou today, you can still rent a foreign house for 3,000 yuan and hire a nanny for 5,000 yuan a month. Our vision should encompass the whole country, and remote locations should also be taken into account. We should not only pay attention to Beijing and Shanghai. We should know what kind of impact the issuance of large denomination notes will have on countless ordinary people across the country.

At this point, the members scrambled to speak, with three or five people standing up at the same time, either glaring or clenching their fists. President Sun could only smile at this.

Finally, Lou Tongsun put forward his most powerful argument, explaining that national credit depends on the amount of currency in circulation. If it is constantly increasing, it will not only lose its stabilizing effect but also destroy national credit itself. He also said that this proposal has positive significance in its negative aspects, because if the government adopts it, those in power will not spend extravagantly.

The discussion reached this point, and it was already twelve o'clock. The president then announced the vote, and the result was that it was passed by a majority of forty-four votes.

### Second Day of Foreign Ministers' Conference Reviews Allied Control Council Report; US Suggests Reducing European Occupation Forces

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] The four foreign ministers held their second day of meetings this afternoon and immediately reviewed the report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] The four deputy foreign ministers met at 10:00 AM (Moscow time) this morning to review the 700-page report of the Allied Control Council for Germany, in order to save the time of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. At Marshall's request, the deputy ministers will prepare a concise outline of the report for use in today's Foreign Ministers' Conference. The representatives present were Vyshinsky (Soviet Union), Murphy (United States), Strang (United Kingdom), and Couve de Murville (France). Meanwhile, the four foreign ministers' representatives also met today on the Austrian question, attended by Gusev (Soviet Union), Clark (United States), Baaris (France), and Hoot (United Kingdom).

[Reuters, Moscow, 10th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference opened today and reached an agreement on dissolving Prussia, the cradle of German militarism. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov then first raised the China issue, advocating its inclusion on the agenda (see page one). Marshall indicated that he would not be able to give a definite answer until Tuesday. Marshall later suggested that the conference should discuss the issue of limiting the number of Allied occupation zones in Europe. Molotov replied that since Marshall needed 24 hours to give a definite answer on the China issue, he would also need 24 hours to answer on the suggestion of limiting occupation forces. The meeting lasted 40 minutes, and the four foreign ministers agreed to adopt the six agenda items decided upon at the New York Foreign Ministers Conference. The first item to be discussed was the report of the Allied Control Council for Germany, and the last item was the Austrian question. The representatives of the four foreign ministers decided to discuss the most appropriate way to review the Allied Control Council report on Tuesday morning, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference was scheduled to convene every day at 1:00 PM standard time (9:00 PM Shanghai time). The issue of Prussia and another suggestion to discuss the report of the Trieste Free Territory Financial Committee at an early date were both proposed by the United Kingdom.

The meeting place, the Aviation Club, is a white building located on a tree-lined avenue. Entering the building is a marble hall with ten giant pillars on both sides, followed by a lounge, and then the conference room. The seats of the representatives of each country at the conference table were arranged as follows: Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky; Foreign Minister Molotov; interpreter; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev; Dulles, advisor to the US delegation; Cohen, Counselor of the State Department; Marshall, Counselor of the State Department; Assistant Bohlen; US Ambassador Smith; Murphy, Political Advisor to the US Military Government in Germany; Alphand, Director of the External Economic Affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Couve de Murville, Director of External Political Affairs; Foreign Minister Bidault; French Ambassador Jaddru; Haduven, Political Advisor to the French Military Government; British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson; Baquan, Director of External Economic Affairs; Foreign Secretary Bevin; interpreter; Bevin's private secretary Dixon; and Lord Hoot. More than 30 experts and staff members sat behind Molotov.

### Molotov's Proposal Surprises US Officials; US Congressman Judd Criticizes Soviet Overreach

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Washington officials today believe that Molotov's suggestion to include the situation in China on the formal agenda is indeed surprising. US Representative Judd stated that he opposes submitting the China issue to the Moscow conference. He pointed out that agreements on China were reached at the 1945 Moscow Three-Power Conference and the Yalta Conference, but these agreements, especially the Dalian case, have been severely violated. Judd stated that there is no reason to discuss the China issue in Moscow. All that is needed is for the Soviet Union to implement its previous agreements. China has fought for many years to achieve independence in its diplomacy. It is strange for the China issue to be discussed by the four powers. If they really do so, then they are overstepping their bounds.

[Central News Agency, New York, 11th, Special Dispatch] American radio commentators today were the first to comment on Molotov's raising the China issue at the Moscow conference. They believe that the Soviet Foreign Minister's move is aimed at putting his opponent, the United States, in an awkward position, thereby enhancing the Soviet Union's "bargaining" position. In the European issue, Molotov personally felt the embarrassment caused by issues such as German reparations and reducing occupation forces. Therefore, he raised the China issue today as a "bargaining" chip. Molotov also seems to be buying time because he first needs time to observe the final decisions of the US government and Congress on the Mediterranean and the Middle East (especially Greece and Turkey), and the reactions of various countries to the decisions made by the United States, before deciding what kind of demands or concessions the Soviet Union should make in the peace treaties with Germany and Austria.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] French radio commentators here recently analyzed Molotov's motives for the proposal on the China issue, believing that there are three goals: (1) to put the Soviet Union in a favorable position when the China issue is brought to a head; (2) to make the United States admit its failure in mediation in China; (3) to prepare the foundation for a round-table conference to solve this issue.

### Czechoslovakia and Poland Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty; Stipulating a Validity Period of Thirty Years

[Agence France-Presse, Czech Capital, 10th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that Czechoslovakia and Poland signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries in Warsaw today. Its main purpose is to ensure the security and defense of the two countries against the threat of Germany. In addition to signing the treaty, the representatives of both sides also signed an appendix today, with three main points: (1) Both parties agree to resolve existing territorial disputes within two years; (2) The two countries will conclude economic and cultural agreements in the near future; (3) Both parties provide promises to ensure the rights and free development of the Czech minority in Poland and the Polish minority in the Czech Republic on a reciprocal basis. The treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries has a validity period of twenty years.

### Foreign Guests' Strange Costumes Arouse Great Interest from Russians; Used to Eating Rationed Food, They Now Dare to Feast

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The British and French representatives at the Foreign Ministers' Conference are arousing interest among the Russians. British costumes are particularly striking in Moscow. They wear brown uniform coats, similar to those often worn by Soviet chauffeurs, with white fur hats, like shepherds from the Caucasus. In the eyes of the Russians, the British look like actors who have just come off stage from the opera house. Most Russians travel far to the city center just to see them. Fortunately, Bevin, the head of the British delegation, does not dress like his staff members. He wears a gray old coat and a narrow-brimmed, dented hat, which conforms to the image of a diplomat in the minds of ordinary Russians. Most members of the British delegation are used to eating rationed food at home. When they come to Moscow, they gorge themselves, attracting the attention of the restaurant waiters. A Moscow hotel waiter said, "The food shortage in Britain must be more severe than elsewhere. You can tell just by watching these people devour their food." What is noteworthy about the French delegation are the female staff members and stenographers. They wear wide trousers, leather jackets, and no hats, running across the cold streets. A Russian said: "If you combine these women with the British delegation, they become a perfect masquerade troupe."

### US Decides to Remain in Korea Until the Mission is Completed; State Department Assistant Clarifies Policy on Radio

[Agence France-Presse, Detroit, 10th] Hiltring, Assistant Secretary of the US State Department, stated in a radio broadcast today that in the US-occupied zone in Korea, we will clearly show to North Korea, the Soviet Union, and other countries around the world what achievements the American democracy will have in the economic, political, and social reconstruction of a country that has suffered forty years of slavery. The United States is sincere in providing assistance to the democratic people who hope for true freedom and independence. This is obvious to all the Korean people. The problems that we must deal with in Korea constitute a fierce challenge to the United States. It would be a big mistake for the United States to ignore the situation in Korea. The struggle for control of Korea was the main cause of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. Japan gained a base to invade Northeast China by controlling Korea, and advanced step by step, eventually attacking Pearl Harbor. In order to prevent Korea from becoming a base for future aggression again, we must make Korea a free, democratic, and autonomous country. This is a factor in maintaining stability in the East. The plan that the United States intends to implement in Korea requires the patience of the Korean people. The United States must find a new basis for its understanding with the Soviet Union. In short, the US plan can be summarized as follows: (1) Reviving Korean industry; (2) Developing Korean commerce; (3) Educating the Korean people.

Artificial Boundaries Must Be Broken

Hiltring continued: The Moscow Agreement of 1945 stipulated that Korea be divided into two zones. This boundary was originally intended as a temporary measure. However, today, ten months later, this artificial and temporary boundary still exists, like a stone wall hindering the unification of Korea. The United States and the Soviet Union also have major differences of opinion on the establishment of a temporary government in Korea, because the two sides have different interpretations of the word "democracy". The United States believes that representatives of all Korean parties should be consulted, while the Soviet Union believes that all Koreans who oppose the Moscow Agreement should be excluded. However, although the unification of Korea has failed, the US government has not been discouraged and remains resolutely optimistic. We will remain in Korea until the walls of suspicion are destroyed and the new Korea is politically independent and economically self-sufficient.

### Ambassador Fu Bingchang Meets with Bidault and Smith

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th] Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, paid a visit to French Foreign Minister Bidault and US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith this morning. Each meeting lasted about half an hour.

### Palestine Issue

British and American Foreign Ministers to Hold Consultations

[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] Regarding the Palestine issue, officials have announced that the British Foreign Secretary intends to meet separately with US Secretary of State Marshall to discuss this issue. The British representative to the Security Council, Cadogan, will notify Foreign Secretary Bevin of any news related to the Palestine issue at any time.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie yesterday assigned the staff of the secretariat of the Palestine issue study committee. As for the organization of the committee itself, it is expected that Lie will propose that it be composed of the five permanent members of the Security Council, namely China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, and three non-permanent members, namely Brazil, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden.

### US Controls Atomic Program; Returned to Atomic Energy Commission for Discussion; Soviet Amendments Rejected in Security Council

[Associated Press, Lake Success, New York, 10th] The United Nations Security Council decided today to order the Atomic Energy Commission to promptly draft detailed rules for the atomic energy control plan and to complete the report by September 16. The amendments proposed by the Soviet Union have been rejected. US Representative Austin and Soviet Representative Gromyko debated the wording of the instruction for an hour before the representatives voted unanimously to return this difficult issue to the Atomic Energy Commission. According to Gromyko, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, he needs to give this matter careful consideration before deciding when to convene the first meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission. Earlier, Austin gave a 20-minute speech, accusing the Soviet Union's proposal to control atomic energy would create a competition in atomic armaments and would cause war. Austin changed his past optimistic attitude and spoke in a depressed tone: The Soviet Union's atomic energy plan will inevitably be opposed by the United States because this plan cannot guarantee security in a positive sense, and it is sufficient to cause mutual distrust and war in a negative sense. The Soviet Union's suggestion to destroy atomic weapons before organizing an international investigation agency cannot prevent the competition of atomic weapons. Austin spoke in an optimistic tone when requesting the Security Council to return the entire issue to the Atomic Energy Commission: When the committee completes the technical details, some serious conflicts of opinion may be resolved. Austin absolutely denied that the United States had any intention of monopolizing atomic energy. French Representative Parodi complained that Gromyko raised too many "exceptions" to the US plan, which caused the current problems. Parodi also said that Gromyko not only criticized the United States, but also criticized all the representatives of the committee who passed the US proposal with a vote of ten to zero. The new council members of the Security Council, Belgium and Colombia, also made their first speeches today, stating that they both agreed with the US proposal.

Lilienthal to Head US Atomic Energy Commission

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] The Senate Atomic Energy Committee today approved the appointment of Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission by a vote of eight to one.

### Soviet National Defense Expenditure Huge; Accounts for One-Third of the Total Budget

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Military experts in this area analyzed the Soviet Union's national defense budget for this year, believing that the actual number will account for one-third of the government's total expenditure (equivalent to US$74.28 billion), rather than 18%, equivalent to US$13.4 billion, as claimed by Moscow Radio. To analyze the Soviet budget, it is necessary to pay attention to two facts: (1) Items that should be included in military expenditure in the US budget are included in non-military expenditure items in the Soviet Union; (2) Because the Soviet Union implements a controlled economy, the purchasing power of its budget expenditure is higher than that of other governments. There are other points worth noting: (1) A large part of the elite national defense forces may be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with an expenditure of US$2.83 billion. (2) At least US$1.3 billion of the scientific research fund is used for military purposes; (3) In addition to federal expenditure in the budget, each republic of the Soviet Union stipulates military expenditure separately; (4) The construction of military facilities is said to be handled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and political prisoners and prisoners of war are conscripted on a large scale without paying wages; (5) The heavy industry budget includes the cost of manufacturing military weapons; (6) Military uniforms and other similar military supplies are also included in industrial expenditure; (7) The agricultural budget includes a portion of military rations.

### Truman and Congressional Leaders Carefully Discuss the Middle East Situation; Will Clearly Explain US Policy on Greece

[United Press, Washington, 10th] President Truman is scheduled to deliver a speech at a joint session of the House and Senate tomorrow, in which he will clearly state the US attitude toward the entire Middle East region where communism is attempting to expand its influence, including the aid to Greece and aid to Turkey plans. Prior to this, the President consulted with key members of both major parties in Congress to seek their support. This speech by the President will be the first public statement since receiving the British note and Greece's emergency plea for help. It is expected that the President will propose to lend US$250 million to Greece to support its government and to transfer the surplus US military supplies in Germany to strengthen the Greek army to fight against the communist-trained guerrillas.

The President may also propose to lend Turkey the same amount of money when necessary. According to a member of Congress, the United States may give Turkey a loan of 150 million US dollars, part of which can be used to purchase the surplus US military supplies in Europe. Some members of Congress also expect that the President will ask Congress to allow the same military and financial assistance to Italy. The decision of Congress on the President's proposal will have a very significant impact on the future, and its importance may be comparable to the decision of the United States to abolish the Neutrality Act and pass the Lend-Lease Act before entering the war.

### Bomb Thrown Immediately After Speech; Philippine President Narrowly Escapes Assassination; A Barber Arrested and Confesses to Assassination Attempt

[Associated Press, Manila, 11th] Philippine President Roxas delivered a speech in the central square of the city last night, approving the "Equal Treatment Amendment" when he was suddenly assassinated by someone throwing a grenade. Forty-five minutes after the incident, the police arrested a suspect, Quirino. The grenade landed next to the President's feet, but fortunately, other officials quickly kicked it three yards away. It exploded without injuring the President and others, but seven people, including the head of the guard, Colonel Tanto, were injured.

[Associated Press, Manila, 11th] Hernandez, the acting chairman of the Philippine Labor Organization Congress and chief editor, was arrested today on suspicion of being involved in Quirino's assassination of President Roxas.

[United Press, Manila, 11th] Quirino, the assassin who attempted to assassinate President Roxas, has fully confessed. Quirino, 50 years old, a barber, confessed in Bilibid Prison this morning that he was sitting under a palm tree about ten yards away from the podium. The grenade was hidden in a peanut bag. When the peanuts were finished, he decided to throw it, but unfortunately, his wrist trembled, and the target was not completely accurate. He originally bought an automatic pistol, but the pistol was stolen a few days ago, and then he obtained two grenades, the source of which is unknown.

According to the police, Quirino originally planned to act during the President's parade and speech in Lucena over the weekend, but later changed his plan midway. The police also escorted Quirino to the scene of the incident to reenact the crime, and then took him to meet Roxas. It is reported that Roxas asked why he did this, and Quirino replied that he believed that the President could not fulfill his past promises, and the country's economic corruption was obviously the responsibility of the President. He regretted that this wish was not fulfilled, and if he had the opportunity, he would try again. It is not yet known whether Quirino has any relationship with the Philippine opposition.

Roxas Talks About Assassination

[United Press, Manila, 11th] President Roxas said yesterday in a lighthearted tone that after the assassin pulled out the pin of the grenade, he waited for a short time and threw it out, causing it to not explode immediately upon landing. At that time, he was lighting a cigarette when he suddenly saw a smoking grenade thrown onto the podium, only a few feet away, and he knew he was in danger. The commander of the military police had jumped in front of him to protect him, and the Speaker of the Senate kicked the grenade off the stage and shouted "Get away!"

### Indonesian Army Breaks Dike; Area Around Surabaya Becomes a Marsh

[Reuters] Tjirilen to Return to Batavia to Mediate

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 11th] According to news received from Batavia today, in the conflict between the Dutch army and the Indonesian army, the Indonesian army used the tactics of breaking the dikes and releasing water, forcing thousands of people to evacuate from the flooded area. A large area near Surabaya has been flooded, and 20,000 acres of rice have no hope of harvesting. According to a Dutch military spokesman, the Dutch are currently negotiating with the Indonesian authorities to stop part of the dike-breaking and water release in Semarang. In Surabaya, the native army, possessing machine guns and Japanese cannons, is said to have penetrated into the Dutch military area.

### British House of Commons Begins Debate on Economic Plan

[Reuters, London, 10th] The House of Commons today began debating the economic plan. The Minister of Commerce, Cripps, spoke on behalf of the government, announcing two major changes in the design of the British industrial economy: first, to strengthen the staff of the economic design; and second, to ensure measures for industrial design cooperation. In the future, all government-related industrial matters will have a dedicated economic design department attached. In addition, a joint design department will be established to coordinate design agencies among various departments. The government will also suggest that labor and management organizations send delegations to meet with government design department officials. He also stated that the government currently has no intention of adopting a large-scale discounted regulatory plan to force exports to be dumped in stable markets, as long-term markets should not be abandoned. Similarly, exports from the Sterling Area will not be shifted to the Dollar Area. The chance of inflation is currently very high, so production must increase, and working hours must not be shortened or wages increased, otherwise the country's position will inevitably worsen. In short, adopting a democratic design to establish a solid foundation for industry and raise the living standards of the people is the nation's top priority.

Conservative Party Member and former Minister of Production in Churchill's cabinet, Lyttelton, criticized the government's controls for failing to be concise and effective, and also criticized the huge deficit in the budget. He finally predicted that national bankruptcy was not far off, and that the people's living standards might fall again by forty percent.

### Fire in the Vast Slums of Zhabei Destroys 160 Shanties, Simple Construction and Incompetent Firefighters, One Child Dies Tragically, Hundreds Homeless

[Report from this newspaper] The area of Baochang Road, Zhongxing Road, and Xiangshan Road in Zhabei was engulfed in a major fire yesterday afternoon. More than 160 shanties were reduced to ashes, and 500 to 600 victims wailed in the streets, a truly tragic scene. A six-year-old child named Chen Zhiyong died in the fire. In addition, Dai Awu was injured and immediately sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital, where he was bandaged and discharged.

The shanties belonged to the 44th Bao of Zhabei. The destroyed houses covered more than four jia. The fire area was as large as 800 square feet, stretching from Baochang Road in the west to Saitong Road in the east, Zhongxing Road in the north, and Xiangshan Road in the south. This vast slum was reduced to scorched earth in less than two hours.

The fire started at the Shanghai School Equipment Company at the corner of Baochang Road and Zhongxing Road at 2:50 PM. Because all the buildings there were mostly wooden sheds and grass huts, and there were many timber yards interspersed among them, once a fire broke out, it quickly spread everywhere and was difficult to put out. Although the Xinzha, Hongkou, and Central fire departments dispatched six fire engines to the scene, they were unable to do anything because the fire had already become a raging inferno. However, the firefighters still bravely went deep into the fire and poured water everywhere. However, the flames rose and fell unpredictably, making the situation extremely dangerous. Because the firefighters went too deep, seven leather belts were pressed into the fire and could not be pulled out. The intensity and speed of the fire's spread can be seen from this.

At the beginning of the fire, residents tried to put it out themselves, but it was ineffective because the houses were mostly made of flammable materials. By the time the fire department's observation post discovered it, the fire had already become too large to control.

At that time, the residents of the shantytown were in chaos, with the elderly, weak, women, and children all panicked, shouting for help and crying. The sound was heart-wrenching.

During the fire, Chen Zhiyong, the six-year-old son of Chen Wanshun Timber Yard at No. 1 Zhongxing Lane, was trapped by the fire and unable to escape. When he was found near the wall of No. 44, he had already been burned to a crisp, his abdomen ruptured and intestines flowing out, a truly tragic sight.

Among the victims, the Chen Fugi Timber Yard suffered the greatest losses. In addition to all the timber being burned, there was also a truck that could not be driven out in time and was destroyed. The estimated loss was 150 million yuan.

The North Station Branch sent a large team of police officers and the 3rd Squadron of Volunteer Police to maintain order at the fire scene. At the same time, He Quan, the Director of the Cha Branch, and Zhou Zhaoxiang, the Director of the Fire Department, also personally supervised the scene. When it was determined that the fire was started by Yin Jiasheng of the Shanghai School Equipment Company, Yin had already fled in fear of punishment.

The fire gradually died down at 4:10 PM, as there was nothing left to burn, but the cries and wails of the women and children remained unabated.

The volunteer police found a gold ring weighing two qian in the fire, engraved with the words "Zhang Shunyin." There was also a watch and a bicycle. All of these are currently stored at the headquarters of the Volunteer Police at No. 28 Jiaotong Road. The owners can go to the team leader, Lu Wenlong, to claim them.

Student Movement to Protect Rights Officially Issues Declaration Yesterday

It is reported that all middle and university students in Shanghai have officially organized the Shanghai Student Patriotic Movement to Protect Rights. This patriotic movement will expand even further, and the association has issued a declaration, which reads in part: "We cannot sit idly by while the loss of rights and national humiliation are repeatedly inflicted upon our motherland. We should not only demand that the Allied countries withdraw their troops stationed in China, return all sovereign territories, and return all plundered materials, but we should also prevent new imperialists from interfering in our internal affairs. We demand that the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference stop discussing Chinese issues and stop using various means to threaten and influence any party in our internal strife. China's internal affairs should be resolved by our own government. We oppose any international interference."

### Shanghai Has the Most Fires in the Country

### Improving the Fire Department Organization: Ten Key Points Formulated, Equipment worth 7 Billion Yuan to be Added, 1,000 Recruits to be Collected Within the Year

[Report from this newspaper] According to Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang's statement to reporters yesterday, the plan to improve the city's fire department organization has been drafted and approved by Police Bureau Director Xuan Zhaowu, and is now being submitted to the Mayor for review. The improvement plan includes the following ten key points: (1) Reorganize the fire department, abolish the current fire department headquarters, and have the fire department directly responsible for fire rescue work from now on. (2) Improve the treatment of firefighters, requesting an average increase of 30 percent, with the length of service as the basis for salary. Drivers of fire trucks should be treated the same as drivers of the Public Utilities Bureau, with no discounts on their salaries and benefits. The municipal government should also consider subsidizing meal expenses. (3) Add fire-fighting equipment, hoping to have a budget of 7 billion yuan. The source of this money is currently uncertain, but if possible, it will be collected from citizens. (4) Plan to purchase 200 million yuan worth of spare parts for fire-fighting equipment. (5) The uniforms of each firefighter should be increased to four sets per person for replacement. (6) The monthly amount of gasoline for the fire department should be increased from 1,500 gallons to 2,500 gallons. (7) The city government should subsidize the cost of miscellaneous items such as soap and copper polish. (8) The cost of repairing the Taiping hydrants by the British Concession Water Company last year was approximately 100 million yuan, which the city government should repay as soon as possible to ensure future safety. (9) Increase the number of volunteer fire brigades. By the end of this year, it is planned to recruit 1,000 police fire brigade members, assisted by the Bao Ri Office, hoping that one person from each Jia can participate. (10) Provide spiritual training to the current officers of the fire department to enhance their spirit of service. It is also planned to recruit 200 new police officers in the near future to strengthen the fire department organization.

### Execution Ground Prepared, Awaiting Orders for Execution

In addition, the prosecutor has completed the investigation of Chang's property, so Chang's final fate can be decided within days.

### Opium Smokers Who Served as Traitors to be Tried by the High Court

Judicial Yuan Order Explanation

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of whether traitors who did not serve in the puppet army during the period of occupation, but who held military positions after the victory, should be treated as military traitors if discovered, the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation Order No. 3333 has provided an explanation, which states that it has been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference that the defendant in a traitor case was originally not a soldier and did not serve in the puppet army. Only after the victory did he serve in the army and obtain military status. If he is discovered to be a traitor when he is not in office or service, he should be tried by the High Court or its branch in accordance with Article 16 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Procedure Law.

Article 16 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Procedure Law originally states: If a soldier commits a crime before taking office or service, and it is discovered while he is in office or service, he shall be tried by a joint military and judicial trial according to his rank. If the crime is committed while he is in office or service, and it is discovered after he has been dismissed or discharged, he shall be tried by the court, but this shall not apply to cases where the person has been deprived of his official position.

### Telegrams Between Shanghai and Taiwan Still Being Sent and Received as Usual

[Report from this newspaper] It has been widely rumored that telegrams between Shanghai and Taiwan have been interrupted due to the expansion of the riots in Taiwan. Yesterday, the reporter visited Yu Bingjian, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, who said that this rumor is completely untrue. The Shanghai-Taiwan wireless circuit is still open. Currently, all telegrams to Taiwan from all over the country are transferred by the bureau, causing extreme congestion in the telegraph service. The transmissions are being sent in order, and there may be some delays. Furthermore, because the Taiwan Bureau is having difficulty delivering telegrams, it temporarily limited the acceptance of telegrams yesterday to avoid delays. However, telegrams for which the sender is willing to be responsible are still being accepted as usual, and there are no restrictions.

[Another report] Wireless telegrams between Shanghai and Taiwan Province were exchanged throughout the day yesterday, except for a brief interruption from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. However, there were very few incoming telegrams. Outgoing telegrams, except for urgent telegrams which were temporarily suspended, ordinary telegrams were accepted and sent as usual, but not as quickly as usual. The main reason is that many of the middle and lower-level staff of the Taiwan Provincial Telecommunications Department, such as telegraphers, were originally Taiwanese. After this incident occurred, they were somewhat affected, and their work was inevitably slackened.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships Safely Arrive in Keelung

[Report from this newspaper] Shipping lines between Shanghai and Taiwan have been completely suspended due to the Taipei riots. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ma Chang, Hai Zhou, and Hai Chen freedom ships, and the Zhong Zi No. 102 and Zhong Zi No. 103 landing craft, which sailed to Keelung the other day, all arrived yesterday morning.

The Chunghsing Shipping Company's Chunghsing passenger ship arrived in Keelung on the morning of the 5th of this month and left Keelung at 2:30 PM on the 6th to sail to Shantou. It left Shantou again the day before yesterday at 3:30 PM to come to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port tomorrow morning, carrying 600 to 700 passengers from Taiwan and Shantou.

In addition, the French postal ship Félix Roussel, which departed from Marseille on the 15th of last month to come to China, will arrive in Xigong in a few days and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month.

### A New Communication Method is Fast and Accurate

[Report from this newspaper] A new wireless communication method will be launched between Shanghai and San Francisco in the near future, called wireless teleprinter facsimile telegraphy.

Wireless teleprinter facsimile telegraphy was widely used by the US Army and Navy during the war. When two locations are equipped with this equipment, one party types on a typewriter, and the keys on the other party's typewriter rise and fall simultaneously due to the oscillation of radio waves. Therefore, in an instant, the telegram sent from the typewriter on this side appears on the receiving paper of the typewriter on the other side. Its advantage is not only speed, but also because it is a mechanical action, it does not need to go through the stage of code translation, so the accuracy rate is indeed 100%.

After the war, surplus materials from the US military, including this equipment, were sold to the Chinese government. The Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Bureau cooperated with the American Wireless Traffic Company, hiring three experts from the company to come to Shanghai to guide the installation and training of technicians, which has been completed. A trial report was recently conducted, and the results were excellent. It is now awaiting approval from the Ministry of Communications and can be officially started in the near future.

### Wireless Teleprinter Facsimile Telegraphy to be Launched Between Shanghai and San Francisco Immediately, Head of the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Section Accused of Embezzling Bonuses, Trial Begins, Large Discrepancy Between Both Parties in Valuing Smuggled Goods

[Report from this newspaper] The case of Feng Lianke, Head of the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Section, being accused of embezzling whistleblower bonuses, was tried in the District Court yesterday. According to the plaintiff, Song Ziling, on September 2nd of last year, due to his tip-off, Jianghai Customs seized 64 pieces of smuggled goods on the Hanyang ship, which he estimated to be worth 6 billion yuan. The next day, Feng only acknowledged two pieces of smuggled goods as having been tipped off by him, in an attempt to embezzle the whistleblower bonus, and said that according to the Customs' regulations on rewarding whistleblowers, he should receive 40% of the value of the smuggled goods, which is approximately 2.64 billion yuan in legal tender. However, according to the defendant's statement, Song's accusation is false and he has never engaged in corruption or bribery. The value of the smuggled goods, according to Customs' estimation, is only worth 88.8 million yuan. After questioning both parties in court, the case needs further investigation and the discussion was rescheduled for further deliberation.

### Labor Dispute: Huanhua Dismisses Four Workers, Huacheng Raises the Issue

[Report from this newspaper] The Huanhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 85, Lane 98, Yude Road, Tushan Bay, previously had a dispute because the employer did not comply with the wage payment method for power outages as decided by the Labor-Management Arbitration Conference. After mediation by the Social Bureau, it was decided to pay two days' wages for four days of power outages. However, the employer did not comply and dismissed four worker representatives, including Fan Fahui. After negotiations by the 9th District Dyeing and Weaving Industry Workers' Union, the Social Bureau notified the factory on the 6th of this month to put the dismissed workers on probation for three months, which the employer did not accept. Yesterday, the workers sent representatives to the Social Bureau for instructions and reported on the progress. It is understood that if the dispute cannot be resolved reasonably, the dyeing and weaving industry unions in the 2nd and 3rd districts will support them.

### Li Shiyu, Who Served in Puppet Positions and Participated in the Cleansing Campaign, Receives Initial Trial, Claims to Have Done Subversion Work

[Report from this newspaper] Li Shiyu's case of suspected collaboration with the enemy was initially questioned in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Li is from Heilongjiang, forty-odd years old, and originally worked as a staff member of the Military Commission's International Affairs Research Office in Tianjin. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic of China, he defected and served as a standing committee member of the puppet Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and concurrently as the chief secretary of the puppet Hebei Higher Court. In the 29th year, through the introduction of Fu Shuangying, the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Political Training Department, he met Chen Gongbo, the President of the Puppet Legislative Yuan, and was assigned to be a legislator by Chen. In August of the 30th year, he was transferred to the Director of the Military Law Department of the Puppet Shanghai Security Command. In February of the 30th year, the puppet government began the cleansing campaign, and Chen Gongbo was appointed as the Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Cleansing Committee, and Li Shiyu was appointed as the Director of the Fourth Department of the Committee and concurrently as the Captain of the Enforcement Team. The enforcement team was stationed in all suburban areas of Shanghai, such as Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Beiqiao, Pudong, and Chongming. In the spring of the 32nd year, the enemy and puppet forces took over the concessions, and Li Shiyu was reassigned as the Director of the Judicial Department of the Puppet Shanghai First and Third Police Bureaus. Later, the First and Third Bureaus were merged into the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, and Li remained the Director of the Judicial Department. In July of the 34th year, our war situation improved and the enemy was on the verge of collapse. Li Shiyu took the opportunity to secretly present a subversion plan to the Central Government, hoping to cover up his past crimes. After the victory, he worked in the Military Statistics Bureau. Due to his serious past crimes, he was arrested by the Military Statistics Bureau and sent to the High Court for trial. According to Li Shiyu's defense yesterday, he participated in the Puppet Sixth National Congress and later participated in the puppet organization under the secret orders of the Central Government. From the winter of the 30th year, he participated in He Shizhen's underground work in Shanghai. He also did his best in other aspects, such as engaging in subversion work before the victory and arresting traitors after the victory. After the court hearing, it was decided to reschedule the hearing for further investigation of evidence, and the defendant was returned to the detention center.

Another accomplice, Chen Amu, was transferred to the District Court for handling due to jurisdictional errors. After the verdict was completed, the family members of the victims in the audience believed that the sentence was too light, and they all prostrated themselves in the court and cried, demanding the death penalty. They were stopped by the bailiffs before they wiped away their tears and left.

The case of Shang Mumei, the Deputy President of the puppet "Huangdao Association," his son Shang Jijiang, and other suspected traitors, is scheduled to be sentenced this morning.

### Public Works Bureau Staff Savings - Many Problems Remain Regarding Repayment

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of repayment of savings, retirement, and pension funds for Chinese staff of the former Public Works Bureau, the subcommittee of the Liquidation Committee has repeatedly held meetings for discussion. The date for calculation has been decided to be up to the time of the Japanese occupation of the concessions during the Pacific War, i.e., the end of December 1941. Matters after that date will be discussed in detail later. As for the calculation of multiples, it is proposed to repay based on the multiples of the current municipal government bureaus' civil servant grades. However, it has been decided that the repayment date should not be too far apart from the most recent date of adjustment in civil servant salaries. As for British and American personnel, the government is requested to repay at the foreign exchange rate. As for personnel from neutral countries, it was previously heard that the calculation period was shorter than that for British and Americans, and they are requesting the same treatment. When the subcommittee met on the 9th, they attended to state their reasons. The subcommittee will submit these opinions to the Liquidation Committee. It is understood that if the repayment is carried out according to the above method, the total amount will be 70 billion, which the municipal government is unable to pay. It should be requested to be allocated by the central government. As for Mayor Wu's telegram requesting assistance from officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, no one has come to Shanghai to date.

### Restoring Championship Form, Hualian Defeats Renyu, Encas Wins Hailu Qing by One Point, Chenyou Easily Defeats Shanghai Railway

[Our Report] In the second basketball league, Hualian played Renyu last night, and the gymnasium was once again overcrowded. Hualian's Da Li did not "go to sea," reportedly due to a foot injury. Bao Songyuan became the representative to command the team, resulting in a 51-36 victory over Renyu, with the halftime score at 24-14. In the other two games, Chenyou II defeated Shanghai Railway 72-46, and Encas I reversed the defeat in the last three minutes, winning 45-44, by only one point in the final moment. Last night, Hualian's Lao Bao was an ideal figure, and Xue Chongxiang and Ren Guorong both developed evenly. Wu Chengzhang and Liang Xiong were also qualified. Renyu's players are young and promising, but lack on-field experience, revealing a "pipa playing" posture as soon as they took the court.

Chenyou Defeats Railway

After Chenyou's Wang Rongsheng and Wang Bingfu scored six consecutive points, Shanghai Railway's Zhang Qu (Banglun) finally made a shot. Rong Sheng and Shi Jiuquan continued to increase the score, and soon the score was 16-5. At this point, the Railway team was in a state of disarray. The score was recorded as 26-9 at ten minutes. Railway's Wang Kunxi replaced Zhang Qichang, and immediately scored a goal upon entering the court, but the opponent's momentum was difficult to stop. The score was 38-13 at fifteen minutes, and Chenyou paused at 40-13. Railway's Zhang Qichang re-entered the battle, and Wang Binghao exited. The halftime score was 50-17.

In the second half, the Railway team scored eight points instantly, and Chenyou found it difficult to score. The players who entered the second half were Ling Peng, Huang Cunrui, Zhang Qichen, Shi Jiuquan, and Bao Daowei. To arouse interest, this was not the official lineup. In the last four minutes, the score was 67-38, and Chenyou made a full adjustment, eventually winning 75-46.

Hailu Qing Suffers Miserable Defeat

The battle between Encas and Hailu Qing was like the American Civil War, with strong bodies, rough movements, and quite a bit of forceful performance. Initially, Encas took the lead, but after ten minutes, Hailu Qing surpassed them with 19-17. Then, the score became tied at 19 each. The physical combat became more intense, and Hailu Qing ended the first half with 25 points to 21. In the second half, the "martial arts style" melee continued for five minutes, and the two sides began to score. Although the match was intense, it was a fierce battle at close quarters. Encas chased quickly, and suddenly V. Kailu Siji tied the score at 39. Bao Lai surpassed by two points at 41. At that time, four minutes were reported. Ge Peng was penalized, and Hailu Qing's Fulu Que made the free throw. Peter Jones scored, making the score 42, surpassing Encas by one point. Kailu Siji scored, and Encas was back up by one point. Boluha injured his ankle, and Bosbei replaced him. Encas bought a timeout, and Hailu Qing's Fulu Que each scored a goal, making the score 45-44, with Encas leading by one point. Hailu Qing called a timeout at the last moment, but at that time there were only three seconds left. After the start, the buzzer sounded first, and the ball went in later, so the goal should be ruled invalid. Hailu Qing was very regretful, and the audience also expressed deep sympathy. The final score was 45-44.

Hualian Defeats Renyu

Renyu's Shen Pengju and Hualian's Chen Xuechong successively made free throws to establish the first merit. Zhang Liangxiong's long-range shot from the baseline made the score 3-1, boosting Hualian's morale. Xuechong scored again, and Songyuan and Xuechong increased the score to nine points. Renyu called a timeout. Lao Bao missed a free throw, but was countered by Wu Xinyun of the opponent with a one-on-one fast break. Ren Xiangcheng also surrounded and shot, making the score 14-4 when Renyu called another timeout. Renyu's Chen Wei Yuan entered to replace Wu Xin, and the situation improved. Shen Pengju scored nine points, and Hualian's Lao Bao was cheered by the audience. Xiangcheng often stole "cold rice." At the time of the last half, the score was 24-14. Adi (Wu Chengzhang) seemed abnormal.

After the break, Zhuo Guoquan replaced Zhang Liangxiong, and Renyu replaced Chen Weiyuan with Wu Xinyun. Yao Wenyi used two free throws to add two points for Renyu. Wu Chengzhang "answered the call after a long wait," and at this time made his virgin work, making a free throw. Zhuo Guorong's left-handed shot was very confident. Lao Bao replaced Da Li to command the team and became the cornerstone of the entire team last night. In the last four minutes, the score was 49-30. As a result, Hualian defeated Renyu 51-36.

The lineups for both sides today were announced by the responsible persons of each team, Railway's Yan Yougeng and Qingbai's Xu Wenkui, as follows: Referee Jiang Yinseng, linesmen Yue Xiurong and Huang Renyi.

The outcome of today's battle is difficult to predict, because when they first met in the initial finals last week, they drew with two goals each. Meeting again today, both sides will definitely go all out. Qingbai's lineup today, except for Gao Baozheng and Fei Chunhua, who will not be able to play due to some reason, all other veterans such as Yan Shijin, Meng Yiliang, and Li Yichen will be on the field, so the strength is still very strong.

Qingbai notified all players to gather at the Paramount this afternoon, wearing tooth-white and red striped jerseys and white shorts.

### Reestablishment of the City Athletic Federation

The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Sports Federation was formed in 1928 by schools such as Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Fudan, Fushi, Pudong, Minli, Guanghua, Daxia, Soochow, Jinan, Chizhi, Qixiu, Rongde, Aiguo, and Minli Girls' Middle School. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the schools moved inland and the federation's affairs were suspended. Now, the old members, except for Jinan, Chizhi, and Nanyang Vocational and Commercial School, which have not yet reopened, have all returned to their original locations. The federation's affairs cannot be delayed. Therefore, Chen De, Wu Lisheng, Zhang Yunzhong, and others held a reestablishment meeting at Fudan Middle School the other day. It was resolved that in addition to registering old members, new members would also be invited to join by letter.

### Borotra, Old But Strong

Wins Championship at Nearly Fifty Years Old

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] At the Lyon International Indoor Tennis Tournament, French veteran tennis player Borotra unexpectedly won the championship in the final on Saturday. Borotra is almost fifty years old now, and he was once a champion more than ten years ago. It is unexpected that he is still so strong at his age.

### Scraps from the Sidelines

A huge upset broke out in yesterday evening's basketball league: Hai Muqing lost to Encas by one point, ruining their hope of winning the championship.

Encas's victory was a strategic success, not a fluke. Ge Peng Qiguifu was responsible for closely guarding Hailuqing's tall center Fuluque, which was very effective in cutting off the connection between Hailuqing's offense and defense. Then, Ma Hanxing and Ao Chailiao, two short and fierce players, were used to break through and seize the ball, transport it near the basket, and pass it to Bao Lai and E. Kailuosigai on both sides to score.

The actions of both teams were chaotic and procrastinating, and there were very few clear and beautiful baskets in the entire game. Both sides relied on mid-range shooting to score points. In the first half, Encas once led by 14 to 6, and in the second half, Hailuqing once took the advantage with 35 to 27. Encas had plenty of stamina and was eventually able to reverse the defeat.

Encas's defeat of Hailuqing indirectly created an opportunity for Hualian.

In another game, Hualian easily defeated Renyu. Da Li did not play due to injury. Renyu was eager to win, but put on an abnormal performance. It was the team's worst performance of the season. They had no offensive methods, the defense was also lax, and the shooting was even more careless, forming a mess.

Lao Bao replaced Da Li as the main player. His blocks, saves, interceptions, and shots were excellent, but he showed off too much in the second half. Although Wu Chengzhang was on the court, he didn't put in much effort. Ren Xiangcheng made many mistakes in passing last night. Since long passes are not reliable, they should not be overused. Zhuo Guorong entered the game in the second half and had a tacit understanding with Xue Chong in passing.

The score was always five points apart. When the score was 45 to 28 in the second half, the advantage was already clear, and the audience left one after another. (Chang Nian)

### Garrison Command Accepts Stock Exchange Request

Banning Black Market Transactions Outside the Exchange, Cutting Off Privately Installed Telephones for Collusion, Confiscating Telephone Sets, and Arresting Principals for Legal Prosecution.

[Our Report] The Stock Exchange recently sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Command requesting the suppression of black market transactions outside the stock exchange, stating in brief: Since the promulgation of the emergency economic measures plan, floating capital will inevitably concentrate in the stock market in large quantities. If it is a legitimate transaction, the more floating capital enters the stock market, the more the pressure on prices will be reduced, so it should be actively encouraged. However, black market transactions have always existed in the stock market. The method is mainly collusion, and the nature is actually gambling. Unscrupulous firms use private telephones to engage in buying and selling between customers and firms, and between firms and firms. The amount of transactions is several times higher than legal transactions, often hundreds of thousands of shares each time. This type of collusion transaction never involves the delivery of physical goods or funds. The buyer pays interest on a daily basis, and the seller receives interest on a daily basis, which is contrary to the provisions of the Exchange Law. Moreover, the difference between the interest rate and the transaction price is huge, all decided by the black market operators according to their own interests, enriching themselves and manipulating the market. After the transaction is completed, the profit and loss are calculated according to the final price of the day, and the payment is cleared on the settlement date until the transaction is completed. This type of black market collusion and legitimate transactions are completely different matters for floating capital flowing into the stock market. If it is not eliminated, the harm will be extremely serious. The major drawbacks are: (1) When the market price fluctuates sharply, black market operators often cannot balance long and short positions, and cases of default and bankruptcy are endless. Many customers and firms suffer, which has an impact on social security and financial stability. (2) Black market operators use the rise and fall of interest rates to pressure long and short positions, thereby creating waves and hindering the interests of legitimate investors. (3) The government specially approves the establishment of a stock market, with the aim of guiding social floating capital to develop industrial and commercial enterprises. Because of the existence of black market collusion, it hinders the healthy development of the legitimate stock market. (4) The law stipulates that stock transactions must be subject to transaction tax collected by the exchange on behalf of the government. However, black market transactions outside the exchange are not taxed. Investors avoid taxes and do not go to the exchange but enter the black market, which affects national tax revenue. (5) Collusion is an illegal transaction, and privately installed telephones are sufficient to spread rumors and create disturbances, which hinders public order. The operators disregard the law and take it easy, which over time develops the habit of committing crimes in society, and the hidden worries are worth considering. Therefore, it is recommended to take decisive measures, cut off the privately installed telephone lines for collusion, confiscate the telephone sets, and arrest the principals for legal prosecution. It is now known that the Garrison Command has accepted the Stock Exchange's proposal and has notified the police department to start cracking down immediately.

### Yongsha Struggles and Wriggles, Cold Stocks Rise to Limit One After Another

The short selling forces in the Chinese stock market suddenly strengthened yesterday. After a lot of struggle, the market finally fell sharply from a high point at noon. The situation eased in the afternoon and gradually softened. The banking sector provided some support, but the market ended at a low price at the close. However, if the long and short positions are adjusted and smoothed out, and based on the news that bank credit will be relaxed in the near future, the day when the next installment is delivered may once again unleash its aggressive buying momentum.

The market opened high in the morning. After the opening, Yongsha was sold from 180 to 177, 218, and 84, with small sellers pushing the price down to 3,340 yuan. Buyers came in from 185, 32, 133, and 14. Datong, China-France, Yonggong, New Asia, American Asia, Yongye, China Shipping, and Guohuo all rose to the limit one after another.

Firewood was forced to stop trading with a transaction, rising to 3,400 yuan.

After 11:00 AM, the price rose again to 3,400 yuan. 14 and 97 pressed the price at high points, and the price fell again. 76, 142, 83, 185, and 4 all liquidated their positions. After 11:30 AM, the market outlook completely changed. The rumor that the National Bank had stopped lending support resurfaced. The market finally fell to below 3,200 yuan at the noon close. The price fell slightly after the close. As a result, Yongsha, Xinhuo, and Hua all fell slightly by as much as half of their value. Xinguang and Jingfu America-Asia and Qinxing each fell by more than half. Xinhua rose slightly, and China-France rose to the limit. Yongsha, Huafeng, Xinhuo, Jingfu America-Asia, and Xinguang fell slightly by as much as half of their value. Qinxing rose slightly.

China Textile, Tongyi, China Silk, Firewood, Lianan Underwear, and New Asia all fell back a little after rising to the limit. The rest rose and fell only slightly.

Although 232 and others sold in the afternoon, 94, 117, 125, 223, and 47 all bought. Yongsha rose to 3,280 yuan. Sellers from 198 and 180 sold at high points and were seen on the market. 76, 141, 87, and 207 all sold, and the price fell back to 3,180 yuan. 152, 198, and 94 were still buying. Many stocks that had been stagnant and miscellaneous brands rose to the limit. The situation was mostly flat. Later, 207 repeatedly sold aggressively, gradually forming a sign of decline. Most scattered investors were uncertain. The market became more fearful at the close. 112 and 133 and others all closed their positions. The market closed at a low price of 3,150 yuan. After the close, offers of 3,140 yuan and 3,150 yuan were heard. As a result, Yongsha, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about half of their value. Xinhua rose by less than 10%. China-France rose to the limit. Yongsha, Xinhuo, Huafeng, and Xinguang fell by half. Qinxing fell slightly. Cold stocks Jiufu, New Asia, Yongye, Cement, Lianan, Yonggong, Five-Star, Guohuo, Datong, China Silk, and Commerce rose to the limit.

The rest rose only slightly. All stocks outside the market rose except for Dasheng.

### Foreign Stocks Firm Before Retreating Slightly

Foreign stocks did not break out of the flat market yesterday. After being firm, they retreated slightly. Among the small stocks, there was no lack of attractive ones. Yipi rose more, while Yisha started at 21,000 yuan and was closed out by Guang gangs and securities gangs at a low price. As a result, rubber stocks were stable, Yipi rose by less than 10%, and the rest rose and fell only slightly.

### Unified Bonds Continue to Rise

Government bonds rose and then consolidated yesterday, but interest among people in the industry continued to be high, and the process continued to be firm. Unified Bing opened at 11,000 yuan and rose to 12,800 yuan. Longs came out, and the price fell to 10,800 yuan. After that, the price hovered steadily. As a result, Class A, B, and C each rose by 1,300 compared with the previous close, Unified Ding rose by 500 yuan, and Unified E also rose by 1,000 yuan.

### Consultation Meeting to be Held Today

[Our Report] Tea merchant representatives Shou Jingwei, Li Shan, Sun Xiaobang, Tao Zhensheng, and others visited Liu Gongyun, Vice President and Business Bureau Chief of the Central Bank, yesterday to discuss the purchase of export tea for 1946 and delivered the new plan proposed by the tea industry. Liu said that because he had only recently taken office, he did not have detailed knowledge of the handling and negotiation process of this matter. Therefore, he decided to convene a consultation meeting this afternoon at 3:00 PM with representatives from the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, tea merchants, and the original handlers of this case from the Central Bank to discuss the purchase method.

### Production Loan Inspection Team Increases Personnel and Hastens Completion of Work

[Report from our newspaper] The work of inspecting the raw wax fee weaving industry has now been two-thirds completed. There are still 100 factories waiting to be inspected, and it is expected that all work will be completed before the middle of next month. In order to speed up the process, a new batch of personnel has recently been added, totaling 26 people, all of whom have been transferred from relevant departments. The inspection team itself is a temporary organization. Once the work is completed, it will be disbanded. The investigation report will be submitted to the Four Banks Joint Treasury, which will be used as the basis for handling this matter. Whether it will be released to the public is still unknown. As of now, the inspection work has not revealed other malpractices, except that some factories used the loans to purchase gold. As for the factories that purchased gold, they also used debt repayment as a reason. In the future, the Four Banks will consider the severity of the situation and recover the loans early from these factories. Most factories used production loans to repay high-interest loans. Although this does not comply with the loan regulations, it is still reasonable and will not be investigated in depth. Furthermore, the future report will analyze in detail the relationship between the loan and the factory's production and sales, whether the application of the loan is appropriate, and whether the distribution of the loan is accurate, as a reference for future government loans to private industries.

### Civil Aviation Requests Price Increase, Passengers and Cargo Rush to Load

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, there have been widespread rumors of fare increases, and various passengers have been purchasing goods and rushing to load them in order to pay less freight, especially for goods being transported to Tianjin. Yesterday, the ship from Hai Zhe sailed to Tianjin, carrying more than 7,200 bags of sugar, more than 300 pieces of cotton yarn, more than 1,700 pieces of textiles, and 2,000 boxes of cigarettes, fully loaded for Tianjin.

### Rice and Grain Transactions Quiet

Yesterday, a total of about 11,000 shi of rice and grain arrived in the northern and southern markets. The stores sold them all, but the market transactions were still stagnant, with no buyers. The situation of japonica rice is deteriorating daily, continuing to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, with middle rice falling by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Indica rice also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. White yuan goods are in short supply and stable, while yin yuan also has no fluctuations.

Flour is gradually declining and moving slowly, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Bran is rarely inquired about. Soybean cakes are still sluggish in customer sales, returning to a weary state with a slightly reduced market shape.

Soybeans are digesting poorly, with northeastern soybeans being clearly priced but secretly stagnant. Broad beans fell by more than 1,000 yuan, while mung beans from Nanyang slightly rose, with prices rising sharply. Raw peanuts are selling briskly, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

### UNRRA Cotton Allocation Method: Handled According to Foreign Cotton Procurement Rules

After consultations between the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) regarding the allocation of raw cotton supplied, the quota allocation, and the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and the Executive Yuan, it was decided that the allocation would be handled by the Executive Yuan according to the principles stipulated in the "Foreign Cotton Procurement Rules." However, the quantity allocated to a certain yarn factory cannot exceed the difference between the four-month inventory and the three-month order requirement, minus the allocation limit. It is also heard that for factories that have not purchased cotton yarn through the Board of Trustees, if they need to purchase foreign cotton, the six district cotton spinning associations should first inspect the quality of the 20-count yarn spun by each factory. Only those that are rated as Grade D or above after inspection will be allowed to purchase foreign cotton. The current allocation of raw cotton is temporarily limited to 39 units (including Shanghai Municipal Factory No. 36, foreign companies Lundchang and Ewo, and the state-run Textile Construction Company) that have already received cotton yarn from the six cotton spinning associations. The following is the limit on the number of cotton bales that should be obtained based on the above principles.

### Ministry of Finance Cables the Central Bank Auditing Office to Strengthen Supervision of Bank Operations

In order to strengthen the supervision of banks and improve business efficiency, the Ministry of Finance has formulated ten items for inspectors to supervise and correct when inspecting banks, and has specially cabled the Central Bank Auditing Office to implement them earnestly: (1) Technical errors in the application of accounting subjects, accounting procedures, and accounting procedures that do not involve malpractices; (2) The names and arrangements of accounting subjects and the format of accounting books do not comply with regulations; (3) Account names do not comply with the provisions of the "Name Usage Regulations"; (4) Temporary receipts and payments have been suspended for too long, and should be investigated and transferred without doubt; (5) Various loans have not been established or exceed the prescribed limits; (6) Overdue loans or collection items should be collected and settled; (7) Various depreciation and amortization have not been handled in accordance with regulations; (8) Withheld taxes have been delayed in being paid to the treasury; (9) Collateralized loans have not obtained the right of pledge; (10) Other technical oversights in business processing should be noted and improved.

### Statistics on Monthly Raw Material Needs of Rubber Factories in Various Regions

[Report from our newspaper] According to a survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: The monthly raw rubber material needs of the rubber industry in this city are 1,739.5 tons. The total monthly needs of other regions outside Shanghai are 1,605 tons. The details are as follows: 72 member companies in Shanghai need 1,739.5 tons per month. 4 member companies in Tianjin need 270 tons per month. Enemy factories in Tianjin that have been taken over by the government are estimated to need 210 tons per month. 8 member companies in Chongqing need 68 tons per month. Member companies in Qingdao and Taiwan, 7 in the former and 1 in the latter, need 470 tons per month. There are other unknown factories in Taiwan, estimated to need 120 tons per month. The northeastern provinces are estimated to need 120 tons per month. Guangzhou is estimated to need 300 tons per month. Therefore, the surveyed raw rubber demand in various regions of the country is 3,344.5 tons per month.

### Industrial Raw Material Prices Vary

[Report from our newspaper] The industrial raw material market has been active in recent days. Caustic soda, with more goods being released, saw its market price rise and then fall again. Yesterday, the market price for Moon Brand caustic soda was 4.5 million yuan, pure soda Moon Brand was 280,000 yuan, Magari was 220,000 yuan, and Yongli was 180,000 to 200,000 yuan. Glycerin and stearic acid had no transactions. Ammonium sulfate and fat field powder were in demand by customers, and the market price rose sharply, reaching 4.5 million yuan per ton, which was very popular. Yellow and white petroleum jelly prices fell again. Original new barrels of yellow petroleum jelly were priced at 1,000 yuan per pound. It is heard that customers have been purchasing a lot recently, and the price is still rising sharply because the current market price is much lower than the order price. The estimated cost per pound for the order is 1,500 yuan. Zinc powder still stands at a high price of 10 million per ton.

### Foreign Tea Trade Difficult to Develop

Yesterday, the demand for English tea remained sluggish. Although buyers were still inquiring about the aged Qimen tea from the 34th year, the asking price was still tight, only about 500,000 yuan per dan. However, according to the sellers, the cost was high, and they were reluctant to sell for less than 570,000 yuan. As a result, there was no certainty in the negotiation, and transactions were difficult to expand. As for the variety of green tea, except for old goods that had been in stock for many years, which were difficult to sell, the rest were not stagnant, and the green tea from the 34th and 35th years was selling more smoothly. The market price was consistent with supply and demand, and there were no fluctuations. Domestic sales of red and green tea have been sluggish for a long time, and there is still little excitement to be seen. The market situation is still calm due to the inability of specialty goods to raise prices.

### Cotton Yarn Product Association Handles Yarn Inventory Registration

[Report from our newspaper] Eight units of the city's cotton yarn reproduction industry association held a joint meeting at the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm. Representatives from various industries, including Li Daofa, Ni Gengnian, Xu Zhaohou, and Yao Siwei, attended the meeting. The industry was ordered by the Shanghai Garrison Command's Cloth and Yarn Group to register the inventory of yarn among its members. Therefore, it was decided to handle the registration themselves and then report it. It was also decided to send representatives to the garrison department in the near future to inquire about the registration procedures.

### Yarn Market Sales Sparse

The yarn market was increasingly sluggish yesterday, with customer sales even sparser, and transactions on this street were particularly rare. The market was filled with sellers, but even at the limited price, it was not easy to find buyers. Therefore, yarns below 20 counts fell by 5%, and the black market disappeared invisibly. However, fine yarn and 42-count ply yarn, because there were not many in stock, fell only slightly. Even at the official price, it was still difficult to buy.

### Fine Cloth Prices Gradually Decrease

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was not very active. The Textile Construction Company supplied and sold various types of cloth as usual. The 20-count cloth was lower than the previous period. Therefore, 12-count cloth was only 153,500 yuan, chicken cloth was 146,000 yuan, and sun cloth was 143,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 405 fine twill per bolt also fell sharply by 5,000 yuan to 213,500 yuan. Colored goods only rose by 5,000 yuan compared to the original tribute cloth. However, it is heard that the Tianjin group is slightly interested in summer cloth, so the white gray cloth market is still firm.

### Silk Weaving Allied Company Does Not Accept Overseas Orders

The Silk Weaving Allied Company recently has more than 600 bolts of woven fabrics for export. However, many orders placed by Indian merchants in the past have been canceled or delayed due to the government's regulation of foreign exchange. Therefore, in the future, the company will negotiate with local foreign merchants to sell spot goods as a principle, and will not accept orders for the time being to avoid future disputes due to currency system issues.

### Hankou Tung Oil Arrives, Market Price Stable, Transactions Rare

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that a large number of tung oil from Hankou has been shipped to Shanghai in batches. The market price is stable. It is difficult for tung oil other than adequately-produced tung oil to improve in price, and transactions are also rare. Yesterday, the market price for adequate tung oil was 450,000 yuan including the barrel, and 430,000 yuan without the barrel. Domestic tung oil was 400,000 yuan, Fujian Xi Hong was 370,000 yuan per barrel, and Hongjiang was 250,000 yuan per barrel.

### Ramie Market Price Declines

[Report from our newspaper] Half a month ago, ramie reached a high point. White ramie was priced at 500,000 yuan per shi dan, and the market was very firm. In recent days, sales have become sluggish, and the price in Hankou has frequently declined. Yesterday, white ramie was priced at 400,000 yuan per shi zu, green ramie was 330,000 yuan, yellow ramie was 200,000 yuan, yarn ramie was 200,000 yuan, thick ramie was 200,000 yuan, and Ting ramie was 381,000 yuan, all of which were much lower than before.

### Sugar Prices Stable

The sugar market is trending steadily, without much fluctuation. The association's quoted price for 24 groups of white sugar was 214,000 to 216,000 yuan, 22 medium-grained white sugar was 194,000 yuan, Taiwan red sugar was 142,500 to 142,200 yuan, three-year white spot was 190,000 yuan, eight-term warehouse order was 189,000 yuan, nine-term was 182,000 yuan, Peruvian fine sugar warehouse order was 188,900 to 188,000 or 187,500 yuan, raw sugar was 165,000 yuan, numbered goods were 157,000 yuan, oil gang commission was 130,000 yuan, Shunde green sugar was 127,000 to 128,000 yuan, totaling hundreds of bags, and Xinghua white sugar was 188,000 to 180,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar was 138,900 to 132,000 or 133,000 yuan, totaling more than two hundred weak bags. Although Jian gang Diao Qing had a asking price, there were no transactions.

### Commemorating the Death of the Father of the Nation, Seeking Freedom and Equality for China

— From the Newspaper's Archives

Twenty-two years ago today, the Father of the Nation passed away in Beijing's Iron Lion Hutong due to liver disease. At that time, the situation in China was that the National Revolutionary Army in the south had just left Guangdong and was facing obstruction from warlords along the way. The north and central China were completely in the hands of feudal remnants of warlords and politicians. The dark official politics since the Yuan Shikai era loomed over most of China. Therefore, the Father of the Nation ignored the advice of many comrades and traveled from Guangzhou to the north despite his illness, hoping to persuade these politicians and warlords who were focused on their own interests to seek peace and unity for China. In the thirteen years since the founding of the Republic, the situation had been so heartbreaking for the Father of the Nation. Years of warlord wars had left the country full of devastation, with the people suffering and impoverished. The new nation not only had no hope of construction, but also had no chance to catch its breath. It relied solely on foreign debt to quench its thirst. Under such circumstances, it was naturally impossible for the country to rise from its semi-colonial status. The Father of the Nation felt that for the revolution to truly succeed, first, there must be revolutionary ideas that penetrate the hearts of the people, so he personally drafted the Three Principles of the People; second, there must be a definite way to build the country, so he wrote the Outline of National Construction and the National Strategy; third, the people must be able to clearly understand the current situation of the country and be deeply vigilant, so he drafted the First National Congress Declaration. With all of these, and with the people of the whole country fully understanding their meaning and value, China could slowly build itself up, become strong, and achieve the ultimate goal: the freedom and equality of the nation.

This was the ideological landscape of the Father of the Nation at the time of his death on March 12th of the 14th year of the Republic. In his will, the Father of the Nation also earnestly instructed future generations with this. The content of the will is now of course very familiar to everyone, but precisely because it is too familiar, it is easy to overlook the important meaning it contains. There are two sections in the will that are the most important. The first section is "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China." This refers to the goal and ideal of the Father of the Nation's lifelong revolution. The second section is "Recently advocating the convening of a National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties." This refers to the methods and steps to achieve this ideal.

The international status exchanged for blood and flesh - don't let it plummet

The meaning contained in these short sentences is especially worth reflecting on today. What is meant by "freedom and equality for China"? In terms of external meaning, China should have its independent and self-reliant international status, not be bound by any unilateral unequal treaties. It should have the power and courage to act independently in diplomacy, and not succumb to or compromise due to the influence of interests. In particular, the national dignity of China as an independent country must be fully recognized and respected by countries around the world. In terms of internal meaning, all ethnic groups, all regions, and all classes within the country should have the freedom and equality stipulated by national laws, and be fully respected and protected by national laws.

In this sense, our current situation is too far from the Father of the Nation's ideal. Here, we must note that after the victory in the Anti-Japanese War, when our longest and most vicious enemy, Japanese imperialism, surrendered, we originally had a great opportunity to gradually achieve this ideal of the Father of the Nation. Unfortunately, this opportunity was fleeting. Due to the outbreak of civil strife, destruction of transportation, stagnation of construction, soaring prices, and people's misery, the chaos in the political and economic order was even worse than during the Anti-Japanese War. As a result, the little international status that had been exchanged for the blood and flesh of millions of people in the eight-year Anti-Japanese War plummeted again. Does today's China have true freedom and equality in the international arena? On this day of the 22nd anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, this is the first point that every Chinese person should feel ashamed and vigilant about.

Secondly, the Father of the Nation said in his will that in order to achieve the goal of national freedom and equality, first, a National Assembly must be convened to achieve peaceful unification internally; second, unequal treaties must be abolished so that China can gain an autonomous position in the international arena. On the surface, it can be said that both of these have been successful. The National Assembly convened last November to December brought together national scholars to formulate the fundamental constitution of the country, allowing China to take a further step towards obtaining a unified rule of law. This was originally what the Father of the Nation had earnestly hoped for, and the Outline of National Construction also regarded the promulgation of the constitution and the success of constitutional government as the final stage of the nation-building process. The constitution that was passed this time was originally revised based on the principles of modification in the Political Consultative Conference, and should have satisfied the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). However, as a result, they still refused to participate in the National Assembly on the grounds of other reasons, and even closed the door to peace talks and consultations, making the constitution, which originally symbolized national democracy and unity, still hindered by force in its implementation.

Unequal treaties have been abolished, but unequal status has not been dispeled. As for unequal treaties, such as consular jurisdiction, stationing of troops, concession areas, and inland river navigation rights signed in the Manchu Qing Dynasty, have all been abolished near the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and replaced by new ones based on mutual equality. Originally, these unequal terms were all signed by the corrupt and incompetent Manchu Qing government, and the Republic after the revolution did not necessarily have to recognize them. However, at that time, because the power of the revolution was not yet fully united and stable, in order to take into account the practical difficulties, these unequal treaties had to be recognized as valid. However, the abolition of unequal treaties was something that the Father of the Nation never forgot until his death, and it was also something that the government has worked hard to achieve over the past twenty years. Finally, because of the courage and strength shown by the country in the Anti-Japanese War, it was sympathized and respected by the Allied countries. As early as May of the 30th year, China and the United States had preliminary discussions on abolishing unequal treaties. By January 11th of the 32nd year, the new treaties of equality between China and the United States and China and the United Kingdom had been signed. France and other countries also declared one after another that they would abandon all their privileges in China and sign new treaties. Unequal treaties that bound the Chinese nation for a hundred years were abolished.

The superficial unequal clauses have indeed been abolished, but in fact, has China's status in the international arena been truly equal? Whether a country can obtain equal status in the international arena mainly depends on whether the country has a unified and powerful force that makes people dare not despise it. At the Paris 21-nation peace conference last year, when discussing the Treaty of Peace with Germany, China's desire to be included in the invited countries was opposed. Now, the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference has also opened. In the discussion of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, China, with such deep economic relations with Germany, cannot even have a say. Moreover, it is said that this meeting may also involve China's internal affairs. How long has it been since the San Francisco Conference, China has fallen from one of the four or five powers to a problem to be discussed at the conference table, and its status is already like that of a small European country that was defeated in the war! Although unequal treaties have been abolished, unequal status still exists.

Using power to destroy the ice dragon will inevitably achieve independence and freedom

How can China truly lift the bonds of all unequal treaties and transform from a semi-colonial country into a truly independent and self-reliant country? Clearly, first, the country must be peacefully unified so that all forces can be concentrated, all destruction must be stopped immediately, and all chaos must be changed immediately. Second, take advantage of the favorable environment that the Japanese imperialists have been defeated and the external obstacles have been removed. Put all efforts into domestic construction. In this way, true freedom and equality can come.

Today, when we read the Father of the Nation's words "seek freedom and equality for China" in his will, our hearts are filled with infinite emotion and infinite shame. The Father of the Nation has been dead for twenty-two years, how much have we done of what he earnestly entrusted to us? We originally had the opportunity to achieve this ideal goal, but why are we so disappointing and sit idly by as this opportunity slips away? Think about it deeply today. The Father of the Nation has clearly pointed out our path, and Chairman Chiang, the successor of the Father of the Nation, has also repeatedly told us: what China needs most urgently now is: peace, democracy, unity, and construction. This is the only path ahead of us, and it is also the only entrustment that the Father of the Nation has left to us.

### Promote Afforestation Movement

— Wu Guozhen

The afforestation movement was originally one of the seven basic movements for local construction stipulated by the central government. Tracing back to the 17th year of the Republic of China, when the warlords were pacified and the country was unified, the work of political tutelage and construction began. In view of the fact that all construction work must start from basic local affairs, the central government stipulated afforestation, road construction, sanitation, Baojia literacy, cooperation, and the promotion of domestic goods as seven basic local construction movements, leading the country to promote them consistently.

Since the afforestation movement is one of the seven basic construction movements, it has already had a history of ten years of promotion before the Anti-Japanese War. The ancients had a saying: "It takes one year to plant a tree, and ten years to grow timber." In order to enable this movement to continue for a long time, so as to achieve the effect of "ten years to grow timber," the central government further stipulated March 12th of each year, the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, as Arbor Day. Every year on this day, the people of the whole country commemorate the Father of the Nation on the one hand, and on the other hand, they follow the Father of the Nation's teaching of "making the best use of the land" and expand afforestation propaganda and hold afforestation demonstrations, using the action of practicing the legacy to commemorate the Father of the Nation, which is more meaningful and more practical than ordinary commemorative ceremonies.

Speaking of the relationship between the afforestation movement and China, since our country's agriculture developed very early, most of the primeval forests have been converted into farmland. It is very necessary to use the artificial afforestation movement to make up for the lack of natural evolution. The function of afforestation is not only to cultivate forests and increase national wealth, but also to regulate floods and droughts and prevent disasters. As for afforestation in cities, in addition to the above-mentioned functions, it also has the following two major functions.

(1) Improve hygiene - because cities have a dense population, industry and commerce gather, and the noise and smoke are far greater than in rural areas. The housing of ordinary people is mostly row upon row, crowded and narrow. Moreover, the places of work, whether factories or shops, and the places for leisure after work, whether theaters or tea houses, are mostly crowded together, which is detrimental to health. To make up for this kind of urban deformity, the only way is to plant more trees and establish more gardens to increase fresh air and benefit the population.

(2) Beautify the scenery - cities are the center of national economic culture, and should have beautified designs for international tourism and domestic sightseeing. The cultivation of natural scenery is a necessary condition for beautification. For example, the cultivation of gardens and the planting of roadside trees not only improve hygiene, but also have the function of beautifying.

Shanghai has a dense population and prosperous industry and commerce, and is the most urbanized city in the country. Since the Anti-Japanese War, after eight years of enemy puppet devastation, many trees have been destroyed and felled, and the forests and gardens have almost been abandoned. This year's March 12th is the first Arbor Day after the national government returned to the capital. It is especially appropriate to take this opportunity to promote the afforestation movement. In addition to various preparatory matters, which have been actively carried out by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Works Bureau in conjunction with relevant organizations and groups, it is hoped that all citizens will enthusiastically participate at that time to cultivate materials for the country and improve their own health, so as to receive permanent and endless benefits with the effort of raising a hand and a foot.

### Commemorating Arbor Day

— Wu Kaixian

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our task is not only to restore all pre-war construction, but also to surpass it. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his economic construction plan, once made it clear to us that the most important thing is industrial construction, and he also included afforestation in this plan.

Regarding the raw materials for industrial construction, the most important are of course steel and wood, which are the sources of industrial construction. Therefore, to assess the wealth of a country, one must estimate the domestic production of steel and wood.

Steel is stored in mineral lands. Our country's production can also rank fourth in the world. We only need the technology to mine it, and this problem is relatively easy to solve.

As for wood, we must find ways to cultivate it in order to increase production and avoid shortages. The main areas of wood production in our country are the three northeastern provinces, several southwestern provinces, and Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, and Hunan. Most other places are barren hills with very little wood production. If we want to increase wood production, promoting afforestation is indeed a necessary and urgent matter.

Wood has a wide range of uses. In industry, it is used for building materials, bridge materials, railway sleepers, and other materials such as paper pulp for papermaking and tung oil. As for edible uses, such as edible fruit trees, etc.

According to the classification of silviculturists, there are practical forest trees and landscape forest trees. This requires experts to describe, and I don't need to add detailed annotations.

Speaking of the benefits of afforestation, the industrial uses have been mentioned above. Other benefits include strengthening embankments, preventing floods, regulating climate, and increasing rainfall. It is also of great benefit to agriculture, water conservancy, and human health. This is also something that everyone often discusses and knows.

In principle, afforestation is naturally suitable for mountainous areas or open plains. In the Shanghai area, the afforestation to be promoted in urban areas is the planting of landscape trees in gardens. This can add a lot of green color to the dense city, increase the beauty of the cityscape, and also allow the dense city to obtain more air regulation and increase the health of citizens. In the suburbs, plant more fruit trees and some commercial trees, and take advantage of the concentration of talents in Shanghai to plant more seedlings, improve seedlings, and supply them to all parts of the country for purchase and planting.

Today is Arbor Day, also the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation. The central government stipulates this day, on the one hand, to commemorate the Father of the Nation, and on the other hand, to instruct us that tree planting is most suitable during this solar term. The tree-planting movement is being vigorously promoted and guided by the government, but the responsibility for widespread implementation still rests with the people themselves. And forestry experts and those engaged in forestry should also work harder. It is hoped that farmers will pay more attention and work harder. Shanghai is the largest city in the country and a hub of talent. We should set an example in all facilities, and afforestation and tree planting are naturally no exception.

### Small Matters of a Great Man

— Compiled by this newspaper's data room

Reading: The Father of the Nation was naturally quiet and usually silent, but he loved to read. Whenever new books came out, he would try to find and buy those of more value. After buying them, he would wrap them in paper covers to avoid damage and dirt, and then read them carefully. The books on the shelf were all classified and placed in order, without any disorder. The Father of the Nation bought mostly books on geography, history, economics, politics, and military affairs, as well as ancient Chinese canonical books, but very few novels.

Chess Skills: The Father of the Nation had no interest in music, drama, or other entertainment, but he was very fond of Chinese chess. In his luggage, in addition to books and stationery, chess pieces and a chessboard were always included. The Father of the Nation was very serious when playing chess with others, and he would often play until late at night. His chess skills were also quite good, but he was always slightly inferior when playing against Hu Hanmin.

Daily Life: The Father of the Nation had a regular daily life. He would get out of bed at six or seven in the morning, and he would personally tidy up his bedclothes, quilts, and pillows, never relying on servants. The Father of the Nation loved cleanliness. He would take a bath every day, and he would change his underwear every day. When he lived in Nanyang, the weather was extremely hot, but the Father of the Nation never followed the local custom of taking off his hat and queue, and he never went barefoot or wore slippers when staying indoors.

Food: The Father of the Nation paid much attention to his diet. He used chopsticks for meals, not knives or forks, and he usually liked to eat vegetables. He ate very little fish and meat. He never touched alcohol or tobacco, but he was very fond of eating fruit, especially bananas and pineapples. When he lived on Rue Molière in Shanghai, he would always ask servants to go out and buy them for him.

Language: The Father of the Nation usually spoke the Guangzhou dialect, but he used Mandarin when giving speeches. His tone was slow, heavy, and orderly, and all who heard him were moved. The Father of the Nation spoke English fluently, but he never spoke it in conversation or speeches unless it was necessary. The Father of the Nation was kind and rarely angry. When he lived in Shanghai, his servant, Chen He, was quite foolish. When things did not go as he wished, the Father of the Nation would scold him, saying "Da Pao He," but this was rarely heard. "Da Pao He" is Cantonese for "foolish silkworm."

Liver Disease: On November 13 of the thirteenth year of the Republic, the Father of the Nation, on the day of his birthday, left Guangzhou for the north to seek a national conference in the north to seek unity and peace. On December 4, he arrived in Tianjin. Due to the long journey and fatigue, he caught a cold and felt unwell in his liver. He sought medical treatment, and by the end of the year, his illness had worsened. He went to Beijing while ill and underwent an autopsy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. He learned that his entire liver was as hard as wood and that his liver cancer was in its terminal stage.

Death: In early March of the fourteenth year of the Republic, the Father of the Nation's illness worsened, his pulse accelerated, reaching 150 to 160 beats per minute, and his breathing decreased, sometimes only 17 or 18 breaths. On the afternoon of March 11, he was supported by his wife to sign the pre-prepared will. He slept peacefully for several hours in the afternoon. He woke up at 6:30, his hands and feet gradually became cold, and he could not speak much. He only intermittently said "Peace... Struggle... Save China..." At 9:30 on the morning of March 12, this great man passed away.

Funeral: After the death of the Father of the Nation, the people of the whole country mourned him. On the day of the funeral, more than 20,000 people outside Xizhimen held ropes and cried bitterly. When the Father of the Nation passed away, he left two wills: one to his comrades in the party and one to his family. The following year, Dai Chuanxian suggested to the central government that the will should be read respectfully at every meeting to commemorate him and never forget him. After the central government approved it, it ordered the whole country to follow it, and it has been followed to this day.

### The Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription for the Father of the Nation When He Was Critically Ill

— Lu Danlin

Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, went north in the winter of the thirteenth year of the Republic. Because he suffered from terminal liver cancer, he consulted Chinese and foreign doctors in Tianjin and Beiping for treatment. He passed away in Beiping on March 12 of the fourteenth year of the Republic. However, according to an English report from Liu Ruiheng, the president of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, to Kong Xiangxi and forwarded to Mr. Sun's family and Kuomintang members on February 17, "Upon Mr. Sun's admission to our hospital, it was discovered that he was suffering from terminal liver cancer, which is an incurable disease. After dissection and microscopic examination of the outer skin of the cancer, the diagnosis was confirmed. The condition went from bad to extremely bad. We believe that there is no hope for Mr. Sun's survival." Therefore, the next day, Mr. Sun was moved from Peking Union Medical College Hospital to the Gu residence in Tieshizi Hutong for treatment. At that time, Zhang Jingjiang, Hu Shih, and others appointed traditional Chinese medicine doctor Lu Zhong'an to examine him. After Dr. Lu prescribed one dose of Astragalus and Codonopsis, the leg swelling completely disappeared. On the 20th, after another diagnosis, the soup and medicine were decocted and drunk. Dr. 克禮's examination report showed that blood circulation had gradually improved. Lunch and diet were the same as when he was not sick, and he was able to sleep peacefully for seven or eight hours. However, because the disease had become deep-rooted and the report from Peking Union Medical College Hospital had already declared that there was no hope, Mr. Sun still fought the disease with great fearlessness, so he was able to extend his time for more than 20 days before passing away. At that time, Lu Zhong'an's diagnosis and prescription were given general attention. Now, I will record the pulse case and prescription he prescribed: Fright, panic, and anger all injure the liver meridian. Blood boils and qi stagnates, causing congestion and blockage, which turns into liver hardening. Hardening leads to carbuncles, which fester over time. The mechanism of ascension and descension is lost, and blood and qi are greatly depleted. Therefore, the spirit is tired, appetite is poor, feet are swollen, the body is thin, the tongue is dry, the coating is peeled off, the pulse is strong and rapid, and it is rootless when pressed. The Inner Canon takes the liver as the general's office, and the ministerial fire is hidden within. If it is nourished by true water and subdued by true qi, it can be effective. I respectfully prescribe the following prescription for consideration.

3 mace of Dendrobium loddigesii Rolfe
3 mace of Wild Mountain Ginseng
3 mace of Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc.
4 mace of Ophiopogon japonicus (Linn. f.) Ker-Gawl.
4 mace of Fresh Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch.
3 mace of Astragalus complanatus R.Br.
3 mace of Adenophora stricta Miq.
2 mace of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.

To be honest, Mr. Sun's illness was treated by several famous doctors, and radium needles were used for more than 40 hours, but there was no effect. It was said that the doctors were helpless and the medicine was ineffective. Lu Zhong'an's medicine was nothing more than fulfilling human affairs. Now, after a lapse of twenty-two years, recording his pulse case and prescription is nothing more than leaving a memorial for the traditional Chinese medicine community.

### Big Style

— By 法·日耳韋司, translated by 李青厓

You know my wife and me very well, and you certainly wouldn't put us in the category of those who only want to save pennies by accumulating small amounts and don't want to be comfortable for once. So when you heard that my uncle of 賽爾 passed away and left me an inheritance, you certainly wouldn't think it strange that we made a big change in our lives. At that time, in matters related to me, the first thing I paid attention to was leaving my position at the 法布 Company, where I had worked for fifteen years, in a definite way. Ha, don't worry, I have already handled that matter with the most reasonable procedure and apologized earnestly to the respected general manager. This amazing man, who had already known about this matter, said to me:

"I fully agree with you, my good friend."

Please note, since I became a millionaire, he has called me "good friend." Before, he simply called me "friend." These are just small things, of course, but they make me happy and prove that you have also climbed a few steps on the social ladder.

Many other changes followed. The apartment we used to live in became irritating to our new status. So we abandoned it and found another, larger and more sophisticated apartment. On the day of the move, my wife said to me:

"For me, there are too many things here. And I don't want to continue washing pots and waxing floors like I did when I was poor. If you agree, we'll hire a female worker."

These words seemed completely reasonable to me. So we went to a employment agency, and my wife explained her needs: an upright person with automatic service experience who doesn't need supervision.

"I understand what you mean," said the manager of the agency. "A skilled maid who has worked in upper-class families. I will send her to your house tomorrow."

The second day, we saw her arrive. Her name was 克樂蒂德. She was a woman of medium build, neither old nor young, neither ugly nor beautiful, but her ordinary face showed a kind of contempt of unknown origin gained from long service. My wife asked her without malice:

"Are you the maid sent by the agency?"

She hurriedly replied in a correcting tone:

"I am the housekeeper that the manager of the agency told Madame about!"

The people at the agency really didn't misunderstand us. Probably, no servant has ever been able to produce such noteworthy references. There were not many documents, but they were all worded extremely appropriately and signed by several of the most prominent aristocratic families.

"I have always worked in the Saint-Germain district," she said to us. "Unfortunately, it is not easy to find a position in that area today! There has been too much destruction in the past few years!"

In the beginning, we were a little uncomfortable because of 克樂蒂德. It inevitably produced a strange feeling when we first decided to have a stranger live in our home. And I think this should also produce a strange feeling for someone who doesn't live in a stranger's house. But 克樂蒂德, she had already taken it for granted. Under our roof, she seemed completely at ease, much more so than we felt about that level, because we hadn't had time to get used to the new apartment.

Apart from this, our maid - I mean, our housekeeper - was completely satisfactory to us, as could be judged by such unremarkable employers as we were. Her service was perfect. She only asked us to add a floor polisher to keep the floors clean and a part-time seamstress to handle various mending matters. Such requests from such an outstanding servant were truly irresistible!

So, 克樂蒂德 was a pearl! Indispensable for people like us who were just starting out. Not content with performing tasks in an impeccable manner, she seemed to assume an obligation to announce obligations to us. Alas! Holding many talents for improvising and thinking deeply, and without openly listing any criticisms or instructions. Please note, here is an example I have taken from thousands of examples: We bought a set of modern furniture in the dining room, with a folding table that used to be there and is still there, very beautiful, my goodness. In the beginning, my wife followed her usual practice and laid a carpet on it. Who knew that this carpet would strike at 克樂蒂德's concept of beauty. Silently, she removed it. My wife put it back on, and she removed it again. In the end, my wife understood and put the carpet away.

After 克樂蒂德 finished this matter with her female employer, she was even willing to pay attention to me. At first, I thought this was good. Can I confess this to you? When fortune first came upon us, I had never worn a swallowtail dress or a smoking jacket. That is why 克樂蒂德, when the time came, used thoughtful methods to guide me on which one to wear. Likewise, she knew how to make me pay attention to correcting certain mistakes. One evening, just as we were about to go out, I heard her say to me:

"麥薛 is a little careless this evening!"

"Why, 克樂蒂德?" I asked.

"Because 麥薛 made a mistake. 麥薛 put on a swallowtail coat and fastened a black bow tie."

I hadn't heard of this small detail: you have to wear a white bow tie with a swallowtail coat! Later, 克樂蒂德 continued her work, strictly adhering to a regulation of wearing yellow leather shoes and floral shirts, and these were the details that I had always performed the worst. And that wasn't the only sacrifice she knew to add to my personal tastes. I also had to eliminate my still too vulgar language, and in a twisted attitude, give up my habit of stuffing rice dumplings into the mouth of my vest, give up my pipe to smoke cigars, and give up playing 貝育特的 cards to play bridge.

We not only changed the menu at home to suit this loyal servant, but I tell you, 麥薛, we also had to often sneak into restaurants to eat certain dishes that were not suitable for our new environment: such as 酸燴小牛頭, 伽恩州做法的臟腑, fisherman-style fresh mussels, and the like.

Such multifaceted efforts unfolded by our outstanding housekeeper were not without effect. Slowly, but surely, we made progress in comfortable living. Perhaps we could finally transform into a pair of the most presentable social people if an unexpected change did not suddenly jeopardize our education.

One morning, we wasted time waiting for 克爾蒂德 to come to work. So my wife went to the bedroom of this model servant to see her, but she was not in the bedroom. Suspecting something, we made a circle around the house: we found that our pearl had disappeared along with our silver tabletop, some jewelry, and other decorations. ...

You ask if I reported it to the police? My goodness, 麥薛, I should tell you that we didn't! We, my wife and I, were so satisfied at the time with what had fallen upon us. (Translated from the French 中国邮报周刊)

### Snippets on Poetry

— Hu Ne

Poetry is like sweet dew, nourishing our parched lives.

Poetry that is divorced from reality, that sings of the wind and moon; poetry that lives in an ivory tower; poetry that is beautiful in appearance but poor in content; this era no longer needs it.

We want the accusations of the masses, the grievances from the bottom of our hearts, the reflection of reality, poetry with flesh and blood!

### Tang Dynasty Dance Costume

— Ming Yu

### On the Tang Dynasty Dance Costume Painted by Ms. Ming Yu

— Zhu Yingpeng

The prosperity of dance and music was praised in the Tang Dynasty, and the systems of the Jiaofang Bureau were passed down. The customs of the Central Plains and the Western Regions were all appropriate, and the teams were arranged like an army. Later generations of culture and education lost the etiquette, and the Ming Dynasty's atmosphere moved with the stars. The paintings in the Mogao Caves preserve the customs, and a glimpse can be seen. In recent years, scholars have been fascinated, traveling thousands of miles to the Western border, painstakingly copying and pursuing, forgetting their fatigue, and seeing a new banner in the art world. It must be known that the skills of craftsmen are uneven, and the merit of examining ancient customs can be used. In taking the law, it is necessary to distinguish between the pure and the flawed, and to plagiarize blindly is only to deceive oneself. Now, new ideas come out of the loom, and following blindly is not following the blind. Drawing from the past and promoting the new lies here, and lacking one basket of soil will ruin all the work.

### Distant Thoughts

— Yang Mou

Separation allows us to savor the meaning of reunion; with separation, we cherish the time of coming together even more. Fate is impermanent; it is the trickster of life. Countless emotions can only be conveyed silently and remotely through the merging of souls.

You say that the surroundings are dry and desolate, like an endless desert, with no trace of green oasis to be seen. But I, too, can only find a little warmth and comfort in your letters, in the words of the past. The climate should be echoing the warmth of spring day by day, but when will it shine on our side?

This is an era of tormenting young people, no, an era of training young people. The sensitive tentacles of thought - we are eager to develop in every direction, but we inevitably reflect back disappointment and pessimism! - We remember bravely encouraging each other not to sigh, which only more obviously reveals the emptiness of the heart, doesn't it. What's the use? I am sure that you are still often...

We worry about life and respect life. Life is solemn, and for its sake, we have endured all the costs. Even if the torment of emotions is painful, let the brilliance shine in the taste of tears, and we place our hopes on the future.

Sweeping across the long passage of time, the distant space, in an atmosphere of loneliness, we proudly are not lonely after all. The floating clouds in the sky, the moon, the familiar soil under our feet - we are always connecting them and delivering the same care.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 196

— Ye Jingfeng

This time, as soon as I heard Yaoqun about to read out the order, I noticed that the lights in the hall, as if changing bulbs, suddenly flickered twice, and then flickered twice again. This was a warning signal. However, if I hadn't heard Yaoqun read out the first alarm, I would never have noticed this second alarm, because the flickering of the lights was common in Beiping, saying that the Beiping generator was too old and often had problems. After the lights flickered, I saw Yaoqun's pupils quickly reflect twice, which was exactly the natural preparation of the pupils; this proved that she had not been hypnotized (because the eyes of the subject are either wide open or closed, but they will never flicker). At the same time, I saw her eyes focused on the ground not far from us, with a very nervous expression, so I followed her gaze, and only then did I discover that in the place where the lights on the ground cast yin and yang shadows, there was a very faint shadow flickering. After carefully identifying the intervals of the flickering, I realized that it was the telegram from the headquarters.

This communication method was installed extremely cleverly; it only required a small telegraph key panel, one end connected to the total money of the electric meter, and the other end connected to a transformer, with a telegraph button installed in the middle to control the current. Touching this button would cause all the electric lights to flicker, one dark and one bright.

But at this time, the lights in the hall did not all flicker obviously. Only by carefully watching the places where shadows of different sizes and light intensities were cast could one vaguely see the flickering action. I thought that perhaps only one small light in the many lights in the hall was connected to a transformer, so the flickering was imperceptible; otherwise, would a cunning spy like "Commander Jin" be able to escape her notice if all the lights were to flicker together? But from this point, it can also be seen that Yaoqun's alertness is truly beyond the reach of ordinary people.

While Yaoqun was reading the telegram order, the situation on Hejian's side suddenly changed again. After hearing Hejian announce his identity and name, the female commander had already changed from strengthening to softening. I don't know what happened, maybe Hejian made a joke or two to her, but the guy's attitude suddenly became tough again. Because I was listening to Yaoqun read out the telegram and searching for the source of the flickering lights, I didn't pay attention to the cause of the changes on Hejian's side; at this time, I only heard the so-called "Commander Jin" repeatedly pressing Hejian to provide proof of identity, otherwise, she would carry out a full search according to the order, but Hejian was still smiling and speaking irregular and stiff Japanese:

"Search, yes, search! But today I came from 松井, and I haven't heard of this "Garrison Command"... Which side is this department on; is it Japanese? Or Chinese? Or is it jointly run by both sides? ..."

As Hejian said this, I saw the color on the face of the so-called "Commander Jin" become extremely ugly, which showed that she had become extremely angry, and only a slight touch was needed to make her explode. While they were arguing, Yaoqun, who was standing beside me, suddenly gently told me and Little Tiger, "Our people are all down!" I slightly turned my head and glanced at the dining seats in the hall. I didn't know when, people had gathered around a dozen tables, some with three or four people at a table, some with one or two people, and even our big fool "〇四" was squeezing at a table with his men. What surprised me even more was that among these people, there was a table where Mr. Dai, Mr. Ma, and Mr. W were sitting upright. Several waiters, like colorful butterflies, were gliding and fluttering, busily coming and going between the tables, delivering tea, snacks, coffee, cold drinks, etc. As for when he came, because I was fully focused on Hejian's side, I simply had no awareness.

Free Talk

### "Chicken and Eggs"

— Yang Zhimin

The City Council's discussion on unfreezing the cost of living index caused quite a stir. (Details can be found in the "New Sun" column of this newspaper on the 9th.)

However, the impassioned pleas of two councilors at the meeting are worth mentioning again.

"If the chicken is finished, where will the eggs come from?" This major question is indeed worth the government's consideration.

The workers are the chickens. The cost of living index is the chicken feed, but in this environment of economic collapse, the chickens themselves do not hope to eat white rice. All they ask for is a little bit of bran that can prolong their lives. After all, the chickens still have to lay eggs.

Conversely, if the government only hopes that the chickens lay eggs and does not give them the minimum feed, then, "Where will the eggs come from?" If the production of eggs is truly cut off, what will happen to the "egg bosses" who rely on the chickens for survival?

### Facing the Taiwan Incident Squarely

— Liu Meng

According to an Associated Press report on the 8th: Demonstration movements occurred in Taiwan, led by Taiwanese people repatriated from Japan and Hainan Island, showing their political colors for the first time, shouting slogans... This is such eye-catching news!

There was no "disturbance" when Taiwan was taken over, but the disturbance arose a year after the takeover. This is not an accidental event. The useful things left behind by the Japanese are not nonexistent, but they have not been fully utilized. And what was brought from the motherland? People longed for rain in a drought, but what did they get? — A cruel storm! Fifty years is not a short period! Chairman Chiang brought the warmth of the motherland, but as soon as the Chairman left, the current reality drove away the warmth. Inner hope is hope, but fact is fact. Who wouldn't be disappointed?

"Everything will be fine after the victory!" Everyone had such hope, but this "solution" was occupied by a few people. What other solution is there?

Now the incident has "political color," and the "demonstration" movement is "led by Taiwanese people repatriated from Japan and Hainan Island." What exactly is going on? The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. It is worth our deep thought.

### The Fox Killing Record

— Jianhua

This newspaper reported yesterday that the Qingxian Cotton Mill on Jianguo Road in this city has experienced strange fires in the past three days due to the haunting of a fox spirit, resulting in a loss of as much as 150 million yuan. The talk of the streets is full of wonder.

In this atomic age, the theory of fox hauntings is difficult to establish. The strange fires at the factory are exactly the same as the fact that Battalion Commander Yang killed a fox. I will record it below as a reference for the factory's investigation:

Outside Shangwen Gate in this city, there is a temple, not very famous, which is said to be inhabited by a fox spirit. It is known for its spiritual efficacy in seeking wealth and asking about illnesses. The incense is flourishing, attracting people from near and far. In the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], anti-Japanese troops gathered in southern Shanghai, suffering from a lack of accommodation. Battalion Commander Yang of a certain battalion saw that the location of the temple was suitable and sufficient for use, so he asked the monks of the temple for permission to reside there. The monk said that there was a fox spirit in the temple and feared that it would be difficult to settle down. Battalion Commander Yang did not believe him, scoffed at it as nonsense, and personally led several movements into the temple, arranging everything. Yang saw a spirit tablet in the meditation hall, said to be the fox spirit, covered with a ceiling. The paint was new, the windows were bright, and the tables were clean, and the sound of the bell was clear. Yang immediately wrote a note in the chanting hall and ordered the soldiers to post it outside the door, designating it as the camp's garrison. At that time, there was nothing different. The next day, the soldiers arrived, and just as they were unloading their luggage, they looked at each other in surprise. What was coming? The juice was all over the blankets. The monk folded his palms and said that it must be the work of the great immortal, so there was this anomaly. Yang still did not believe it. Unexpectedly, in three days, there were more than ten strange fires. Not only did they burn bedding, but even the documents on the table could spontaneously ignite. Battalion Commander Yang was filled with doubt and burned incense and lit candles to worship in front of the spirit tablet, and ordered the soldiers not to enter the meditation hall without permission, so as not to disturb the great immortal. At the same time, a yellow paper suddenly fell slowly from the dogwood ceiling, on which were written the words "Please stay elsewhere, or don't blame me." Battalion Commander Yang had a flash of inspiration and immediately pulled out his pistol and fired several shots at the ceiling. Immediately, he found fresh red blood dripping down. He was greatly surprised, and went to the pavilion to verify it. An old monk was curled up in the pavilion, his head and chest had been shot, and blood was flowing like a flood, he was dead. Battalion Commander Yang then knew that the monk was deliberately playing tricks, pretending to be a fox spirit, in order to prevent the borrowing of the house. He searched the monks of the temple and found two leather hides, a glass bottle, a leather bag containing dung juice, with a copper pipe installed on it, the pipe was not plugged, and could be rotated left and right. If it was rotated to the right, the hole would appear, and if it was rotated to the left, the hole would be closed, like a dripping bottle. There were several pieces of pity in the glass bottle, half of which had been used. The crowd was angry and wanted to kill him, but after a certain gentleman's plea, they let it go.

It is found that once the phosphorus is dissolved, it can catch fire. The strange fire in the cotton mill on Jianguo Road may also be caused by people.

### Words Still Ring in My Ears

— Yu Wangwo (artist)

The team leaders' meeting decided not to discuss the China issue

### "Vanguard for the People" — A Short Record of a Traitor's Change of Face

— Changliu

Hu Shih told reporters that students cannot be blamed for being interested in politics now because the country has been in turmoil for years. This statement seems applicable to the problem of traitors.

The traitor problem, in a certain period, that is, during the period when reserve notes were two hundred to one, the "wind" was indeed quite "tight" for a while, because "what you sow is what you reap." The "traitors" who had served the enemy puppets with "dog and horse labor" should naturally be "punished."

However, many traitors, like "reserve notes," have greatly changed their faces after the "two hundred to one" "conversion" stage. It's a bit like Sun Wukong plucking a "hair" from his body, shouting "Change!" and wiping his face, the "monkey spirit" may immediately turn into a charming eighteen-year-old girl, or a representative of public opinion who has gone through some kind of election, or even a neatly dressed and majestic "chief" or the like. Therefore, those "loyal dogs and horses" who were "despised" in their hearts also didn't care at all, shouting "Long live..." in front of the "meeting as usual"; and also posing as one of the leaders who lead the masses with "bear-like gestures", showing their style.

For example, those "musicians" who composed something like the "Greater East Asia March" for the "Japanese fathers" are now actually greatly moaning about "how difficult the arduous resistance against Japan" for the motherland in their song lyrics.

On their faces, they still look radiant, carrying the big sign of "Vanguard for the People."

——When there is a shortage of talent, traitors can also serve the country!

Therefore, translating books (those already in prison), composing music, directing movies, performing plays, is exactly "giving strength if you have strength" and "giving talent if you have talent" (talent meaning talent), making brilliant contributions in many ways!

But mainly, we cannot forget Hu Shih's phrase, the motherland has been in turmoil for years, everyone is tightening their belts and doesn't even have time, who still cares about ethics, morals, what about being a bastard for the "Japanese fathers" and so on, what "traitors" and what "puppets"!

Eating is important, everyone is too busy to take care of themselves, so you have your numbers, and I have my numbers, and we can only sigh with disappointment.

Edward Robinson and Joan Bennett in "Scarlet Street"

### Wangxian Gate

— Hulu

Foreign soldiers visited foreign prostitutes and fell into a soy sauce vat

— See the Beiping Correspondence of Ta Kung Pao

Foreign soldiers secretly visit foreign prostitutes, "Phoenix seeks the male"; foreign soldiers see military police and panic, wanting to escape!

Learning cleverly from "Zhang Junrui", they hurriedly jumped over the high wall, but accidentally fell into a soy sauce vat! Soy sauce vat, out crawled a big cockroach!

### Oscar Wilde and the Audience

— Hua

Once, the play of the aesthete Oscar Wilde was performed on stage and met with great failure. That night he went to the club. Someone asked him:

"Oscar (his name), how was your play performed tonight?"

"Oh," the writer replied proudly, "the play was a great success, but the audience was a great failure."

### Introducing "Scarlet Street"

— Bicheng

"Scarlet Street" tells us a real story. It is not as heartbreaking as "The Constant Nymph." It is hot, it is bloody, but it is not unfamiliar.

A fifty-year-old middle-aged man, who has served in the accounting department for twenty years, has no passionate love, no great career, and naturally no money to spend lavishly in his life. He just lives diligently, loyally, and ordinarily. Is he really very satisfied? Of course not, just as he said: "In the depths of the heart, there is always something stuck." He can't say what it is, it's been too long. It has been hidden in his heart for ten or even twenty years. One day, the dust on its surface is suddenly blown away by a gentle breeze, so it becomes clear and prominent again. It is "love," it is "desire." After many years of deep hiding, once it comes out, it becomes stronger and more powerful. Middle-aged people are not easy to be infatuated, but once they are infatuated, the degree must be deeper and more difficult to extricate themselves than young people.

Because there were scenes of theft and murder in the film, it is said that it was even banned in the United States for a time, but it was finally lifted. The reason is that the filming of the film should be able to reflect reality. When theft and murder have not been eradicated in real life for a day, it is impossible not to have similar shots on the screen.

"Scarlet Street" has scenes of theft and murder, but I feel that it has given me a lesson. Moreover, under the joint performance of Edward Robinson and Joan Bennett, it has great artistic achievements. It was selected as one of the famous films, and it was not a fluke.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"Okay! Okay! Stop talking! Okay?" Lao Zhu made a vomiting gesture. "I've heard enough of your high-sounding theories! In the mouths of you businessmen, materials are always the most important thing, with materials there is resistance against Japan, with materials there is a country. It's really brilliant! But only..."

Xu Shaoming interjected triumphantly, interrupting the other party's words.

"Of course! Isn't the war with foreign countries for the sake of fighting for materials?"

"Brilliant! Brilliant!" Zhu Zhaonian said with a hippie smile: "But there is one thing missing: if no one fights well on the front line, one day, your materials will have nowhere to be robbed, nowhere to be transported! Unless you transport them to the Himalayas!"

"But the soldiers on the front line also have to eat and dress. If there are no materials, what do you teach them to wear and eat?" Xu Shaoming wiped the sweat from his face with a snow-white handkerchief, while feeling justified.

"Are the materials you are robbing and transporting to supply the soldiers with food and clothing? Brother, don't deceive yourself!" Lao Zhu couldn't help but add a contemptuous sneer. "What kind of materials are you robbing and transporting? To be honest, the country doesn't need this kind of materials at all! Now that the resistance against Japan has reached this point, ladies should also suffer a little! What's the use of robbing and transporting these luxuries? If everyone only talks about robbing and transporting this kind of materials, brother, I'm not saying big words to scare you, maybe your materials haven't been transported to Chongqing yet, and the enemy is waiting for you there early in the morning!"

Fatty Xu seemed to be a little horrified by what he said; but these few words were certainly not enough to change his prejudice (11)
