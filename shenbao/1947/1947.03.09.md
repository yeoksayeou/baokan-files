### The National Army Advances Smoothly on All Fronts: The Shandong Battle Situation Will See New Developments; Fierce Fighting Around Qingdao Has Lasted Nine Days

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 8th Dispatch] The new overall deployment of the National Army in Shandong Province has been meticulously completed. The military forces on all fronts are advancing smoothly, and new developments are expected soon. The defense of Jinan is becoming increasingly consolidated, and there has been no fierce fighting on its outskirts for a week. In the outer areas of Weixian, Changle, Qingdao, Jimo, and Jiaoxian, the Communist army's attacks have lasted for nine days and nights, but the National Army still firmly holds each stronghold and is fighting against them. The battle situation in Tianma, near Changle, is becoming increasingly fierce. In recent days, there have been more than ten rounds of charges back and forth each day, but the area remains in the hands of the National Army.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 8th Dispatch] More than 20,000 Communist troops in the Culaishan area southeast of Tai'an have been building fortifications near Dawenkou for several days, actively preparing for battle. Military sources say that good news from the front lines in southern Shandong may be reported tomorrow.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 8th Dispatch] The area of operations around Qingdao is expanding. From the evening of the 6th, more than 20,000 Communist troops attacked Balizhuang in the north of Jiaoxian County, Yanggezhuang in the south of the county, and the Dagu River west of the county. After being repelled, they reinforced their troops on the evening of the 7th and attacked Zhongyong Village in the east of the county, attempting to encircle Jiaoxian from all sides. Fierce fighting continued on the evening of the 8th. In addition, several thousand Communist troops harassed Lancun to the east and west of Jiaoxian, the Jiaodong railway stations, and Lianhua Mountain, ten kilometers east of Jimo, on the evenings of the 6th and 7th. All were repelled. When the Communist troops retreated from Lancun and Jiaodong, they destroyed many sections of the railway tracks.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 8th Dispatch] The battle for Jiaoxian is intensifying, and the Communist army is continuing to reinforce the outer areas of Jiaoxian. The Communist Independent Brigade sneaked into Ducunjie, twelve kilometers southwest of Jiaoxian, on the 8th. The Sixth Division sneaked into Shimou, twenty kilometers from Jiaoxian, on the 7th, and the Fifth Division sneaked into Sunjiakou, north of Jiaoxian, and is continuing to move south.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 8th Dispatch] The fierce fighting in the Changle area on the outskirts of Weixian has increased. The attacking Communist troops have also increased to more than 20,000. The area of operations has expanded from Tianma and Tan Jiafangzi to Lataipu, Dongxi Fengting, and other places around Changle. Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 7th.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] The Communist Police Third and Fifth Brigades sneaked into Paishan Railway Station on the 7th. The Ninth Division sneaked into Wangwang, twenty-eight li northwest of Weixian, and there is a trend of re-offending Zaxian.

### The Battle on the Pinghan Railway Line is Deadlocked: Liu Bocheng's Remnant Communists Invade Kaocheng

[Our Newspaper Baoding, 8th Dispatch] The battle on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway line is deadlocked. The Communist troops in the Taihang area west of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section are busy with troop movements. More than 10,000 troops under Nie Rongzhen are concentrated between Wangdu and Xinle in the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section, attempting to prevent the National Army from connecting this section from north to south, and there is a tendency to secure the corridor area between Fuping section. The 34th Army Group Command in Baoding moved to Xushui today.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 8th Dispatch] The northern section of the Pinghan Railway line has entered a deadlock. The claim of recovering Tangxian is inaccurate. The National Army once detoured into the territory of Tangxian, while the Communist troops detoured north. More than 6,000 people sneaked into the north of Wan County yesterday, and more than 3,000 people sneaked into Dagudian south of Mancheng. The outskirts of Xushui are still tense, and more than 5,000 Communist troops continue to sneak into Xudong. More than 3,000 people sneaked into Santai Town northeast of Baoding yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 8th Dispatch] After the National Army moved into Mancheng, the Communist troops entrenched nearby were all wiped out. Their remaining main forces fled to the mountains west of Mancheng. In addition to tracking and pursuing them, the National Army is setting up checkpoints and advancing layer by layer. There are no large Communist troops within ten li around Mancheng. Residents have been helping the old and young to return one after another. The county government is now launching relief work.

[Another Telegram] Since the National Army reinforcement troops moved into Xushui, the security situation has become increasingly peaceful and the morale of the people is stable. On the night of the 7th, more than 2,000 Communist troops of unknown number suddenly sneaked in from the northwest, carrying six mortars and more than 20 machine guns, and distributed themselves around the west of the city and the Daxiao Jue Liang area, urgently collecting stretchers from nearby villages, seemingly intending to attack the city.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th Dispatch] More than 6,000 Communist troops sneaked into Dakangguan north of Wan County and the east side of the Pinghan Railway line. A part of them, more than 3,000, sneaked into the Datongdian area south of Mancheng. In addition, more than 3,000 Communist troops entrenched in Jicai Santai northeast of Baoding are again attempting to attack Mancheng.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th Dispatch] Military news: Last month, Communist General Liu Bocheng led seven columns to invade the Longhai Railway. After capturing Caoxian on January 25, they invaded Kaocheng. Although the local security teams have been steadfastly defending, due to the disparity in numbers, towns such as Mengtai Old City in the county have fallen, and the Communist troops have been burning, killing, and looting, which is extremely tragic.

### County Magistrates in Central Shandong Are Rewarded and Punished Respectively

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th Dispatch] Tan Ziqi, Special Commissioner of the 10th District of Shandong, and Zhai Yuwei, Special Commissioner of the 12th District, were authorized to order the county magistrates under their jurisdiction to withdraw when the Communist troops invaded central Shandong. The 16th Resolution Committee of the Shandong Provincial Government has decided to remove them from their posts but retain them. Liang Ruwei, County Magistrate of Boshan, Cheng Xuetong, County Magistrate of Zichuan, Li Guideng, County Magistrate of Zouping, Zhou Tong, County Magistrate of Zhangqiu, and Liu Shengwu, County Magistrate of Changshan, were also given two major demerits each for misunderstanding the order and withdrawing from their jurisdictions. Liu Zhenzhang, County Magistrate of Laiwu, and Xu Zhenxi, County Magistrate of Xintai, cooperated with the military and went deep into the occupied areas. All measures were in accordance with the requirements of pacification. Although they eventually withdrew from the county due to changing circumstances, they risked their lives and made outstanding achievements, and were each given one major merit and awarded a bonus of 500,000 yuan.

### The First Batch of American Troops Leaving China Will Depart for Guam This Week

[Associated Press, Beiping, 8th Dispatch] It is reported that after former US Special Envoy to China, Marshall, announced his resignation from mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the first batch of withdrawing US troops will be dispatched to Guam within a week. The first batch of withdrawing US troops are the troops stationed in Tianjin, who have been fully equipped and are ready to depart for Guam on transport ships from Tanggu in the coming days, deploying everything in preparation for the rest of the troops to continue to be stationed there. The official departure date is subject to the announcement from Washington, so the US military here has not been able to confirm this news. The total withdrawal of the US military may be delayed until sometime next month or early May. How long they remain depends on the withdrawal of the last batch of American personnel from the previous convoy. This last batch of withdrawing personnel is scheduled to return home on the 7th of next month, but there will still be a few hundred people staying until May to complete everything. When the main force of the US military withdraws, 50 US troops in Beiping will be among the first to depart.

### The National Army in Northeast China Has Loyally Achieved Military Success: The Chairman Specially Awards Medals; Du Yuming Broadcasted the Course of the Battle Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 8th Dispatch] This time, the National Army completely defeated the superior forces of the Communist troops who were disturbing Changchun, Dehui, Nong'an, and other places in the snowy and icy Northeast, achieving unprecedented results. The Chairman deeply appreciates the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers in stabilizing the local areas and protecting the people. In addition to sending a special telegram of commendation, he also awarded medals to the meritorious generals and soldiers. These medals have now been forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief's Office by the Northeast Headquarters, and Chief Du will personally award the medals in Changchun in the coming days. There are three types of medals: the Army, Navy, and Air Force Medal, the Thousand-City Medal, and the Guanghua Medal, totaling more than one hundred.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th Dispatch] There are no traces of Communist troops on the south bank of the Songhua River. The National Army has completed its counterattack mission and is currently clearing the area to stabilize the people's livelihood. During this Communist southern invasion, Huang Kecheng, commander of the Communist Liaoning Field Army District and commander of the Third Division, was killed by the National Army in Longfeng Mountain during the battle of Dedong. Many other regimental and battalion commanders also died in the National Army's artillery fire.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] In the Battle of Dehui, the National Army achieved brilliant results. Huang Kecheng, commander of the Communist Independent Third Division, died on the battlefield during the fierce fighting on Phoenix Mountain northwest of Dehui. Wan Yi, deputy commander of the First Column of the Communist Jilin-Liaoning Field Army District, died of serious injuries in Shanghewan. It is also reported that the commanders of the 53rd Regiment of the 18th Division and the 24th Regiment of the 7th Brigade were killed in the Battle of Dehui. In summary, the Independent First Division suffered the most casualties among the Communist forces in the Changchun-Jilin area.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 8th Dispatch] The Beiping Headquarters received a telegram from the Northeast military today stating that the Communist army suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Dehui. Its Commander Huang Kecheng, Commander of the Third Army, Chen Xuedao, Commander of the 53rd Regiment of the 18th Division, and Song Zhaolai, Commander of the 20th Regiment of the Third Division, were all killed in battle. A total of the defeated Communist army's First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-first, Twenty-fourth, and Thirty-first Divisions, and the Thirty-fifth and Ninth Brigades, Tian Song's troops, the Jibei Military Region, three artillery regiments of the First and Third Military Subdistricts, and the First Tank Battalion, etc., suffered more than 30,000 casualties, captured more than 1,400 people, seized four tanks, 1,109 rifles, more than 30 light machine guns, and 16 heavy machine guns. The rest is still being checked. The Communist army currently deployed in Wujia Station has the Fourth and Sixth Divisions, one regiment in Wu Ke Shu, two brigades in Taolai Zhao, and one division in Sanyouhe.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th Dispatch] Chief Du Yuming broadcasted the course of the Changchun outer perimeter battle at the Changchun Central News Agency Radio Station at 8:15 p.m. on the 8th. He said that this battle was a strategy of luring the enemy in deep. Due to secrecy, it could not be announced in advance, causing the people in the counties along the river to suffer unprecedented devastation, and the elders of Changchun and Yongji also suffered greatly from the false alarms. The people are very uneasy, the Communist army launched its military offensive, its means were cruel, its actions were despicable, and the people of the Northeast will surely remember it. The Communist army first attempted to invade Changchun twice, but both failed. Now they have launched a full-scale invasion across the river, and Mao Zedong personally presided over it in the Northeast, and Lin Biao also convened a military conference in Harbin, which shows how important this action is. The Communist army claimed to have mobilized 300,000 troops this time, but they have already mobilized 200,000 people. The scale of the invasion on all fronts is unprecedented. They planned to capture Changchun and then invade Liaopan. At the same time, they also launched an offensive in southern and western Liaoning to support them. The Communist army's conspiracy was foreseen by the National Army, and countermeasures were formulated. Therefore, after the Communist army crossed the river, the National Army gradually implemented the predetermined plan, concentrated its forces, and shortened the front line. The garrison of Dehui had only four battalions, and the garrison of the bridgehead had only two platoons, but they were able to follow orders, defend independently, and fight the main force of the Communist army for ten days without being moved. The Communist army's offensive was frustrated and suffered heavy sacrifices. At the same time, the National Army stationed in Jilin and Changchun launched attacks on all sides, defeating them in one fell swoop. The Communist army fled in panic, losing more than 30,000 elite troops. Their arrogant attempt has finally become an illusion. In summary, this battle was extremely fierce, but we were able to defeat the Communist army, militarily breaking their attempt to attack fortified positions and politically defeating their ambition to forcibly seize territory. At the same time, we smashed their international propaganda conspiracy. This glorious victory depends on the brave sacrifice of all officers and soldiers, and the 600,000 people of Changchun mobilized to maintain security and assist the National Army. The military and civilians of Dehui are united and unwavering, and their spirit of doing what is right and being brave is a traditional expression of the Chinese nation's moral character for 5,000 years and a symbol of the spirit of military-civilian cooperation.

### The Communist Army in Southern Liaoning Is Actively Operating

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 8th Dispatch] The Communist army's activities in southern Liaoning have recently become more active. According to military sources: (1) More than 4,000 Communist troops launched a full-scale attack on Majiatun, 15 kilometers north of Miaoxizhen, on the morning of the 3rd. The Communist army there defended with all its strength, launching repeated attacks and killings. After a bloody battle for a day and night, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties. When the National Army reinforcements arrived at noon on the 4th, they were immediately defeated. The remaining Communist troops left more than 600 bodies and fled to the southeast. (2) On the night of the 4th, about 3,000 Communist troops attacked the garrison of Shijiatun, one kilometer east of Pulandian. Another part attempted to cut off the National Army's reinforcements by detouring around the area north of Shijiatun. After the garrison fought bravely, they repelled the detouring troops by dawn on the 6th. However, the Communist troops on the front were still fighting.

[Another Telegram] The more than 20,000 Communist troops who occupied Tongliao were besieged by our garrison after breaking through. After reorganizing near Dalin, they joined forces with the reinforcements and intercepted the Communist troops in the area. The fighting was fierce, and the Communist army suffered more than 1,000 casualties and fled in all directions. Our army took advantage of the victory and advanced to the outskirts of the city.

[Another Telegram] The Communist army north of Dalian attacked Shijiatun (east of Pulandian) again on the 5th. The National Army has given it a strong blockade.

### The CCP Barters Goods with the Soviet Union: A Large Amount of Grain is Transported to Soviet Territory

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th Dispatch] According to a telegram from Changchun by New York Times reporter Wells on March 6, the Communist Party of Northeast China is transporting 6,000 tons of grain daily to Soviet Siberia via railway in exchange for Soviet coal, kerosene, perfume, matches, cigarettes, and other items. Wells quoted Chinese railway engineers and other personnel who had just arrived in Changchun from the Communist area as saying that the Harbin Communist Party and the Soviet Union had established a barter agreement to transport grain to Siberia, and the transaction began two months ago. So far, 900,000 tons of wheat, soybeans, beef, pork, sorghum, and corn have been transported to the Soviet Union. Furs are also included. According to Wells, an average of ten freight cars leave Harbin every day, each carrying 600 tons of goods. Five of them go to Manzhouli, and the other five go to Suifenhe. He said that since the freight began at the end of January, the Soviet Union has transported 65 Japanese-made locomotives to Harbin. These locomotives were taken away by the Soviet army when they occupied the Northeast. In addition, a large number of railway technicians were sent to Harbin. Wells also said that according to people who had just arrived here from Harbin, since the freight began, grain prices in Harbin have risen by more than 200%. After the Communist Party's two offensives against the National Army along the Songhua River failed, the value of the anti-currency fell sharply, and they began to hoard grain, which resulted in further inflation. It is said that the poorest residents have also turned against the Communist Party. This resentment is due to the lack of coal during the cold season, the stagnation of commerce, the heavy taxes, the recruitment of all people from the age of eighteen to forty-five, and the stationing of Communist troops in each household. Anyone who dares to criticize the Communist regime is labeled as an "absolute reactionary" and killed. Many people have fled to the National Army areas. The Communist Party issues exit permits in Harbin to allow people to go to Changchun to buy goods that are exclusively lacking in Harbin, but the procedure for obtaining these permits is extremely complicated and time-consuming, because the Communist Party is afraid that they will not return.

There is No Religious Freedom Under the Rule of the Chinese Communists

[United Press, Beiping, 8th Dispatch] Father Connors, a priest of the American St. Columbas Church and a correspondent for the National Catholic News Agency, recently came here from Yan'an. Today, he published a statement in an English newspaper denying that there is religious freedom in Yan'an. This is the most severe article by American observers criticizing the CCP's religious policy. It strongly argues that "the CCP persecutes religion in various parts of North China. Although there are formal and degree differences in various places, the principles are consistent."

This statement directly refutes the recent Associated Press report on religious freedom in Yan'an. The article is accompanied by a photo of a church in Yan'an, titled: "Desecrated Holy Land." The article states: "The churches in Yan'an are now used by the CCP to store grain. The pulpits are filled with millet and grains. All the windows of the churches have been damaged. The walls are covered with CCP slogans."

"On February 15, I held Mass for Catholics in Yan'an. The Mass was not held in the church, but in a former Catholic elementary school. I guessed that the CCP wanted to use our gathering for propaganda. Sure enough, the Shanghai newspapers published C.T. Sim's Associated Press report on the religious gathering in Yan'an on February 15. Who is this Associated Press reporter who personally participated in my religious gathering? At that time, the only Chinese who could speak English was Ma Shengming (transliteration), who was a member of the CCP and belonged to the 18th Group. He accompanied me throughout my visit to the church. He is a senior official of the foreign reporters' liaison office. I dare not conclude that this new article was written by Ma. But he must be the ghostwriter of this article. He did not explain why I could not hold Mass in the church. I can point out that the reason is that all the buildings of the church, except for the two rooms of the elementary school, have been occupied by the CCP army."

"When Mr. Ma accompanied me to see Father Liang, I spoke to Father Liang in Latin, but he shook his head and did not answer. His expression was rather uneasy. Father Liang is a graduate of Fu Jen Catholic University and is enthusiastic about Latin. Why did he remain silent? This made me very surprised. Later, I learned that it is not appropriate to talk in a language that they do not understand in front of the CCP officials."

"The CCP leaders all unanimously advocate the CCP's religious freedom, but in practice, they are obeying in public but disobeying in private. The American officials of the Military Mediation Department are all familiar with this situation. However, because they are working hard to mediate, they do not want to speak freely. Now is the time to publicize it."

American Missionary Woman Arrested by the CCP

[United Press, New York, 8th Dispatch] The Presbyterian Church Foreign Missions Board announced today that Mrs. Jenness, a missionary of the church stationed in China, was arrested by the CCP in a village in Shunde County, Southern Hebei, three months ago. Mrs. Jenness came to China to preach in 1916, and her husband passed away in Shunping in 1941.

### To Seek Prosperity in the Countryside, Industrial Development is Necessary: Weng Zhiyong Talks About the Planned Economy Proposal

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Weng Zhiyong, Acting Director of the Economic Research Office of the Central Agricultural Bank, talked about the "Planned Economy" proposal put forward by Xiao Zheng, which was approved by the National Defense Council a few days ago. Its main purpose is based on first prospering the rural economy, and then developing the industrial economy. This view is the same as that of the general public, because farmers account for 85% of China's total population. However, Weng Zhiyong believes that the main purpose of prospering the countryside is to develop security, such as Britain's development of India, which was based on an Indian shipping company, which improved its transportation and made India what it is today. Therefore, the focus should be on restoring transportation. At the same time, the proposal includes the mechanization of agriculture, and then advocating "those who till the land own the land." In fact, agriculture currently relies heavily on industry. In terms of collective farms, agricultural machinery and tools are needed. Therefore, in our country after everything is peaceful, its economic construction should wait for the development of industry before we can talk about agriculture, because the development from agriculture to industry is too slow. The current rural economy in our country is really about the stability of the villages.

It is understood that the steamer was operated by the Tongju Company on behalf of the Zhongya Company. It was carrying nearly 1,000 tons of express passenger and cargo from Hankou, with estimated losses exceeding 2.5 billion.

### Survey of Qaidam Basin; Survey Team of Over 400 People Formed; To Depart Next Month, Penetrating Deep into the Interior

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th] The Qaidam Basin, located in the northwest of Qinghai Province, is separated from the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang by only one mountain. It is larger in area than the entire Zhejiang Province. In ancient times, it was a thoroughfare for east-west travel, and traces of beacon towers still exist today. In the past, Mongols roamed there as nomads. More than a decade ago, due to the invasion of Kazakhs, the Mongols migrated to other places, resulting in the desolation of the basin and the absence of human habitation. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], an office for the supervision of agricultural reclamation was established, but it only started reclamation in a few data points along the Suiyuan border, and did not achieve practical results. Last year, the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway Survey Team penetrated deep into the basin, which was the first time that scientists from the interior had traversed the entire territory. However, the land is mostly alkaline. According to existing data, the value of developing the basin does not seem to be too high, far inferior to the reclamation area in the Northeast. The basin was abandoned for this reason. The recent formation of a survey team intends to use modern scientific methods to overcome natural difficulties in order to meet national defense needs. However, to penetrate deep into the desolate Han [area], the allocation of all manpower and materials must be carefully deployed. It is estimated that the entire team will have more than 400 people, costing more than 1 billion yuan. The team is scheduled to depart in April when the construction of the Yuxin Highway begins, heading west from Xining along the southern edge of the Bayan Har Mountains, turning back at the Altyn-Tagh Mountains at the junction of Qinghai and Xinjiang, and then heading along the northern edge of the Qilian Mountains to Delingha, passing through Dulan Salt Lake and returning to Qinghai. When necessary, it plans to directly enter the interior for a detailed survey. Qinghai Chairman Ma Bufang attaches great importance to this work and has decided to fully support the team in achieving the first exploration of the basin in its history.

British Consul-General Ogden delivered a speech, emphasizing the historical friendship between Britain and France, and said: After the last major war, it was mistakenly believed that Germany had lost its military strength and would no longer be a threat, allowing the Anglo-French alliance to disintegrate, and enabling Germany to rise again. Historical lessons are deeply alarming. The signing of the Anglo-French alliance took place in Dunkirk, and the timing was just before the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, which is very meaningful. France has now allied with the Soviet Union, and the Anglo-French alliance can prevent Germany's re-emergence at any time, and is a cornerstone of world peace.

### On Foreign Relations from a Moral Perspective

— Jiang Junzhang

Our Chinese nation has a universal traditional morality, that is, the concept of respecting merit and repaying kindness. During the Warring States period, Lord Wuji of Wei stole military tallies, seized Jin Bi's army, defeated the Qin army, and relieved the siege of Zhao. The King of Zhao and Lord Pingyuan greeted him with sincerity and respect, but Wuji looked proud. One of his officers, a butcher by the name of Zhu Hai, admonished him with the meaning of "One should never forget the kindness others have shown him; one should never remember the kindness one has shown others." Wuji gladly accepted, and this story has been passed down as a beautiful tale. Mr. Guo Moruo even wrote a play called "The Tiger Tally" to arrange and promote the history of Lord Xinling rescuing Zhao. In the wartime capital of Chongqing, it attracted many audiences. This concept of repaying kindness received and not expecting repayment for kindness given is an undeniable noble morality. The "repayment" here is nothing more than four forms, namely repaying kindness with kindness, repaying grievances with grievances, repaying kindness with grievances, and repaying grievances with kindness. No Chinese person does not deeply hate the event of "repaying kindness with grievances" and will never advocate it. This can be said to be one of our national morals.

Looking at the relationship between China and the United States, the United States has traditionally dealt with events related to China with a policy of sovereign independence, territorial integrity, open doors, and equal opportunities. Of course, this has its own position, but these things do not create a "grievance" in the minds of the Chinese people. As for the United States' support for our war of resistance with manpower, financial resources, and material resources during this war, and finally sacrificing the blood of its people on the Chinese battlefield, this is certainly for common interests, but it will not lead to resentment among the people of China. As for the post-war period, the United States helped us accept surrender, helped us return prisoners, gave us credit loans, mediated our internal disputes, assisted in the training of our army, and even hoped to provide greater economic assistance under possible circumstances to make us a democratic and prosperous country. The United States' policy toward China is certainly for the peace of the Pacific Ocean, that is, for its own security, but these measures do not pose any danger to China, so why should we form an intractable resentment? Therefore, our overall view of the central point of the anti-American movement is the presence of U.S. troops in China, and the central demand is the withdrawal of U.S. troops. In fact, this issue is very clear in the hearts of the average Chinese person: when the time comes, the U.S. troops will definitely return, and even if we want to keep them, we cannot. And when they go back, they will definitely go back cleanly and will never take a blade of grass or a tree from us. Therefore, the anti-American movement in China has no purpose to speak of.

Although the anti-American movement in China has its obvious international character, the actual center is probably the interests of the party. There are several simple facts that we can review: (1) When the United States wanted to reorganize the Chinese army and equip it with American equipment in order to counterattack Japan, the Chinese Communists proposed the requirement of proportional equipment for the Communist troops. They were using the effort of the war of resistance to cater to the American mentality of defeating Japan as soon as possible, in order to impress some American generals. The result was failure. The dismissal of U.S. General Stilwell and U.S. Ambassador to China Gauss was related to this matter. Before this incident, the Chinese Communists were not anti-American. After this incident, the Chinese Communists and the left-wingers of the Allied countries often mentioned Mr. Stilwell's dismissal, expressing great regret; and the responsible persons of the U.S. government have since been called reactionaries by the Chinese Communists. (2) A period of time after Japan's surrender was the golden period for the development of the Chinese Communists. They expanded from a base of seventy-odd counties to more than three hundred counties within a month or two; during this time, the U.S. Navy was working hard to help the Chinese government army handle the work of accepting surrender and returning prisoners, and the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union was changing rapidly on the international political stage. Since Japan's surrender, the Chinese Communists' anti-American movement has been developing day by day. From these facts, we can see whether the Chinese Communists' anti-American movement is for the socialist motherland? Or for the Chinese Communist Party itself? We can easily get the correct answer. And has the development of this movement been for the sake of the country and the nation? We can know without thinking.

Due to the development of the second fact mentioned above, the first slogan of the Chinese Communists against the United States after the victory was to oppose the presence of U.S. troops in China, and their demand was for the U.S. troops to withdraw from China. However, the U.S. troops in China did not come suddenly; they came for the victory of the United Nations and to cooperate in defeating Japan on the Chinese battlefield. They did not come to take advantage of the victory, rob resources, or move materials. The war had just ended, the bloodshed was not yet dry, the task had not been completed, and the efforts were in full swing. How could we start the movement to withdraw the U.S. troops? However, the Chinese Communists have their own propaganda methods. On the eve of Japan's surrender, Zhu De, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese Communist Army, issued seven orders in a row, ordering his troops to attack the government troops or the enemy and puppet troops awaiting surrender, seize cities and territories, and even spread the news of victory. The Chinese Communists called the war at this time "liberation" and "uprising." After October, the war did not make much progress, or even suffered defeats. He called the war at that time a civil war, and civil war should be opposed. He advocated the anti-civil war movement. U.S. troops helping the government army accept surrender and return prisoners were obviously beneficial to the government army, and vice versa, it was detrimental to the Chinese Communist army. Therefore, the Chinese Communists put the blame for fueling the civil war on the heads of the U.S. troops in China and opposed them. Therefore, the official launch of the Chinese Communists' anti-American movement was carried out under the cover of anti-civil war. When the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was established, the Chinese Communists launched another anti-American movement, using inequality as a pretext and calling for the prosperity of national capital and industry and commerce. However, there was no way to link it to the issue of U.S. troops in China, so they had to drop the subject. However, the Beiping Dong'an incident, in which a U.S. soldier raped a female student, Shen Chong, was a simple incident of a soldier breaking the law, but it was related to the presence of U.S. troops in China, and this incident happened to run counter to the Chinese society's concept of chastity. They used this psychology to expand the problem, but ultimately it was to withdraw the U.S. troops. By analogy, the Quan Gong Building incident was a kind of anti-American movement, mainly to boycott American goods, but this movement could only be carried out under the cover of loving domestic goods. The reason is the same. In short, the Chinese Communists take seizing power as their goal, the government as their enemy, and the friends of the government as their quasi-enemies, and therefore do their best to oppose them. Assuming that the Soviet Union sincerely helped the government to realize China's unification as the United States did, or that the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union toward China were reversed, then which country would the Chinese Communists carry out an anti-movement against? This is also a question that can be easily answered.

The Chinese Communists' anti-American movement in the government area is in a guiding position, and is implemented by scholars or businessmen who are dissatisfied with the government's measures. If we compare the leaders of several major anti-American movements and their party relations with the newspapers that have worked hard to promote them, we can find that in the past anti-American movements, there were speeches, articles, and statements, and the names were only a few, as if these gentlemen were specializing in this kind of business. They specialize in this kind of business. What exactly is it for? They also said that it was for peace, for democracy, and for the interests of the country and the nation, but what is the real purpose? Only they themselves know. There is a class of helpers in Chinese society, which can be called "gentry." They specialize in "resolving difficulties," so they also hope that there will be more "difficulties" and "disputes" in society. Otherwise, they will have nothing to resolve and will gain nothing. If we compare this situation with the current political situation, it is also very interesting to think about.

In short, looking at the anti-American movement in China from the past and future relations between China and the United States, from the relationship between the interests of the country and the nation, and from the perspective of China's national morality, this movement is impossible to happen. Looking at the United States' policy toward China, this movement is even less necessary to happen. However, under the premise that the interests of the party outweigh everything else, this movement has actually happened, which is a major stain on our nation's inherent morality.

We can see from the development methods of the anti-American movement that it is playing with the masses and deceiving the people. We need democracy, peace, unification, and national construction internally, and we need harmony between the United States and the Soviet Union to jointly maintain the peace of the Pacific Ocean externally. China cannot be anti-American, just as it cannot be anti-Soviet. This is a simple creed that our intellectuals should have.

### On the Eve of the Opening of the Council of Foreign Ministers, Bevin Arrives in Moscow, Marshall to Fly from Berlin to the Soviet Union Today

[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, 8th broadcast: The Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to open on the 10th. The British delegation, led by Bevin, arrived at the Belarusian Railway Station today. This is the first delegation of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to arrive in the Soviet Union. Marshall and Bidault will arrive in Moscow on Sunday. Marshall is in Berlin today, holding all-day talks with General McNarney, the US military commander, to study the 700-page report of the Allied Control Council. Marshall declared in Berlin that during the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, he will urge the other three countries to sign a 40-year pact with the United States to govern Germany's military rehabilitation and prevent the resurgence of Germany's war industry.

[Reuters Moscow, 8th dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin, upon arriving in Moscow by special train this afternoon, stated in a speech that he was delighted to return to Moscow on behalf of the British people to extend greetings to the Soviet Union. He expressed his hope that world peace could prevent future aggression and ensure security for the entire world. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky personally went to the airport to welcome Bevin.

[This newspaper's report] London, 8th broadcast: When British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to Moscow to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov did not go to the airport to welcome him, nor was the Soviet national anthem played by a band, as is usually the case when welcoming dignitaries from various countries to the Soviet capital. This has aroused various discussions, as even when the Polish Prime Minister arrived in Moscow last week, there were various welcoming ceremonies.

[Agence France-Presse Vienna, 8th dispatch] General Clark, commander of the US forces in Austria, left for Moscow via Berlin today.

[United Press Moscow, 8th dispatch] The US delegation attending the Moscow Conference, in addition to Secretary of State Marshall and his advisors, arrived here on the 8th in eight airplanes. There are thirty-six journalists in the US delegation, the highest number of US journalists the Soviet side has permitted to come to the Soviet capital. The US delegation and the journalist group are now staying at the Hotel Moskva, which is a gathering place for Americans.

The famous Soviet diplomatic expert, Munin, gave a speech on the issue of this conference on the evening of the 7th. After the speech, when answering questions from the audience, he pointed out: "The British train of twelve carriages (meaning twelve proposals) is on its way to the Soviet Union, but three of them are tightly covered." Munin also said that the German issue would be the most difficult in this conference, but with sincere cooperation, there are various reasons to believe that the German issue can be resolved. If a peace treaty with Germany can be concluded based on the Potsdam Agreement, then we need not fear the conspiracy of American capitalists to turn Germany into a colony.

### Secretary Marshall Reveals: Intention to Propose a Four-Power Pact

[United Press Berlin, 8th dispatch] Today, Marshall revealed here that the United States will propose a four-nation, 40-year agreement at the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to regulate Germany's demilitarization and industrial revival. In April of last year, former US Secretary of State Byrnes also made a similar suggestion of a 25-year agreement to the British, Soviet, and French governments. He also assured France and other neighboring countries of Germany that the United States did not want to withdraw from Germany until peace was definitively guaranteed. Later, in his speech in Stuttgart, Byrnes changed the term to 40 years, but the British, Soviet, and French governments have not yet expressed any opinion on it. Recently, Paris seems to hope that in addition to the British-Soviet-French triangular alliance agreement, the four-nation agreement will also be signed at the same time to ensure the possibility of jointly preventing Germany from aggressing again.

[Reuters Berlin, 8th dispatch] Before leaving here for the Soviet capital, Secretary of State Marshall stated that the United States believes that completing the four-power control of Germany pact previously proposed by Byrnes is extremely important. This is to show the world that the United States continues to care about Europe and accepts the responsibilities of other parts of the world. We believe that if this matter can be agreed upon, many difficulties concerning Germany and Austria can be easily resolved. Secretary Marshall also said that he had met with the French President, Prime Minister, and other officials in Paris, allowing him to understand in advance the French government's various opinions on Europe and the Moscow Conference. In Berlin, he received reports on the situation in Germany from senior officials of the US occupation zone, such as McNarney, Clay, and Murphy. Secretary Marshall is scheduled to fly to Moscow tomorrow morning. He made the aforementioned statement to American citizens and American journalists.

### Negotiations on Various Allied Treaties are Busy, Czech-Polish Treaty Scheduled to be Signed Today, Belgian-Czech Negotiations Underway in Prague

[Reuters London, 8th dispatch] In the week before the opening of the Moscow Conference, the negotiations on the allied treaties were extremely tense. The Anglo-French treaty was signed in Dunkirk on Tuesday, and the Czech-Polish treaty will also be signed in Warsaw on Sunday. These two treaties have many similarities, and some thorny issues have yet to be resolved. Britain and France have not yet reached an agreement on the future control of the Ruhr area and the distribution of Ruhr coal production. Just as the treaty was about to be signed, Britain's appointment of Germans as managers of the Ruhr industry almost prevented the treaty from being signed. The Czech-Polish treaty negotiations have been going on for several months, but no solution has yet been found regarding who owns the Teschen and Glacier regions. It is expected that the treaty will state that these issues will be left to be resolved within two years. In addition, after Belgium and France held preliminary talks, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak will also travel to Prague, intending to establish an alliance treaty with the Czech Republic. Between Britain and Belgium, since Foreign Secretary Bevin mentioned the idea of an alliance in Brussels, the conclusion of the alliance seems to be only a matter of time.

When a basic agreement was reached on the fifth day of the negotiations, the Hungarian Foreign Minister suddenly made an astonishing request, wanting the Czech delegation to discuss the consequences of the exchange and the issue of the Hungarian people in the Czech Republic performing labor. The Czech delegation replied that this was an internal Czech affair and could not be discussed. The Hungarian Foreign Minister immediately stated that continuing the negotiations was no longer necessary. The Hungarian delegation's raising of issues unrelated to the exchange of residents shows its lack of sincerity.

### Moscow Full of Life: Shops Compete to Show off

[United Press Lake Success, 7th dispatch] The United States' plan to entrust the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific Ocean has been disappointed due to the Soviet Union's proposed amendments to the Security Council and has aroused new disputes.

In addition, Austin said that he accepted two of the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union. One is that the United States should lead the people of the islands to independence, and the second is that the United States may manage the islands as part of the US territory. British and Australian representatives still insisted that the United States should not take over before the final peace treaty with Japan is signed. British representative Jebb stated that if the majority agreed, he would not oppose it. Australian representative Hasluck argued that other countries in the Pacific, such as New Zealand and India, should also have the opportunity to participate in the discussion, and said: The best way is to establish a special committee of the United Nations for detailed discussion. As a result, due to the differences of opinion between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, no resolution was reached. At this point, the Security Council adjourned and postponed the discussion of this issue until next Wednesday.

[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, 7th dispatch] Regarding the United States' request to entrust the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Security Council of the United Nations continued to discuss it. Chinese representative Dr. Guo Taiqi first gave a speech, saying: The Chinese government agrees with the United States' proposal to entrust the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific Ocean, such as the Caroline Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Mariana Islands, to the United States, and is willing to support it. I believe that the Security Council has the right to take a decision on this issue without waiting for the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. The Pacific Islands are of great strategic importance. The United States only asks to entrust them and does not ask to completely merge or control them. I agree with this.

### The United Nations Far East Department Releases an Economic Report Recommending the Establishment of a Far East Economic Commission

[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 7th dispatch] The United Nations Far East Department today released an economic report on Far Eastern countries. The part about China says: Due to the occurrence of the war, China's industrialization plan has been delayed for at least ten years. Prices have increased 6,000 times compared with before the war.

The report then recommends to the Economic and Social Council to establish a Far East Economic Commission, with the following points as guiding principles: (1) study economic and technical problems, (2) provide information on recovery work in the Far East, (5) make suggestions on technical assistance, (4) initiate and promote economic cooperation in the Far East.

### The German Question: The Key to European Peace

The German question is currently the only unresolved issue among the defeated European nations. The foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France will soon hold a meeting to begin discussions. This article describes the current situation in Germany, which is useful for those concerned about the global situation.

The German question currently facing the four powers is one of the most difficult issues in the quest for peace. In any case, the future of Europe is always linked to the fate of Germany. If the Soviet Union and Western countries are to coexist harmoniously, they must be able to agree on the German question.

When the foreign ministers of the various countries discuss the procedures for discussing the German question, they must consider the changes that Germany has undergone since the Potsdam Conference and the changes in Germany's relations with the major powers. The Potsdam Conference once established various regulations for the four powers' occupation of Germany, but in fact, it formed a plan for German peace.

Today's Germany appears to be different from the Germany at the time of the collapse of the Third Reich. This time, it suffered a far greater blow than the last, which is indeed a more important factor influencing the reconstruction of Europe. The cost and experience of the victorious nations in occupying Germany do not seem to be enough to teach them a lesson, and if they still want to implement the original plan, they will have to pay a considerable price.

Conflicting Objectives for Germany Among the Four Powers

The relations between the four powers have also not been without changes. It was difficult for the four powers to achieve coordination immediately after the victory, but few people expected that the struggle for interests and principles would be so profound as to cause a new division in the world, and a German peace treaty has not yet been signed.

In Germany, each occupying country is pursuing its own special goals, disregarding the general principles of the Potsdam decision. For example, France emphasizes the division of a territory, the Soviet Union focuses on reparations, the United Kingdom attaches importance to the restoration and control of the Ruhr industrial area, and the United States strives to eliminate Nazism. In each occupation zone, this method of acting independently makes Germany at a loss.

Today's world is already different from the world when the war just ended. Domestic disputes and unrest have occurred in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. No one has obtained anything they hoped for from the war, and no government believes that the impact of the war is equivalent to the revolutionary changes that the war should have caused.

Recently, General Clay, Deputy Chairman of the U.S. Military Government in Germany, criticized the lack of courage and realistic views of the German anti-Nazi courts because they often handled unimportant cases first and put aside the trials of important criminals.

But now there is still an opportunity to make the four powers' agreement on Germany not as difficult as the world fears, and the negotiations so far are still encouraging.

The Berlin Supervisory Control Committee is still a place where important representatives of the four powers maintain frequent contact. For a year and a half, they have been dealing with each other on a practical basis. Although this dealing is slow, they have gradually approached a common opinion, that is, the division system has failed, and unified management of Germany is indispensable.

Unification of Occupation Zones Urgently Needs to Be Resolved

Now France and the Soviet Union have not yet recognized the division management system, but in fact, the four countries are already prepared to recognize at some stage of the negotiation that further action is impossible unless Germany has a complete organization and a central government. Therefore, the unification of the zones is the first goal of discussion. If this goal can win the agreement of the three powers other than France, then the first hurdle can be overcome.

The importance of this development is due to the summary of experience. The division system is a fierce means of disarming Germany and completing Germany's military and political defeat; but as a peacetime method, it cannot benefit everyone. For example, the Soviet Union has found that in order to maintain a considerable standard of living, it has to reduce production for reparations, and Western countries have found that in order to purchase food, they have to export a part of the production materials that can be used for reparations. This division system not only divided Germany, but also divided the governments of the Allied countries.

A year and a half of occupying Germany has made it clear to everyone that the German question cannot be solved in isolation. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, which used to rely on neighboring Germany as their main source of trade income, have now become relief areas. The French insist that they need to get the Saar and the Rhineland, not only for security reasons but also as a precautionary embankment to avoid being mired in the same quagmire as Germany. The Czechs resent that they have lost the Sudetenland because they have lost technology and workers at the same time, as well as the source of Germany's market and material supply. As for Italy, there was a time when 50% of their foreign trade was with Germany.

Due to these circumstances, many factors influence each other, and the 60% reduction in coal mine production in the Ruhr area is the biggest economic panic caused by this war to Europe. The biggest irony after the war is that many vehicles cannot run, and many families cannot keep warm, because there are too few Germans left to manage the coal mines.

In this world, Germany has launched wars twice, and each time it has mobilized many of the world's most powerful countries to subdue it, but this time it has been truly defeated, and it seems difficult for it to launch another war in the near future.

During the war, many post-war designers thought that Europe could be rebuilt without Germany's participation. Many senior officials believed that Germany should only maintain a "soap and kitchen" economy and expel its troops to engage in building places that had been destroyed by the German army. The general principle is this: If we can distribute Germany's industry to other countries and make the industry of other neighboring countries more than that of Germany itself, we will definitely be able to stabilize the economy of the European continent and at the same time make the whole world safer.

Germany is Still the Center of Europe

But the problem is here: lowering the standard of living in Germany also lowers the standard of living in Europe. Under the surveillance of the four powers. It can continue to be in a prisoner's position, but it is still the center of Europe, and we have no way to separate it from the strategic position between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Due to this European geographical situation, the revival of Europe must first revive Germany, and both the East and the West should build peace in Germany, because if we cannot build peace in Germany, then we cannot establish peace anywhere else.

Today, when the foreign ministers of various countries are preparing to begin formal discussions on the issue of German peace, we must not forget that for eighteen months, the chairmen of the four occupation zones in Germany have been constantly striving to find detailed arrangements.

For this reason, Berlin has now become the most interesting capital in Europe, not only because it is where we test occupation methods and occupation policies, but also because it has become a city that has been destroyed by war and is almost the same as the original desert state.

Something will always grow out of the desert, and destruction is the foundation of some kind of new construction. If there are now some forces that can transcend the tendency of division and work hard to pull the various parts together, then there will inevitably be other forces that either engage in destruction or engage in construction.

Sixty million people will inevitably be united, especially in today's overpopulated Germany.

A year ago, we could say that there was no such country as Germany here. At that time, they were still a group of passive people who only wanted to satisfy the food and shelter desires of ordinary animals. Although their health was still good, there is no doubt that the war and defeat not only destroyed cities and factories, but also destroyed the tools and abilities for reconstruction and reconstruction. Today, there are neither reconstruction materials nor reconstruction manpower.

Although the superficial situation in Germany has not changed today, and the entire land is still divided into four parts, no one now, especially the personnel in the four military governments, dares to say that there is no Germany at present.

Agreement Among the Four Powers Is the Most Important

The voting situation in the four occupation zones in Germany, as well as the general trend of people's voting, reflect that the political trend of Germany and other countries with people's voting can be completely free, the same. The German people are the largest, most densely populated, and most harmonious in opinion on the continent of Europe. This makes Germany powerful and dangerous. Germany is now very weak, but still has terrible dangers. Germany is an inseparable part of Europe. If Germany adopts a federal system and gives up local decentralization, it will make Europe also tend to a federal organization. The forces tending towards unity have already become stronger among the people, while they are weaker among the governments. This is one of the solutions proposed by many leaders of the Western occupation zone. These leaders are temporary. The second election will be able to explain the real situation better than the first election, but before the traffic between the East and the West is established and foreign political control is relaxed, the real trend of the people will not be expressed. The direction of this trend, what kind of country Germany will be, which is reborn from destruction, will mainly be determined by the conditions of the four powers' agreement and the relationship between the four powers.

A German Christian Democratic leader in Berlin said: One of our hopes is that the German question will not separate the Soviet Union and the Western powers. But the future of the country will not be entirely determined by the conquerors. Even in the state of division, Germany itself will be a factor participating in the decision. Germany is not a four-sided problem but a five-sided struggle. Everyone is watching all the developments with excitement, because the next chapter of history has begun.

### Churchill's Motion: No Confidence in the Government; Internal Disagreement Within the Labour Party

[United Press, London, 8th] Prime Minister Attlee again encountered a "rebellion" by more than 100 Labour MPs today. These people demanded that the current military strength of more than one million people be reduced by half in order to increase the number of domestic workers. At the same time, Conservative Party leader Churchill demanded that the House of Commons vote no confidence in the Labour Party's socialist industrial revival plan, thereby overthrowing the Labour Party government. The rebellious Labour MPs had previously expressed dissatisfaction with Foreign Secretary Bevin's policies, and were not colluding with the impeachment case proposed by Churchill. Attlee has agreed to listen to their opinions at the Labour Party primary meeting next Monday. British Liberal Party MPs have always supported the current government's foreign policy. When economic policies are discussed next week, they will support the Conservative Party's impeachment case. The Liberal Party has a total of nine MPs in the House of Commons who have signed a motion severely criticizing the current government for failing to properly handle the industrial crisis.

### Council Passes 36th Annual Budget: Revenue of 240 Billion; Decision to Continue Collecting Municipal Construction Donations; Suggests the Municipal Government Live Within Its Means and Make Every Effort to Economize

[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal budget issue, which the Municipal Council has devoted great efforts to investigating and deliberating and which the Municipal Government urgently hopes to resolve, was finally passed in the 20th meeting of the general assembly yesterday with a part of the revenue. The general assembly also passed the continuation of the collection of municipal construction donations, which is estimated to collect more than 28.9 billion yuan this year, so the total revenue is 242,800,341.722 yuan. (Including the decision to collect more than 260 million yuan for health, education, and cultural expenses.)

As for the expenditure budget, the council requested the municipal government to re-compile and allocate the expenditure budget, taking into account the "living within its means" principle and without hindering the progress of constructive undertakings, in accordance with the city center plan, and submit it to the council's third general assembly for deliberation. At the same time, the 11 points that the budget and final accounts committee suggested the municipal government pay close attention to were also amended and passed by the general assembly. After discussing and resolving other proposals, the second general assembly was adjourned at 6:00 p.m. yesterday.

Before the council discussed the budget yesterday, Li Wenjie, the representative of the budget and final accounts committee, first reported on the review process. This report was extremely detailed and well-organized.

Eleven Suggestions to the Municipal Government

The committee also made 11 suggestions to the municipal government to improve the municipal government's administration, which are (1) The Finance Bureau should effectively supervise tax collectors to eliminate embezzlement and prevent tax evasion. (2) The affiliated institutions that should be merged and the personnel that can be laid off mentioned in the inspection reports of the various committees should be paid close attention to. (3) Personnel expenditures are too large, so personnel in the general affairs, personnel statistics, and other departments of various units should be effectively reduced. (4) The number of workers in various units should be reduced. The ratio of one worker for every four employees must be maintained. (5) Abolish or merge branch institutions. (6) If the 7.2 billion yuan for in-service training of primary and secondary school teachers is included in the budget, the amount spent on education and culture should maintain a total of 20% of the expenditures. (7) If social members are willing to privately fund the construction of roads and rename them in memory of them, and voluntarily fund the construction of roads, etc., they can be adopted. (8) The Civil Affairs Office is in charge of the conscription expenses and should send a special letter to the central government for compensation. (9) If the school buildings of newly added schools under the Education Bureau have not yet been found, this amount should be transferred to the construction funds of established schools first. (10) Stop any unnecessary or temporarily delayed expenditures. For example, there are only 8,000 privately owned cars in the city, while the city government and various bureaus have a total of 599 cars, so they should be specially and effectively reduced to save on repair and grease expenses. (11) The revenue that should have been collected but has not been collected in the past year should be listed as the use of this year.

The budget plan, which 4 million citizens of the city care about, has come to an end. In addition, in order to build a great Shanghai, the general assembly has another resolution, explaining the reasons, intending to request assistance from the central government, and proposing three methods: (1) Request the central government to allocate special funds, (2) Request the central government to allocate assistance from the proceeds of the disposal of enemy and puppet industries in the city, (3) Request the central government to approve the retention of the funds that the city should pay to the central government under the land price tax, field tax, land value-added tax, and business tax to be used for assistance.

### Municipal Construction Donation Collection Issue: Only One Person Expressed Opposition

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the issue of municipal construction donations, the majority of the general assembly yesterday passed the continuation of the collection. The total annual budget is 28,916,000,000.00 yuan. About a dozen councilors spoke on this case. Except for Zhang Zhongyuan, who opposed the collection and proposed to change it to a road construction donation, the rest all agreed to the collection. However, everyone expressed slightly different opinions.

### Refund Academic Training Fees; Organize Municipal Fire Protection Committee; A Batch of Proposals Resolved in the Twelfth Meeting

[Reported by this newspaper] In addition to passing the municipal budget revenue and municipal construction donations yesterday, the general assembly also resolved many other proposals: (1) The case proposed by Wang Jian'e that "the use license tax for privately owned cars and freight cars should be levied according to the amount collected before the war" was approved in principle by the Finance Committee and submitted to the general assembly for discussion on the multiple to be added. As a result of the debate, it was still submitted to the Finance Committee for review. (2) Proposed by Xi Yushu et al., telegraphing the Executive Yuan to approve the allocation of two generators from Japanese compensation, totaling 100,000 kilowatts of electricity, for the use of this city. And proposed that the municipal government approve the establishment of a Shanghai United Electricity Company by the various power plants in the city, which was passed. (3) The 7.2 billion yuan for the academic training fees of primary and secondary school teachers in the city should be included in the municipal government's expenditure budget for this year, and those who have already collected it from students should be refunded. (4) It is proposed that representatives from the municipal government, municipal party department, municipal council, police bureau, fire department, privately-run fire brigade, local associations, agricultural, industrial, and commercial associations, education association, and insurance industry association be organized to form the municipal fire protection committee. (5) Request the financial partner to quickly amend the gold jewelry handling method. (6) Suggest that the competent authority concentrate conscripted young men in the city for training at a suitable location in the city. (7) Request the central government to retain the right of provincial, county, and city councils to request the central government's agencies stationed in the provinces, cities, and counties to attend meetings and report and question them during council meetings. (8) Request the municipal government to strictly ban and punish the principals of private primary and secondary schools in the city who do not comply with the regulations of the authorities and arbitrarily set up various names and raise the amount of fees. (9) Request that the site of the enemy loyalty tower on Jiangwan Road be rebuilt into Yingshi Park. (10) Send a telegram to all councils across the country to express opposition to international intervention in order to safeguard sovereignty. (11) Suggest that the central government rescue the industrial crisis and submit a concise method. (12) Each district office shall be responsible for the education in its jurisdiction. (13) The government should quickly send back Japanese people retained by various industrial group organs. Technical personnel who must be used should also be strictly managed. (14) The construction of roads and other buildings in each district shall be determined by the district itself, and the labor will be determined by the district itself. The Engineering Department will design and guide it to reduce the city government's expenditure. (15) Suggest that the central government and the municipal government sort out various old debts and determine a reasonable repayment method. The legal proposal will be submitted to the Finance Committee to formulate detailed methods for discussion at the next general assembly.

The three cases submitted by the speaker were resolved after deliberation: (1) The Nanjing Municipal Council suggested that the councils of all provinces and cities send representatives to hold a temporary joint meeting, which will be discussed at the next general assembly. (2) Approved the suggestion of the Shanghai Cultural and Sports Committee to rebuild the former Japanese shrine into a martyr. (3) The municipal government forwarded to the central government that the first batch of materials for Japanese compensation will be transported to China, and requested that the losses of private schools be included in the priority list.

### Huang Hanliang Failed to Appear After Summons; The District Prosecutor's Office Issued an Arrest Warrant; He Qishen and Others Returned to Beijing to Report on the Investigation

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of illegal gold and banknote transactions by Huang Hanliang, a person in charge of the China Xingye Bank, was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the Garrison Command. The handling prosecutor has issued summons several times, but Huang has not appeared. Therefore, an arrest warrant has been issued a few days ago. It is reported that Huang has already left Shanghai to avoid it. If the District Prosecutor's Office cannot arrest him in the short term, it will consider issuing an arrest warrant.

Gao Fang, Deputy Director of the Audit Office of the Central Bank, and He Qishen, a Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to come to Shanghai to inspect the accounts of various banks and villages. They have been here for three weeks. A total of 44 banks and villages have been sampled. It was found that there were some questions about some of the accounts. Now the two have gathered all the documents and rolls they have sampled and will take the night express to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Finance. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai in three days.

### If the Index Is Not Restored, Society Will Lose Stability; Ten Councilors Jointly Proposed to Unfreeze; Heated Debate After Submitting to the Social Committee for Review

[Reported by this newspaper] A heated debate was sparked at the Council General Assembly yesterday over the discussion of unfreezing the cost-of-living index. The case was proposed by Councilor Shui Xiangyun and jointly signed by Zhou Xuexiang, Lu Yin Chu and ten others, proposing to forward it to the central government to restore the cost-of-living index for workers from April of this year. The reason is that the already rising prices have made workers unable to bear the burden, and the accumulated raw materials and finished products of the capitalists have become inversely proportional. If prices continue to rise and the cost-of-living index is frozen from January, it is unreasonable in many ways. Although there are subsidies for the price difference of six kinds of daily necessities, the procedures are cumbersome and the distribution is unfair. Not only do workers have a strong reaction, but even factories such as the Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Association also express opposition. If this continues, if the cost-of-living index is not restored, there will be many disputes, which will not only affect production, but also cause social instability. Shui Xiangyun also added that the compilation of the cost-of-living index includes 54 items, but the current price difference is only calculated according to six items. The workers have not received the price difference subsidy for the other 48 items. On February 2, all those who calculated the cost-of-living index received a subsidy of 73,000 yuan, and there was no difference for those with high technical skills. This cannot encourage work efficiency, and outstanding workers have lazy work. Although this decree was promulgated by the central government, if it does not work, the Council has the need to suggest that the central government make revisions.

### Vigorously Calling for the Protection of Lease Rights; Demolishing Houses and Evicting Tenants in the Central District; What Do Councilors Mean?

[Reported by this newspaper] Houses at No. 1230, No. 1232, No. 1234, and No. 1230 Lane A, Zhengdong East Road, were demolished by the landlord yesterday, forcing tenants to move out, which caused disputes.

The above four houses include 18 households. When the landlord Qiaoyuan Tai Woodworking Shop sent more than 40 workers with legal currency to implement it at 10 a.m. yesterday, the 18 households were forced to move their furniture to the sidewalk by the roadside. At the same time, the workers also broke through the roof, forcing the tenants to have no choice but to re-enter. After the tenants' representatives petitioned the District Court, the execution was stopped at 3:00 p.m., but the doors and windows were all removed, leaving only a frame.

When reporters went to inspect late at night, many tenants were still living on the streets. The broken furniture was still piled up messily on the street. According to the tenants, when the house was demolished, Dong Ruiren, a woman in confinement in No. 1234, was injured in the head by falling bricks and tiles from the roof. They also said: "We will definitely go to the Council to petition." It was found that the Council was enthusiastically discussing the issue of protecting tenants' lease rights the day before the second general assembly, but this unfortunate event was publicly performed on Zhengdong East Road, which is not a remote area, and was filmed by American reporters, which is regrettable.

### If Chickens Are Finished, Where Do Eggs Come From? The Deputy Speaker Said So

Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, upon hearing the statement, expressed his opinion, saying that the government, facing imminent economic collapse, is using emergency measures to rescue the situation, attempting to suppress prices through political power. Although the compilation of the cost of living index includes fifty-six items, many of them are not essential. After this freeze, subsidies will be provided for the price differences of six daily necessities: rice, oil, sugar, coal balls, and cotton cloth. The set prices are generally sufficient to purchase the goods. If prices rise again next month, the difference will still be subsidized. The government has come up with these emergency measures in a state of panic, and it is hoped that all sectors will support them. Otherwise, if the chicken is finished, there will absolutely be no more eggs produced. He hoped that the assembly would seriously discuss this proposal without favoring any one side.

Xu Jiqing Speaks Out Loud (Photograph by This Newspaper)

Who Caused High Prices?

Labor Senator Zhang Zhusan stood up and said: Is the responsibility for fueling high prices caused by workers' wages or by merchants? Now, freezing the cost of living index, which deviates from actual needs, can society be stabilized? Furthermore, the fundamental issue is whether the cost of living index affects prices, or whether prices affect the cost of living index, which should be clearly determined. Zhou Xuexiang said: After this index freeze, the subsidy method for workers, regardless of whether they are skilled or ordinary workers, is the same, which he believes is not very fair.

Zhou Xuexiang's Expression While Speaking (Photograph by This Newspaper)

Social Stability Depends on Cooperation

Fei Shusheng said: Emergency measures are to cope with extraordinary times, which is still a good method in the absence of other options. The government treats officials, farmers, workers, and merchants equally, without discrimination. We should look at how workers' wages compare with those before the war. And look at the current treatment of public school teachers? Social stability depends on cooperation from all levels. If only workers' lives are resolved, while the lives of public school teachers, soldiers, and police are not, then society still cannot be stable. Now, we only need to seek the accuracy and reasonableness of the differential subsidies, and seek the convenience of the procedures.

Tao Baichuan Proposes Freezing the Unfreezing Proposal

Tao Baichuan then spoke, saying: This is a major issue, and both sides have reasons. I suggest not putting it to a vote, but "freezing" this proposal to unfreeze the cost of living index and postponing it to the next general meeting for discussion. Because the plan issued by the government is a whole, freezing the cost of living index is only one part of it. Overthrowing it now is like deflating a large ball, and the entire plan will be destroyed. If the plan cannot save the economic crisis, it will fail in two or three months. We cannot ignore the suffering of workers' lives, then "when impoverished, one must change; change leads to success," and there will be a reasonable solution. Li Hua then loudly cried out: The price of labor in exchange for wages is a due right, so he demanded the unfreezing. Lu Yinchu said: When the government's emergency order comes down, workers should grit their teeth and endure, but it is necessary to pay attention to one point: can prices be suppressed? This loophole should be suggested to the central government for correction and remedy. Yuan Zhaoxin also advocated unfreezing.

### Second Congress Closes, Speaker and Mayor Give Speeches, Hoping to Live Within Means, The Future Still Faces Three Difficulties

The second congress held a closing ceremony. After performing the formalities, Chairman Pan, the speaker, delivered a closing speech, briefly stating: The most important issue on the agenda of the second congress was the city budget. For the sake of prudence and comprehensive consideration, the congress was extended for two months to investigate and inspect the situation of various bureaus and units of the municipal government, and was reviewed by the budget and final accounts committee to obtain a reasonable decision. In this period of soaring prices, it is difficult to ensure that everything will remain unchanged throughout the year, and the key lies entirely in prices. Therefore, we can only decide on revenue based on the extent to which citizens can afford it. The congress decided on a revenue of over two thousand four hundred billion, and I believe that the mayor and the bureau directors who participated in the meeting can all appreciate the painstaking efforts of the senators. When re-compiling the expenditure budget, within the principle of living within our means and without affecting necessary expenditures, please refer to our opinions.

At the same time, Speaker Pan expressed his apologies to all citizens of the city, saying that he feared he could not fully reflect or represent their opinions, but believed that the discussion of the proposals was for the sake of building Shanghai, rather than solely for the sake of one person, one district, or one profession. Finally, he hoped that the municipal government would, to the greatest extent possible, live within its means within the scope of the budget for this year, so that citizens would not complain about the huge budget passed by the congress.

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the municipal government to the city council for its hard work in solving difficulties for the municipal government, but said that, observing the future, there were still three difficulties: (1) Although revenue has been decided, expenditure also requires great effort. However, we are determined to follow the opinions of the council. (2) If prices can be stabilized, not only can the budget be resolved, but also the livelihood of the people can be resolved. We hope that the council can assist the municipal government in finding ways to suppress prices. (3) Only after the entire Shanghai is stable can we talk about other things. At this time of national instability, this work must be borne jointly by the senators and every citizen. Senator Feng Youzhen delivered a reply on behalf of the senators, also saying that it was very difficult for his colleagues to discuss the budget, and he hoped that the municipal government could ensure that the taxes paid by the citizens' blood and sweat would be used for public purposes. After the speech, the congress adjourned at half past six.

### The Original Proposer Clarifies His Identity

The original proposer, Shui Xiangyun, then made a supplement, declaring that he was not proposing this proposal in the capacity of a worker representative, but was speaking from the position of a senator. Reading today's Shen Bao, he learned that the Ministry of Social Affairs is drafting measures for evaluating wages, so he hoped to reflect the workers' demands to the central government and make remedies when drafting the measures for evaluating wages. Speaker Pan also expressed his opinion, believing that the plan issued by the government is a whole, and it is not good to rashly overturn it now. For the sake of prudence, the case was handed over to the Social Affairs Committee for review. After a majority vote, the debate ended.

### Daily Power Shortage Totals 60,000 Kilowatts

[Report from this newspaper] As the City Council is discussing the city's power shortage problem, the American-owned Shanghai Power Company has made an accurate assessment of the current situation. It believes that the current power shortage in the city is 60,000 kilowatts per day. If the 60,000 kilowatts of power were used for industry, it could employ 90,000 unemployed workers. If the income were based on the January index of this year, the total monthly wages would reach 39 million national currency. At the same time, the labor of 90,000 workers could produce cotton cloth or other consumer goods worth 211 million yuan per month, which is equivalent to 17.6 million US dollars in terms of gold. It is worthy of the deep attention of citizens that the power shortage is not a temporary situation, and may extend to more than three years. If there is no appropriate replacement for the generators, then the power shortage may even become more severe. According to the most conservative estimate, if there is no replacement by 1951, the power shortage will reach 190,000 kilowatts, exceeding the total power generation of Shanghai today.

The city's power recovery plan is roughly as follows: By July of this year, the power can be increased by 33,000 kilowatts; by the end of this year, another 16,000 kilowatts can be added; next year, 42,000 kilowatts can be added, for a total of 82,000 kilowatts. However, for the sake of protecting the machines, it is imperative to adopt a rest system, which will reduce the power generation by at least 25,000 kilowatts. Therefore, the 60,000-kilowatt power shortage cannot be completely made up.

As the world is experiencing power shortages, even if we start ordering from foreign countries today, it will be difficult to officially receive them before 1951. Therefore, to cope with this emergency situation, it is necessary to adopt a power plant consortium system to eliminate unnecessary waste and expenses. The Shanghai Power Company has repeatedly negotiated with the Zhabei, Pudong, and Nanshi power plants, and all have agreed to this approach.

### "Foreign Tiger" Escorted to Court, Very Calm Attitude, Arrived at Court After Dark, Detained After Interrogation, Ledgers and Other Documents Transferred in a Sack

[Report from this newspaper] Maysber, general manager of the "Foreign Tiger" Ebbes Company, was transferred to the District Court by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters at 6:01 p.m. yesterday, along with all the case files and documents. After the District Court's Chief Clerk Huang Xianyu reviewed the files, he transferred them to the District Attorney's Office at 7:30 p.m. District Attorney Quan Tao, on duty, and interpreter Xu Shaoyong opened the court for interrogation, and after interrogation at 8:40 p.m., ordered him to be detained.

Transferred to the District Attorney's Office with Maysber was a list of stolen goods from Ebbes Company, which included: US$345,311, HK$23,050, Philippine pesos 3,300, 28 large bars of gold, US dollar bills (from the cashier's office) US$2,110, a US Treasury Department payment order, a 60,000 national currency check from Chase Bank, a checkbook from the Netherlands Bank, two notebooks (illegal gold and dollar sales were recorded in the notebooks), an entry and exit exchange book, detailed remittance accounts, a general ledger, remittance stubs, transaction slips, check or remittance application forms, remittance letters, and daily balance sheets of bank deposits and inventory, totaling 23 items, packed in a sack. There was also an accounting statistics sheet from the Garrison Headquarters, and four written records of confessions, including two from Maysber, one from Bartya, and one from Pabotista.

Although it was already 7:30 p.m. when Maysber arrived at the District Attorney's Office, the receiving room had heard the news early and specially kept staff members Tang Yizhi and others waiting. After the Garrison Headquarters' car arrived, Mei calmly got out of the car, carrying a large bundle wrapped in a blanket and a travel bag containing books, bread, shoes, towels, and other miscellaneous items. He told reporters that he had come to Shanghai to do business before the war and returned to Shanghai last August after being in the United States when the Pacific War broke out. As for still engaging in gold and dollar trading after the government announced the economic emergency measures, he did not know that it was illegal, but said that his legal counsel, lawyer Sellctt, could explain on his behalf.

Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters Announces Detailed Investigation Process

[Report from this newspaper] The Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters yesterday specially announced the details of the detection and investigation of the case as follows: On the first of this month, the Inspection Office received a reliable confidential report stating that there was an Ebbes Company in Room 118 of the Xinfeng Company in Sassoon House on Nanjing Road, hosted by a Dutchman named Maysber, specializing in the secret operation of gold, dollar, and foreign currency transactions. The amount of daily transactions was quite large, and all black market prices were controlled by the company. When the gold and dollar prices soared in early February, the company had planned to collect more than 2 million US dollars in advance to engage in speculative manipulation. In addition, it also engaged in black market foreign exchange, selling it on the black market to facilitate smuggling importers, and colluding with exporters to collect foreign exchange earned from exports and then sell it at a higher price. It is estimated that this figure accounts for more than two-fifths of the city's black market foreign exchange. After the economic emergency measures were announced, the company continued to operate. All of the above points have evidence and books to check, and it is requested that they be investigated and banned.

After receiving the report, the Inspection Office immediately dispatched cadres with the specific status of the Economic Supervision Group executing the economic emergency measures, and went to the company for a search with legal procedures. On the spot, they seized 13 copies of the company's black market cash transaction receipts, black market foreign exchange ledgers, etc., and on the same day (March 3), they bought US dollars for 14,300 yuan and sold 2,110 US dollars in cash for 14,700 yuan, as well as US dollar foreign exchange bills for 6,000 yuan. The evidence was conclusive and Maysber was proven to be a current offender. At the same time, Xu Renji, auditor from the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank, and Ren Gai, auditor from the Audit Office, were invited to the scene to conduct a joint study, which concluded that there was no doubt that a crime had been committed. Subsequently, stolen money was seized, including US$345,311, HK$23,050, Philippine pesos 3,300, and 380 taels of gold. Upon interrogation on the spot, Maysber and other accounting personnel admitted to illegally engaging in black market foreign currency and foreign exchange transactions. Maysber also told the investigators on the spot, "I have indeed committed a crime and dare not operate any further, but please leave some funds to disband the staff in order to handle the termination."

Since the crime had already been proven, the Inspection Office formally arrested the principal offender, Maysber, and took the main accounting personnel, the Portuguese Pabotista and Bartya, as well as the Chinese cashiers Shi Jiusen and Shao Shunqin, to the department for interrogation. The stolen goods (US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, gold bars, etc.) were divided into two iron boxes and sealed by the main offender himself before being handed over to the Central Bank for safekeeping. Other ledgers, etc., were taken to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. That night, in addition to interrogating the Chinese cashiers Shi Jiusen and Shao Shunqin, and the Portuguese Bartya, and obtaining their confessions and releasing them on bail, the principal offenders Maysber and Pabotista admitted to the crime after a retrial and were detained. The company's transaction documents were examined by accountant Xie Chunpu, and after two days of calculation, it was confirmed that the company had bought a total of US$788,800 in cash foreign exchange, £193,348 in British pounds, HK$1,511,000 in Hong Kong dollars, and 4,195 Portuguese patacas during the gold rush period from February 1st to February 17th, and sold US$507,650 in US dollars, £380,633 in British pounds, HK$1,335,000 in Hong Kong dollars, and 21,500 Portuguese patacas. After the economic emergency measures were announced, the company continued to buy and sell US$310,827 in US dollars, £164,350 in British pounds, HK$90,000 in Hong Kong dollars, and A$1,000 in Australian dollars, and sell US$73,150 in US dollars, £103,023 in British pounds, HK$215,581 in Hong Kong dollars, 62,000 Portuguese patacas, and A$1,000 in Australian dollars. The total of purchases and sales since February 1st

The total number is already alarming

Those before February 1st have not yet been calculated. Adding this huge inflow and outflow, and arbitrarily exceeding the foreign currency exchange rate stipulated by the Central Bank after the promulgation of the law, operating on the black market, it is sufficient to prove that the company has disregarded the law, deliberately manipulated the black market, and disrupted the financial system. This is a special criminal case involving foreign nationals undermining our country's financial laws. In addition to Pabotista, whose preliminary examination of the books has come to an end, was granted bail first, the principal offender Maysber was transferred to the court for punishment in accordance with Article 7 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency Notes within the Economic Emergency Measures Plan. According to the provisions of Article 7, "Those who violate this will be regarded as speculation and manipulation to disrupt the financial system. In addition to confiscating their banknotes and revoking their business licenses, the manager will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years."

### Reporting Illegal Traffic Police: Accepting Bribes and Releasing Thieves

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xia Rongguang, a patrol officer of the Shanghai-Nanjing section of the Railway Administration Police Department, received a letter from a "pickpocket gang" last year, along with 50,000 yuan in legal tender. After receiving the letter, Xia discussed the matter with police officer Zhang Shuchun and others, and they divided and spent the 50,000 yuan among themselves, tacitly agreeing with the thieves. Subsequently, they deliberately indulged the thieves' activities, pretending not to hear about them, with numerous instances of dereliction of duty. Recently, someone reported this to the Police Department, which sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. Except for Xia Rongguang, who is on the run, the suspected criminals Zhang Shuchun, Lu Jun, Li Songxian, Zhou Mingzhang, Duan Yuanxu, Xie Shuzhi, Wang Hengchang, Chen Xuefu, Wu Yunsheng, Wu Meichu, Mao Ying, Fang Jianzhang, and Zhang Xiaoxian, a total of thirteen people, were arrested and transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation yesterday.

### Dr. Hu Shi Arrives in Shanghai to Preside Over the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College and Will Go to Beijing to Attend the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture

Dr. Hu Shi, President of National Peking University, arrived in Shanghai by US military plane the other day to preside over the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College and to attend the Board of Directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. Yesterday, he invited the Shanghai-based directors of Peking Union Medical College to the International Hotel for a preparatory meeting. Mr. Hu told reporters yesterday that the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College was originally scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 12th of this month, but because most of the directors are in Shanghai, the meeting was changed to Shanghai. At that time, directors in Beijing, such as Weng Wenhao and Zhou Yichun, will also come to Shanghai to attend. Directors already in Shanghai include Liu Ruiheng, Li Ming, Chen Zhiqian, and American directors Wilson, Earle Ballou, Dean of the Science College of Yenching University, and A. M. Dumlop, professor at St. John's University. The matters to be discussed by the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College this time will be how to prepare for the start of the school year this autumn and the election of the president and vice president. In terms of funding, the Rockefeller Foundation of the United States originally allocated US$12 million to Peking Union Medical College, which is used with interest calculated at 3%, yielding US$660,000 per year. The school buildings were occupied by the Japanese army as a hospital during the war and were used by the Military Mediation Department after the victory. Now, representatives of the government, the Communist Party, and the United States have all moved out, and everything can be cleared within a month. Preparations will be made for receiving and repairing the buildings so that the school can open in the autumn. The damage to the buildings during the war was not significant. The Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College held a meeting in New York last March. This will be the first meeting held in the country after the victory. Mr. Hu is the chairman of the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College. After the Board of Directors meeting in Shanghai on the 12th, he will take a train to Beijing to attend the Board of Directors meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, which will be held on the 14th. When reporters asked if he would become the Minister of Education as rumored, he said: "I am here purely for the revival of Peking Union Medical College and the meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. I am non-partisan and non-factional. The rumors about me becoming the Minister of Education are purely hearsay. Please do not believe them." Subsequently, reporters inquired about the household registration inspection and the investigation of private homes in Beiping. Mr. Hu said: "This matter is over. Students from Peking University and Tsinghua University went on strike for two days and then took supplementary exams to complete the process. All related school staff and students have been released, and everything is no longer a problem. The atmosphere is not tense now."

### Border Region Teachers Training Program to Be Established in July This Year

### The Number of Quotas for the Translators Studying Abroad Examination Is Not Accurate; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Education Issues Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Ministry of Education is holding a public-funded study abroad examination for translators, and registration has now begun, with a scheduled examination date. The number of quotas was approved by the Executive Yuan upon submission by the former Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission for 100 positions. Currently, there are widespread rumors that 60 of these 100 positions have already been internally designated for translators who are currently continuing their service in the United States, and another 20 positions have also been internally designated by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, in reality, there are only 20 quota positions. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Education recently issued the following statement: All translators who have served as translators in the Foreign Affairs Bureau and have obtained certificates without major faults can participate in this public-funded study abroad examination for translators. It is estimated that there are as many as 3,600 translators with this qualification. On average, one person out of every thirty-six will be selected. The Ministry of Education has decided to use the examination results as the sole criterion for selection. However, because 100 of these 3,600 people are still continuing their service in the United States and it is inconvenient for them to return to the country to participate in the examination, for fairness, 97 people will be selected in this examination, and the remaining three positions will still be reserved. Translators in the United States can apply to the Ministry of Education according to the prescribed procedures, and the Ministry will use their service performance as the selection criterion. The rumor that there are internally designated quotas is likely due to a misunderstanding.

### Free Tuition for Poor Students in Beijing

The Municipal Gezhi Middle School is celebrating its 30th anniversary. In order to celebrate, the alumni of the school have scheduled a meeting of the Alumni Association at the school on Guangxi Road at 2:00 pm this afternoon to prepare for the celebration.

Letter of Correction: "Having read yesterday's issue of your newspaper, which carried a news item about schools overcharging tuition fees, our school was also listed, which was quite surprising. After investigation, the tuition fees collected by our school are in full compliance with the standards set by the Municipal Council and have been filed with the Bureau of Education. The part about our school published in your newspaper is obviously based on hearsay and is in error. We request that you grant a correction." Sincerely, Mingde Women's Primary and Secondary School (March 8th)

### Today's First Division Football Match: Donghua Meets the Soviet Union Again; From 3:00 pm at the Yiyuan Stadium; Mayor's Cup Shanyun vs. Jewish in the Morning

There are a total of three football matches today. The main battle is the second round of the First Division, where Donghua will meet the Soviet Union again, competing at the Yiyuan Stadium at 3:00 pm. After Donghua defeated the Soviet Union 4-2 in the first round, they have won every game, creating a great record of eight wins in eight games. The First Division championship is already within reach. The outcome is irrelevant, but in order to maintain a perfect record, they will continue their efforts. Today's lineup was announced yesterday by Jia Youliang and is the same as the battle against Youyou last week, with careful deployment. On the Soviet side, the lineup is also largely the same as last week. The Soviet Union has been practicing hard for days to avenge their previous defeat and there will be a bloody battle at that time.

In addition to Donghua meeting the Soviet Union again today, there are also two games, the Mayor's Cup and the Third Division final, competing at Yiyuan and Jinyuan Public Park, respectively. Tickets for Yiyuan are 3,000 for the grandstand and 5,000 for the central seat, and will be sold at the gymnasium from 1:00 pm. In the Mayor's Cup, Jewish will face Shanyun at 9:30 am at Yiyuan. Jewish had a bye in the first week, and Shanyun was poisoned by Longjie in the first battle. However, Longjie had an unregistered player on the field, and the Football Committee ruled that Shanyun won 1-0, thus advancing. Today, they will meet Jewish, and it may be difficult to preserve their victory. In the Third Division final, the Customs will face Jingwu at 10:00 am at Jinyuan Park, which is a total elimination match for the group. Today's schedule is as follows:

Donghua - Soviet Union First Division 3:00 pm Yiyuan Referee Chen Jixiang, Linesmen Yue Xiurong and He Chunhui

### Football Committee Explains Resolutions

The Football Committee has made some supplements to the resolutions of the 21st Standing Committee meeting that were published the other day and has explained Article 22 of the League Regulations. Recorded below:

(Resolution) During the Qingbai vs. Railway Mayor's Cup match on March 1, many railway uniformed employees rushed into the field across the fence because they were dissatisfied with the referee's decision, shouting, scolding, and hitting, disturbing the order of the field. This is a betrayal of the spirit of sports and a letter should be sent to the Railway Administration to be responsible for stopping it in the future in order to maintain the progress of the game. Otherwise, the team's game schedule will not be arranged temporarily.

(Explanation) Article 22 of the League Regulations: "Players registered in a certain group can attend the games of their team's senior group, but after the player has participated in the senior game twice, they are only allowed to represent the senior team in the game during the same season and are not allowed to return." Originally a specific regulation to restrict the promotion and demotion of players in the league (for the same club with two or more teams participating in the game), the cup game uses an elimination system, and the number of games decided by each team is uncertain. Clubs with A and B teams have no linked relationship. Moreover, the Mayor's Cup and the Junior Cup can be held separately, and members of Groups B and C can participate in the Mayor's Cup game. Therefore, in the minutes of the 21st decision meeting of the Football Committee, "Article 22 of the League Regulations does not apply to the Cup" is purely an explanation of the nature to the outside world and has no meaning to change the regulations.

Railway Sports Association Letter Reply to the Football Committee

The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Employees Sports Association replied to the Football Committee on March 7, stating: "We have always strived to maintain and abide by the spirit of sports, sportsmanship, and regulations. On that day, the players of our team did not express any objection to the penalty of 12 yards. The spectators on the field expressed their opinions from the standpoint of objective fairness. The referee may have been negligent and revealed it in words, but it is not something that our team can advise on. Moreover, on that day, employees of the Railway Bureau accounted for only one-tenth of the number of spectators, and there were no unsatisfactory words or deeds. Therefore, we are not able to admit the various sections in your letter. Regarding the issue of order at the venue, our team participates in the game, and based on sportsmanship, we cooperate to maintain it. However, the responsibility for maintaining order at the venue still lies with your association, and our association is not convenient to act on its behalf. As for the arrangement of the game schedule, the right lies with your association, and our association does not dare to advise."

### U.S. Troops Adamant About Not Conceding Defeat: Chinese Alliance to Battle Columbus Again; Clash at Gymnasium Tonight at 7 PM

The U.S. Navy's Columbus basketball team engaged in a friendly match with Shanghai's Chinese champions, the Chinese Alliance team, the night before last.

With the Chinese Alliance's agreement, a second clash is scheduled for 7 PM this evening at the same venue. Referees will be Qu Honglu and Liu Hesheng, and ticket prices remain unchanged.

The Chinese Alliance fully demonstrated its fighting spirit the night before last. Great Li commanded the three armies, with the five tigers coordinating their actions. The entire team displayed seamless teamwork. Although the Columbus team is just one team from a warship, its strength is formidable. Among the foreign troops in Shanghai, it can be considered a behemoth. Coupled with their height, long arms, and clear minds, they are indeed a formidable opponent for the Chinese Alliance. In today's encounter, the foreign troops aim to avenge their previous defeat and are expected to deliver an even more spectacular performance. Chinese Alliance captain Kong Guangyi followed the Green Team to Beijing yesterday, but Ren Xiangcheng is available to take his place, so there should be no impact. The lineup for today's battle is recorded below:

[Chinese Alliance Team] Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songtong, Chen Xuechong, Ren Xiangcheng, Zhuo Guorong, Zhang Liangxiong.

[Columbus] Bosak, Grafford, Ash, Poeppel, Raies, Qu Linghuotuo, Ke Luoning, Oberon, Burke, Wass, Rumm, Blun, Joe Qu'er, Rasi, Kloss.

### Outlets for Floating Capital Increasingly Narrow; Securities Market Gains Momentum; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks See Enthusiastic Inquiries

Chinese stocks rose yesterday after a period of mostly stable trading. While sentiment was good, bank selling at higher prices slightly curbed the gains, and previously popular stocks also saw their trading range narrow. The market opened strong this morning due to news that listed stocks could be used as reserves for savings deposits, resulting in unusually robust sentiment. Delivery orders appeared, with numbers 85, 207, 117, 203, 199, 218, 152, 2, 14, 32, and 178 being sold off from 3,000 yuan down to 2,850 yuan. Numbers 198, 97, 22, and 185 were bought low.

Numbers 198, 223, 160, and 152 maintained their positions by buying low and recovered to 2,980 yuan. Numbers 65 and 2231 were still selling, seeing 2,930 yuan. After struggling, numbers 32 and 14 both bought, and number 137 bought current delivery orders, closing at around 2,970 yuan at noon. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xian Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Qinxing, Huafeng, and Xinguang each rose by about half a percent. Meiya and Zhongfa rose by 10%, Jingfu rose slightly, and Xinhua was limit-up. In delivery trading, Xian Yong Yarn, Xinhe, and Huafeng rose by half a percent, Meiya rose by 10%, Xinguang and Jingfu rose slightly, and the cold stocks of Shangwu, Zhongsi, Bingyi, and Guohuo all reached limit-up. Xinya alone fell by half a percent, while the rest rose by about half a percent. In over-the-counter trading, Dasheng and Shijie were flat, while the rest saw slight gains.

Foreign Stocks

Yesterday, securities firms came to absorb stocks, pushing up prices. However, rubber stock prices did not change much. Guangbang sold off some holdings, and prices stabilized slightly after rising. Yisha opened at 19,300 yuan in the morning, reaching a high of 20,300 yuan, and then hovered around 19,700 yuan.

### Man-Made Silk Quotations Weakening

The 24th term of artificial silk for the silk weaving industry continues to be allocated. The quota for large factories is 600 cases, hence the weakness in the black market price yesterday. The opening quotation for Takayama Yu-Mitsuru No. 120 was 7.15 million yuan, and the closing price at noon was 7.05 million yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day, but there was still a lack of transactions. Factory owners had no intention of buying due to sluggish sales of silk fabrics, and foreign firms had no interest either due to the lack of telegraphic replies. The market situation was exceptionally quiet. Yesterday, users sold D-grade man-made silk at a quoted price of 7.6 million yuan, while ordinary others still quoted around 7.3 million yuan. The silk market was even more deserted, with quilt covers hardly attracting any attention. Dachen Gewang crepe was quoted at 17,000 yuan, but there was still a lack of buyers even at 6,600 yuan. Transactions of man-made silk goods such as Huajin crepe were also scarce. Only printed materials were relatively popular as they were required to fulfill sales orders.

[Our Correspondent] Economic Affairs Vice Minister Pan Xulun arrived in Shanghai from the capital yesterday morning. In the afternoon at 3 PM, he summoned Li Shengbo, Deputy Director of the Cotton Management Committee, Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Office, Wang Zijian, Director of the Secretariat, Feng Mo, a specialist, and Jiang Dixian, Deputy Director of the Business Office of the Textile Construction Corporation, to discuss the current cotton yarn situation. The exchange of views was quite detailed. It is said that the focus of yesterday's discussions was on (1) the foreign exchange required for purchasing foreign cotton, (2) the purchase price of cotton yarn, and (3) the allocation of cotton yarn. After listening to the views of various individuals, Mr. Pan will make recommendations to the central authorities to serve as a reference when deciding on policy.

### Improved Absorption Capacity, Limited Cotton Yarn Trading

After opening, the cotton yarn market stabilized. Subsequently, the market became firm in stability due to relatively smooth sales to actual user factories. However, there was considerable interest in 42-count yarn, but the supply was very scarce, making it difficult to open trading. 20-count, 16-count, and 42-count yarns were initially popular but then became stable, and the final results were similar to the previous day.

### Cotton Cloth Sentiment Stable

The cotton cloth market saw the Textile Construction Corporation selling 20-count fine cloth as usual yesterday, priced at 135,000 yuan, which was 7,000 yuan lower than the last quoted price. As a result, sentiment in the market was stable. Trading of 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened as low as 156,500 yuan at one point, and some dyeing and weaving mills absorbed some, but the final price was still 158,000 yuan, similar to the previous day. Wufu was 154,000 yuan, Caiqiu was 152,000 yuan, Lanji was 150,000 yuan, and Zharuan was 120,000 yuan. Market conditions for other colored cloths and Shilin serge were also stable.

### Salt Administration Bureau States Three Reasons for Exporting Salt to Japan

Regarding the export of Chinese salt to Japan, the industrial sector has criticized the government on the grounds of maintaining China's chemical industry. According to the Salt Administration Bureau, the reasons for exporting salt to Japan are threefold: (1) to find an outlet for surplus salt domestically, alleviating the livelihood difficulties of salt farmers, (2) to exchange for materials needed domestically, and (3) to prevent salt farmers from smuggling, thereby hindering tax revenue. As for China's chemical industry, it is unable to consume this huge amount of salt in the short term. Therefore, the government has no choice but to export an appropriate amount. If Japan does not obtain salt from China, it can also obtain comparable amounts of salt from other sources such as the Red Sea and Burma. However, this year's salt production is less than expected, and adjustments will be made at any time, with the principle of exporting only surpluses. 300,000 dan of salt from the Taiwan salt region will also be shipped to Japan successively. 60,000 dan from Fuzhou were loaded onto ships for export last week.

### Various Industries Draft Nine Measures, Requesting the Formation of a Raw Material Import Review Committee to Uniformly Review the Raw Material Needs of Various Factories

Yesterday, the city chamber of commerce sent a joint letter from 16 trade associations, including the color printing industry, the chemical industry, the photographic plate-making industry, the gas lamp industry, the celluloid industry, the silk and satin printing industry, the electrical equipment industry, the glass industry, the hardware industry, the electroplating industry, the leather manufacturing industry, the paper manufacturing industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the cosmetics industry, the letterpress printing industry, and the tinplate can manufacturing industry, to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Economics, requesting permission to establish a raw material import review committee composed of various industrial organizations to coordinate with the emergency economic measures and seek the development of production enterprises, thereby thoroughly stabilizing the national economy. Nine proposed measures were drafted as follows:

(1) A raw material import review committee shall be established by the trade associations of various industries. All factories within the industrial scope, whether state-owned, privately owned, or foreign-owned, shall have their required imported raw materials uniformly reviewed by the review committee.

(2) The duties of the raw material import review committee shall be as follows:

    A. Investigate the quantity of various raw materials required annually by each industry and the current inventory of various raw materials in each industry's factories.
    B. Review whether the raw materials should be imported.
    C. Review whether the quantity of raw materials applied for import by each industry's factory is appropriate.
    D. Promote domestic raw materials. If domestic goods can be substituted, import shall not be approved.
    E. Issue certification documents for factories in each industry applying to import raw materials.
    F. Assist the Import Management Committee regarding raw material import matters.

(3) The Import Management Committee's approval of raw material imports shall be based on the certification documents of the raw material import review committees of various industries. Otherwise, no foreign exchange settlement or import shall be approved.

(4) The Import Management Committee may send personnel to participate in the raw material import review committees of various industries.

(5) If the Import Management Committee believes that there are objections to the raw material import certification documents submitted by the review committee, it may return them to the review committee for reconsideration.

(6) The raw materials imported by factories in various industries shall be used only for manufacturing goods and shall not be hoarded or sold privately, but the transfer among colleagues shall not be limited by this.

(7) The raw material import review committee shall invite relevant industries to participate together for joint review, or the relevant industry associations shall jointly organize a review committee.

(8) Factories in various industries may organize a raw material import cooperative to uniformly handle the import and distribution of raw materials for each industry. The government shall assist and supervise it, and the methods shall be prescribed separately.

(9) The details of imported goods decided upon by the raw material import review committee of each industry shall be published in the newspaper from time to time to solicit criticism, so that corrections can be made at any time. The above measures outline the general principles. If they are adopted and implemented, there will be six benefits. However, at the same time, strict restrictions should be imposed on the import of finished products, and imports should be prohibited unless absolutely necessary. Smuggling should also be effectively curbed, which will make the results easier to achieve. (Omitted below)

### Rice Market Remains Sluggish, Flour Prices Decline with Few Buyers

Yesterday, the total source of rice in the rice market was about 11,000 shi, with sluggish sales. Japonica rice gradually declined, with both middle, lower-grade southern and northern japonica rice seeing continued declines of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Indica rice trading was slack and listless. Baiyuan was stable, while Yinyuan raised its price.

The Oil Market Society Bureau strictly prohibited market prices from exceeding the negotiated price, so trading in the market was limited. Only refined oil trading rose slightly by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. It is heard that soybean oil and raw oil are firm in the over-the-counter market due to the scarcity of goods from Qingdao. The supply and demand of soybean cake were both low, and the market was flat.

Flour prices gradually declined, dropping by another 1,000 yuan, with few buyers, making it difficult to improve the situation. Bran prices dropped by 1,000 yuan, with sluggish sales, making it difficult to be optimistic.

Foreign merchants digested yellow beans in the street, continuing to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Mung beans fell back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. High-quality raw kernels were stable, while middle and lower-quality kernels fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame was firm, red beans turned firm, and kernel grains were fair. Corn from Qingdao moved again, weakening and then strengthening, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Rise Slightly

Yesterday's sugar market trend was relatively stable, with occasional rebounds. The association set the price of No. 22 medium white sand at 185,500 yuan. No. 24 group white sand was at 213,000 to 215,000 yuan. The spot price for the eighth term three-and-a-half car white sugar was 188,000 yuan. The price for the same goods in the ninth term was 182,000 yuan, which then dropped to 180,000 yuan, and then rebounded to 181,000, 182,500, and 183,000 yuan. The spot price for Miyan fine sand rose from 185,000 to 186,000 yuan to 187,000 to 189,000 yuan. Shantou refined sugar rose by 5,000 yuan, with several hundred bags trading at 130,000 yuan to 129,000 yuan. Diao refined sugar rose by 2,000 yuan, opening at several hundred bags at 126,000 yuan, followed by 124,000 yuan.

### Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Investigates Two Types of Industrial Raw Materials: Stearic Acid and Precipitated Calcium Carbonate

[Our Correspondent] Since our government adopted the import licensing system, the supply of industrial raw materials in this city has also been affected. The Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office has specially dispatched staff to various factories to conduct on-site investigations of the production and sales situation of various industrial raw materials, so as to actively promote the self-sufficiency plan for industrial raw materials. The office has now investigated two types of raw materials: stearic acid and precipitated calcium carbonate. The investigation process is summarized as follows:

Stearic Acid: In this city, it is mostly used as a raw material for candles, cosmetics, skin creams, etc. The annual usage in this city is 250 tons (equivalent to 5,000 dan) for the cosmetics industry, 150 tons (equivalent to 3,000 dan) for the rubber industry, and 300 tons (equivalent to 6,000 dan) for the candle industry. However, as the candle industry has stagnated, the actual usage is only 8,000 dan. Currently, there is only one factory in this city producing stearic acid, with an annual production of 7,200 dan. However, the current actual production is only half of that. If expansion is implemented, production can be increased to 12,000 dan within three months, which is sufficient for the entire country. It is hoped that the government can provide assistance so that the production and sales issues of stearic acid can be resolved.

Precipitated Calcium Carbonate: In this city, it is mostly used in the rubber and cosmetics industries. There are 72 rubber factories in this city, with a monthly need for 17,395 tons of rubber, but the actual usage is less than 1,000 tons. With 1,500 tons being estimated for rubber usage in other cities, the monthly usage of precipitated calcium carbonate is 2,000 tons, which is 20,000 tons per year. The cosmetics industry uses 1,600 tons of precipitated calcium carbonate per year, totaling 21,600 tons for both. The current price is 5 million yuan per ton, with a total value of 108 billion yuan. There are a total of five calcium carbonate manufacturing factories in this city, which can produce 24 tons per day, approximately 7,200 tons per year, only one-third of the total consumption. Therefore, there is an urgent need to expand production to balance production and sales. It was also found that the industry needs cheap white coal and sufficient electricity. At the same time, imports of foreign goods should be restricted to stimulate production in the industry.

### 2.5 Million Pounds of Chinese Tea Approved for Export to the UK

[Reuters, London, 7th] According to local Chinese tea importers, it is estimated that most of the 2.5 million pounds of Chinese tea approved for import by the end of this month have already been purchased. Import permits are expected to be issued soon to continue importing Chinese tea.

### Export Tea Transactions Rare

The attention of English factories is focused on black tea for export. Yesterday, the market still saw few transactions due to a lack of agreement between buyers and sellers. As for green tea varieties, since the export merchants in this city learned that some of the old stock from previous years was of lower quality and not welcomed abroad, they are now unwilling to inquire about it, resulting in a quieter market. However, there is frequent consideration given to green tea from the 34th and 35th years, but unfortunately, the prices offered do not meet the buyers' expectations, leading to largely unsuccessful negotiations and very mediocre transactions. Only Wu Chang, Dade Chang, Hua Cha, and other companies are still making purchases, and the market remains stable. Domestic sales of red and green tea are rarely exciting, and there is little fluctuation in sentiment.

### Electric Bulb Prices Rise Sharply

[Report from this newspaper] According to electrical goods merchants: the price of electric bulbs is soaring due to the cessation of tungsten filament supply and frequent increases in material and labor costs. The market is very hot. 220V40W GE bulbs are selling for 15,000 yuan each, Apur for 14,000 yuan each, and Hua De for 14,000 yuan each. 220V100W GE bulbs are selling for 40,000 yuan each, Apur for 25,000 yuan each, and American ATLAS bulbs for 40,000 yuan each.

### Tung Oil Supply from Source Uninterrupted, Market Stable with Upward Trend

[Report from this newspaper] Tung oil transactions continued in small quantities over the weekend. The arrival of goods from the production areas continues unabated. Merchants are purchasing arriving goods at prices ranging from 380,000 to 400,000 yuan per dan, depending on the refractive index. Export-grade white oil is being purchased by exporters at a price of 440,000 yuan per dan without barrels, with quick barrels costing an additional 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Tung oil merchants are selling in small quantities at a price of 420,000 yuan per dan (non-export grade). There have been no deliveries from Dingxi Hongjiyingfengjiu, resulting in no goods and no market. 83-catty barrel of secondary Xihong is 390,000 yuan per barrel. Hongjiang barrel oil ranges from 250,000 to 270,000 yuan per barrel. Rural sales are becoming more active, with a stable but upward trend.

### Dyes Frequently Decline

[Report from this newspaper] The sluggishness of the dye market over the past two weeks is unprecedented in the last half-year. According to industry insiders: sales to North China have ceased, and domestic sales are also suffering because of abundant inventories. The weight of the market price and time considerations is very heavy, and the cost of transportation is very high, so there is no demand, and transactions are extremely scarce. Over the weekend, Daqiao vermilion was priced at 200,000 yuan per can, Haitong brown at 65,000 yuan, Wuma vermilion at 350,000 yuan per can, BNC yuanqing at 90,000 yuan per can, and No. 16 dizihui at 360,000 yuan per can, all significantly lower than the previous day.

### Sausage Casing Market Declining

Sausage casing prices are declining because foreign prices are frequently reported to be sluggish, while manufacturers' production costs are high, making it impossible to lower prices. Recently, foreign firms' demand has weakened, and the market has suddenly turned to decline. It is reported that sausage casing manufacturers are planning to request that fresh casing prices be stabilized to reduce costs. If the sausage casing industry can reduce costs, the annual export volume could reach 8,500 barrels, which, based on current New York prices, could yield more than 50 million US dollars.

### Oil Trade Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today

The Shanghai Oil Trade Association, since being ordered to prepare for its establishment, has passed more than a month. Applications to join the association have been very enthusiastic, totaling more than 70% of the oil merchants in the city. The preparatory committee has decided to hold an inaugural meeting at the association's location on Minquan Road on the 9th of this month to elect directors and supervisors in accordance with the law.

### Bituminous Coal Continues to Decline

The selling price of white coal in the coal market is still being strongly supported by the owners, so the process remains stable throughout. Bituminous coal continues the previous trend. Market prices continue to fall, especially bituminous coal dust, which has seen the most severe decline. Jilong dust is being offered at 600,000 yuan, but still lacks a buyer.

### Woolen Fabrics Trade Narrows

Woolen fabrics have been gradually increasing in price for the past two weeks due to various environmental factors. Currently, there is less circulation of goods in the market, and factories are facing difficulties in production. Import merchants are caught in a standstill due to the temporary import ban, foreign exchange adjustments, and further restrictions. As a result, it is difficult for fellow merchants to import goods, and sales are rebounding, with many hoarding goods. The actual sales of Chinese and Western clothing are much lower than in previous spring seasons. Therefore, the current and future import and export of woolen fabrics can be said to be entering a narrow path.

### The Advantages and Disadvantages of Import and Export Linking System

Regarding the detailed measures of the import and export linking system, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene a meeting on the 10th of this month at the chamber to discuss with relevant organizations. The Import and Export Trade Association is currently drafting opinions on the measures and has notified all fellow merchants to attend the discussion at that time. Zhou Jingwei, the secretary of the association, recently analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the import and export linking system for the industry to reporters as follows:

(1) In the past year, our foreign export trade has been unable to develop due to the imbalance between costs and foreign market prices. On the other hand, imports have increased many times over. This is because there is a great need for various industrial raw materials after the war, and the consumption of finished products is also large. Before the war, industrial manufactured products used only a portion of foreign raw materials, with the remaining raw materials mostly being domestic products. However, in recent years, due to inconvenient domestic transportation and the losses suffered during the eight years of war, the production of some raw materials has sharply decreased, and as a result, prices are often higher than those of foreign goods. Therefore, the quantity of imported goods has been increasing daily. The authorities feel that it is difficult to cope with the enormous influx of imports in the current situation of foreign exchange supply. Furthermore, since the implementation of the import management policy, the various industries have been deeply restricted, and their businesses are almost at a standstill. Therefore, an import and export linking system should be adopted to maintain them.

(2) Although the linking system is a shortcut to free trade for the import and export industry, excessive indulgence can easily lead to competition. As a result, imports and exports will inevitably lead to a surge in goods and a drop in prices, while those in the industry with greater financial resources and better access to information can manipulate and monopolize the market. Therefore, the implementation measures for this linking system still need to be carried out with measures that are neither too loose nor too tight in order to achieve any benefits.

### Assisting Foundries and Other Industries, Second Batch of Pig Iron Being Negotiated, Delivery Price to Shanghai Lower than Spot Price

[Report from this newspaper] In order to assist the machinery, foundry, and electrical equipment industries in resolving raw material difficulties, the Mechanical and Electrical Group of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office is actively negotiating for the purchase of low-priced pig iron and coke for various industries. Regarding pig iron, in addition to purchasing more than 700 tons from the Dadukou Ordnance Department of Chongqing in January of this year at a price of 940,000 yuan per ton for use by various industries, it has recently negotiated with the North China Iron and Steel Company to purchase a second batch of pig iron. It is reported that the negotiation has shown that, except for high-silicon iron, which is out of stock, there is an inventory of 4,000 tons of No. 1 pig iron, priced at 1,050,000 yuan per ton. There is also an inventory of 8,000 tons of No. 2 pig iron, priced at 980,000 yuan per ton. The above prices are for delivery at the Qinhuangdao or Tanggu wharf. For orders of 100 tons or more, 50,000 yuan per ton can be reduced. A deposit of 70% must be paid first, and the remainder must be paid upon shipment. For small orders, delivery will be made at the wharf within 15 days after receipt of the deposit, while large orders will require 30 days. Regarding freight, a flat rate of 300,000 yuan per ton will be charged, with refunds for overpayment and supplemental payments for underpayment, to be remitted by telegraph seven days before shipment. It is reported that the effective period of the transaction price is temporarily limited to ten days (i.e., maintained until March 15). Based on the terms of this transaction, the delivered price of this batch of pig iron to Shanghai is much lower than the current market price of pig iron in the city. It is reported that the transaction is currently in progress. In addition, the office negotiated the purchase of a batch of coke earlier this month, totaling approximately 160 tons, which has already been supplied to various mechanical and electrical industries at a price of 700,000 yuan per ton. It is reported that the market price of coke is approximately 1,800,000 to 2,000,000 yuan per ton.

### Prelude to the Moscow Conference: A Record of Matters Discussed by London Foreign Ministers' Representatives

— Airmail report, March 1, Special correspondent in London, Fushong

The foreign ministers of the three countries are too busy, and their meetings are hurried with limited time. Therefore, before gathering in Moscow, they first send representatives to London to discuss matters, so that they can extract a clue from the myriad details as a basis for the three giants to meet and discuss. The meeting of representatives has been convened in London since January 14. It has been open for six weeks and ended on February 23, submitting the report to the foreign ministers. During the six weeks, they discussed German issues in the morning and Austrian issues in the afternoon. The United Kingdom had two representatives: Sir Hood, who attended discussions on issues related to Austria, and Sir William Strang, who attended discussions on issues related to Germany. The United States also had two: General Mark Clark, who was in charge of Austrian issues, and Mr. Robert Murphy, who was in charge of German issues. France only had one, M. Couve de Murville, and the Soviet Union only had one, Mr. Gusev, who attended both meetings.

Once the meeting opened, various small countries requested to participate one after another, and the written memorandums they sent in piled up like a mountain. The various dominions of the United Kingdom unanimously believed that the Paris Conference had already had disputes between large and small countries, and that a mistake should not be repeated. The eighteen countries that declared war on Germany this time should all have the opportunity to participate and speak. The Netherlands and Belgium, which suffered deeply from Germany's crimes, are now excluded, and are naturally indignant. Various parties have tried their best to request the right to speak.

China Sent a Memorandum

Our China did not send personnel to present reasons, but only sent a memorandum, reiterating what Minister Wang said in France, that China should also participate in convening the German peace conference. I remember that on the day the representatives' meeting was convened, British newspaper reporters inquired one after another whether China had a memorandum or whether it would send personnel to present its views. At that time, China did not make any moves. After the memorandum was sent, the newspapers did not mention a word about what China had proposed. During the representatives' meeting, there were also many opinions on whether to hold a large-scale peace treaty conference with Germany, like the Paris Peace Conference. Small countries believe that if small countries are allowed to participate and speak as much as possible during the preparation period, then the final conference will be brief and formal, which can save the lip service and propaganda speeches of the Justice and Peace Conference. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union believe that whether the decisions of the foreign ministers' meeting are final or not, at least a peace conference should be convened to conclude the matter, while the United States is silent on this. If the Moscow Conference decides not to convene even a transferred peace conference, then our memorandum will completely lose its target.

Small Countries' Protests Take Effect

The protests and struggles of small countries have, after all, had considerable effect. When discussing the agenda of the German peace treaty, the French representative proposed three principles: First, the drafting of the peace treaty should naturally be the responsibility of the four countries. Second, the right of participation of other countries should be greater than the time when the Justice and other five small enemy countries were at peace. Third, while small countries participate, this should not increase the difficulties of the foreign ministers' meeting.

As for how to make the right of participation of small countries greater than the previous one, France also has suggestions: On the one hand, various small countries can send people to the foreign ministers' representatives' meeting to present their views, and on the other hand, a consultation and information committee should be organized, composed of representatives of the four major powers and "related countries," to provide consultation for the foreign ministers' meeting and also to contribute opinions to the foreign ministers' meeting. In the Potsdam Agreement, it was originally stipulated that when the foreign ministers' meeting discusses issues related to a certain country, that "directly related" country can be invited to participate. But how should the definition of "directly related" be made? The four foreign ministers' representatives had different views, and finally accepted the suggestion of the Soviet representative Gusev that any country that borders Germany or has been occupied by Germany is a "directly related" country. Although this definition is far-fetched, no definition is better than this, so it has to be passed. The Times said that in this way, Albania will be able to attend the discussion, while Canada, which has made outstanding contributions in the war against Germany, will have no share. From our Chinese point of view, since we have not been occupied by Germany and are far away in the Far East and do not border Germany, we will have no share in this committee. The United Kingdom and the United States support the participation of ten countries. So far, this is still pending, and will probably be submitted to the three giants for decision. But in any case, the four representatives unanimously acknowledge the error in drafting the Justice Peace Treaty, so they unanimously advocated that the countries concerned should be able to issue written statements as much as possible, and that when discussing issues related to that country and Germany, that country should be invited to attend. For example, in the case of German-Dutch issues, the Netherlands should be invited to express its views.

Two Unresolved Difficulties

The extent to which small countries should participate is the first issue on which the four representatives disagreed and could not decide. The second issue is the issue of Germany's national system. Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Luxembourg advocate that Germany should be a federal or confederate system in the future, while Yugoslavia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Belarus, Ukraine, and Norway advocate maintaining Germany's political unity. Those who advocate a federal system believe that only by dispersing its centralized power can Germany's aggressive power be weakened, while those who advocate political unity believe that dispersing it will stimulate its Greater Germanism and fuel its aggressive desires. It is better to unify it, which is easier to control. Although the two statements are extreme, their purpose is to prevent Germany from aggression in the future. The two opinions have also been submitted to the foreign ministers' meeting.

The German issue is just these two main branches, roughly speaking. As for Austria, the most troublesome thing is the issue of Yugoslavia wanting a piece of land in southern Austria. Since Yugoslavia's request for port affairs from Italy failed, this time it seems to be desperate, and it has the appearance of not stopping until it achieves its goal. It must have a piece of land in southern Austria called Carinhia (where most of the residents are Slovenes, 120,000 to 130,000). There are only 60,000 Germans. From the perspective of race and strategy, this piece of land should belong to Yugoslavia. The representative of the South, Dr. Vilfar, spoke eloquently, but the British representative said that a referendum was held there in 1920 under international supervision. 51% were returned to Austria, and 49% wished to belong to the South. The road was only given to Austria. The Prime Minister of Austria, Figl, rushed to London with his Foreign Minister and refused to give up this land of 1,000 square miles. He said to the South that his mistreatment of Slovenes was a false accusation. The case also went to Moscow.

Also, in the Potsdam Agreement, the Western countries promised to hand over the German assets in East Austria to the Soviet Union. Although the principle has been set, this time a detailed rule must be set. Western countries believe that this definition should be strict, so that many Austrian interests will not be confused with the German ones. The Soviet Union in the East believes that the more ambiguous the definition is, the better, so that it can enjoy the greatest benefits. This is another point of contention.

The above are just the general trends. There are also thousands and hundreds of requests for land cession, and tens of millions and hundreds of millions of requests for compensation, which are all pushed to Moscow for resolution. The current problems are much more complicated and thorny than in the Potsdam era. As the British Economist magazine rightly said: "What needs to be resolved now is not only the mistakes planted by Hitler, but also the problems committed by the victorious countries themselves."

### Dutch Youth Participate in Grand Celebration Parade

— (Special correspondent for this newspaper, Wang Yizhiqi)

Celebration of the Fourth Dutch Queen's Grandchild

Leiden City Airmail Report, February 28, Special correspondent for this newspaper, Wang Yizhi

The Dutch royal family surnamed Oranji has been passed down for hundreds of years. They have accumulated virtue and benevolence and are deeply loved by the people. Now, they are known for their kindness and compassion among the various countries. Her Majesty Wilhelmina, the benevolent Empress of the Netherlands, has inherited the legacy of the late Empress Dowager. She is knowledgeable, advocates politics, and is close to the people. She participates in all kinds of events and knows everything in this complex life, prosperous career, and five-flowered, thousand-odd, wonderful new era and new world. She is able to adapt to the trend and win the sympathy of the social groups. Dr. L. J. M. Beel, the Dutch Prime Minister who formed a detached cabinet by integrating various parties last year, is also a virtuous minister of peace who has reversed the chaos and brought about good fortune. Although the national strength of the Netherlands has inevitably gone from rich to poor after the war, the love between the monarch and the people and the harmony between the upper and lower classes can be seen in the celebration of the birth of the fourth Queen's grandchild, Marijke (see the first picture) on the morning of February 19.

The fourth Queen's grandchild was born at 2:46 a.m. At that time, the people of the eleven provinces were all asleep. The Dutch official first used the radio to broadcast the good news. Hertogenbosch, the capital of Noord-Braban, the southern and northern wilderness province of the Netherlands, which believes in Roman Catholicism, has a carnival that usually celebrates the night. The college students who enjoy themselves in their dances by chance take the knowledge they have obtained first and return north at dawn. They arrive at the ancient ferry V-treclit in the center of the entire territory of the Netherlands and break the door of the great cathedral, swarming straight in, climbing the bell tower, and ringing the bell to spread the news to the entire city, quickly shattering the morning dreams of the residents everywhere. From near to far, it gradually reached everyone in the country. According to the traditional historical customs of the Netherlands, whenever there is a major event in the royal family, a Herald light cavalry is always used to fly and report to the people. On this day, all the cities, large and small, took a holiday for a full day of celebration. Men and women, young and old, left their alleys and came out. We still see the former light cavalry, as the vanguard of the opening road, wearing a grand crown and a magnificent momentum.

A Frenzied Procession Participates in the Grand Ceremony

Looking at this day, most of them are Hantang, The Hague, as well as Rotterdam ancient ferry Zhulin New Field Nijmegen Guangchuan Breda Zhongbao Middelburg Luling Groningen Shiwei Leeuwarden Yuwu Eind-hoven Xihan Hilversum Township Arn-hem Hejin Amers-foort Sifu Zwolle Leiden, and other cities, the same large and small celebrations of enthusiasm, enough to mark the following nine points, (1) Cars celebrating the royal family's great joy raced, departing from the east, west, north and south sides of the cities, one after another, all with the birthplace of the Queen's Grandchild, Nanxidi Soe-st-dijk, as their final concentrated destination, I should slightly change the ancient people's poems, and use the fourteen words "Nine Qu Kuanglang Open Palace, Wanxing Huan Yu Bai Mianliu" to describe its magnificence. (2) A flag-waving parade under a clear wind and beautiful sun. (3) A torch parade on a horse-drawn carriage and water-drawn vehicle. (4) A youthful and lively drum and music parade (see second picture). (5) Flag-raising speeches and music playing in the central city square. (6) Street corner dances in front of lanterns. (7) Children's games and entertainment in grand mansions and deep halls. (8) A large court chorus of tens of groups and tens of thousands of people, culminating in the Tap-toe music of the soldiers returning to camp at the urging of the time and urging of various pubs, to help the grand ceremony. (9) The blessing of the church. At the same time, the artistic talents of the whole country, each because of the good use of the commercial and industrial sectors' wide range of advertising strategies, showed their good skills, made money in a proper way, and used it at the right time. There are many ways for my domestic compatriots to rise up and imitate. There are many ways to take advantage of it. I will specifically cite seven things to illustrate the rest: First, the walls of royal government offices, major newspapers, and department stores, or pay tribute to orange electric bubbles, where the words and circles of the celebration are created, or install the latest Neon (that is, electric rainbow) electric light tubes, and the light scenes of happy symbols such as wading birds carrying infants emerge. Second, the windows of various shops are decorated with painted scenes and pictures, such as the Stork, which is used in Western customs to replace the unicorn who sends children, carrying the child in swaddling clothes, or spreading its wings and soaring, or living in a nest on the roof and standing high on the calendar, or placed next to an orange tree symbolizing the royal family, or embellishing the map of the Netherlands with the oblique continuous provinces, with colorful algae paintings, clever ideas, or tying orange and yellow silk ribbons, or placing orange thin silk curtains at the bottom of a small cradle that can be pushed by wheels, or arranging in a fan shape, interspersed with flags of various colors, or inserting a panorama of Nanxidi Palace, or encircling the reflections and portraits of the Dutch empress, queen, empress, and empress's grandchildren. Strolling through the streets, it is like visiting an exhibition of decorative arts and crafts. Third, in the ten days after the birth of the Queen's grandchild, the timely and wonderful products of the candy store are double-baked biscuits with mint-filled sugar dorps, slightly like the red-dyed happy eggs in China to celebrate the addition of a child. In Dutch customs, if a son is born to a family, undyed white grains are added to the cake surface, and red sugar grains are used for a daughter. Since orange and yellow are the surnames of the Dutch empress, the cake surface is covered with orange-yellow grains regardless of whether the royal family has a son or a daughter. Friends give each other gifts to celebrate the great joy. Fourth, the display of goods in various stores to cater to the psychology of ordinary people, such as vegetables and fruits that belong to orange, chrysanthemums with orange-yellow in flower shops, and orange-yellow candles in silverware stores, are examples. Fifth, the enthusiastic promotion of precious books about the royal family and postcards that promote the spirit of patriotism in color paintings in painting paper stores. Sixth, the fast meal or general meeting, the ingenuity of the dishes, and the production of a celebratory menu. The seventh item is the celebratory special issue of each daily newspaper. The cover always sees the orange-yellow color printed lace, or a special page in the newspaper is opened, specially revealing the poem of the painting for green decoration, which is slightly similar to the "Huanlong Dingye" of the previous generation of imperial books for the emperor's special respect, such as the organ newspaper for Roman Catholicism, The Maasbode's poem, the top center of the outer frame is painted with a royal crown, the left and right are decorated with orange and yellow, and the horizontal lintel is written with the words "Happy sound spreads all over the country", the left and right corners are listed the family crests of the Dutch royal family and the empress's husband, respectively, and there is a messenger pigeon flying downwards next to them, according to legend, in ancient times, the Old World was plagued by floods, Noah and his family moved into a lone boat in advance and floated in the sea, avoiding the disaster, waiting for the shore to be flooded and then the water receded, Noah first released a dove to try to fly to the mainland, but it was never seen returning, then he released a dove again, and after a long time, it returned with a green branch, which was the first good news that the flood had receded on the shore, so Westerners drew messenger pigeon paintings, and our Chinese red letter happy posts could be printed with golden pigeons to renew the public's vision and hearing, the left side of the outer frame is painted with a tall chimney, representing industry, painted with pleasure ship sailboats, and seagulls in the sky, representing shipping and commerce, the right side is painted with a church, and between the city residence and the rural house, there are courtyard trees, representing the foundation of the country, and on the lower side, the right is the farmer who uses horses to cultivate the land, the left is the sailor who ventures far away, and in the middle is written the children and women who carry their hands and sing after hearing the news, the poem title is the happy bell, the Western words are lengthy, evolved into seven sections, I will now extract its essence and translate it into a seven-character quatrain as follows:

Loving the Country and Respecting the King are Twins

"The good atmosphere shines back to the fourth spring, the orange fruit shows its spirit, people from the east, west, north, and south compete to congratulate, loving the country and respecting the king are twins."

There is a saying in China that a scholar's kindness is half a piece of paper. Western writing is lyrical, but it cannot be as wonderful as my square characters that combine characters and paintings. Therefore, Chinese painting has not progressed. Pictures in the West have long been in an important position, standing on their own. The decorative skills of Western society's art are more advanced than those of the Chinese. Every time there is a celebration, it can be because the pictures are exquisite, amazing and dazzling, and the innovations are wonderful. The material consumption is not much, but the spiritual benefits are very great. Nowadays, Chinese society is full of unpleasant and unhappy atmosphere. It is worried that it is too bitter and too dull. If we borrow the leisure of sound education and drum music, the comfort of Chen Sai's parade, the end of the dispute over rights within the door, and the reward of the innocence outside the object, reconcile the interest and unite the mood, how can there be no one to eliminate the last gaps and sit down to achieve peace?

The Fourth Dutch Queen's Grandchild

### 筧橋空軍官校　在苦難中創造前途

— Hangzhou, 6th day of month. Special correspondent of this newspaper, Chu Yusheng.

In this era when the nation has once again fallen into the abyss of hardship, and all undertakings such as education and economy are in dire straits, only those with ambition and perseverance can maintain and create their careers. The Jianqiao Air Force Officer School, as the foundation of the air force construction, which is an important part of national defense construction, is the only supreme institution for training aviation talents. It is also creating its future amidst hardships.

Before the war, the air school had quite complete facilities and many houses. During the war, it was hated by the Japanese enemy and wantonly destroyed. It was not easy to repair after the war. Now, their student dormitory can only accommodate the 25th and 26th classes. The 27th class will arrive at the school in May, and there is a problem with the dormitory, which is being rebuilt. Originally, there were special classrooms for communication, bombing, expulsion, navigation, etc. in the education process, with very complete large-scale instruments inside. After the war, they were completely destroyed by the enemy. Now, they can only practice on machinery and conduct practical education. Originally, the air school was quite privileged, so almost every room had heating equipment. Now, only the office building has heating equipment, and there is none in other places.

Spring Chill, Starting a River

This reporter went to the air school for the sixth time. It was the time of early spring, but their heating pipes were not turned on. The Director of Education and several other officers smiled and said to the reporter, "The country is so difficult, how can we bear to waste public funds?" Under the call of Director Hu, all officers, students, and soldiers participated in labor service. As a result, they transformed dozens of acres of weedy and thorny wasteland into flat and usable land. Many roads in the school were built by officers and students, many trees were planted by officers and students, and many ditches were dug by officers, students, and soldiers. Lieutenant Colonel Zhu Shoushu pointed out to the reporter that this strong team is now starting to dig a river. "Hands are omnipotent," they are adhering to this motto!

26th Class Students, Learning Blind Flight

Their 26th class of students is learning the course of blind flight. Everyone happily boarded the plane and bravely soared in the sky. Especially those skilled instructors with past combat exploits, aviation is like drinking a glass of sweet wine to them. One instructor told me, "If I don't fly for a day, it's really uncomfortable." They have taken the vast sky as their paradise, and they can roam freely in the vast open space. It is said that the 26th class of students is undergoing the elimination process. Many students are very happy, but also very nervous. They are deeply afraid of being eliminated, deeply afraid of losing this vast aerial paradise, so they are all learning cautiously, hoping to become an important member of the air force construction. These days, the sound of light Stearman training planes has been constant in the sky over Hangzhou all day long. This is when the 26th class of students is learning blind flight.

In the History of Aviation, See Who Is Suitable for Aviation

I once pulled a few officers to discuss what kind of people are suitable for flying. In the history of world aviation, people who should have flying energy can be divided into three periods: the first period was before the First World War, when airplanes were just being invented, and everyone thought flying was a terrifying thing. Whether they could land safely after flying into the sky was a great doubt, so as long as they were brave, regardless of whether their body was good or not, they were all good at flying airplanes. By the First World War, people became interested in aviation, and discovered that in addition to having the conditions of courage, they also needed to have a healthy body. After the First World War, in addition to having courage and a strong body, they also needed a kind of aviation psychology. Aviation psychology is related to nationality, history, geography, habits, and other conditions. People in some places are suitable for aviation, while people in some places are not. For example, Guangdong is close to the ocean and is influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and others, so they have a sound aviation psychology, so many people are suitable for aviation. Now, the United States determines whether a person is suitable for aviation. The highest authority belongs to aviation psychologists, followed by aviation doctors. In China, the highest authority for determining whether a person is suitable for aviation belongs to aviation doctors. Aviation psychologists are really rare, so we are one step behind others.

What Is the Main Cause of Airplane Accidents?

We also talked about the causes of the recent airplane accidents in Shanghai and Chongqing. The superficial reasons are abnormal weather, sloppy aircraft maintenance, negligent pre-flight checks, and excessive loading, but the main reason should be the unsound aviation psychology. Perhaps the driver had something to do the night before, or perhaps the driver encountered new stimuli, or perhaps the driver had fantasies about certain issues. Therefore, he could not devote his energy to driving, and he would encounter an unprecedented tragedy. According to one instructor, "During the war, even if the weather was abnormal, we had to fly to the front line to fight. Even if there were minor problems with the aircraft, we had to find a way to fly back to the original defense. At that time, all our energy was concentrated in one place, so we managed not to disgrace our mission. For example, Mr. Cao Chaojue, who flew over the Hump in a Stearman training plane, judging from the constant airplane accidents in Shanghai and Chongqing now, isn't it a myth that Mr. Cao was able to fly over the Hump?" We understood their enlightenment. Today, China is promoting aviation sports and exercising a sound physique, which is indeed a necessary path, but cultivating an aviation psychology is also very urgently needed.

In the Exhibition, Confident That the Future Is Promising

The officers and students of the Air Force Officer School hope that reporters will report the situation of the air school to everyone so that everyone can understand them. At the same time, they hope that more knowledge will enrich them and give them a richer education. At their request, this newspaper specially exhibited current affairs photos in their club. All the officers, students, and soldiers of the school, as well as all their families, came to visit. Later, Director Hu (Weike) said in a letter to this newspaper on the 3rd of this month, "From the exhibition of Shen Bao, I recognized China struggling in hardship," which made the reporter and all the colleagues of this newspaper excited and ashamed! Another enthusiastic and exciting scene is unforgettable. We saw their pure, innocent, and lively state, which made us confident that China has a future. According to the person in charge, the Chinese Kuomintang Party Department has left the school in 1945. Now they want to change the Political Department and establish a Guidance Office to complete the school system. All of this proves that the Air Force Officer School is creating its future in an era of hardship!

Starting from the Passing of a Friend

Yesterday, I went to a guild hall to mourn the loss of a deceased friend. I found the scene too desolate. The four walls had no elegiac couplets, and there were few people mourning. The flickering candles and the crying of the family shrouded the desolate mourning hall. Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but shed a few tears of sympathy.

Speaking of this deceased friend, he was still young and at the prime of his life. He served in an organization. He was loyal to his duties and was also a very "law-abiding" person. He never neglected his duties, even without strict review from the public sector. So he can be said to be a model good civil servant.

He had an elderly mother and young siblings at home, all of whom depended on him for their livelihood. The burden on his shoulders was really too heavy. But his income was meager beyond belief, so he had to try his best to save money and provide for his mother and two siblings as much as possible.

His work was too troublesome and his nutrition was too poor, so his body suffered damage without him realizing it. Over time, inflammation developed. When he went to the hospital, he still thought about his duties even while sick, but the illness gradually became serious, and finally his life was taken away by the ruthless god of death!

It is said that his illness was not absolutely incurable, but because of the lack of medical expenses, the hospital was unwilling to provide careful treatment. And after this friend died in the hospital, he still owed a large sum of medical expenses. Therefore, the hospital absolutely did not allow his family to move the body out of the morgue until this large sum was paid. According to his family's situation, it was of course impossible to bear such a large sum of medical expenses. Although the public sector has stipulated bereavement pay, it is too small, so this expense, along with the funeral expenses, was still raised by others through fundraising. The misery of a civil servant's life, how can it not make people grieve and lament!

The dead are gone. I imagine that there are many other civil servant comrades in the same situation as this friend. Therefore, I cannot help but make a painful appeal for this group of civil servant comrades. I think civil servants are people who work for the country. If the country cannot provide a definite guarantee for the lives of these civil servants, not only will this deceased friend forever hold regret under the springs, but how can the many surviving civil servant comrades be able to cheer up their enthusiasm for work? This will undoubtedly have an impact on the future of the country. I hope that the authorities can learn from the facts described in this article and make practical improvements to the lives of a group of civil servants in the long term. That would be very fortunate.

The Garbage on Changshou Road Has Been Cleared

This column published an article based on a reader's request for cleanliness on Changshou Road. Now, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau stating: "We ordered the Cleaning Brigade to investigate. According to the reply, the garbage at that location was difficult to clear because the ships at the garbage wharf were stranded and the transportation was abnormal. In order to thoroughly clear it, the garbage was concentrated at the above location, and trucks were reassigned to transport it. It has been verified that the garbage on Changshou Road was completely cleared on February 4th." We are publishing this information specially.

### Continued Discussion on Public Utilities in Suzhou

— Suzhou, 6th day of month. Special correspondent of this newspaper, Wu Shouren

Technical Difficulties, Widespread Public Telephones

Taking a closer look at today's Suzhou Telecommunications Bureau, although the service efficiency of its employees and internal management can be said to be impeccable, there is a technical difficulty that is seriously hindering the growth of the Suzhou telecommunications industry. In short, it is the obsolescence of the machinery: most of the existing switching exchanges and some telephones are old items from before the war. In particular, the exchange equipment has been in operation for more than 20 years, exceeding its load-bearing age. Therefore, when telephones malfunction, it is impossible to repair them all. Both users and technicians feel pain. The Telecommunications Bureau has made its best efforts to remedy this. They have strictly implemented the morning telephone testing and night line testing system, so that the Bureau can know about telephone malfunctions from the testing before the user has even discovered them, and immediately send technicians to repair them. The second is that the city telephone restriction measures promulgated by the Ministry of Communications continue to be effective, so that new users in the area who need telephones, although they are eager to have them installed, cannot have their wishes fulfilled. In order to make up for this shortcoming, Director Chen has opened up many public telephones, which are installed separately in densely populated and commercially built areas to facilitate many people.

Electricity and Steam Business, Limited to Lighting

The general situation of the telecommunications business in Suzhou has been briefly described above. Next is the electricity and steam business. The so-called electricity and steam business is currently limited to lighting. The Suzhou Electric Light Plant is a purely commercial institution, and its scale is one of the best on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Its power generation is 70,000 degrees of electricity, and the source of light for the entire county depends entirely on it. However, due to the difficult source of coal, the entire city stops supplying daytime electricity for two days a month, on the 1st and 15th of each month. On other days, power outages are rotated by region. This is a blow to many manufacturing plants that do not have their own power generation capabilities. All parties hope to improve, but limited to the actual difficulties of the electric light plant, being able to勉力to do what it is doing now is already quite commendable. The reporter interviewed their person in charge, who said that although the price of each degree of electricity is on average as high as 750 yuan, they still suffer extremely tragic losses every month. The crux of the matter is that the amount of allocated coal is too small, only about 2,500 tons a month, while the actual consumption reaches more than 4,000 tons. The difference of more than 1,500 tons must be completely sought from the market, with a price of 900,000 yuan per ton. The biggest reason for the loss is this. However, having said that, when it comes to the treatment of colleagues, in the current society of Suzhou, employees of the Electric Light Plant have a relatively secure life. Regarding this point, it is ultimately a fairly acceptable achievement.

Public Buses, Shortcomings Need to Be Remedied

What needs to be reported again is the urban public bus service, which opened in July last year. At that time, it caused fierce debates in all circles of Suzhou. Some believed that this was an evolution of social transportation and should be supported. Some believed that the current society was too poor, and the operation of public buses would seriously threaten the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers, leading to social unrest, and that it should be delayed. But in the end, public buses appeared before the people of Suzhou in the midst of everyone's desire for evolution. However, later, the failure to publicly solicit bids caused fierce criticism. However, after not much time, it disappeared. Until two months ago, the accumulation of unpaid road maintenance fees of more than 100 million yuan affected the Suzhou streets, which were gradually deteriorating due to the heavy load, but the problem of being unable to start construction made local public opinion greatly dissatisfied. But as of now, it has still subsided without any conclusion. From the reporter's objective standpoint, the operation of public buses is indeed an indisputable business under the current social transportation needs. However, Suzhou public buses also have their undeniable shortcomings: First, the bus bodies are converted from ten-wheeled military trucks, and the equipment is too rudimentary, but the fare is not cheap at all. Second, the drivers' driving skills and service ethics are too bad. In just six months of operation, several innocent people have been sacrificed under the huge wheels. Tragedies of being crushed and injured are common. The company often only uses economic compensation as a way to deal with it.

To sum up, the public utilities in Suzhou are too fragile, so fragile that it is hard for outsiders to believe. Among them, only the telecommunications business is quite commendable in terms of management. However, because of this, we feel that the telecommunications business in Suzhou should devote its efforts to cultivating it, so that good management can be matched with good technology, and bring a different brilliance to the entire public utility business in Suzhou! At the same time, it is hoped that the city telephone restriction measures can be abolished as soon as possible, so that the telecommunications business can fully achieve the ultimate goal of serving mankind. Speaking from the heart, Suzhou is a city worth developing. On the Beijing-Shanghai line, apart from Shanghai, how many wealthy places can have more than one million residents (including towns)? Are we willing to let it continue to lag behind in this way?

Spring and Autumn

### Writing Before the Ying Yepin Painting Exhibition Whether Chinese Painting Will Last Forever

— Ding Shan

Yepin is about to open a painting exhibition and asked me to write a preface. I said, I'm really tired of writing the same old things. Let's talk about the intrinsic value of Chinese painting. Yepin said okay, so we set the above topic.

The highest art in China is poetry, calligraphy, and painting, but recently I often feel a kind of terrifying threat, feeling that the "highest art" not only has no hope of revival, but is also about to face destruction. First, is there a need for "poetry," this five-character and seven-character rhyming poetry, in the environment of a real society? It is even resented by ordinary people, who say that it has no room for free expression, but is only left to a few old gentlemen who cling to the old and guard the dead to groan. This system, from poetry, lyrics, and music, to the three-five-seven-character "Kunqu Opera" and "Peking Opera," is heading into the shadows of decline. The more it moves away from the public, the darker it becomes!

The second is calligraphy, that is, the beauty of Chinese characters. The beauty of Chinese characters is unique to China. Although Japan has the same characters as us, it cannot get the beauty of our Chinese characters. Although the need for these characters cannot be abandoned in the use of Chinese characters, the aesthetic conditions of the calligraphy have been completely destroyed. Not to mention that no one is willing to put in the effort to pay attention to calligraphy itself, even the tool for writing characters, the "brush," is gradually being occupied by fountain pens, pencils, and even ballpoint pens, and has lost the conditions for calligraphy itself. This terrifying threat has spread throughout the country. I am afraid that in less than ten years, not only will no one be able to write Chinese characters, but no one will even recognize them.

In the past twenty years, what has been struggling and preserved a little is still "Chinese painting." Painting is a combination of poetic ideas, expressed with the brush used for writing. It does not have the difficulty of "poetry" or the monotony of "calligraphy." Ordinary people can still accept it. They can see a mountain and a tree from a certain ink splatter, and a flower or a bird from a certain color block, so they are more able to appreciate it and even willing to spend money to buy it and hang it on their walls to flaunt their elegance. Therefore, those who hold the brush to paint are more numerous than those who hold the brush to write poetry or write characters. It seems to be growing day by day in the 36th year of the Republic of China, and each representative writer of each period has a patriarch. In the early Republic of China, Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting were popular, and the patriarchs they held up were Bada Shanren, Qing Teng, and Banqiao. In the mid-Republic of China, Zhang Daqian and others held up Shitao and Mei Qushan. The Western painters of Liu Haisu's generation turned to learning Chinese painting, felt that writing with a brush was unbearable restraint, and advocated "rebel art," not wanting a patriarch, but seeing his real-life paintings, he still could not escape Bada Shitao. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, Wu Dayu and Wang Yiting passed away, Zhang Daqian moved to the Dunhuang Grottoes to paint Buddhist images, and there was no main force to promote and shout for the patriarch. People were also tired of the strange Bada school and the red and green Shitao school, and gradually returned to the Four Wangs and Wu Li. Until now, Liu Haisu has also changed to painting Shigutu. The standard for buying paintings is to specifically ask Feng Chaoran, Wu Xiangfan, Wu Daiqiu and other collectors for inspections. Therefore, they unintentionally unanimously promoted Dong Yuan and Ju Ran, and the Four Wangs, not to mention Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, and Qiu Ying, seemed to be unworthy.

Exhibitions are crowded with people, and it is not surprising that each exhibition earns a lot of money. Every painter is thriving, thinking that they are better than the Yuan Dynasty and surpass the Song Dynasty, and even have the idea that Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Guan Tong, and Jing Hao are nothing more than that. Who knew that since the victory, in less than two years, the golden age of painters had suddenly disappeared. Those who were once praised for their paintings in Luoyang are now all desolate. Therefore, everyone unanimously blamed the collapse of the economy, which led to the weakening of the purchasing power of art appreciators. Painters have lost their livelihood and can no longer produce exquisite works. The decline of painting has also followed the same demise as "poetry" and "calligraphy," and has truly become "three absolutes"?

In fact, Chinese painting had already died, not in the 36th year of the Republic of China, but in the early Qing Dynasty. If we carefully examine it, we can know that the source of life for art itself is always new. Just like poetry changes to lyrics, lyrics change to music, seal script changes to clerical script, clerical script changes to regular script, and regular script changes to cursive script, all are moving forward. Painting changed from the figures and animals of the Jin and Tang Dynasties to the landscapes of the Song Dynasty, and from the reality of the Song Dynasty to the abstraction of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. It has been changing to Dong Qichang and Wang Yuanqi, who are completely drawing sketches in their paintings. It is always moving forward. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, they specialized in creating retro styles, imitating everything. Therefore, "poetry" stopped at "Jiangxi" and "Xikun," "calligraphy" stopped at "Zhao" and "Dong," and "painting" stopped at the "Four Wangs." Until the Republic of China, "poetry" could not buy money, and people did not want to study it, so it died first. Apart from a few Hanlin scholars, calligraphy could not buy money, so it also continued to decline. Painting still had a group of ordinary people to buy it, but they also had an attitude of being tired of the old and liking the new to choose their own preferences. Therefore, painters had to struggle to keep up with the times and cater to their preferences, so they changed again and again in the thirty-sixth year, and in the end could not escape the small scope of the ancients, and showed a scene where the modern atmosphere was exhausted.

So, can this "painting," the quintessence of China, still exist? I firmly say it exists, it exists permanently! But what exists is the creation of the Republic of China era, not the resurrection of Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, or even the Four Wangs and Wu Li. Just like "poetry," a new creation will appear in the future, which cannot be encompassed by the Jiangxi school or the Xikun style.

This small discussion ends here, and Yepin's painting exhibition finally opened on the fifth of this month on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Township Association. Whether his strength can add a bit of vitality to the permanent existence of "painting," we can go to find the soul in his paintings.

Ying Yepin I Know Zheng Wuchang

The success of a painter is not accidental; they must have considerable learning — a clear distinction between good and bad, thoughtful understanding, a receptive attitude, and skillful change. These are the four beauties of painting (my humble opinion, I hope those who know will not disagree). Those who can distinguish between good and bad have a direction for their studies and will not go astray. What is good? How to achieve the good? They must add contemplation and spontaneously produce wonderful understanding. Wonderful traces often appear, and wonderful methods appear from time to time, not limited to ancient or modern times, and only those with a receptive attitude can gain and accept them. If the eyes have it and the spirit understands it, but the hands cannot respond, it is like entering a real mountain and returning empty-handed, and nothing is gained. One must have the skills to change and transform in order to be able to master all the strengths and create their own universe as if coming to a new land.

I remember more than ten years ago, Yepin lived close to me, and we could spend time together in the morning and evening, talking freely about ancient and modern painting. His distinction between good and bad was very high. Whenever he saw famous works, his eyes were bright and he wanted to see through the paper, and then he would nod and applaud, praising them repeatedly. His intelligence was beyond that of ordinary people. Even if it was made by a market historian or a village child, he would still repeatedly examine it to find its good points, and often said: "Tao is in the rubble, there may be wonderful things in it that people cannot think of or do." His receptiveness is like mud. Whenever he had an understanding, he would diligently pursue it with his hands, striving to exhaust its mysteries before stopping. Because his talent and hard work are equipped with the four beauties, his works are new and different every day, and he goes in and out of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Figures, flowers, birds, fish, and insects are all exquisitely crafted, especially landscapes. He has gained more from the methods of Huang Gongwang and Wang Meng. Huang Gongwang's work combines grandeur with simplicity, and Wang Meng's work combines simplicity with grandeur. The innermost secrets of this, Yepin can magically understand in the solitary branches and rocks, towering peaks and deep ravines, all of which move people's hearts and minds. Is Yepin not a man of today! Recently, Yepin will exhibit his masterpieces on the fifth floor of the Ningbo Township Association, with a total of more than one hundred points. Those who know will often be happy to congratulate Yepin on his success.

### On Paintings

— Gu Fei

On Inscribing on Master Daqian's Collection of Wu Xiaoxian's Calligraphy Scroll "Wu Ling Spring"

The spring hues of Wu Ling have fallen to the spring wind,
Imagining the solitude of the crimson blossoms of that year;
Rare to find such a clean place in the human world,
A thousand years of regret remain east of the Xiang River.

West Lake

The lake's light and mountain mists vie with the clouds' flight,
Beneath the azure, the Southern Mountains enter the gaze faintly;
Ten thousand strands of verdant silk weave the spring waters,
A dam of crimson brocade sets off the slanting brilliance.

On Inscribing on a Landscape Painting

The wind and sun are clear and solemn,
Pine shadows extend far beyond the house;
Within it resides a recluse,
Who reads all books without exception.

On Inscribing on a Landscape Painting

No human footprints on the mossy path,
Unusual flowers grace the simple wall;
Fine clouds divide the temples, making them verdant,
Towering peaks mimic slanted eyebrows.

On Inscribing on a Landscape Painting

The first rays of the sun adorn the level woods,
A deep green suddenly enters the eye;
Two mountains stand facing each other,
A stream gurgles, sounding like jade;
Winding and turning, one finds human dwellings,
Elevated and lowered, one sees thatched cottages,
Faintly hearing the sound of reading,
Sometimes continuing with the songs of the field.

On Inscribing on Fifth Sister Mo Fei's Painting of a Village Scene - Desert

Clearly desolate, like my hometown,
Recognizing the fine autumn light in the smoky waves,
The person in the boat is like me, always here,
Only missing a wine jar at the bow.

### Wu Zhi Lao's Calligraphy - Jiang Jinziyuan Temple Stele

— Guan Zhou

The famous calligrapher Wang Juesi said: "The beginning of calligraphy is difficult to enter the model, and the end is difficult to exit the model." The world is full of writing, and everyone knows it, but only our country regards writing as an art equivalent to painting and sculpture.

Skilled in painting, exquisite in calligraphy, and proficient in poetry, these are known as the "three perfections." Mr. Wu Zhihui, who is advanced in years and highly virtuous, is capable of all three. Some say that Mr. Wu has never painted, but they have probably never seen his paintings. Recently, I saw on Mr. Wu's bookshelf a volume of his manuscripts that he is currently writing, which explains the six types of Chinese characters. In it, he lists about five hundred pictographic characters, each with a picture. For example, for "rain," he paints rain, and for "clouds," he paints clouds, and he even adds color. Therefore, Mr. Wu is also capable of painting.

Recently, the stele inscription of the Jiang Jinziyuan Temple, written by Mr. Wu, has been published and is being sold at 40 Lu Ban Road. The inscription was written by Quan Zuwang of Yin in the year Wuwu of the Qianlong reign (1738), and Mr. Chen Bulei's postscript states, "...After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Wu Zhihui was asked to rewrite this stele, and his son Jingguo was instructed to select skilled stonemasons from Suzhou to carve it in stone, so that it would last forever. In the summer of the thirty-fifth year [of the Republic], the carving was completed. Mr. Wu's original calligraphy, without the slightest deviation, is vigorous, upright, and elegant, executed with the spirit of seal script and official script, enough to be admired for calligraphy for a thousand years. All his life, he favored regular script, which was used for the imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and was used as the standard for selection. Mr. Wu was a licentiate (juren) of the Qing dynasty and was also proficient in seal script. The beauty of his regular script, with its upright form and elegant strokes, needs no praise from me."

### White Clouds Emerging from the Peaks

— Zhao Tongyin

### Joint Catalogue of Three Artists' Exhibitions

— Shi Chongpeng

Recently, within the past two weeks, three painters, Zhang Yanfu, Ying Yeping, and Zhu Qishi, have successively held individual exhibitions at the Chinese Painting Gallery and the Ningbo Native Place Association Gallery. At a time when economic issues of gold and American dollars and political issues of peace talks and reorganization are causing the world to spin, artists are still independently creating and holding exhibitions. This cannot but be considered a dose of coolness for the depressed masses of society. Especially for us art workers, this is of particular interest.

Zhu, Zhang, and Ying are all young and vigorous painters in their forties. They each have their own talents and skills and are all friends I admire. Yanfu's landscapes imitate Shitao and Shixi, Qishi writes about the Yellow Mountains, and Yeping takes inspiration from various schools and is not exclusively devoted to one. Therefore, in this exhibition, more than 70% of Yanfu's paintings are landscapes of the Second Stone (Shitao and Shixi). The layout, environment, and techniques such as trees, stones, and moss dots are all in the style of the Second Stone, especially in terms of artistic conception, which is simple, natural, and appropriately ingenious! What I admire most about him is that between the outlines of the mountains and rocks, the misty clouds and waters, he renders some light ochre and azurite, which is fluent and lively, and depicts the beauty of the mountains and rivers and the charm of Mount Taihua without omission. He does not care about being too similar to Shitao and Shixi!

In recent years, Yeping's landscapes have used the Four Wangs as his bridge. Passing through this bridge, he attacks Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Huang Gongwang, and Wang Meng in one go, and he has actually been able to enter their halls. This cannot but make us admire him. In this exhibition, the magnificence of "Luofu Mountain Qiaogang," the steadiness of "Holding a Staff and Watching the Waterfall," the secluded elegance of "Chaoshan Xiaxia," and the upright elegance of "Orchids and Bamboo" are indeed derived from the style of Wu Zhonggui and Zhao Wenmin.

Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, many painters have written about the Yellow Mountains. The Yellow Mountains have three wonders: strange pines, bizarre rocks, and chaotic clouds, all of which are excellent models. Mei Qing, whose art name was Mei Shanshan, was famous for painting the Yellow Mountains, but Mei Qing's brushwork was plain, and his spirit was always insufficient. In recent times, Zhang Daqian has been able to capture the charm of the Yellow Mountains' three wonders, earning him the praise of the art world. In addition to Daqian, Qishi also likes to write about the Yellow Mountains and has a similar yet different approach to Daqian. Qishi is also skilled in calligraphy, painting, and seal carving. His calligraphy starts with the Second Emperors (Li Yu and Zhao Ji), incorporating the brushstrokes of Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Huang Tingjian, and Liu Gongquan, which are elegant and unrestrained and are also similar to Huang Tingjian. His seal carving takes from ancient seals, stele inscriptions, Qin imperial edicts, and bronze inscriptions, so his ancient carvings are solid and can be well matched with his calligraphy. Mr. Xiao Wuwuquan once commented on Wu Changshuo: "His painting is not as good as his calligraphy, and his calligraphy is not as good as his seal carving," but Qishi does not have that shortcoming.

### Chinese Painting in Europe and America – A Record of Zhang Yunggu's Speech

— Chen Lin

The Sino-British Cultural Association recently held an art evening at the Nanjing Clubhouse, attended by more than a hundred people from England, America, Holland, Canada, and other countries living in Nanjing. Professor Zhang Yunggu was specially invited to give a speech. Dr. Fitzgerald, the chairman, gave a speech introducing Zhang, saying that Zhang devoted himself to painting in his spare time, held exhibitions in North America in previous years, and lectured at New York University and other schools. Zhang's speech cited British poetry and prose to explain Chinese painting, and his language was very humorous. The following is a translation of a few points based on my recollection.

A rich man in Chicago, Mr. Gu, purchased a masterpiece of Chinese painting and praised its mystery and the brightness of its colors, showing it to everyone. Unexpectedly, the so-called masterpiece was actually an "ancestral portrait" used by ordinary families for ancestor worship. (According to exporters, before the war, a large number of ancestral portraits from our country were exported and sold to various cities in the United States.) Although the painting has its significance in terms of patterns and customs, it is ridiculous to represent Chinese painting with it and exaggerate it.

In fact, major art museums in Europe and America also have many exquisite Chinese paintings, such as the Admonitions Scroll by Gu Kaizhi's daughter in the British Museum and the court paintings of the Song Dynasty in the Boston Museum, which are extremely valuable. I once saw a long handscroll of autumn insects painted in color by Qian Xuan of the Yuan Dynasty in the Detroit Museum, which was truly a masterpiece. Not only were the forms vivid and lifelike, but the colors were also able to capture the truth. Biologists in that country said that the colors of grasshoppers and frogs in autumn change due to the change of seasons. It is truly rare that Chinese painters six hundred years ago could express them with such precision.

In a New York painting exhibition, a merchant once selected a Chinese album of flowers and birds, but did not like the flying birds, and only selected a painting of a fat, silly goose. Someone asked why he abandoned the small birds and chose the big goose. He replied that since the cost was the same, the fat goose was more solid and full, while the small birds were too small and insignificant. Judging from his tone, this person may have been a cook. Chinese painting emphasizes the sense of emptiness and spirituality in its composition, but foreigners who are concerned with every detail do not know such leisurely elegance.

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 193

— Ye Jingfeng

In the room, Yaoqun clearly read out the good news they had received, word by word. Even Hucheng now fully understood what was going on. Everyone's thoughts immediately produced a violent reaction, and they were all using their brains to plan the most appropriate way to respond. No one spoke first, so the whole room was silent.

"I'm sorry," Hejian finally broke the silence, walking towards Mr. W's huge desk and apologizing to Mr. W, "I'll just borrow a phone here for a moment." Before Hejian finished speaking, Mr. W had already handed the phone over the desk.

"Hello...Is that the Ping Office?" Hejian spoke in Japanese, "Oh, please let Director Songjing speak...Me?...Hejian Yu of the General Staff Headquarters...What? Gone out? Then please let Director Jiu Speaking?...Oh? Gone out too?...Oh, going to Fengtai?...Meeting? Okay, please let the Duty Director of the Secretariat speak...Huh...Then please let Vice Adjutant Sato speak...Okay!"

Having said this, Hejian put the phone receiver in his arms, closed the mouthpiece, and smiled coldly at us, "They're playing tricks again...Maybe they really went to a meeting?"

Mr. W nodded, pointing at Hejian's arms, indicating that he should pay attention to the phone.

"Hello?...I wouldn't dare, Hejian Yu...Is that Sato-kun?...Yes...I have something to ask you about. According to the report from my subordinates, your department, or maybe other intelligence agencies, has sent teams to concentrate here. I don't know what their target is...Oh?...It has nothing to do with your department...Then who is it?...Nakajima or Kawashima?...Oh, Nakajima?...To protect us?...What a joke, I dare not bother them!"

Hejian put down the phone, "After all this trouble, it's still a problem among brothers?" Hejian smiled coldly, the color on his face had changed, and he really seemed a little angry; "Okay, I should stand up and go forward!" Saying that, he looked at me again, "Brother Yue, let's see if we're going to have bad luck, even the 'Manchurian bitch' has come looking for us...Let's go!" Hejian was acting like a child throwing a tantrum.

"Urgent..." The building alarm sounded again, Yaoqun quickly read, "According to Fuzhong's report, the building has been surrounded on all sides, and the exit has been cut off...The assault troops have reached the Second Branch of the West District. Report received, awaiting orders to act...There has been contact in the hall...Urgent...All items in this building have been prepared according to the order!"

"Probably someone has already come in..." Hejian was very annoyed; because this kind of nameless "protection" hurt his dignity, and of course there must be other purposes inside. "Let's go down?" Hejian looked at us.

### Realism in Western Art History "Impressionist" Artists

— Shen Yan

The name "Impressionism" was a satirical name given by critics to the art exhibition of the "Nameless Society" held in 1874. This was because Monet's work "Impression, Sunrise" was exhibited at the exhibition, and the critics therefore called it "the exhibition of Impressionist artists." This name was later publicly recognized and became a term in art history. However, the content of Monet's "Impression, Sunrise" is actually more profound than the critics thought at the time, and in meaning, it represents Impressionism and symbolizes the life of Monet, the central figure of Impressionism. Monet's paintings are based on sunlight, air tones, and water surface as the main body of art. This kind of work depicting the morning mist shrouded in the water and the sun slowly rising really hints at the direction in which Monet's landscape paintings will develop.

For more than ten years before this exhibition, Monet had often gathered together with several like-minded writers. In 1863, he saw Edouard Manet's solo exhibition, which was quite inspiring, and paid special attention to Manet's "Luncheon on the Grass" and "Olympia." Manet's work, which caused a lot of controversy, was supported by young artists due to Baudelaire's defense, and this atmosphere finally developed into the exhibition of the "Nameless Society."

Manet was an artist who initially influenced Monet, but later was influenced by Monet. In terms of painting landscape systems, he stood in the position of the realist school that developed Courbet since the color standard. Although he joined the group of artists mentioned above and occupied a leading position for a period of time, he was by no means an Impressionist artist. He adopted the so-called "plein air" production attitude and did plein air sketches, which was after being influenced by Monet. However, Manet originally liked the brightness of external light and its rich colors, and hated the dim colors of Courbet. Although it belongs to the Courbet system, the use of color is the opposite. Therefore, it can be said that he is an artist between Courbet and Monet.

Manet's paintings, no matter in any corner of the picture, are full of bright colors; if the same painting method of expressing the brightness and darkness of light is used to supplement the lack of brilliance of the pigment itself, the shadow portion must be made particularly dark. Therefore, if you want to remove the dark color from the screen, you must also give the shadow a rich color. And use another technique in the expression of light. This tendency will inevitably lead to the "light description" of Impressionism.

"Impressionism" is not a school with a so-called "impressionism" painting theory. The artists belonging to this school all study according to their own artistic beliefs and their own techniques. Therefore, although the artists who are said to belong to this group have different painting styles or techniques. This point is very important for understanding the characteristics of Impressionism. It is also the main point to distinguish it from the so-called "Neo-Impressionism." As for the "Neo-Impressionism," there is no sound realism spirit, only an inferior imitation of "Impressionism."

### Two Matters in Japan

— Laoyan

My friend Mr. Xu has just returned from Japan. I invited him to drink somewhere and asked him about the recent situation there. He immediately talked about the following two things, which increased my feelings!

Since Japan surrendered the year before last, its domestic politics and economy have been controlled by MacArthur. Therefore, the restriction on light and heavy industries is very strict. Only people from victorious countries can apply to start a business. The Japanese had no choice but to shamelessly seduce the great Chinese nationals residing in their country, saying that they could apply in their names, and if the matter was successful and profitable, they would share the profits. The Chinese compatriots profited from their wealth and did not hesitate to sell their national character, and they applied for them one after another. It is not difficult to imagine how much they earned each month. Although MacArthur knew the ills, he did not investigate, but he would never tolerate it for the American people.

Mr. Xu's left neighbor is a Japanese family. He often went to chat when he was bored. He saw that the low table was missing a leg, which made it inconvenient to place things. After half a month, he was still the same, so he asked strangely. He said: "The carpenter has no time!" Mr. Xu clearly saw a carpenter Zhang next door, who was wandering around doing nothing, so he recommended Zhang to him. The owner replied: "The one recommended by you is a citizen of your country. What I said was that our own craftsman has no time."

Comparing the above two things, I wonder what my compatriots who often abandon their own goods and love foreign goods will think after reading this!

### "Pulling Dragon Firewood" - A Tale of Gold Mining in the Sea

— Tiandiren

Garbage, which Shanghai people consider to be annoying waste, is greeted with ecstasy by people in the countryside, who regard it as valuable fuel; because in this era of "expensive firewood," many shops in towns have changed to burning rice husks and other sundries due to the high price of firewood. Therefore, dried garbage is regarded as cheap and high-quality fuel.

From Longhua in the south to Sizui Point, the villagers along the shore gather in groups, men, women, old and young, to the foreshore after the tide recedes to rake garbage - they call it "pulling dragon firewood." The tools they use, in addition to a bamboo-toothed rake, include grass baskets, burlap sacks, reed bags, etc., to hold the garbage. Each time, they return fully loaded.

Driven by curiosity, I went to the foreshore one day to observe in person. I saw groups of "gold diggers," including hunchbacked old men and old women over sixty years old, boys and girls around ten years old who were of school age, and young and strong young men and women. They traveled back and forth on the cold Huangpu Beach, nervously raking the wet garbage with bamboo-toothed rakes, and piling it into their grass baskets, burlap sacks, or reed bags, and then carrying it back to dry.

Looking closely at the drying garbage, I saw rice straw, chicken feathers, rubber bands for bundling banknotes, corks for thermos bottles, rotten vegetable roots and leaves, and tattered scraps of paper...In short, bamboo heads and wood scraps, everything was available. Children, seeing it, were as if they were in the Grand View Garden, prostrate and picking up their toys, which was quite interesting.

After the garbage is dried, it is carried to the town and sold to teahouses, tofu shops, etc. At first, it was sold for two or three thousand yuan per load, but now it has been increased to five or six thousand yuan per load, and there are also some users who buy it in the countryside; the villagers rake all day, from fifty or sixty pounds to more than two hundred pounds, and each person has an income of two or three thousand yuan to more than 20,000 yuan per day. It is a small supplement to this rural sideline. It is said that the stronger the north wind, the more it blows, but at the same time it is colder. They would rather be attacked by the cold wind than want the wind to be calm. This abnormal psychology is both pitiful and sighable!

This kind of dried garbage is only suitable for kitchens with bellows. When burned, the firepower is quite strong, but because there are impurities in it that cannot be used as fuel, it is impossible to carefully select and pick them out, so they have to be burned in a mess. Therefore, when burning, strange noises are mixed together, and the stench is difficult to smell, but once you get used to it, you will be indifferent and not surprised.

Recently, it was reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution to allocate 450 million yuan to clear the accumulated garbage in the city. It is estimated that this accumulated garbage is no less than ten thousand tons. Where will so much garbage go? There are no garbage dumps and no garbage warehouses. Incinerate it? Not necessarily. The only way out is naturally to dump it into the sea, let it drift with the waves, and let it go. Fortunately, the "snow in front of the door" has been swept away, and he doesn't care about the "frost on the roof"! Once cleared out, I don't know how many tons will be destroyed by the villagers!

### Houseboats

— Jiang Yin

To solve the housing shortage problem, there is now another method in the United States, which is newly built small boats that can be used as houses. They are thirty-six feet long, have a forty-five horsepower engine, and a speed of seven miles per hour.

It is fireproof and rustproof, and also has durable wool to insulate it.

The boat has a lounge, dining room, bathroom, and kitchen. The lounge can be divided into two bedrooms if necessary. The kitchen is very well arranged, with a refrigerator, four wall cabinets, a washing basin, a stove, and a table.

The installed current is 110 volts, and its value is 9,990 US dollars.

### Taiwan Incident

— Liu Meng

I hope that the Taiwan incident can be resolved reasonably as soon as possible. Regardless of who is responsible for this incident, I hope that the civil and military officials who govern Taiwan can correct their past mistakes. I can't help but sincerely pray for this.

Because of this incident, I was reminded of the psychology of the Chinese people after the end of the Anti-Japanese War. I have never been to the rear, but I do not regret it. I have been doing things worthy of the country in the occupied land. Victory came, and like everyone in the occupied areas, I breathed a sigh of relief, with joy, extended a helping hand, and waited for a familiar handshake. But I was disappointed. We were discriminated against. The occupied area was like a happy land with terrible germs, and the people in the occupied area seemed to have been enjoying themselves during the Anti-Japanese War, and also seemed to be carrying terrible green germs. Of course, we used reserve notes, but 400 yuan of legal tender before the reserve notes was equivalent to one yuan of legal tender after the victory, but no one complained.

Planes brought discrimination from the rear: schools, institutions...in all kinds of places, people in the occupied areas were simply traitors! This mentality is wrong, and the actions based on this mentality are also wrong. If this mentality and style do not change for a long time, division and unrest are inevitable; the Taiwan incident is just an "example."

### A Scholar Visits the Soldiers

— Qilou

A certain day of a certain month was one of the rare years in our 4,500-year history of mutual slashing when we laid down the butcher knife. At that time, the world was peaceful, and several scholars in Qufu, Shandong, picked some pears from a pear tree that they believed to be the tree of truth, and went to visit the soldiers all over the country to preach the truth to them.

They formed two teams and set off in different directions. Now we are only talking about the journey of one team.

This group of scholars arrived at the border and were about to enter the territory of Jiangsu Province, but they were stopped by several soldiers guarding the tombs. The scholars said "That's great," they were just about to talk to the soldiers. So they took out the fruit of truth, but these fruits were not yet ripe. The soldiers took a bite and spit it out quickly. "Such a sour thing!"

The scholars fled from under the guns. When the frozen pears gradually ripened, they arrived in a large city. The prosperous scene made their hearts sway. That night, they touched the women on the road, and were caught by soldiers passing by. One of the clever scholars took out some fruits of truth and bought out everyone.

Walking south again, they arrived in a warm area. The soldiers here were undergoing demobilization training, which was indeed a peaceful scene. The scholars, holding a few rotten fruits, were welcomed to preach the truth.

Unexpectedly, at this time, another team of scholars also arrived. In order to compete for the seat, the two teams of scholars scolded each other, accusing each other of being fox spirits, determined that they were the true Taoist scholars, and used the few remaining rotten fruits as weapons to throw at each other. As a result, the soldiers who were training were also aroused by the enthusiasm for struggle and joined the battle. The butcher knife that had just been put down was raised again. And the rare peace disappeared in an instant.

The scholars were afraid of the war and fled back in different directions. When they arrived in Qufu, they inevitably made a report, which was considered an explanation. The report said how many soldiers they had met, and the later conflict between the two teams. They did not preach the truth to the soldiers. At that time, a historian (of course, also a scholar) felt that the text was too superficial, so he used the style of the Spring and Autumn Annals to write:

"When scholars meet soldiers, there is no way to reason."

### Talking About Yan Song and He Shen

— Aiju

Greed and extravagance are the most intense of evils, even more so than floods and fierce beasts. They not only harm the officialdom, harm society, harm the country, but also cause its destruction. Like Rong Qing and others mentioned above, they themselves cannot enjoy it for long, and will eventually be ruined and discredited. Yan Song of the late Ming Dynasty and He Shen of the former Qing Dynasty are examples. After Song was defeated, he was already eighty years old, and Shi Lou had been executed. Song became a beggar and died wandering. But even today, reading the Bingshanlu, Song's confiscated property, in addition to calligraphy, paintings, steles and rare items, even the gold items are colorful and dazzling. It is certainly not comparable to the confiscated property of various traitors in the anti-Japanese era. How can the stockpiling of gold bars and the purchase of large buildings be dreamed of by a huge greedy thief? As for He Kun, he was only a sedan chair lifter at the beginning. I don't know what words he used, but suddenly he was praised. At the end of Qianlong's reign, he was in a position to crown hundreds of officials. All provinces had to plunder and collect a share of any gifts. Sometimes it was even better than the tribute. It is said that Jiaqing accidentally broke a jadeite plate set in a certain hall at the end of Qianlong's reign, which was deeply loved by Emperor Gaozong. He searched all the major antique shops in Beijing, but could not find it. Someone jokingly suggested that He Shen had it, and repeatedly asked He Shen for it. It was only then that he obtained it, and it was even higher than the original Chen's item. He Shen has always been rude to the princes, and Jiaqing has been accumulating resentment for a long time. This time, he was ridiculed by He, and Jiaqing could not contain his anger. After Emperor Chun died, Jiaqing immediately confiscated it and put Shen to justice. The charges were obvious and recorded in the Donghualu. At that time, there was a rumor that He Shen fell and Jiaqing was full, and the stolen goods he greedily obtained were no less than the Bingshanlu. Alas! The lessons of Song and Shen are a warning. Why do the major officials who are robbing today, because of extravagant enjoyment, do their best to be greedy and take their own destruction? Does Shang Lai Zhen Fang follow this?

### Broaden Your Mind

— Yang Zhimin

"Life is a ruthless enemy, and the cost of living index is a powerful force to defend against the enemy's assaults." That's what we used to say, but what about now? Everyone knows that this powerful force has been completely defeated. In that case, from now on, we can only respectfully welcome the ruthless enemy to invade directly.

"Today no rice, tomorrow no firewood," this kind of mental anguish will come to us sooner or later. Therefore, when close friends meet, they all use the idiom "broaden your mind" as an excuse.

In order for us to truly achieve the state of "broadening our minds," the government must provide us with a stable life. To have a stable life, the first thing is that prices cannot continue to rise indiscriminately, and the rationed goods must have a fixed price, a fixed date, and possibly some leeway in time. Don't squeeze and jostle, causing people to feel unpleasant mentally. I think this should be a right that people within a possible scope deserve. Although this cannot be said to be a matter of "broadening our minds," in the hearts of us (the people), we will at least feel the government's kindness.

### Literary and Art World

The poet Xu Zhimo had two unpublished diaries and about thirty original poems and paintings inscribed by Tagore, Hu Shih, Yang Xingfo, Wen Yiduo, and others before his death. His wife, Ms. Lu Xiaoman, has now compiled them into a "Zhimo Diary," which will be included in the Chenguang Literary Series by Chenguang Publishing Company and will be published soon.

The twelfth of this month is Tian Han's fiftieth birthday and the thirtieth anniversary of his creative work. Chen Baichen and others have launched a grand celebration. In addition to inviting Guo Moruo and other drama figures to give speeches, there will also be Tian Han's drama recitations, improved Yue opera ballads, and other programs to add to the fun.

The National Central Library's journal has been reissued and is sold by Kaiming Bookstore. Subscriptions are not available for the time being. The first issue of the reissue contains works by He Changqun, Jiang Liangfu, Zhao Jingshen, and others.

The translator Geng Jizhi, who followed Zhang Jia'ao to the Northeast to serve as the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Chinese-Changchun Railway two years ago, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Shenyang on the second of this month. Geng's wife and children are all in Shanghai. Zhang Jia'ao is responsible for handling the funeral arrangements. (Jing Gu)

Guotai Bookstore, located at 115 Hankou Road (east of Jiangxi Road), lends out books, including academic research, magazines, scripts, etc., especially novels, for only over one hundred yuan per day. (Serving amateurs, office hours are from 1:00 PM to 5:30 PM daily.)

### Record of a City in Peril

— Qin Shouou

As soon as he left, the female guest cried even more fiercely. Although she could not bear his abuse, her habit of not being independent made her feel that she had to rely on Xiao Shen. Once Xiao Shen left, abandoning her, what would she do? In her heart, in these times of war and chaos, it was impossible to survive without a man to lean on.

"Ah! You two have really made a mess of things!" Lu Qian couldn't help but sigh again.

"What are you afraid of? If Jin wants to go with us, then we'll take her!" The older child playing the harmonica said without thinking.

"Really! What's there to be afraid of? Apart from the dozen or so people from the People's Education Center, we're only a little over twenty people together. What difference does it make if we add Jin?" Several older children who didn't know the immensity of it all said this.

The former was angry. Jin just cried.

"Don't be afraid! Miss Jin, at worst, you can perform with us in the play!" One of the girls tried her best to comfort this pitiful woman.

"I...I...can't..." she replied, with a sob in her voice.

"Then you can do some work in our theater troupe."

"I...I...also don't...know how to read..."

This made the enthusiastic young ladies feel embarrassed! They hadn't seen much of the world and had never thought that in this day and age, there were still women who were dressed very fashionably, but were actually incapable of doing anything, and lived like parasites all year round.

"That doesn't matter, let her cook for us, that's also useful!" The older child playing the harmonica stubbornly said.

"But, Zhang Chang, even we don't know how to leave!" Lu the cripple showed a look of anxiety. "Ah! You guys mean well, but don't harm Miss Jin..."! Someone wanted to interrupt him, but he waved his hand and said painfully, "She and Xiao Shen are doing business, they have plenty of transportation, and they might be able to go tomorrow or the day after. But what about us? Of course, we don't want to leave now, but when it really comes time to leave, do you think we'll have a car? Ah! Look! The troops being transferred to the front lines for reinforcements have to walk barefoot, how can there be transportation for us?"

Miss Jin cried even more sadly.

"Old Lu is always pessimistic!" Several people said this. "If we don't have trucks, can't we squeeze onto a train?"

"Okay, everyone, watch and see!" Lu Qian said helplessly, and finally wanted to sigh again, but before he could, someone they had been waiting for for a long time walked in from outside the door.

More than twenty voices shouted in unison: "Old Zhu! Old Zhu!" (8)
