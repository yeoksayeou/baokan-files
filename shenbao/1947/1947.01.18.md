### Government Expects Peace Talks to Reopen: Yan'an's Reply Has Not Yet Arrived in Nanjing, Zhang Zhizhong Paid Respects to the Chairman Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The government, hoping that peace negotiations can reopen soon, has repeatedly expressed concessions and has also agreed to a new proposal. It also plans to send Zhang Zhizhong and others to Yan'an immediately. After the matter was notified to the CCP by the ambassador, all eyes are focused on the CCP's reply. As of the evening of the 17th, the CCP office stated that they had not yet received a reply telegram. Certain influential figures, analyzing the current domestic and international situation, observed that the CCP may have a new expression regarding whether these peace talks can be reopened, believing that there are more optimistic elements for the future. As for Zhang Zhizhong himself, in addition to expressing yesterday his hope that more representatives could be sent to Yan'an, he paid respects to the Chairman on the morning of the 17th to discuss matters. In the evening, he took advantage of Yu Youren's banquet to talk with Shao Lizi for a long time.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Regarding the government's plan to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an, after the ambassador notified the CCP, the CCP wired Yan'an on the 16th for instructions. Currently, they are awaiting a reply telegram, and the government is also waiting for this reply. Zhang himself stated that he is happy to accept the government's mission.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The ambassador's personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, visited Zhang Zhizhong at nine o'clock on the morning of the 17th. It is reported that Fu expressed that the U.S. hopes the government will focus on the content of the negotiations, not only creating an atmosphere of peace talks, but also actually ensuring that the opinions of both the KMT and the CCP can be brought closer.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The date of Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Yan'an depends on the CCP's reply. Zhang stated that the CCP's response may be to send representatives to Nanjing again to reopen peace talks. If so, he will terminate his trip to Yan'an. The government will not announce the new peace proposal for the time being. He also said that if he goes to Yan'an, another senior government official will accompany him, but he did not specify whether it would be Zhang Jun or Shao Lizi. He only expressed optimism about the future of the negotiations personally.

[Another Dispatch] Wang Bingnan stated that the peace proposals were telegraphed to Yan'an on the 16th, but it is not known when a reply from Yan'an can be received. It is believed that the government will only be able to reply after the leaders in Yan'an have received them. Qualified politicians here believe that Yan'an will not refuse Zhang's flight to Yan'an.

[Our Report] Relevant sources stated that reopening peace talks is still in the exploratory stage. It is expected that the CCP will not firmly reject peace talks, otherwise it will bear the infamous reputation of sabotaging peace talks. However, reopening peace talks is easy, but achieving peace is difficult. Everything still requires patience. The government representatives only presented the main items of the peace proposal this time in Shanghai, without specifying the detailed methods, fearing that secrets would be leaked, hindering the progress of peace talks. In fact, some key points in the proposal may still await the final instructions of the highest authorities.

The British government urgently hopes that both sides can comply with the Sino-Soviet Treaty on the agreement on Dalian.

### Minister Yu Attends the People's Political Council to Report on Foreign Exchange and Other Issues; Attending Councilors Raise Questions One After Another

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Council held its 13th meeting at 9 a.m. on the 17th and invited Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun to report on foreign exchange and related issues. More than ten resident councilors, including Wu Yifang, attended. After Chairman Mo Dehui announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Shao Lizi read a written diplomatic report, followed by Minister Yu's report, which detailed: (1) the foreign exchange issue, (2) the national budget for this year, (3) the issue of remittances from overseas Chinese, and (4) the issue of tax system adjustments. Minister Yu's report focused on past measures and future prospects. After the report, councilors Wu Chunwu, Wang Puhan, Zheng Kuiyi, Qian Gonglai, Fan Yusui, Su Yun, Lin Hu, Zuo Juesheng, Luo Heng, Peng Gechen, Yin Shuxian, Gan Jiawu, Xi Yueduo, and Dapusheng raised questions. Almost all of the attending councilors, except Wu Yilao, spoke. They all believed that the national financial crisis today is very deep and worrying. The current state of domestic war continues, and fighting a war with banknotes is very dangerous. They pointed out that the mismanagement of foreign exchange, the huge disparity between official and black market prices, and the constant fluctuations in gold and U.S. dollars are stimulating rising prices. They especially hoped that the issue of remittances from overseas Chinese could be improved, otherwise the remittances would completely evade Hong Kong and foreign banks. Zuo Juesheng painfully stated that the current situation is extremely serious. On the one hand, the lack of peace in the country has created an economic crisis; on the other hand, the deep financial crisis affects domestic peace. But if this continues to drag on, the economic future is worrying. Peng Gechen and others pointed out that those who manage foreign exchange are buying up foreign exchange, causing the government to suffer losses, corrupt officials to make money, and the people to suffer. Finally, councilor Dapusheng hoped to benefit the country and eliminate abuses, and promote the realization of the opinions provided by the councilors. Mo Dehui also hoped that Mr. Yu would convey the opinions of the councilors to President Zhu Ziven. Minister Yu answered the above questions separately.

(3) Zheng Kuiyi et al. proposed to request the government to improve the absorption of remittances from overseas Chinese, and it was decided to submit to the government for reference. (4) Wu Chunwu et al. requested the government to instruct the Nanjing Municipal Government to quickly repair the streets and improve lighting, and it was decided to submit to the government for quick and effective handling.

### Sino-British Commercial Treaty Still Awaiting Consultation; Our Side Has Submitted a Counter-Proposal; Inland Navigation and Residence of Overseas Chinese Are the Main Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] In the Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations, our side has submitted a counter-proposal, which is currently being studied by the British side. It is reported that the main issues are inland navigation and residence. Our attitude is that the ships of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson can no longer navigate in our inland rivers, while the British side has discriminatory regulations regarding the residence of our overseas Chinese in their three islands, autonomous regions, or India, which are not as fair as the American approach. It is feared that considerable time for consultation will still be needed before both sides make a final decision.

### China Democratic Socialist Party's Views on Peace Talks: Both Sides Must Implement "Returning the Military to the Nation and Returning Politics to the People" Before the Key to Peace Talks Can Be Resolved

[Central News Agency, This City] The China Democratic Socialist Party yesterday issued its views on the peace talks, stating:

Our party places endless hope on the recent resumption of peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

Recalling that the reason why the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have failed to succeed in peace talks over the years is that the biggest reason is that each has its own military force. On the one hand, they are suspicious of each other, thinking that the other party has the ambition to eliminate me; on the other hand, each claims to be the best, thinking that I have the opportunity to eliminate the other party. If this continues in the future, I am afraid that peace talks will never succeed. However, our party still places endless hope on this peace talk, because "returning the military to the nation and returning politics to the people" has become a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have acknowledged that this must be implemented. Our party hopes that the Kuomintang will start with itself. At present, the boundary between the party and the government in the central government has not been clearly defined. It can also be said that the party is above the government, the army belongs to the party, and the government is directed by the party. Now, in order to eliminate the Communist Party's suspicion, the only way is for the Kuomintang to truly and practically return the military to the nation, active servicemen completely withdraw from the party, and the Kuomintang retreats to the ranks of ordinary political parties. At the same time, returning politics to the people will eliminate the Communist Party's suspicion that the government and the Kuomintang are one and the same. If so, the Kuomintang can openly and honestly ask the Communist Party to return the military to the nation, and the key to peace talks can be resolved.

It is heard that the Communist Party insists on restoring the situation before January 13. Assuming that the Communist Party also returns the military to the nation, and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party do not divide the country, then there is no distinction between before and after January 13 for the national army to be stationed in the common territory. At the same time, the Communist Party opposes the National Assembly and the Constitution it has passed, but the Constitution it has passed is based on the Political Consultative Conference Constitution and should be recognized by all parties. Even if there are disagreements, they can be revised by submitting amendment articles when the next meeting is held. Since the Kuomintang has returned politics to the people, it is not only opening up the central government, but also the local government should be opened up at the same time. Why must the Communist Party necessarily divide a certain place as the Communist Party's regime and a certain place as the regime other than the Communist Party? Because they are in the same country, under the same legal system and the same political system, can they become a country. If the above is true, then returning the military to the nation and returning politics to the people, and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party striving to implement them in good faith, is democracy, is peace. If peace and democracy can be achieved, the country will naturally be unified and naturally strong. Otherwise, each possessing its own party's army and exercising its own party's regime is anti-democracy. If it is anti-democracy, there can be no peace, no unification. The true meaning of democracy lies not in the propaganda of words, but in the manifestation of facts. The crystallization of peace talks lies here, and the spirit of reorganizing the government lies here.

Today, the national situation is extremely critical, the economy is collapsing, and the country is about to perish. What is so important that they cannot abandon suspicion and return to good relations?

Our party is impartial to both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. We hope that both parties can truly and practically return the military to the nation and return politics to the people, jointly creating a fair and just rule-of-law government that transcends all parties, and will naturally be supported by the people of the whole country. The foundation of a thousand words and ten thousand words of peace talks must be this. If so, they will wake up. If so, it will be success. This humble intention is entirely to plead for the lives of the dying people. May the people of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party accept it.

### Peking University Female Student Rape Case: US Military Tribunal Opens Trial, Continues Today, Ms. Shen Decides to Appear in Court

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] The case of the American soldier raping Peking University student Shen Chong was publicly tried at 9:00 AM on the 17th, and continued on the 18th. The victim, Ms. Shen, appeared in court on the 18th as a witness.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The US Marine Corps First Division stationed in China organized a military tribunal to publicly try the case of American soldier Corporal Williams Pearson's atrocities against Peking University student Shen Chong in the Dongdan drill ground on December 24, 1946, at 9:00 AM on the 17th. The military tribunal was composed of a presiding judge and six military judges, with Lieutenant Colonel Hughes as the presiding judge. At the opening of the court, prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Fitz Gerald attended with an assistant, and the defendant's defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel Muster (the Fifth Regiment's Chief of Staff), also attended with an assistant. Pearson, as allowed by American law, sat on the lower side of the defense attorney. The court also had two clerks and three translators. The court was originally scheduled to open at 9:00 AM on the 17th, but was delayed until 9:30 AM for some reason. According to bystanders, those present included the defendant's guardian Shen Shao (Ms. Shen's father), Peking University President Hu Shi, Yang Zhenqing (Shen's cousin), Shen Chong's legal advisors Li Shitong and Zhao Fengjie, Zuo Mingzheng, Director of the Municipal Foreign Affairs Office, Meng Zhaoying, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau, Lu Bindong, Secretary of the Foreign Affairs Office, Zhang Shuxian, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, Ji Yuan, Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, representatives of the 19th Regiment of the Military Police, and 27 Chinese and foreign reporters.

Judges Swear to Faithfully Perform Duties, Announce Five Counts of Defendant's Crimes

The trial dates are the 17th and 18th. The trial time today is from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 1:15 PM to 2:40 PM. The trial began with the presiding judge. All judges and clerks swore to faithfully perform their duties according to law, and then the prosecutor announced the opening of the court. (Central News Agency Note: According to the regulations of the American military tribunal, the prosecutor conducts the examination, and the victim is also one of the witnesses. The presiding judge is in a neutral position. Each witness being examined must be led by the presiding judge to swear an oath to express their willingness to tell the whole truth about the facts, otherwise they will be subject to legal sanctions). The prosecutor read the indictment, announcing five counts of the defendant's crimes: (1) Rape, (2) Coercive Rape, (3) Fornication, (4) Violation of Military Discipline, (5) Offense Against Public Morality. According to the investigation of the above five counts, among them, items 2, 3, 4, and 5, there are no appropriate equivalent terms in our country's laws. The translations of items 2, 4, and 5 are similar, but their meanings are not entirely the same as our laws. As for the third item, there is no suitable term to follow. According to the detailed explanation in the World Standard English-Chinese Dictionary, the word "Fornication" means "(direct sexual behavior between unmarried men and women)". Its legal meaning is also different from the ordinary dictionary. The translation of this agency is for reference only and should be based on the original text. After the reading, the defendant was questioned. The defendant denied committing the first, second, fourth, and fifth crimes, saying that although the third item could be admitted, it was only a response to the examination in the military tribunal and could not be admitted in the civil court.

Witnesses Testify in Succession, Recounting What They Witnessed

The prosecutor then successively summoned the witnesses. After each witness completed their testimony, the presiding judge asked the witness three questions: (1) Is there anything else you want to say? (2) If there is anything unclear in the court, you can explain it. (3) The situation in the court must not be directly or indirectly told to others. The witnesses who were summoned were: (1) Captain McNeir (Intelligence Officer of the Fifth Regiment of the US Marine Corps) presented a map of the scene of the incident involving the American soldiers. (2) Meng Zhaojie (Apprentice of the Motor Vehicle Repair Class of the Eleventh War Zone), who was the first eyewitness, said that at 8:30 PM on December 24th last year, he bought cigarettes in front of the Ping'an Cinema on East Chang'an Street and witnessed two American soldiers carrying a woman to the woods opposite the Ping'an Cinema. The woman was crying, so he invited colleagues Zhao Yuhua, Zhao Zetian, Ma Wenbin, and Qiang Zhixin. Two of the five people held flashlights. They saw an American soldier and the female student under the root of the wall in the South Dadi area from a distance of twenty feet. Another American soldier was about two feet away from them. They then returned to report to the two inspectors who were inspecting the Ping'an Cinema. The seven people went to watch again, but were driven away by the American soldiers. They then left and the five of them reported to the patrol at the south entrance of Wangfu that there was a woman crying at the location. After the prosecutor finished questioning, the defendant's defense attorney asked the same questions with similar results. Meng replied that he went to watch because he heard the woman crying in front of the Ping'an Gate. The situation of the American soldier's atrocities at that time was also as described above. The light at the location of the American soldier was dim, with no moonlight and no wind. (3) Qiang Zhixin (same occupation as Meng) testified that the situation of the American soldier's atrocities at that time was similar to Meng's. He saw an American soldier assaulting them and snatching a pistol from an inspector. (4) Ma Wenbin (Assistant of the Repair Class of the Eleventh War Zone) testified that he could not recognize the faces of the American soldiers at night. The glove he found when he returned to the lawn for the third time was picked up by Zhao Zetian. Other testimony was the same as Meng's. (5) Zhao Zetian (same occupation as Meng) testified that he and Meng were stopped by an American soldier for the third time in South Dadi. He recognized the glove in court and said that there was blood and dirt on the glove at that time. He heard the woman crying, but did not hear them talking. (6) Tang Wenhua (Private First Class of the Garrison Headquarters, i.e., inspector) testified that the American soldier who pushed them away had snatched his .38 caliber pistol. (7) Wang Tong (Sergeant of the Second Team of the Police Bureau's Patrol Brigade, transferred to the Garrison Department's military camp for joint unified patrol service) testified that he saw an American soldier and a woman being driven away by another American soldier with a flashlight. He also said that because of the language barrier, he did not force them. (8) Guan Dehou (First Class Police Officer of the Inner Seventh Branch) testified that at 10:30 PM that night, he received a report and went to investigate the matter. He heard a woman crying in South Dadi. When he approached, he saw an American soldier and a woman lying on the ground. He ordered the American soldier to get up in Mandarin. The American soldier responded with rude words. He grabbed the crazy people and protected the woman. At that time, the American soldier tried to hug the woman, but the woman hid behind him. Guan also testified that in addition to finding the American soldier and the woman because of the crying, he also saw a white object moving. At that time, the location was northeast of the empty room in East Dadi, 70 to 80 steps away from Hademen Street. After the American soldier found it, he reported it to the patrol car of the Sino-American Liaison Office in Dongdan. Guan finished the questioning and it was 12:00 PM. Break.

Ms. Shen's Spirit Was Stimulated, Holding Pants, Saying She Was Raped

The public trial continued at 1:15 PM in the afternoon. Hu Shi and He Siyuan did not attend to observe due to official business. (1) Liu Shangzhi (Battalion Sergeant of the 13th Company of the Security Police Team) testified that the American soldier was irritable and had a bad attitude. When he tried to escape, he blocked him with a gun. At that time, the woman was standing behind Guan, holding a white object in her hand. When he asked the woman, he knew it was her pants, so he told her to put them on. The woman told him that she had been raped. Cai Shaoming (Foreign Affairs Inspector of the Sino-American Liaison Office) then ordered her to put them on. The woman told him that she had been raped. (2) Cai Shaoming (Foreign Affairs Inspector of the Sino-American Liaison Office) testified that at about 10:30 (because he did not have a watch at the time), he was stopped by police officer Guan Dehou and others in the first patrol car in Dongdan, reporting that two American soldiers were carrying a Chinese woman and raping her in the field. They went together. At that time, they saw that the woman was wearing a dark coat, unbuttoned, with dirt on her clothes, face, and nose. Because her coat was unbuttoned, her clothes were disheveled and her hair was also disheveled. The back of her coat was damp and her expression seemed to be mentally stimulated. The woman claimed to be a "student of Peking Women's University" and her surname was Shen. Later, because of mental stimulation, she could not speak anymore. The American soldier was wearing a uniform coat and was empty-handed. In addition, Guan and others reported that they also picked up a glove with blood and dirt on it. Therefore, it was the jurisdiction of Zhang Yingjun, a clerk of the Second Patrol Army, so after Zhang arrived, he handed the case over to Zhang and others for handling. The defendant's defense attorney strictly asked whether he saw tear stains on Ms. Shen's face. He replied that he did not see them at the scene of the incident because the light was dim, but he saw tear stains on Ms. Shen's face when he went to the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters where the light was sufficient. The report to the U.S. Military Police Headquarters and Zhang Clerk was based on the report of Guan and others, and its content was the same. At this point, the presiding judge announced that the trial would continue at 9:00 AM on the 18th. [Central News Agency Note: The testimony in this manuscript is a stenographic record of the court hearing. If there are any errors, the court records should be used as the standard.] (End)

### Communist Army's Continuous Fierce Attacks Fail, Situation in Southern Shandong Becomes Deadlocked, Zaozhuang is Fortified, Jinxiang is Also Stable

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] The situation in Southern Shanxi is gradually becoming deadlocked. The battle for Zaozhuang was still fierce yesterday, but there were no major changes in the positions of both sides. Also, after Liu Bocheng of the Communist Army of Shanxi led 100,000 of his men to attack Jinxiang and were defeated, there are still battles taking place on the outskirts of Jinxiang. Zhang Taisheng's troops, who attacked Yongcheng, retreated on the 16th.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] The Communist Army's offensive against Zaozhuang reached its peak on the 13th. Part of the Communist Army rushed to the outside of the Zaozhuang city moat on the afternoon of the 13th and engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the defending army, but was immediately driven back by the defending army. Because the Communist Army suffered heavy casualties, its morale is increasingly disintegrating, and they are all tired of war. Therefore, although the Communist Army continues to advance, it is ultimately at the end of its strength. At present, not only are we fully confident of holding Zaozhuang, but the situation in Southern Shandong will definitely take a sharp turn for the better in two or three days. There has been no major contact on the Linzi branch line and the Hezhao branch line in recent days, and the situation on the outskirts of Jinxiang is also stable.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] Today, the fighting in Southern Shandong has eased, and Taizao is also becoming stable. The Communist Army near the Zaozhuang coal mine was repelled by the National Army at noon on the 17th, and the situation in Taierzhuang is also calm.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th] The Communist Army attacking Zaozhuang launched another large-scale attack at dusk on the 16th, and bombarded the National Army's positions with mortars and other heavy fire, and the battle was extremely fierce for a time, and gradually subsided after midnight.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th] (1) Zaozhuang is still firmly defended by the National Army on the 17th. The continuous charges made by the Communist Army against the area have failed. The battle for Qicun in the west of the village is unfolding fiercely. (2) The situation in Jinxiang has not changed. (3) The Communist Army attacking Yongcheng is still suppressed in the Dawangzhu area, fifty miles west of the city.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] It is reported that after the National Army recovered Zahe, the remnants of the Communist Army retreated to Jiwan. However, this morning, the Communist Army harassed Zao again, attempting to threaten Suqian again, and the National Army repelled them. The Dasizhuang and Kongjiazhuang areas between Taixing and Taixian are occasionally harassed by the Communist Army. Wu Hou, the magistrate of Taixing County, went to Huangqiao with more than 30 troops yesterday to appease the Communist Army near Huangqiao.

### Communist Army on the Outskirts of Jilin and Changchun is at the End of Its Strength, Fierce Fighting on the Dehui-Huadian Line, Damaged Railway Bridge Under Repair

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Changchun Telephone: Zheng Dongguo came to Changchun by car due to snow, arriving at 10:00 PM on the 16th. According to him, the Communist Army's current offensive is obviously launching a part of its main force. Although the Communist Army is attacking, it is building works on the north bank of the Songhua River. In addition, it is cold and freezing, and it is not a time for military action.

### UNRRA Work-for-Relief Conference Concludes, Huo Director's Closing Remarks Read by Lu Guangmian, Hoping Everyone Will Work Hard, Be Optimistic, and Proactive

[Our City News] The UNRRA work-for-relief conference continued for five days. Yesterday afternoon, after the final meeting, a closing ceremony was held. Director Huo was unable to stay for a long time due to business, and Vice Director Zheng presided over the ceremony on his behalf. First, Secretary-General Lu Guangmian delivered a speech, summarizing and reviewing the progress of the conference and expressing his gratitude to the representatives for their hard work. He hoped that all departments would strengthen their connections in the future to further improve work efficiency. He also read Director Huo's closing remarks, which roughly stated: "The work-for-relief conference has now come to a successful conclusion, and I am very pleased. I would also like to express my gratitude to General Egerton and the colleagues of UNRRA. The focus of this meeting is to discuss how to change from direct relief to work-for-relief and assist refugees in gaining self-reliance. After this meeting, the headquarters and sub-headquarters should be able to obtain closer connections. Whatever must be completed, we will immediately plan to carry it out and promote its realization, so as to provide assistance to the people and carry out construction work for the country. During this conference, I am very pleased that representatives from all parties came to Shanghai to participate and assist millions of unemployed refugees in restoring their productive capacity in a cooperative manner. Our assistance is temporary, because we enable them to obtain permanent productive capacity. During the conference, many technical issues were raised by all parties. Some have been resolved and some have been reserved temporarily. The headquarters hopes to resolve them in the shortest possible time. After you all return to your original places, I hope you will not forget the purpose of the work, which is to assist the people and is not temporary, but permanent. Therefore, it is necessary to consider methods so that the people to be rescued can become self-reliant. UNRRA's relief materials to China will gradually decrease in the future. We must prepare to use limited materials to relieve the huge number of disaster victims, so we must strengthen connections to complete the mission. I hope everyone will work hard, be optimistic, and proactive. Our work is an extremely important work, and it does not end here, but requires permanent effort."

Following Vice Director Zheng's speech, a representative of the members gave a reply. After the whole group took a photo, the meeting adjourned.

### Changchun Military Mediation Sub-department, Communist Personnel Suspend Work, Radio Station Also Closed

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] The Changchun military authorities notified the Changchun sub-department of the Military Mediation Department yesterday that Communist Party personnel would suspend work immediately and that the Communist Party's radio station would be closed.

Editorial

### The Shanghai Municipal Budget Problem

The first session of the Shanghai Municipal Council can be said to be a major conference focused on discussing the municipal budget for the 36th year. However, after nine days of meetings, it was still impossible to balance the budget due to a large deficit in income and expenditure. How to increase revenue and reduce expenditure requires detailed discussion and cannot but be temporarily extended for several days from the 15th to await further research by the various subcommittee review committees. We certainly hope that the Municipal Council can find a way to make up for the budget deficit from an extremely difficult environment, while taking into account both the burden on citizens and the needs of municipal administration.

In all fairness, the total budget of over 230.08 billion for the Shanghai Municipal 36th year, plus the 20 billion for adjusting living subsidies, is no less than 250 billion. At first glance, it seems very large, but compared with the 75 billion in the second half of the 35th year, the 36th year should be doubled to 151 billion. The current figure is only 60% higher than this number, which cannot be said to be excessive compared with the general price increase. However, the important issue is not whether this number is necessary, but the following three points: (1) Can the citizens afford this number? (2) How can the burden on citizens be fair? (3) How should the city government use its revenue?

We believe that, first of all, it seems that the Shanghai market is declining, industry and commerce are depressed, taxes are heavy, and the people are miserable, with great suffering. In fact, most of the burden on Shanghai citizens is on the central treasury. For example, even in terms of direct taxes and commodity taxes, the burden on Shanghai citizens in one month, although there are no accurate statistics at hand, is probably greater than their burden on the municipal treasury for the entire year. Land tax and business tax were local taxes before the war, but according to the current financial income and expenditure system appendix, the central government still has to take 40% or 30% of these taxes. Therefore, the reason why the burden on Shanghai citizens is heavy is more than 90% for the country. We are by no means suggesting that citizens can pay less tax to the central government, but we cannot but point out that the burden on citizens for local municipal administration cannot be said to have exceeded the limit. Moreover, the responsibility for the formation of the situation of declining markets and depressed industry and commerce should be attributed to what party and is the result of what policy. Although opinions vary from person to person, it cannot be said that the municipal authorities should bear the sole responsibility. Frankly speaking, if this number of 250 billion is calculated at 8,000 times the general price level before the war, it is only worth 30 million before the war. Even if Shanghai citizens are becoming increasingly poor, they may not necessarily be unable to bear the burden. However, the burden on citizens must be fair, and the income from municipal taxes must be used appropriately, with one penny collected and one penny used.

Then we want to discuss the second point: To make the burden on citizens nearly fair, we must first advocate that the central government should immediately adopt the suggestion of the Municipal Council and, at a time when Shanghai's post-war vitality is declining and the central government has taken over a large number of materials, restore the system where local taxes before the war were entirely used by the local government, and no longer withdraw 40% from land price tax and 30% from business tax, so that the municipal treasury can be slightly less strained. According to the original budget proposal submitted by the municipal government, the funds for these two withdrawals should have reached 20 billion. Moreover, according to the estimates of the budget subcommittee of the Municipal Council, both taxes can still increase by more than 30 billion. If the estimate is not far from the truth, then the municipal treasury's revenue can be increased by 50 billion. In other words, it is reasonable to slightly reduce the burden on citizens to the central government and slightly increase their burden on local municipal administration. Secondly, since entertainment tax and banquet tax are local taxes, the tax rate should be determined by the local government through the resolution of local public opinion organs. In a society like Shanghai, where extravagance is commonplace, if the tax rate is adapted to local conditions, there is plenty of room to consider re-grading these two types of taxes, and the provisions of the highest amount should be determined according to the degree of excessive luxury. On the one hand, we want to promote a simple and plain new life, but on the other hand, the central government legislates to limit the tax collection method that can imply prohibition, which is really a pity. Finally, we believe that the municipal construction donation and the public utilities surcharge for municipal construction donation, although these two types of donations and taxes are local special taxes in this city, in terms of their collection targets, standards, and methods, rather than being harsh taxes, they are no less than good taxes. As long as the tax rate is appropriately stipulated and the rent is accurately estimated, it is most fair to make citizens with certain living abilities determine the amount of their burden on municipal expenses according to the level of their burden on rent. Moreover, the tax collection procedures are simple, the administrative expenses are small, and it is more beneficial to the municipal treasury. We want to advise the Municipal Council that, when reviewing, just be selfless, appeal to reason, and then the wise decision can be understood by the citizens. As for the national compulsory labor substitution fee, that is a special provision based on the National Compulsory Labor Law. Its meaning is not so much in the "substitution fee" as in "compulsory labor." Compulsory labor should be a commendable policy during the post-war construction period in China, which can only be proud of its "abundant manpower." However, this should not be regarded as a problem of making up for the budget. We are willing to write another article to discuss it.

The third point is the central issue, which is to ask: How is the city government's tax revenue distributed and used? We have generally observed the discussions of the Municipal Council and the opinions of the general public, and we are not necessarily shocked by the huge total budget, but we deeply regret the excessive number of redundant personnel and parallel agencies, resulting in a disproportionate ratio of administrative expenses to business expenses. If the municipal authorities can see the depths of the citizens' hearts, adhere to the spirit of "like what the people like," and, with the support of the Municipal Council, make a firm decision to adjust the organization and eliminate redundant personnel, it is better to pay more and use fewer people than to use more people and pay less. Using one person has the use of one person, and doing one day has the merit of one day, and greatly changing the phenomenon of layered institutions and cumulative personnel that has occurred since the autumn and winter of the previous year, then the citizens will be deeply aware that most of the taxes they pay are used for the cause they look forward to and need. The psychological comfort will be indescribable. As long as the city government collects taxes and makes progress day by day, the roads will not be uneven, the ditches will not be filled with sewage, the garbage will not pile up, the feces will not be visible, the traffic will not be blocked, the schools will not refuse to accept school-age children, and the registration of land documents will not be delayed for several months. Such facilities that citizens look forward to and need, with the efforts of necessary employees, will be promoted and realized one by one, instead of using most of the citizens' taxes for the living expenses of employees and the administrative expenses of the agency. We believe that the Shanghai municipal budget can be passed by the Municipal Council and can also be understood by the city's 4 million citizens.

### Under Public Opinion Supervision, Longhai Railway Vigorously Rectifies, Cleans Up Vehicles, and Strengthens East Section Transportation

[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou News] The Longhai Railway is one of the main transportation lines in the country. Since the restoration, due to the imperfect road facilities, everything has been simplified, which has been criticized by merchants and travelers. In particular, the two overturns at Jiaokou last year have aroused social dissatisfaction. Lu Futing, director of the railway administration, was dismissed because of this. Recently, under the supervision of public opinion, the bureau has vigorously rectified, and the road administration has improved day by day. Regarding the renovation of bridges and tunnels on the entire line, due to material problems, it is not possible to start construction on all of them. The first step is to repair the bridges along the river to ensure the safety of travelers. This work has now begun, and the project is progressing very smoothly. It is expected that Bridge No. 8 can be rebuilt by the end of April of this year, and the Black Stone Pass Bridge can be completed before the end of June. As for the Zhongmou Bridge, there is no obstacle to the Huayuan driving. In addition, in order to save transfer time, once the above projects are completed, not only will the entire line be unobstructed, but also night driving will be unimpeded. In addition, in order to save transfer time and make it convenient for merchants and travelers, it is also planned to lay seven tracks across Zhengzhou, and the project is under measurement. Regarding strengthening transportation, the most difficult thing at present is the east section. Prices west of Kaifeng are therefore rising sharply. In order to solve this difficulty, the bureau is rapidly clearing accumulated vehicles, trying to vacate the occupied space at each station on the entire line, and quickly repairing those that are damaged, so that the surplus vehicles can be allocated to stations east of Zhengzhou. On the one hand, it will lease two locomotives from the Jinpu Railway Bureau to restore the Longhai-Jinpu combined transportation and strengthen the east section transportation. In addition, the bureau has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to find a way to allocate locomotives to meet the needs. In addition, the year-end bonus for employees of the railway in the 35th year has been stipulated by the Ministry of Communications to be issued at half a month's salary for December. The railway bureau follows the Ministry's year-end bonus issuance method, stipulating that those who have served until the end of December for six months will receive the full amount, those who have served for three months will receive half of the amount, those who have served for more than one month but less than three months will receive one-quarter of the amount, and those who have served for less than one month will not receive it. The standard of this bonus, before the announcement of the new treatment, will be temporarily issued according to the average of the total amount of the treatment in December of the 35th year (including living subsidies, salary increases, and an additional 30%, etc.).

[Report from our Dangtu correspondent] In Xijie, Bowen Township, in this county, gunshots suddenly rang out late at night on the first of this month, causing panic among the people of the town.

That evening, Zhang's entire family went to Shijia Village to mill rice, leaving only Zhang's mother at home.

The next afternoon, at 6:00 PM, Zhang Minggui's sister-in-law went to the township office to negotiate with Chen, the township head, for compensation for her son's medical expenses for his injuries.

### A Suggestion from a Young Person Who Has Dropped Out of School

We are a group of young people who have already started working but have dropped out of school. In today's society, "qualifications" and "knowledge" are exceptions, but this will eventually be eliminated. We are aware that our knowledge is too shallow to be of use to us, and because we do not have "qualifications," we do not have the opportunity to develop. Aren't we, these young people playing this role, finished? Therefore, we demand that a night middle school, night university, treat night school students with the same qualifications and status as regular middle and university students. To satisfy our desire for knowledge and the qualifications of middle and university graduates, we hope that this demand will be realized. Please come forward to support those who feel the same way, and ask the members of the council to speak out for the out-of-school vocational youths in Shanghai. (Out-of-School Vocational Youth)

### Simplification of Identity Card Issuance Needed

The national identity card is proof of identity for the holder. All Chinese people have the obligation and the right to apply for it. The government has repeatedly ordered that the issuance of identity cards to the people should be done as soon as possible and should not be delayed. However, despite the orders, it is still not possible for the people to quickly obtain an identity card. The reader applied for an identity card on November 30th of last year. The application form has been sent to the baozhang's office for more than a month, but has not yet been received. I have visited the baozhang three times, and according to the baozhang's reply, "The application form has been sent up, and it must be stamped by the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government and sent down to the district office. The procedures are complicated, and I don't know when it will be issued." As small people, we do not know how "complicated" the procedures are, but more than a month cannot be considered short. Can't these "complicated" procedures be completed? The government orders "swift" processing, but it takes more than a month. If it is not "swift," wouldn't it take a year to receive it? I hope that the agencies handling national identity cards will "comply with the situation and respect the law," strive to simplify the procedures, and issue them quickly, without adhering to the old habits of government offices and delaying them through unnecessary steps. At the same time, please answer when the identity card we applied for in November can be issued? (Li Zihe)

### Mail on Behalf

Reply to Mr. Yao Lichu: Your letter regarding the fee charged by Instructor Chen Yi has been forwarded by our office to the Education Bureau. The Education Bureau's Secondary Education Office has sent a letter to the Municipal First Normal School for investigation. According to the school's reply: "It has been found that for all municipal middle schools in this city, the tuition fees for this semester were collected after the middle of November, taking into account the burden on students' parents due to the dedication of Zunshi gold at the beginning of the semester. What our school collected was the above-mentioned tuition fee, not the second tuition fee. This is one point. The collection of tuition fees is a matter of the city's treasury, and our school is not in a position to refuse. However, children of public educators or students from poor families can apply for exemptions. More than half of the students in our school this semester applied for exemptions from Zunshi gold equipment, etc., and exemptions were granted for all or part of them after considering the circumstances, without anyone being left out. This shows that there were no violations in this tuition fee collection, and no one was suspended from school. This is the second point. There is no Yao Lichu among the parents of our school's financial aid students, and no one lives at 100 Dagu Road. It is clear that the anonymous claims are not true. This is the third point."

### Treaty of Peace with Germany and Austria Should Be Participated in by the Five Great Powers, We Have Submitted a Memorandum to the Four Powers, and the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting Allowed Austria to Attend and Make a Statement

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th dispatch] Regarding the drafting of the treaty with Germany and Austria, it is learned that the Chinese government has separately submitted memorandums to the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, requesting participation in the drafting work. It states that, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the peace treaty with Germany and its vassal states should be drafted by a meeting of the five powers. In the past, when the four deputy foreign ministers held a meeting in Paris in 1946, China also submitted a similar note to the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th dispatch] According to reliable sources, although China has received an invitation to present opinions on the German and Austrian treaties to the current meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers in London, the Chinese government has decided not to present such opinions to the meeting at this time. The Chinese government firmly maintains that the entire procedure for concluding the German and Austrian treaties, including the procedure for convening a peace conference in the future, should be agreed upon by the five foreign ministers' meeting before it can be decided and implemented.

[Central News Agency, London, 16th dispatch] The memorandum of our country's opinions on the German peace treaty, drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived at our embassy in the United Kingdom yesterday and will be submitted to the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers currently being held in London.

[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] The four foreign ministers' representatives' meeting on the German issue was held for two hours today. The meeting decided on the order in which small countries would be invited to present their opinions: Poland—January 20th afternoon, the Netherlands—January 21st afternoon, Yugoslavia—January 22nd afternoon, Australia—January 23rd afternoon, South Africa—January 24th, Canada—January 25th. There was no agreement on whether other small countries could be present when a representative of a small country presents their opinion, or whether documents submitted by one country should be circulated to other countries.

[United Press, London, 16th dispatch] The four foreign ministers' representatives agreed today to invite Austria to attend consultations on the Austrian treaty and agreed that the Austrian treaty should be called "the treaty for the reconstruction of an independent and democratic Austria." In other words, the treaty is not a peace treaty but a national treaty. The US representative, General Clark, commander of the US forces in Austria, then announced the withdrawal of the US draft treaty on Austria and stated that a new draft treaty would be submitted within a few days. The United Kingdom will maintain its original draft treaty, and France will also submit its French draft treaty on Austria within a few days. The deputy foreign ministers' meeting has received applications from Yugoslavia, Poland, Canada, Australia, and South Africa to attend and present opinions on the Austrian treaty. The above-mentioned countries may present their opinions first, and Austria will be the last country to present its opinions. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev proposed that the four powers and Austria should be listed as the countries that signed the treaty in the preamble, and other countries should be included in a special section of the treaty, but the four powers did not reach an agreement on this.

### Yugoslavia Demands Territory, Austria Decides to Reject

[Agence France-Presse, Yugoslav Capital, 16th dispatch] Regarding the Austrian treaty, Yugoslavia has sent a memorandum to the meeting of the four foreign ministers currently being held in London. This memorandum was recently published by the South. It states that Austria should be held responsible for Germany's aggression against the South, its occupation of its land, and its forced naturalization of its people. Therefore, it makes the following two demands: (1) The Slovenian Kalensia region should be returned to the South. (2) Croatians who have been naturalized as Germans should be given a special status to protect their national rights and to allow them to exchange with Austrians within the South's borders. In short, the Allies should give serious consideration to the South's demands.

[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] Official sources here: The Austrian government has prepared a detailed reply to Yugoslavia's demand to acquire the two provinces of Kalensia and Styria in Austria and is preparing to present it when the four deputy foreign ministers' meeting invites it to present its opinion. Well-informed sources said that the Austrian government will reject the South's demands for the following reasons: (1) Kalensia is an integral part, and in no way can it be divided. (2) The national nature of Kalensia was determined after a plebiscite held after the First World War. It is reported that the Austrian government will strongly declare the indivisibility of Kalensia geographically, administratively, and economically.

### Belgium and Brazil Submit Opinions on German Peace Treaty

[Reuters, Brussels, 16th dispatch] Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak said today that Belgium's demands on Germany could be presented to the four deputy foreign ministers' meeting in London on Monday. The Belgian Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee resolved today that German property established in Belgium during the war should be regarded as Belgian property and should not be used as German reparations.

[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] Brazil's demands on Germany were submitted to the four deputy foreign ministers' meeting today by the Brazilian Chargé d'Affaires Gutierrez. Brazil believes that in order to obtain more effective cooperation in the discussion of the treaty, not only should small countries be allowed to present their opinions, but they should also be allowed to have the opportunity to discuss the opinions of other countries. Brazil hopes that Germany will one day become an integral part of a peaceful international order so that it will not launch another war of aggression.

Once in danger, I will cooperate in defending it. I hope that all members of parliament and all political parties will cooperate with me. The peaceful coexistence of all political parties is necessary for democracy. If we are driven by emotions, it will be more harmful than beneficial."

[United Press, Berlin, 17th dispatch] The Soviet authorities announced a plan to increase the industrial production of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany by two to three times, which came as a surprise to US Commander Clay and other United Nations representatives. Clay has asked the Soviet representative to the United Nations Control Council for Germany to explain this at the next meeting. According to the United States, in accordance with the original four-power agreement, German industrial productivity should be reduced by 35 to 50 percent. This plan seeks to make German industrial production exceed pre-war levels, which is undoubtedly a fantasy and a violation of the four-power agreement. The plan was published by a Soviet-sponsored social unity party newspaper, foreshadowing the Soviet Union's intention to reach an agreement with other occupying countries at the Moscow foreign ministers' meeting to obtain compensation from Germany's existing production, which would be beneficial to the Soviet Union because it is feeling a shortage of domestic consumer goods.

### The United States Will Establish a Department of Defense; Land and Sea Armies Will Be Under Unified Command; Past Disputes Will Be Swept Away; Good Congressional Response Indicates Early Passage

[United Press International, Washington, 16th] President Truman announced today that the Secretaries of the Army and Navy have reached complete agreement on the matter of unified command of the armed forces. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal have jointly sent a letter to the President, endorsing the bill to establish a National Defense Council. According to this bill, all national armed forces will be under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, with a Secretary of the Army, a Secretary of the Navy, and a Secretary of the Air Force established under the Secretary of Defense. After the merger of the Army and Navy into the Department of Defense, three departments – Army, Navy, and Air Force – will be established, and each Secretary can report directly to the President on departmental affairs or offer opinions at any time, provided the Secretary of Defense is notified in advance.

The proposal for the merger originally came from the Army Department's advocacy, while the Navy Department has consistently opposed it. Now, the Navy Department has expressed its agreement and has jointly submitted the legislation to President Truman for him to promulgate and implement. Truman has replied to Patterson and Forrestal, expressing his pleasure at the agreement between the Army and Navy, and acknowledging that the merger plan agreed upon by the two departments is indeed feasible. Its content is stipulated as follows:

### Merger Plan is Practical

(1) Establishment of a National Defense Council, a National Defense Materials Bureau, and a Central Intelligence Agency.

(2) All national armed forces will be under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense.

(3) Establishment of a Military Council to determine military policy, composed of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

(4) Establishment of a Joint Chiefs of Staff, composed of the commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Military Aide to the President. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will be responsible for deploying American forces, drafting strategies, assigning tasks to the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and other military needs, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Defense.

(5) A Joint Staff Affairs Department will be established under the Joint Chiefs of Staff, composed of an equal number of officers selected from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, with a limit of one hundred officers from each department. The Joint Staff Affairs Department will have a Director who will handle implementation matters based on the decisions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

(6) The Secretary of Defense, with the approval of the President, will determine the common policies and common implementation procedures of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

### The Japanese Political Situation Takes Many Twists and Turns; the Coalition Cabinet is Stillborn

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 17th] In order to overcome the so-called national crisis, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida sought to recruit the Socialist Party and the Liberal and Progressive conservative parties to form a "national unity cabinet." Since December of last year, he has been negotiating with the Socialist Party for a month and a half. However, due to the strong opposition of the Socialist Party's left wing, the conditions put forward by the right wing to Yoshida have inevitably been gradually raised. The list of proposed cabinet members included left-wing elements, which did not receive understanding from the government and the party. In addition, after investigating the qualifications of Nishio and Hirano, the secretaries-general of the Socialist Party who were preparing to join the cabinet, it was found that they were not eligible to be cabinet members. As a result, Yoshida abandoned his plan to change the political situation and retreated to strengthen the policies of the Liberal and Progressive parties, hoping to break through the difficulties. The cabinet declared this point.

### Franco-Vietnamese Negotiations May Resume

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] The French cabinet communiqué stated: France is willing to resume free negotiations with the Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh. The cabinet members listened to the report by the Minister of Colonies, Moutet, on the situation in Vietnam. The cabinet decided that negotiations with the Viet Minh government should resume in an atmosphere of pacification.

### The President of Vietnam Personally Supervises the Troops

[United Press International, Hanoi, 16th] Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, is personally commanding the Viet Minh army at the Haitang Command Post, seven miles southwest of Hanoi in the North. The army continues to fight the French army. However, French officials say that there is no precise information about Ho Chi Minh's whereabouts. Ho may still be in the military, but he is being held hostage by extremist leaders. Since the attack on Hanoi began on December 19 of last year, the Viet Minh army has been under the control of extremists, and Ho Chi Minh himself may be under the guard of the extremists and not at the command post. The French policy, in regards to the attack on Hanoi, clearly does not want to criticize Ho Chi Minh personally, so that when the situation permits, negotiations with him can be resumed.

### Vietnamese Guerrillas Intensify Activities

[United Press International, Saigon, 16th] The terrorist activities of Vietnamese guerrillas are intensifying daily and have now spread to the Cambodian border. Some evidently want the French to know that the cost of a colonial war is even greater than the cost of recognizing Vietnamese independence.

### Anglo-French Treaty to be Drafted Soon

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Regarding the conclusion of an alliance between Britain and France, well-informed sources here recently stated that the Anglo-French treaty will begin to be drafted within a few weeks, and the two sides will exchange views through diplomatic channels. These negotiations may take place in London, between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Massigli, and simultaneously in Paris between the French Prime Minister and British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper.

### British Transport Workers' Strike Resolved

[United Press International, London, 16th] The London transport workers' strike, which has lasted for ten days, was declared resolved today.

This strike was the largest strike since the general strike of 1926, with more than 60,000 transport workers on strike.

### Soviet Scientists Research Solar Weapons

Concentrating Ultraviolet Power

Killing like Crushing Dry Weeds and Rotting Wood

[United Press International, New York, 17th] "Collier's" magazine, published on Thursday, recently carried an article by Kohtane, stating that Soviet scientists at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute are researching ways to allow deadly solar ultraviolet rays to pass through "gaps" in the Earth's atmosphere and instantly destroy any enemy country. "If the power of ultraviolet light is concentrated and passed through the atmosphere to illuminate any enemy country, it will be enough to destroy that country and all its inhabitants, as if crushing dry weeds and rotting wood."

### From a British Perspective on Allied-Occupied Japan (1)

— Original by John Morris, Translated by Zhang Deqian

I previously translated the article "Japan During the Occupation," which appeared in this newspaper from November 17th to 19th last year. It was originally written by Parrott, the "New York Times" correspondent in Tokyo, and provides a glimpse into an American perspective on the occupation of Japan. Now I have also found an article in the British authoritative magazine "The Fortnightly Review" November issue titled "Japan Under Allied Occupation," which is quite representative of a British perspective. I am translating it again for readers to refer to.

(1) Current Situation of Japan

Before the war, I lived in Japan for four years. I only left Japan eight months after the Pearl Harbor incident, in July 1942. At that time, the living conditions in Japan were already extremely difficult. Tokyo had been bombed once by General Doolittle, but that bombing was just a demonstration. The last time I passed through Tokyo's city center was on a bus in a concentration camp, on the way to the pier to board a prisoner-of-war exchange ship. At that time, although Tokyo appeared dilapidated, it was still a city, with seven million people living, working, and entertaining there.

I recently returned from Japan, where I lived for six months. What impressed me the most was the ruin and damage that had occurred in the past four years. During the war, I closely followed the situation in Japan. I had formed a fairly clear image in my mind, assuming that Japan should always be like that. But it was completely different from the actual situation.

To understand the current situation in Japan, we cannot use our knowledge of the destruction in Europe to estimate it. For example, London, even after the most brutal air raids, still had something left; maybe all that was left were some cellars or outer walls, but at least you could still tell what the place was. In Japan, it is completely different. You have to understand that very few buildings in general Japanese cities are made of steel and concrete. The remaining 90 percent, whether they are houses, shops, or even factories, are made of wood. Only Kyoto in Japanese cities has never been bombed, and many large towns have not been bombed either. The center of Tokyo, around the Imperial Palace, although bombed, is still much the same as it was before the war. There are some ruins here and there, but generally speaking, it is similar to the less bombed areas of London. This area is mostly occupied by banks and large businesses; now almost all of it is used as barracks for the occupation forces. Loafing around the streets, with the sound of Allied military music constantly blaring from the loudspeakers, and idle GIs leaning against the walls in contemplation, this scene is no different from any smaller city in Denver or the British Midwest. You still see a few Japanese people, who seem to have wandered into this area by mistake.

Today's Tokyo is Completely Different

But outside that area, the scene is completely different. The Japanese used to call Tokyo the third largest city in the world. Now, apart from that surviving small area, the rest has simply been destroyed. In the three major bombings last year, everything was burned to ashes. The destruction of Tokyo is almost like the destruction of the ancient city of Carthage. What is strange is that although the streets are so dilapidated, they still exist, and electric trams are still running. There are also a few dilapidated buses running. But there are no taxis. To ride a tram, you have to stand in line for an hour or two before you can get on. All the seats in the tram have been removed to accommodate more passengers, and even the footboards are crowded with people. Fainting and injuries are common. Because of the excessive load, the tram can barely climb on slightly sloping streets. The subway was very clean and good before the war, but now the situation is almost the same as above ground. The stations are dirty and dark, and the smell in the tunnels is like a large sewer, making you feel like you are traveling through rubble. The names of the districts are naturally still the same, but there is nothing that can make you recognize what place it is.

Most Citizens Live in the Suburbs

Before the war, Tokyo had a population of about seven million. Now it has been reduced to about three million, most of whom live in the distant suburbs that have been somewhat undamaged. People who work in the city center (the occupation forces naturally have to hire many Japanese) have to spend five or six hours on the road every day. The small houses originally intended for one family are now inhabited by a dozen people. Although the Japanese have never been as concerned as we are about living separately and not disturbing each other, if they continue to live like this, I don't think they will undergo the necessary social and intellectual changes that will enable them to occupy a place in the peaceful and democratic world in the future.

There is naturally much more to write about this, but my purpose is only to outline the background for the occupation forces to carry out their work, so I will stop here.

### Foreigners Involved in Lawsuits in China Are Not Allowed to Bring Translators; We Are Not Bound Before the Sino-US Treaty is Ratified

[Our Newspaper] Since China abolished unequal treaties and extraterritoriality, foreign nationals from Europe and the United States have been subject to Chinese law in lawsuits in Chinese courts, and all their treatment is equal to that of Chinese citizens. Recently, Mr. Smith, the Director and General Manager of the Shanghai-based American firm, Marti Yang Company, was summoned by the Shanghai District Court on November 4 of last year. The District Court rejected his request to bring his private translator. Because Mr. Smith was not proficient in Chinese, he did not understand the content of the written record of his testimony after the interrogation. The District Court ordered him to sign the record according to the law, which caused a dispute over "treatment." The details of the situation were reported by Mr. Smith to the US Consul General in Shanghai, who forwarded the report to the US Embassy. The US Embassy made representations to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office has received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to inquire about the details of the case. The translated excerpts of the US Embassy's note to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the full text of the Ministry of Judicial Administration's instructions to the High Court are published below:

### Translation of the Note from the US Embassy

Translation of the note: "On November 26 of this year, Dr. Cheng Ximeng, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Chen Shilin, Assistant Officer, met with Mr. Burton, Deputy Commercial Attaché of the Embassy, to discuss the matter of Mr. Smith, the Director and General Manager of the American firm Marti Yang Company in Shanghai, being summoned by the Shanghai District Court, and the treatment he received when he appeared on November 4 of this year. According to Director Cheng's statement, the US Consul General in Shanghai reported the details of the case, as well as Mr. Smith's request to be accompanied by his legal counsel or translator when attending the interrogation, which was not approved, and the fact that he had to sign a Chinese record whose content he could not confirm after the court hearing. A copy of Ambassador Stuart's letter of November 8 of this year is enclosed. The Ministry is aware that the recently signed Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation (Article 6, Section 4) stipulates that nationals of either contracting party shall have the freedom to select and engage lawyers, translators, and representatives when exercising or defending their rights in court. Although this treaty has not yet been ratified by both parties, the Embassy believes that even if either party does not comply with its actual provisions, there is a moral obligation to abide by its spirit. Based on this view, the Embassy requests that the Ministry bring the case of Mr. Smith to the attention of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, so that Chinese courts will adopt less arbitrary measures before the aforementioned Sino-US treaty is exchanged and ratified. It would be deeply appreciated if the Ministry would give sympathetic attention to this case. December 5, 1946."

### Reply from the Ministry of Judicial Administration

Ministry of Judicial Administration, January 4 of this year, Jing (36) Xun Can Zi No. 8: "The case is based on the public letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mei San Wu No. 13835, dated December 16 of this year. The US Embassy's (note) concerns the matter of Mr. Smith, the Director and General Manager of the American firm Marti Yang Company in Shanghai, being summoned by the Shanghai District Court, and the treatment he received when he appeared in court on November 4 of this year. The Embassy requests that the Ministry of Judicial Administration pay attention to this matter, so that Chinese courts will take less arbitrary measures before the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation is exchanged and ratified, etc. A copy of the original letter from the US Consul General in Shanghai reporting the case, and a letter from Mr. Smith reporting his experience, addressed to the Consul General, are enclosed to the Ministry. It is found that the aforementioned Sino-US Treaty has not yet been exchanged and ratified, and has not yet come into effect. In law, our government is not yet bound by it. In addition to informing the personnel of the US Embassy of this view, the original note and a translated copy are enclosed, along with a copy of the original letter from the US Consul General and the original letter from Mr. Smith. Please investigate the details of the case and reply as soon as possible."

### Difficulties Arise in the Collection of Public Utility Surcharges

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has reported to the Municipal Council yesterday that difficulties have arisen in the collection of public utility surcharges, requesting a resolution. The reasons are as follows: (1) The US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai refuses to pay the public utility surcharges. Please consider whether it is necessary to list them on their bills and, if so, negotiate with the US military authorities. The Bureau has received a report from the Shanghai Gas Company stating that the company received a letter from the US Navy stating that the surcharge could be waived. (2) The Wusong Gas Company is experiencing great difficulties in collecting surcharges from military users, and has requested the Municipal Government to consult with the Songhu Garrison Command for assistance. (3) According to a report from the Shanghai Power Company, the company has received a letter from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) stating that, in accordance with the agreement between the agency and the Chinese government, they are exempt from all taxes and surcharges. How to handle this matter? Please clarify. The above issues were discussed at the Municipal Council meeting yesterday, but no decision was made. What will happen next is currently unpredictable.

### Over 10,000 Unemployed Workers from the Rear Areas in Shanghai Struggle on the Brink of Starvation, Residing in Shabby Dwellings, with Two to Three Deaths Daily, Representatives of the Delegation Host a Press Conference and Appeal

[Our Own Report] The delegation of unemployed workers from the rear areas who have come to Shanghai, numbering over 10,000, are living on the brink of starvation. They appeal for resumption of work and relief. Yesterday, they hosted a press conference at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Tibet Road, reporting on their current living conditions and expressing their desire for work. According to the general secretary of the delegation, since December of the year before last, over 10,000 workers have come to Shanghai from the rear areas. Except for over 300 who have found ways to return to work on their own, the vast majority are still unemployed, and workers continue to arrive from the rear areas. The reception center set up by the Social Affairs Bureau can only accommodate over 3,000 people, and the center is dilapidated with broken walls, extremely dirty, with men, women, old and young, living in the same room, lacking medical equipment. An average of two to three people die every day. The monthly allotment of over 20 catties of macaroni from the Relief Administration often comes half a month late, and there is only 100 yuan for daily food expenses. The poor quality of the food is unimaginable. The Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan has issued over 1,000 coats, but most are moldy, and two-thirds are for women. The representative wept as they reported on the painful living conditions. The representative also stated that the Social Affairs Bureau had promised to set up a cooperative hardware factory to provide jobs and had promised to lend each person 300,000 yuan of small-sum loans in October last year, but nothing has materialized to this day. The delegation put forward specific appeals: (1) Please request Director Lei to follow Article 7 of the new regulations for worker rehabilitation promulgated by the Executive Yuan, which stipulates that wartime production laborers have priority in returning to work, to guarantee and introduce them to state-owned factories for rapid resumption of work. (2) Please promptly devise winter relief for unemployed workers who have come to Shanghai from the rear areas. (3) Please promptly increase the medical and health personnel and equipment in the reception centers to save lives.

### The Address of the Regiment Headquarters Has Been Determined

Lieutenant General Chuan Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, previously went to Nanjing to request instructions regarding the office address of the Headquarters and the Shanghai Regiment Headquarters. The matter has been officially completed, and he returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday morning. He immediately met with Fang Ying, Commander of the First Naval Base, to inspect the former Naval Hospital on Kunming Road. It is reported that Kunming Road has been decided as the location for the Shanghai Regiment Headquarters. After some clearing, it can be moved in and formally operate within days. As for Tongji Road, although it has been decided as the location for the Garrison District Headquarters, there are many naval dependents currently residing there, and it may be difficult to move in and operate for the time being. The Garrison District Headquarters will temporarily operate at the First Supply District Headquarters reception center, and negotiations with the Navy are ongoing. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the people in the garrison district thoroughly understand the meaning and detailed methods of conscription, Commander Chuan Zhengmo has decided to conduct extensive publicity before conscription. He has already printed a type of Conscription Law and distributed it to district, township, and village offices and Baojia (households), for posting and reference, so that the people in the garrison district understand the true meaning of conscription, and the age and branches of the military service.

### The New Sino-French Air Route, Official Launch Date Still Awaiting China's Decision

The French Far East Aviation Company specially dispatched a DC-4 type F-BBDE jumbo jet, departing from Paris, via Saigon, Hong Kong, etc., to Shanghai at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, in order to inspect the air route between Vietnam and China. The equipment and decoration inside the aircraft are quite beautiful. The aircraft is scheduled to return to France from Shanghai on the 19th of this month. The reporter specially visited Mr. Tuo Liqi, the chief inspector responsible for the company's Shanghai office, yesterday. He said that the French Far East Aviation Company decided to open a new air route between China and France for the purpose of opening up air transport between France and China. The F-BBDE is the first visit to China, and will continue to visit China in the short term after returning to France, in order to establish close contact with the Ministry of Communications of the Chinese government. As for the official launch date, according to the provisions of the Sino-French aviation agreement, the airlines of both countries must launch and take off at the same time. Therefore, the launch date of the French Far East Aviation Company depends on the decision of the Chinese government. The official launch can only take place after China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) or Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) participates in the flight. However, Chinese aircraft can only fly to Vietnam, Saigon, or Hanoi, as the aviation agreement does not stipulate flights between China and Paris. As for the ports in China that the French Far East Aviation Company will pass through, they must also be determined by the Chinese government before they can be announced.

According to reliable sources, the China National Aviation Corporation had aircraft flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, before the conflict between the French and Vietnamese armies, but it was suspended due to the outbreak of war. Based on this fact, the air route between China, France, and Vietnam in the future may be undertaken by Chinese companies.

### British-Gifted Warship "Fubo" Sails to Shanghai

The British-gifted warship "Fubo" returned to China from the United Kingdom and sailed to Nanjing via South China. The Naval Headquarters has made appropriate adjustments to the personnel on board. It is now learned that the warship was led to Shanghai by the newly appointed Captain Jiang Yu the day before yesterday and is currently docked at the Huangpu Road Naval Pier. After a brief resupply, it will sail to the Gaochang Temple Jiangnan Shipyard for inspection and repair.

### Feng Qinzao and Kong Decheng Travel to Tianjin by Ship Together

General Feng Qinzao, former Chairman of Chahar Province, and Kong Decheng, a descendant of Confucius from Qufu, Shandong, attended the National Assembly in Nanjing. After the closing of the National Assembly, they arrived in Shanghai last week. In view of the continuous aircraft accidents, they decided to travel north by ship. It is reported that the General Affairs Office of the Municipal Government has purchased tickets for the "Hai Xiong" from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on their behalf, and they boarded the ship and set sail for Tianjin together yesterday.

### Commercial Banks Act as Agents for Tax Collection

[Our Own Report] In order to facilitate tax payment for citizens, the Municipal Finance Bureau has entrusted six commercial banks to temporarily collect taxes on behalf of the City Bank. All taxes and levies in this city have long been collected by the City Bank acting as an agent for the Municipal Treasury. Thirty-two collection branches have been set up in various districts of the city to handle collection and remittance matters. Now that the business tax, house tax, and municipal construction levies have been levied, in order to facilitate payment for citizens, in addition to the Jiujiang Road Main Branch and the original collection branches continuing to collect and remit, all the bank's First Office at 247 Yu Garden Road, the Third Office at 509 Zhonghua Road, and the Third Office at 509 Zhengdong East Road will also collect taxes. The bank also believes that the urban area is vast and there are many taxpayers. In order to prevent citizens from being crowded and waiting for a long time, or feeling inconvenience, it is decided from this year to temporarily entrust the Zheshang Industrial Bank Head Office (230 Jiangxi Road), Zheshang Industrial Bank Dongmen Road Branch (61 Dongmen Road), Xinhua Bank Sixth Office (451 Zhengzhong Middle Road), Siming Bank Nanjing Road Branch (470 Nanjing East Road), China Industrial Bank Caojiadu Branch (451 Kangding Road), Four Banks Savings Association (170 Nanjing West Road), and China General Chamber of Commerce Bank Yangshupu Office (Fishing Market) to collect taxes separately.

### People Occupying Municipal Real Estate Must Declare and Register Within February

Regulations for Rewarding Reports of Concealed Public Land

[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Municipal Real Estate Management Measures and the Shanghai Municipal Reward Measures for Reporting Concealed Public Land were jointly drafted by the Land Administration Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau. They were reviewed and approved by the Regulations Committee and the Land Administration Committee of the Municipal Council.

### During the Lunar New Year, All Shipping Lines Will Operate as Usual, and the Railway Bureau Will Add Special Trains for Returning Home

The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration added special trains for returning home in order to clear transportation during the Lunar New Year. However, the ticketing situation was extremely chaotic, greatly affecting the order of the station. Therefore, the "Ticketing Measures for Special Trains for Returning Home" were specially formulated. Passengers on special trains for returning home must purchase tickets to the terminal station of each train, regardless of which station they get off at. However, for fourth-class special trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, tickets can only be issued if there is a fourth-class fare established between each stop and the terminal station. Tickets for special trains for which the fare is not specified in the fare table will not be issued. Furthermore, the 92nd and 94th express trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line are extended runs of regional trains, so tickets will be issued as usual. In addition, all special trains for returning home will be handled in accordance with the current express train ticketing procedures.

In addition, the bureau believes that as the end of the year approaches, passengers will inevitably carry various firecrackers on the train, which can easily cause danger. Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to carry them. If anyone is found carrying them on the train privately, the firecrackers will be confiscated and they will be severely punished.

[Another Report] As the Lunar New Year is approaching, shipping lines in this city, according to past practice, are preparing to close and take a vacation. Shipping lines usually begin to suspend operations several days before Lunar New Year's Eve. According to sources in the shipping industry yesterday, the industry is continuing to operate as usual because the passenger and cargo traffic on the northern and southern oceans and the Yangtze River is very crowded this year. However, it will be prepared to suspend operations for a few days during the Spring Festival holiday to allow sailors and others to return home for reunions and to clean up the interior of the ships.

The shipping industry's business was quite developed last year, and the number of ships operating on each line gradually increased. However, most private shipping companies had no profit due to high expenses and low freight and fares.

In addition, Mr. Shen Zhongyi, Deputy General Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, told a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday that the company will continue to operate as usual during the Lunar New Year and will not take a vacation. However, if passenger and cargo traffic on each line decreases, the schedule may be delayed. Currently, the shipping on each line is normal. There will be a passenger ship sailing to Taiwan from the Shanghai-Taiwan line next Monday.

### Impersonating a Police Inspector, Holding a Show of Stolen Goods at the Pawnshop, Staging a New Drama, Stealing a Radio

[Our Own Report] New tricks for swindling are emerging one after another. In the morning the day before yesterday, two people wearing black uniforms suddenly arrived at the Yongxing Pawnshop at 103 Yu Garden Road, escorting someone who looked like a petty thief. They claimed to be police inspectors from the Xinshijie Police Sub-bureau, ordered to bring the thief to display stolen goods. After speaking, they slapped the petty thief twice and asked if he had been here. The petty thief repeatedly said yes and kept calling for help from "uncles". The play was so realistic and vivid that the pawnshop owner, Jiang Yongyi, believed it was true and quickly invited the "police inspectors" inside to sit down, offering tea and cigarettes, fearing negligence. At this point, the "police inspector" took out a pawn ticket from his pocket. After Jiang inspected it, it was indeed issued by the pawnshop on January 5th, for a radio, valued at 300,000 yuan. At the same time, the ticket had the words "Stolen Goods" written on it, so he was even more convinced that it came from the police station. He ordered a shop assistant to go upstairs and take out the original pawned radio. The "petty thief" first recognized it, and then it was handed over to the "police inspector". At this point, the three had finished their play and achieved their goal, so they left. Before leaving, they only left a note with the words "Jin Musheng, Criminal Division, Xinshijie Sub-bureau" as a token. Yesterday, the pawnshop owner, fearing that the 300,000 yuan would be lost, ordered shop assistant Weng Honggui to go to the Xinshijie Police Sub-bureau to inquire. After searching the entire bureau, there was no "Jin Musheng" and no such display of stolen goods. Then he realized that he had been fooled and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau, requesting investigation.

### A Villager Detained for Illegally Possessing Firearms

The police officers rushed to the house and found two automatic and selective fire submachine guns. They took the young woman Chen Mao to the bureau. She claimed that she did not know who had thrown the firearms into the house during the enemy puppet period, and because the villager was ignorant, she had illegally possessed them until now. The rest of her testimony was vague and will be investigated in detail before being processed.

### A Comedian Meets a Comical Incident, a Foolish Thief Steals Rocks from a Rockery

The living room has a pewter candle holder weighing over 20 catties, a stone-copper Buddha statue weighing about 50 catties (installed with a mahogany frame), and a rockery, etc., of great value. Unexpectedly, at about 6 AM yesterday, after the maid got up, she found that the door was wide open and that a thief had broken in. All the Buddha, pewter candle holder, rockery, etc., were stolen. The owner, Shen Xiaoting, has reported to the Taishan Sub-bureau requesting an investigation.

### A Heartwarming Act Amidst the Winter Relief Efforts, Donating Seven Mu of Land to Help the Poor

The grand Peking opera benefit performance organized by the Fundraising Committee of the Municipal Winter Relief Association, following the charity dinner dance, has come to a conclusion after eight days. The first four days were performed at the Tianchan Stage, but the results were not as good as expected due to the rain. The last four days were moved to the China Grand Theater, and the situation improved. The total ticket revenue for the four days was about 150 million.

Furthermore, the association received a deed for six pieces of private land, totaling seven mu, seven fen, four li, and seven hao, from Zhu Xiaofang, Executive Director of the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, through Director Shi of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday. He generously donated the land because he saw that the poor were suffering from hunger and cold and feared starvation. The original letter said: "Your association has launched a winter relief effort to benefit poor compatriots, which I deeply sympathize with. I have specially enclosed six pieces of real estate in Hangzhou, along with all the property certificates (a list is attached separately). Please check and sell them separately. All proceeds will be donated to show my meager effort. Please investigate accordingly." It is now learned that the list is as follows: (1) An empty lot of nine fen on Jiulingsong, Lingyin Road, Hangzhou, surrounded by mountains on three sides, near the road, with elegant scenery. (One each of the two maps of the two municipalities, the third map, the eighty-seventh map, one each of the grain storage certificates, and one of the first contracts under Zhu Huairen's name.) (2) An agricultural land of one mu and one thousand and sixty-five on the church bridge in the Hangzhou Songmucang (one each of the two maps of the two municipalities, the first map, the eighty-one thousand and seventy-sixth map, one grain completion certificate, and one contract under Zhong Heji's name.) (3) A miscellaneous land of five fen and thirty-two near the Songmucang along the road outside the Hangzhou Qiantang Gate (one each of the two maps of the two municipalities, the first map, the two hundred and seventeenth map, one grain completion certificate, and one each of the transfer of the upper contract.)

The above four, five, and six total four mu, six fen, and five li of tea land. It is also learned that when Director Zhu was raising donations for the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association, he also generously donated a Western-style house to benefit the people, which is truly commendable.

### Hateful Mistake

Tang and Ms. Liu knew each other. They met next to the escalator. At first, they joked with each other, and then they started to move their hands and feet. Accidentally, Ms. Liu lost her hand and Rudy fell to the ground, immediately losing consciousness. Later, she was accompanied by her mother to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 10 AM the next day.

### The Third Trial of the Zang Da Erzi Case: The Accused Appears in Court for the First Time; U.S. Navy Petty Officer Luther Called to Testify, Claims He Acted in Self-Defense When He Hit the Rickshaw Puller

[Report from our Newspaper] In the tragic death of Zang Da Erzi, Luther, a U.S. Navy Petty Officer from the USS Helen, was summoned by the court yesterday to testify for Lai Lingnai. At 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Yanlin temporarily convened the court for questioning. Due to the short notice, the victim's family was not informed, and only their attorney, Chen Zhen, appeared. Luther, escorted by U.S. Navy Major Johnson, testified: He is 25 years old, an American citizen, a Petty Officer on the USS Helen, commanding 32 soldiers. He first came to Shanghai on September 18th of last year, staying for only a month before leaving, and returned three months later. On September 22nd, at 10:00 PM, he went to the "Bi Du" (a place), and also went to a bar, but did not drink or go upstairs. Upon entering, he saw Lai Lingnai drinking. Although they were not acquainted, they left at about the same time and he saw a rickshaw puller demanding money from Lai, who claimed he had already paid. The puller continued to harass him and struck Lai Lingnai, who did not retaliate. Therefore, he struck the rickshaw puller once, causing him to fall to the ground. The court questioned him: Since Lai Lingnai was a stranger to you, why did you hit the rickshaw puller? Luther replied: Because at that moment, I considered Lai to be a friend.

The court then inquired about the U.S. military court's investigation. Major Johnson stood up and stated: The evidence in this case has been fully collected and the investigation has concluded, but no verdict has been reached. The verdict needs to be reported to Washington before it can be decided. The court instructed: According to Article 4, Section 2 of the Regulations for Handling Criminal Cases Involving U.S. Military Personnel in China, this court has the authority to inquire about the case's progress. The court then asked Johnson: Since the investigation is complete, under what legal article is the accused being prosecuted? Johnson replied: For murder. He was then asked about the motive. Johnson replied that it was self-defense and there was no instigation. The court continued: This court has sent two letters requesting a response, but we have not received a reply. Why? Johnson replied: Copies have been sent to Mayor Wu and the U.S. Consulate for forwarding, and they should arrive soon. He also stated that Luther will soon be deported back to the U.S. and will not be able to testify in court again. As witnesses Zhao Adi and two others were not present, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. Lai Lingnai, suspected of instigating the murder, also requested a confrontation yesterday, claiming that he no longer recognized Luther. Lai fully believed that he would be released after this general amnesty. However, the most severe penalty for his crime is imprisonment, so he can only have his sentence reduced, not be pardoned, and was returned to custody after questioning.

### Zheng Liangbin's Retrial: Chen Chunpu Summoned to Testify

[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Zheng Liangbin, suspected of being a traitor, continued in the High Court yesterday with witness testimony. The defendant, Zheng Liangbin, from Ningbo, had worked in the shipping industry for many years. In March of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), he defected to the enemy, serving as the Chief of the Ship Department of the enemy's Central China Shipping Company, General Manager of the puppet National News Agency, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the puppet Political Council, and Director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Construction Department. The defendant had a fresh haircut, a flat-top style, a fair complexion, and wore a blue cloth gown. He admitted to holding puppet positions but claimed that the General Manager position at the puppet National News Agency was merely a nominal title because Li Shiqun had asked for money and he had donated 50,000 yuan to the agency. He stated the position as Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the puppet Central Political Council was merely a title and he never received a salary.

The accuser, Zhang Yishi, stated: I filed the accusation because the defendant seized my ship. The seizure occurred in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), before the defendant held any puppet positions. All the puppet positions listed are accurate. He presented the defendant's business card with his titles. The court instructed that regarding the seizure, because it occurred before the defendant held any puppet positions, a civil suit could be filed separately. Chen Chunpu, who had already been sentenced to death, was then brought to testify. Chen was emaciated, with gray hair, wearing a blue cloth gown and worn-out cloth shoes. Chen testified: The defendant and Chen Chunpu were friends before the war, and Chunpu arranged for him to become the Director of the Shanghai Office, connecting him with the Shanghai shipping industry.

The case should have been concluded yesterday, but at the request of the defendant's lawyers, Zhang Shizhao and Chen Tingrui, two more important witnesses needed to be summoned. The hearing was adjourned to a later date.

### Zhao Zunyue's Trial Continued Yesterday: Closing Arguments, Sentencing on the 24th

[Report from our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard the case of Zhao Zunyue. The defendant, from Wujin, 50 years old, a graduate of Nanyang Public School, had worked as a reporter for Shen Bao before the war and as a Councilor and Chief of the Propaganda Section of the North China Political Affairs Commission and as a Councilor of the Ministry of Railways. After Shanghai fell, the defendant returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and, at the persuasion of Wang Jingwei, joined the puppet organization, successively serving as a member of the puppet Political Council, Vice Minister of the puppet Ministry of Railways, Political Commissioner of the puppet Executive Yuan, Secretary-General of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Central Political Council, and Minister of Propaganda, until the end of the war.

In response to the indictment, the defendant stated: The defendant has always been a staunch supporter of the resistance against Japan. During the January 28th Incident (1932), I participated in the Shanghai National Disaster Relief Association. After the outbreak of the war, the defendant went to Hong Kong twice to prepare for the publication of Shen Bao. Later, due to my father's illness, I returned to Shanghai. Wang Jingwei met me at the Yuyuan Road, Lane 226 and persuaded me to join the puppet organization. Because I was not a member of the Kuomintang, I was appointed as a member of the puppet Central Political Council, with nothing to do. The council only handled routine matters such as personnel reports and filings. The power over the railways was in the hands of the enemy's Central China Railway Company, and the puppet Ministry of Railways had no authority to intervene. Although I wanted to reclaim the railway management rights, the enemy did not agree. Later, because the puppet Ministry of Railways had no work to do, it was abolished. I was transferred to be a nominal Political Commissioner of the puppet Executive Yuan, which was just a figurehead position. The Executive Yuan had no office for political commissioners, and I never reported for duty. During my tenure as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, I handled the affairs of the Secretariat, and the original bureau chiefs remained unchanged. The increase in land tax, house tax, and business tax were directly submitted to the puppet mayor by the puppet Finance Bureau, and the records can be checked. The revision of textbooks was carried out during the time of the Reformed Government. The defendant converted public schools into private schools to avoid using these textbooks. Regarding the construction of roads to facilitate enemy military transport, the puppet government had no funds for construction at the time. The organization of the Baojia system was not intended to restrict the activities of underground workers. The individuals who cracked down on underground workers were enemy military police and secret agents. Later, I was transferred to be the Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Central Political Council, which was an idle position with nothing to do. In February of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Propaganda Minister Lin Baisheng resigned, and the defendant was appointed as the puppet Minister of Propaganda. I consulted with Commissioner Xu of the Military Affairs Commission beforehand and obtained his permission before taking office. Because I had a private radio station to communicate with the Central Government and provide information to the rear, the position of puppet Minister of Propaganda could provide cover.

The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Shizhao, argued: Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases states: "Assistance in the war effort or actions beneficial to the people may be considered for reducing the sentence." The defendant privately established a radio station to provide information to the rear, as testified by Tao Guang and Wang Yaoqin. During the defendant's tenure as Secretary-General of the puppet Municipal Government, there were no actions detrimental to the people. One should not ask about the position held within the puppet government, but should examine their actions. Do not only ask about puppet officials, but ask whether they did good or harm. Even if the defendant cannot be found not guilty, his sentence should be reduced. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated: Please pay attention to the defendant's motive, facts, and attitude after the fact when determining the sentence, and be particularly lenient.

At this point, Judge Liu announced: The arguments in this case are concluded, and the sentencing will be on the morning of the 24th of this month.

### The Local Court Begins General Amnesty: Eighty-One Released Yesterday

### Preventing Traitors from Swindling with Impunity

The local court of this city, in view of the General Amnesty Order issued by the National Government and published in the State Council Gazette, whereby those criminals who meet the criteria for amnesty or sentence reduction will be released or have their sentences reduced in batches according to the law, is deeply concerned that unscrupulous individuals may take advantage of the situation, swindle, and deceive. Therefore, a public notice is issued stating: "According to the General Amnesty Order issued by the National Government on New Year's Day of this year, except for war criminals and those who have committed treason, corruption, murder of direct lineal ascendants, manufacture, transportation, and sale of opium, establishment of places for opium consumption, and addiction after repeated prohibition, all crimes committed before December 31st of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945) where the most severe original sentence is imprisonment or less are amnestied. Where the most severe original sentence is imprisonment or more, or with a concurrent fine, the sentence may be reduced in accordance with the regulations. All criminal cases handled by this court, those eligible for amnesty or sentence reduction, are currently being processed for release from prison and for the preparation of sentence reduction by the presiding judge in accordance with the provisions of the law. This national amnesty is truly a generous act of grace. All defendants should wait patiently for the judgment and not be impatient or deceived by others. If there are unscrupulous people who take advantage of the situation, swindle, and extort, you are permitted to submit a written report directly to this court, and we will thoroughly investigate without leniency. This is a public notice for general information."

### Fraudulent Practices in the Liquor Industry's Rotating Credit Associations: The Association Sends a Letter Requesting Sanctions

[Report from our Newspaper] Li Youcai, Chairman of the Shanghai Fen Liquor Industry Association, and Zhang Shuen, Dai Chunfeng, and others from the association, sent a letter to the District Attorney's Office yesterday, stating: Since the victory, the practice of rotating credit associations has become prevalent, affecting members of our association. Due to poor business conditions, they are unable to bear the exploitation of high-interest loans, resulting in numerous business failures and disputes. At the request of affected members, the association intervened to mediate. After investigation, it was discovered that Hui Kang Liquor Store, China Company, Da Zhonghua Liquor Store, and Chen Zhaoyang, Hu Bogui, Xu Shaoyun, Wang Yumei, and others, after obtaining the funds from the credit associations, secretly remitted the funds back to their hometowns to purchase property, leaving only empty storefronts in Shanghai as a means to liquidate debts. It is estimated that the total amount of funds exchanged among members of the industry is in the billions of yuan, with over 300 businesses affected. If this trend is not curbed, it will affect social stability. The association has decided at a meeting that any member who remits large sums of money back to their hometown to purchase property with the intention of defaulting on debts in Shanghai, or who intentionally stops or delays payment of credit association funds or debts under the pretext of owing debts, will be reported by the association to the Municipal Government, the City Council, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the District Attorney's Office for strict sanctions and legal action, and will also be publicly announced in the newspaper.

[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Wu Suiren, Chief of the Treasury Section of the General Administration, who misappropriated 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for private lending at high interest rates, is scheduled to be heard by the Local Court today. Wu submitted a statement of defense yesterday, in which he stated: "The misappropriation of funds was originally intended to establish a low-interest microloan program. Although there is a crime of unauthorized disposal of public funds, it only constitutes a dereliction of duty and does not fall under the anti-corruption regulations cited in the indictment. He also stated that he immediately confessed to the director, Huo Baoshu, in writing after the incident and returned the funds in full.

### The Scandalous Murder Case in the Sheet Metal Shop: A Ripple Across a Pool of Spring Water; She is Killed for Her Beauty; A Rickshaw Puller Defends the "Xi Shi"; A Friend Interferes, Originally Out of Love Sickness

[Report from our Newspaper] On December 13th of last year, an unidentified male corpse was found in front of No. 198, Kaixuan Road. The Changning Road Branch Bureau dispatched officers to transport the body to the morgue for examination, but because no family members claimed the body, it was collected for burial. It has now been learned that the deceased was named Wu Tiegen, 32 years old, from Songjiang, and had worked as a clerk at the Cao Litai Sheet Metal Shop, owned by Cao Chunsheng, located at No. 448, Fuxing Middle Road, for over ten years. After the death of his first wife, the shop owner Cao Chunsheng cohabitated with a woman surnamed Wang, 43 years old. Wang had a daughter from a previous marriage, named A'mi, whom Cao raised. She was renamed Cao Jing and is now 18 years old, with a beautiful face, known as the "Sheet Metal Xi Shi." Wu Tiegen pursued her but was rejected. Next door to the shop was a flatbread shop owned by Wei Changzhi. Wei's son-in-law, Zhao Fusheng, also known as Ma Xiaofuzi, 27 years old, earned a living as a rickshaw puller and had a good relationship with Jing. One day, Wu Tiegen caught a glimpse of them together, and jealousy flared up. He reported it to Cao's mother, who scolded A'mi. From then on, Wu Tiegen and Zhao Fusheng became enemies. Zhao Fusheng repeatedly threatened Wu, demanding that he forcibly borrow 1 million yuan, claiming he would kill Wu if he didn't. Wu Tiegen was terrified and searched everywhere for a loan without success. Unexpectedly, he was murdered under the bamboo fence of the Anping Coffin Repository on Kaixuan Road. Wu Tiegen's older brother, Wu Chuncai (39 years old, currently a gatekeeper at the Zhonghua School, No. 596, Qipu Road), learned of this and reported the details to the police, who immediately arrested Zhao Fusheng for investigation and submitted a report to the District Attorney's Office, requesting a second autopsy. The District Attorney's Office granted the request, and yesterday morning, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall dispatched workers to return the coffin to the morgue. At 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen Zuocai, along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Xi Zihui, arrived to take their seats. After briefly questioning the deceased's brother, they entered the morgue and ordered the workers to open the coffin and remove the body. The forensic doctor first dissected the head, removing the brain. Three black spots were found on the frontal bone of the head, and a bluish-purple bruise was found on the back of the head. The chest was then dissected, and the heart, lungs, and other organs were found to be intact and undamaged. The examination lasted for two hours before it was completed. When the examination was conducted, reporters were also present to observe. The body was swollen and bloated, emitting a foul odor, and looked very gruesome. According to the forensic doctor, whether the deceased was beaten to death or died from other causes will have to wait for a clear determination after further examination. The body has now been re-coffined by the deceased's brother in a newly purchased coffin.

### Gasoline Panic Alleviated: Rationing Rumors Completely False

[Report from our Newspaper] On Wednesday and Thursday of this week, a gasoline panic occurred in the city. Rumors abounded, with some hoarding gasoline and others selling it on the black market, with prices soaring to 5,000 yuan per gallon. According to an investigation, the shortage was due to the failure to obtain import permits for the Asiatic Petroleum Company and Socony-Vacuum Oil Company in time. However, yesterday, things returned to normal, and the oil drums sealed by customs have also been opened. However, because there was no gasoline available for two days, many vehicles were waiting to refuel, causing temporary congestion.

The two companies are now transporting large quantities of gasoline from Pudong via barges and distributing it to gas stations in the city through Yangshupu. Regarding gasoline imports, the Provisional Import Control Committee had previously included it in the list of restricted imports, stipulating that government and military agencies have the highest priority, and gasoline companies have the last opportunity. However, the supply of gasoline is not based on a rationing system. The rumors that rationing will be implemented are completely false. Furthermore, during this period of shortage, the Texaco company was not affected in any way and continued to operate as usual.

### Five Errant Employees of Yonghe Industrial Company Arrested

[Report from our Newspaper] Due to a dispute over year-end bonuses, a labor dispute broke out at Yonghe Industrial Company. Five labor representatives, Tong Fukui, Wei Ruoxu, Wu Boshou, and others, engaged in over-the-top actions, surrounding the factory and cutting off food and drink to the management, and obstructing workers from resuming work. The Garrison Headquarters arrested the five individuals yesterday and brought them to justice. The company has two factories with over 400 workers. They went on strike on the 4th of this month, demanding that the company pay a year-end bonus equivalent to three months' salary. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated, ordering them to resume work first, but the labor representatives refused. Under these circumstances, the two sides continued to negotiate, with the labor representatives finally agreeing to reduce the bonus by two days, but the negotiations broke down. The Social Affairs Bureau then stepped in to arbitrate. While the arbitration was in progress, the labor representatives surrounded the management from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, cutting off their food and drink, and forcing the management to sign an agreement to pay a year-end bonus equivalent to two months and twenty-eight days' salary. Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, and Director Wu, upon hearing this news, deemed the actions of Tong and the others to be over-the-top. In addition to approving the company's dismissal of Tong and the other five, they ordered the Garrison Headquarters to arrest and severely punish them yesterday.

### Nile Road Dispute at Wing On Company Under Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau

[Report from our Newspaper] When the employees of Wing On Company were about to go on strike the day before yesterday to demand a year-end bonus, Section Chief Fan Zhenbang of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau personally went to the company to advise against the strike action. It is understood that: (1) The labor representatives of the company are demanding a year-end bonus of 35 days' salary, while the management is willing to pay 30 days' salary; (2) The employees' salaries are divided into 23 grades, and the labor representatives are demanding a year-end grade-level bonus. The management is willing to raise the lowest four grades, levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to Section Chief Fan of the Social Affairs Bureau, the above two items are expected to be agreed upon by both parties.

[Another Report] Regarding the Wing On Company employees' request to the company for advance payment of bonuses, it is understood that: The company's employees had requested a double salary year-end bonus in December of last year. The company's management issued a double salary bonus of one month across the board on December 26th of last year. Now, the employees are requesting advance payment of bonuses. However, the company believes that according to company law, the bonus needs to wait until the year-end final accounts are completed, audited by an accountant, and resolved by the board of directors before it can be handled according to the regulations. However, they are willing to advance a loan of 1 million yuan to ordinary staff and 150,000 yuan to trainees. The employees are insisting on an advance payment of one and a half month's salary.

### North China Daily News Labor Dispute Resolved

[Report from our Newspaper] The typesetters of the English-language North China Daily News went on strike the day before yesterday without negotiating with the management or showing any intention to have the municipal authorities mediate or arbitrate, causing the newspaper to fail to publish the day before yesterday. However, yesterday, they all returned to work and the newspaper was published as usual. The newspaper had previously paid the workers a double salary as a year-end bonus and, as usual, prepaid half a month's salary for January. They also set aside one day for the Lunar New Year holiday. However, the workers again requested that the newspaper cease publication for seven days during the Lunar New Year and requested a loan of 300,000 yuan. The management believed that the city's Newspaper Association and municipal authorities had no regulations regarding Lunar New Year holidays, and the year-end loan was also without reasonable basis. Therefore, the management firmly rejected these requests.

Yesterday morning, after mediation by the Printing Industry General Union and the municipal authorities, and stern instructions to the workers that they should not make such unreasonable demands, the labor representatives accepted the terms and began to resume work. The management will not pay salaries to any of the workers for the strike period because the workers went on strike without following the legal steps of mediation.

### Maritime Patrols Intensified: Smuggling Incidents Gradually Decreasing

[Report from our Newspaper] According to Chen Changrui, Deputy Commissioner of Customs of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the General Directorate of Customs, recently, maritime patrols in Shanghai have been strict, and smuggling incidents have gradually decreased. In the coastal areas of North China, due to the incomplete restoration of commerce, smuggling incidents are still not common. However, in the South China area, with convenient land and water transportation and numerous ports, the trend of smuggling in South China is currently more rampant than in Shanghai and North China. After the State Council specially approved the "Provisional Measures for the Customs to Temporarily Borrow Naval Vessels and Assign Customs Officers to Board Naval or Military Vessels and Investigate Smuggling by Military Personnel," the Guangdong Customs has reported that they have seized smuggled cotton yarn, cigarettes, and other contraband imported by personnel from a certain supply district command, with a very large value. The General Directorate has sent a reply ordering a detailed report on the circumstances of the seizure and the value of the smuggled goods.

[Another Report] The Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Section, in view of the fact that the measures for confiscating smuggled goods and imposing fines are far less effective than imposing criminal penalties on smugglers, has recently proposed that the Ministry of Finance amend the regulations on penalties for smuggling. These regulations have been drafted by Shen Shikun, Deputy Commissioner of Customs of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Customs, and will be promulgated and implemented after being legislated.

### Painter Xu Xiaoxia Commits Suicide: Funeral Service Scheduled for This Afternoon

The famous painter Xu Xiaoxia was from a prominent family in Haiyan, skilled in painting and design. During the early stages of the founding of the Shin-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, Xu devoted much of his efforts. Later, as the cost of living increased, he left Shin-Ya and started his own business as a Western medicine agent. Recently, affected by the dumping of foreign goods, he felt economic pressure and his mental state deteriorated, suddenly committing suicide out of grief and indignation yesterday, leaving behind children. His funeral arrangements are very humble. The funeral service is scheduled for this afternoon at the Central Funeral Home on Gordon Road and Mabai Road. Xu had a wide circle of friends during his lifetime, and they are discussing ways to help with the aftermath.

### Keeping the Roads Clean: Setting Up 10,000 Trash Cans

[Report from our Newspaper] The Health Bureau believes that the reason why the roads cannot be kept clean is not only due to the insufficient number of street sweepers, but also due to pedestrians arbitrarily discarding fruit peels and other waste. To remedy this situation, it is planned to set up wooden trash cans near the corners of roads, sidewalks, and tram and bus stops, so that pedestrians can discard the waste, beautifying the city and improving sanitation. It is currently planned that the district offices will supervise the Baojia leaders to raise funds from residents, businesses, and organizations in their respective districts to manufacture 10,000 covered wooden trash cans, two feet high and one foot square, which will be cleaned by street sweepers on a rotating basis. It is said that the Health Bureau is actively promoting this plan.

### Reader Consultation - Medicine and Health

(1) Mental Distraction

Question from Wang Yizhong: I am nineteen years old and suffer from asthma with excessive phlegm (white, transparent, cohesive, and sticky). I experience mental distraction and am easily startled with slight exertion or brisk walking. Using my brain continuously for one or two hours causes dizziness and brain swelling. I also experience slight insomnia and memory decline. I don't know what illness these symptoms indicate and how I should treat it.

Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi (Medical Doctor): Please immediately go to the X-ray department of any municipal hospital for an X-ray examination to diagnose whether you have pulmonary tuberculosis or chronic bronchitis. You must obtain an accurate diagnosis before you can take appropriate medication. For now, taking various multivitamin pills and injections of glucose calcium vitamin C, etc., will be beneficial for your lungs or bronchitis.

(2) Hemiplegic Numbness

Question from Sun Hong: My wife suddenly suffered from hemiplegic numbness three months into her pregnancy. After consulting a doctor, it was said to be related to the fetal Qi and that she would recover after a while. She felt slightly better after taking several doses of traditional Chinese medicine, but after three months, although the symptoms have lessened somewhat, her hands, feet, and face (all on the left side) are still slightly numb, making movement very inconvenient. Because we live in a remote rural area and lack access to good doctors, I am afraid of delaying treatment, so I am writing to inquire about this illness and what medicine she should take or how she should be treated.

Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi (Medical Doctor): You must check her urine for kidney disease. You must check her blood and blood pressure. If her blood pressure is not high, she can use shortwave diathermy and massage. At the same time, she can take Vitamin B, etc.

### Suited to Current Needs - New Edition of Customs Gold Units (CGU) Notes Issued - Very Good Market Response - No Fluctuations in Prices of General Daily Necessities

[Reported by This Newspaper] The market response to the new edition of Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes issued yesterday was very good. Although the price of gold initially surged in the morning, the closing price at noon returned to normal, and it weakened further in the afternoon. Other items, such as Chinese stocks and foreign currency, were also quite stable. As for general prices, except for daily necessities such as soap, candles, and matches, as well as raw materials such as butter, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid, which have been increasing in price for several days due to their original shortage, other items showed very little fluctuation. Price tags in general companies and firms also did not move. The reporter also inquired about the opinions of people in the financial sector. According to a person in charge of the Shanghai Bank, this issuance of new notes by the Central Bank is actually to meet the current urgent needs. It is inevitable that it will stimulate prices and public sentiment. The degree of stimulation will depend on whether the Central Bank's control is effective. As of today, the overall situation is quite good, and the market has not been disturbed. The future problem lies in whether the Central Bank can continue to control the situation and maintain this good condition. The amount of new notes issued should not be too large. Effective measures should be taken regarding gold prices. If a large number of new notes are issued, and everyone has several new notes in their pockets, then prices will rise invisibly and inevitably. Currently, inflation in our country is an undeniable fact, and the issuance of new notes is only a superficial manifestation of it. According to Shen Rixin, chairman of the Money Dealers Association, the issuance of large-denomination new notes is currently a very natural fact. The general public feels that there is a need for them, and it is particularly rare that the issuance has not caused price fluctuations in the beginning. It is expected that after a considerable period of time, the general public will "not be surprised" by the new edition of Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes. The two types of new notes issued this time are the same size and resemble the original five-yuan Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes. The patterns are also the same. The 250-yuan note is light brown, and the 500-yuan note is blue. They were printed by the American Banknote Company. According to the markings on the notes, the printing year is the 19th year of the Republic (1930).

### Gold Price Once Rose, But Was Eventually Pushed Back Down

Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to increase its control. After rising high, it immediately fell back. In the early morning, with the issuance of large-denomination Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes already confirmed, the market immediately rose to 3.73 million with buyers. After opening, speculative buying was eager, and the price immediately rose, once reaching 3.79 million to 3.81 million. The Central Bank frequently increased pressure, and some stockpiles were also liquidated, gradually falling back. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 140 bars at a price of 3.71 million, and after entering the market, it broke below the 3.7 million level, exchanging at a low price of 3.69 million. At noon, it stood at around 3.72 million. In the afternoon, the forward delivery was again hyped up to 3.79 million. The Central Bank supplied another thousand-plus bars, and the price finally fell back below 3.7 million, falling 10,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry was listed slightly lower at 390,000 yuan. Silver dollars also fell slightly. Private lending rates were slightly tight, and the interest rate was slightly above 15%. Foreign currency was not exciting yesterday. The black market for US dollars initially opened at 6,500 to 6,600 in the morning, but retreated to around 6,400 at noon. In the afternoon, although the price of gold was high, the currency market still struggled to rally and made no progress. The result was a decrease of 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were still unremarkable, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was still traded between 1,220 yuan and 1,230 yuan. Indian exchange rate was 1,480 yuan to 1,500 yuan, and the British exchange rate had offers at 19,700 yuan.

### Public Bonds Inactive

Public bonds remained inactive yesterday. Unified C bond opened in the morning at 2,200 yuan, with 552 office having buy orders, rising to 2,250 yuan. The 503 office sold, falling to 2,020 yuan. Finally, it hovered between 2,050 yuan and 2,100 yuan. As a result, it was 50 yuan more each for A, B, and E certificates compared to the previous day's close, while D was unchanged.

### Foreign Cotton Allocation Meeting to Be Held Today - Cotton Mill Stockpiles Already Reported

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Import Control Committee has scheduled its second meeting for 10:00 AM today at the Central Bank at 15 The Bund. The committee's chairman, Li Gan, members Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, director of the Textile Control Committee's business department, will all attend. During the meeting, the committee will discuss and determine the annual import quota for foreign cotton and its distribution method based on the cotton stockpiles reported by each cotton mill. It is reported that as of yesterday, all cotton mills had completed reporting their cotton stockpiles.

### Six Commercial Banks Temporarily Accepting Tax Payments - Convenient for Citizens to Pay Taxes

The Municipal Bank acts as the city's treasury, collecting various taxes, fees, and other payments. It has already set up 32 collection branches in various districts of the city, specializing in handling collection and transfer matters. Now that the city's business tax, house tax, and municipal construction tax have been opened for collection, it is heard that in order to facilitate the payment of taxes by citizens, in addition to the head office on Jiujiang Road and the original collection branches continuing to collect and transfer payments, all of the bank's first office at 247 Yu Garden Road, the second office at 1450 Zhonghua Road in Laoximen, and the third office at 509 Zhongzheng East Road (west of the Great World) also accept payments. At the same time, the bank believes that the urban area is vast and there are many taxpayers, and it is still worried that taxpayers may still feel crowded, have to wait for a long time, and have to travel far. Therefore, starting this year, it has temporarily entrusted the head office of Zhejiang Industrial Bank (230 Jiangxi Road), the Dongmen Road branch of Zhejiang Industrial Bank (61-63 Dongmen Road), the sixth office of Xinhua Bank (451 Zhongzheng Middle Road), the Nanjing Road branch of Siming Bank (470 Nanjing East Road), the Caojiadu branch of China Industrial Bank (451 Kangding Road), the Four Banks Savings Association (170 Nanjing West Road), and the Yangshupu office of China General Chamber of Commerce Bank (Fish Market) to collect payments separately.

### Autumn Silk May Be Purchased Before the Lunar New Year - Ge Jingzhong Also in Contact with Jin

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Dean Song summoned Ge Jingzhong, the general manager of China Silk Corporation, to inquire about the silk merchants' application for the government to purchase autumn silk. Mr. Ge reported the details. Mr. Song stated: Personally, I cannot immediately approve the government's purchase of autumn silk. This matter must first be discussed and approved with the relevant agricultural and economic departments before a decision can be made on the purchase date and price. It is heard that Mr. Ge went to Beijing last night to contact the two departments. Mr. Ge is scheduled to return to Shanghai today. It is heard that there should be no problem with the two departments approving the purchase. Moreover, the government may make a purchase before the Lunar New Year. As for the purchase price, it should be based on the price stipulated by the China Silk Corporation.

### Industry Insiders Talk About the Reasons for Soaring Egg Prices - Increased Demand as the Lunar New Year Approaches - Lack of Funds Makes Turnover Difficult

[Reported by This Newspaper] Because the price of eggs has soared nearly doubled in the past two weeks, reporters inquired with industry insiders to find out the truth. It is learned that the main reason for the recent egg price fluctuations is that supply cannot meet demand. The main sources of chicken and duck eggs in this city are Hankou, Wuhu, Nanjing, northern Jiangsu, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. From late November to early December last year, egg vendors purchased large quantities of goods from various places, resulting in oversupply. Most egg vendors are small-scale organizations with limited funds. Moreover, the longest preservation period for fresh eggs is only three weeks. Therefore, they all sold at reduced prices, resulting in significant losses. As a result, egg vendors have recently reduced their purchases from various places. And farmers in the production areas, because there are few people buying goods, also mostly consume the eggs they produce themselves. As a result, there are fewer goods available for purchase in the production areas, and prices have increased. On the other hand, in this city, as the Lunar New Year approaches, demand has increased sharply, while supply has decreased daily. The egg vendors' inventory is thin, resulting in soaring egg prices. It is learned that before the war, egg prices were stable because there were large-scale egg factories that mediated surpluses and shortages. Large-scale egg factories had strong capital, sufficient inventory, and refrigeration equipment. When egg vendors faced insufficient supply or disrupted sources, they found ways to supply the market. Now, because there are no large-scale egg factories to regulate the market, and general egg vendors are limited by capital, a deformed situation has arisen where a shortage means a complete shortage for everyone, and a surplus means a complete surplus for everyone. It is hoped that the relevant authorities can pay attention to this and find ways to improve the situation.

### Tianjin Industry and Commerce Loan Application - Central Government Has Not Yet Responded

[Reported from Tianjin, 17th] The total amount of Tianjin's industry and commerce loan application is 80 billion yuan. No response has been received from the central government to date. There is no hope for lending before the old year. More than 100 struggling industrial and commercial enterprises are applying for closure. Only small-scale production enterprises have received the relaxation of lending standards from the Four Banks Joint Office, which is enough to solve their immediate problems.

### Slight Improvement in Sugar

Yesterday, the sugar market experienced ups and downs, with an overall flat trend. The association's price for spot medium white sugar was 135,000 yuan, warehouse receipt 132,000 yuan, and raw red sugar 128,000 to 130,000 yuan, a slight increase compared to the previous day. Tide sugar also saw improvement, with a quotation of 98,000 yuan for Zhuangqing, 95,000 yuan for Shundeqing and Diaoqing. The price for Dianhua white sugar was 150,000 yuan to 145,000 yuan, Xing red 145,000 yuan, secondary 140,000 yuan, and Wenzhouqing 91,000 yuan to 88,000 yuan.

### Factory Numbers Apply for Yarn Allocation - Textile Construction Company Fully Allocates

[Reported by This Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company opened yarn allocation as usual yesterday. A total of 289 households applied, of which 163 were factories and 126 were yarn numbers. A total of 1,024 applications were made, of which 590 were from factories and 434 were from yarn numbers. All were fully allocated. Specifically, two items of 6-count special-grade annual grassy bale, 43 items of 16-count Fengnian grassy bale, 236 items of 20-count Baoguang grassy bale, 153 items of 20-count Shuiyue grassy bale, 22 items of 20-count double-strand Sunlight large bale, 94 items of 32-count Yanghe grassy bale, 103 items of 31-count Xiantao cone yarn, 25 items of 32-count double-strand Xiantao cone thread, 16 items of 40-count Sunlight cone yarn, 150 items of Blue Phoenix large bale, and 180 items of 42-count double-strand Shuiyue large bale.

### Lack of Supply and Empty Inventory - The Dye Industry Feels Depressed - Called "Making a Fortune," But Actually "Superficial Prosperity"

[Reported by This Newspaper] The dye industry in this city performed very well last year, and it is generally regarded as "making a fortune." The reporter visited the person in charge of the Dye Industry Association yesterday. According to him, although the dye industry in this city appears to be making a fortune on the surface, it actually feels quite depressed. The reason for the depression is the lack of supply and empty inventory. Almost all of the dyes sold last year were goods obtained from the liquidation office of Defu Foreign Company, and the sales profit was only about 20%. General dye shops felt that the profit was too low and often hoarded dyes, waiting for prices to rise. However, merchants with smaller capital experienced tight funds and were forced to close down due to high-interest loans. Therefore, whether you are making a fortune or not depends on the amount of capital and inventory you have, and it cannot be generalized. Because dye industry merchants felt that dyes are necessary for various industries, they jointly requested the Import and Export Committee, along with the import and export industry, to include dyes in the list of unlimited imports. However, it has not been approved to date. And the amount of dyes previously ordered from the United States is extremely small. The industry has tried to purchase British dyes from Hong Kong, but it has obtained very little due to supply falling far short of demand. Therefore, the dye industry in this city currently has a "superficial prosperity." This is because the industry's goods are all supplied by foreign countries. Currently, not only is import restricted, but the dye industries in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States have also not recovered. Therefore, this "superficial prosperity" is deeply worrying.

In the upper division of Group A, Hualian, the defending champion, will face Chunmao. Chunmao is a team composed entirely of players from South China, and there will inevitably be a fierce battle with Hualian.

### Yuxiu Cup Middle School Basketball Tournament; Scheduled to Open on March 8th

Registration from February 20th to 28th

### Sending Off the Inter-Port Football Delegation

The city's delegation to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Inter-Port Football Tournament will depart tomorrow. In addition to holding high hopes for the delegation and believing that the delegation will do its best to win the championship, we also want to offer two points as a farewell message.

The ultimate goal of the inter-port competition is not the gain or loss of the championship, but the use of sports competitions by two different places to observe techniques and connect friendships. Therefore, when we participate in the inter-port competition, we hope not only to achieve a fair victory, but also to achieve the ultimate goal. This hope is placed in noble spirit and technical performance. The outcome of the competition has good fortune and misfortune. If our spirit and technical performance are very good, even if we unfortunately lose, it is still glorious. Otherwise, even if we are fortunate to win, the words engraved on the silver cup cannot match the impression engraved in the minds of thousands of spectators. This bad impression will have to wait until the second inter-port competition is held in Hong Kong, with a good performance to regain it.

The inter-port competition is a preparation and foundation for greater integration. Although there are many foreigners participating in the inter-port delegation, Chinese people account for the majority. The technical level of football is the highest in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The representatives we participate in the World Games will occupy most of the places in Shanghai and Hong Kong. We must look ahead and see the future responsibilities and obligations, the responsibilities and obligations of working together to win glory for the country. Although today we are on opposing sides on the court, we will still be comrades on the same front in the future, so we must love each other and get closer to prepare for future cooperation. We hope that Chinese players from Shanghai and Hong Kong can have a pleasant gathering after the game, and everyone can frankly and sincerely study techniques and enhance friendship in a loving way to establish a good foundation.

Respectfully wish the inter-port football delegation a safe journey and a triumphant return. (Wei)

### Full Operation of the Jiaoji Railway

— Jinan, 10th Dispatch from Our Correspondent Li Tian

First Major Station and Bridge Eastward

Perhaps because most of the stations along the Jiaoji Railway were destroyed by the Communist army, the Jinan Railway Station, which was "spared from disaster," has become one of the most beautiful stations in the country in the reporter's direct observation and memory. Although the station building's design is not grand or magnificent, it is of different forms, spacious and appropriate, and has the artistic flavor of the Middle Ages. The three foreign buildings arranged on the north side of Jinan's most prosperous commercial district, one of which includes a five-story clock tower soaring into the clouds, are truly full of infinite artistic and poetic charm when viewed from afar.

The reporter braved the cold wind and stepped into this beautiful station at dawn on the 6th. The passengers at the station were lined up in three long rows of more than ten feet each, buying tickets in order at three different windows. Although there were many travelers, there was no disorder or rush. The few military police officers on the station lazily wandered around, showing a listless expression. The initial impression of this situation, which was far better than the order at stations in places such as Beijing and Shanghai, surprised the reporter. However, after witnessing the orderly progress of each station, not only when buying tickets and boarding the train but also when alighting and exiting the station, the reporter realized the importance of social education. In order to facilitate the inspection of travelers and their identification, the public has naturally developed this good habit.

### The Jiaoji Line, Less Affected by Internal Strife, is Relatively Complete

Originally, the construction of the Jiaoji Line originated from the fact that in the 23rd year of Guangxu [1897], Germany used the pretext of the murder of two German missionaries in Shandong to send troops to occupy Jiaozhou Bay and demanded the construction of a railway from Jiaozhou to Jinan Prefecture and from Jinan to the Shandong border. Construction began in August of the 25th year of Guangxu [1899] and was completed in June of the 30th year of Guangxu [1904] for the Jiaoji Line and the Zhangdian-Boshan branch line. Because this line was built by Germany, sovereignty was always in the hands of the Germans. In the third year of the Republic [1914], when the First European War broke out, Japan took advantage of its participation in the war to invade and occupy it in November. It was not until three years after the end of the European War (the 11th year of the Republic [1922]) in November, after several negotiations and compromises, that we took over. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], when the War of Resistance against Japan began, Han Fuqu retreated without a fight, and it fell into enemy hands again in December of the same year. It was not until September of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], when the Japanese army surrendered and the Second World War ended in victory, that we officially took it back from the enemy on October 29 of the same year.

In the past, although the Jiaoji Line had suffered from foreign aggression, it was less affected by internal strife, so it was considered one of the most complete lines compared to other lines in the country. Since we took over the Jiaoji Railway from the Japanese on October 29 of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the Jiaoji Railway has experienced the most tragic fate in its history in the Communist army's relentless destruction and attacks. Although the Railway Bureau repaired it as it was damaged, the destruction continued to expand, and it became impossible to repair it. It was not until June of last year that Commander Wang Zuomin led the elite forces to personally command and opened up the entire line on October 10. Director Chen Shungeng followed up with a spirit of combat. He directed the emergency repairs and finally connected the rails on December 12. The entire line officially opened to traffic on the 16th, and on January 6 of this year, a special express train arriving on the same day between Ji and Ji was added.

According to statistics from the Railway Bureau, the total length of the Jiaoji Railway's trunk and branch lines is 461 kilometers. However, in the 409 days from the government's takeover to December 12 of last year, the total was:

(1) Tracks: Damaged by the Communist army 949 times (an average of nearly five times every two days). If calculated by distance, the total was 394.285 kilometers, accounting for six-fifths of the total length of the line.

(2) Steel rails: Lost 41,377 pieces; 319,873 sleepers; 94,068 fishplates; 176,400 bolts; 1,269,099 spikes.

(3) Bridges: Destroyed 303 times, totaling 230 bridges.

(4) Station buildings: Destroyed 92 times, totaling 44 stations, totaling 55,290 square meters.

(5) Water supply equipment: Destroyed 14 times, totaling 14 locations.

(6) Signals: Destroyed 68 times.

(7) Wiring equipment: Destroyed 301 times, totaling 8,364 poles and 8,313,597 meters of wire.

(8) Vehicles: Destroyed 204 vehicles.

(9) A total of 279,9427 man-days were spent on repairs, almost equal to the labor and materials required to rebuild a new road. Is this number not large enough? The Communist army's endless sabotage of national vitality and the destruction of life really makes one wonder what their intentions are.

### Completing the Miracle of Opening to Traffic in a Paralyzed State

The reporter took an ordinary express train from Jinan to Fangzi. The so-called ordinary express train actually stops at every station. The train left the station at 8:15 AM. Except for the third-class carriages, where there were a few people standing without seats, there was no ordinary express train on the Beijing-Shanghai line where passengers were squeezed as if they were escaping. However, this line is not without its shortcomings. The slowness of the train and the severe turbulence reminded me of the situation when the "wartime Xiang-Gui Railway had just opened to traffic." A passenger in the same carriage smiled and said to me: "It's much better now. It can travel more than 20 kilometers per hour! It used to be like a bullock cart!" Another said: "There was a period when it was simply a cradle, and the movement of the car made us dizzy." The reporter had never taken it before, so I couldn't compare, but even based on the current situation, it is not difficult to imagine the severity of the Communist army's destruction and the hardship of the Railway Bureau's emergency repairs!

The Jiaoji Railway was originally the only steel-sleeper railway in the country besides the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. However, the steel sleepers under the tracks were stolen by the enemy before the victory. After the victory, due to the continuous destruction by the Communist army and the difficulty in replenishing materials, the surplus materials from other railway lines were mostly allocated. As a result, German, British, Japanese, 30 kg, 37 kg, 41, 42, and 43 kg steel rails were all available, and there were dozens of types, simply becoming a steel rail exhibition. The weight and height of the steel rails are inconsistent, and the fishplates that fasten the steel rails are all made of earth. Since the abnormal fishplates cannot be used, some are even replaced with wood. In addition, the No. 10 switches were originally used before each regular station, but now No. 8 switches are used due to the shortage of No. 10 switches. Under these layers of difficult conditions, it is truly a miracle that the Jiaoji Line can resume traffic from a paralyzed state.

### The Iron Bridge was Blasted and Tilted, and the Scars were unbearable to Behold

From Jinan through Licheng, Guodian, Longshan to Zaoyuansi, all the houses are generally repaired and intact. From Zaoyuansi onwards (except Zhangdian), all that can be seen is a yellow sand, with few trees and few people. All the houses have been almost completely destroyed, with broken walls and ruins everywhere. The road protection trenches on both sides of the track meander eastward along the track, endlessly. The telephone poles on the side of the road are all made of various types of tree trunks that are both thin, short, and bent, and piles of shattered porcelain insulators of the telephone poles still occasionally emit a chaotic flash in the sunlight. Most of the iron bridges were blasted and tilted, and the scars were mottled, making it unbearable to look at. An average of one shelter every few dozen steps must be on the side of the road, and a solid bunker must be every one kilometer (with one at each end of each bridge). Around the bunkers, or attached three or four small fortresses, outside the small fortresses, and there is a deep trench of more than a foot, the trenches are full of wooden thorns, the outside of the trenches is surrounded by branches or wire nets, so there are three layers, and the graves along the road are countless, and many of the soil colors are still fresh. The withered trees and cold crows, the broken tombstones and the residual steles, made the reporter feel as if he were on the northern border and rereading an "Elegy on an Ancient Battlefield."

At 9:25 AM, the car arrived at Zhangdian, which is the first major station since the Jinan car ride. The 40-kilometer Zibo branch line meets here. It is not only the distribution port of Zibo coal, but also a famous domestic light metal production base because the area is rich in aluminum. During the enemy and puppet occupation, a light metal development company was established here, with a large scale and a maximum of more than 40,000 workers. Before the end of the war, the enemy planned to establish an aircraft manufacturing plant here, but it was suspended due to the surrender. After the victory, the factory was taken over by the National Resources Commission, but until now, it is said that the machines are still in a sleeping state and are rusting.

### The First Bridge has Ten Holes, Six of which were Destroyed by the Communist Army

The three stations east of Zhangdian are Xindian. Between Xindian and Zihedian is the Zihe Bridge, the largest bridge on the entire line. The bridge is 350 meters long and has ten holes. Because it was destroyed by the Communist army, six of them have been destroyed. The Railway Bureau used 6,000 sleepers stacked in a well shape to replace the bridge piers, greatly reducing the load. When the car crawled over at the slowest speed, the creaking sound of the bridge piers being pressed could still be heard. There were hot springs nearby. According to the engineering staff of the Railway Bureau, the spring water was very abundant before the war, but it had been cut off for eight years during the War of Resistance. It was not until our emergency repair personnel came to repair the bridge that the spring water suddenly flowed out again, and the spring flow was much stronger than in the past. The villagers were surprised by this, so they all said that God bless China, and the hot springs were resurrected. The Railway Bureau is planning to build a large-scale hot spring hotel and bathroom after the war calms down for passengers to go to Gao Mu.

At 4:20 PM, the car arrived in Weixian, the largest station in the central part of the Jiaoji Line. The final station of the car today was originally Fangzi, more than 20 kilometers away from here (for safety reasons, the Jiaoji Line has not yet opened night cars), but because the express train heading east tomorrow will still start from Weixian, we decided to take advantage of this opportunity to visit Commander-in-Chief Xia Chuzhong, who is stationed here, and then continue eastward tomorrow morning.

### In the Sound of the Express Train Returning Home, Seeing the Economy of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line

— Hangzhou, 12th Dispatch from Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng

The Spring Festival is coming, and this major artery in Jiangnan—the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line—must once again fulfill its responsibility of carrying travelers returning home. Every train departing from Shanghai is always crowded, while every train departing from Hangzhou seems much more deserted. In order to facilitate the return home, the Railway Bureau has specially added a "return home special train," which departs from Shanghai North Station at 10:00 PM and arrives at the city station at 3:00 AM. The travelers are really struggling, but they can't stop the thoughts of the travelers returning home, and the trains carry the travelers back to Zhejiang one by one.

Is it still "the local accent has not changed, but the temples have turned white"? Many people struggling outside their hometowns have temples that have turned white, but the local accent has also changed. Most of us travelers can be said to have grown up in rural society, but today's rural areas have reached an unbearable state. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the author took a stroll through the towns and villages along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line and deeply felt that if the farmers' associations do not take practical measures, then the foundation of China's nation will be blown away.

Two Jin of Meat Cannot be Exchanged for a Dou of Rice

In the rural areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, there is a saying that "a dou of rice for three jin of meat," which means that farmers can exchange one dou of rice for three jin of pork in the city. Now, the price of rice on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line is roughly 45,000 to 46,000 yuan per dan to more than 50,000 yuan per dan, while pork costs 3,600 yuan to 3,800 yuan per jin. Then, at a price of 4,600 to 5,000 yuan per dou of rice, it cannot even be exchanged for two jin of meat. The ratio is too far apart. Moreover, the cultivation and planting of one mu of land is painstaking. On average, each mu can harvest about one stone and six or seven dou, and the labor cost is roughly 2,000 yuan per worker for food and lodging. The capital must be about eight dou of rice, then the capital has already taken up half of the harvest.

Most of the villagers are poor and few are rich. Most of the rich villagers have become landlords who enjoy the benefits. These thousands of poor villagers have no way to invest in the land. So, they borrow money from the wealthy households. Between spring and summer last year, borrowing one stone of rice required paying back one stone and five dou, or even two stones. In addition to repaying debts and capital, farmers need to bear the grain and taxes assigned by the landlords. What is left, I don't know how many jin of meat can be bought? "A dou of rice for three jin of meat" has become a fantasy. Being able to exchange it for one jin of meat is already a joy.

In recent years, it is not enough for the villagers to make a living, so where do they have the extra money to restore their homes? So, the farmhouses are dilapidated, the farm tools are also damaged, and they don't even think about adding new and good clothes.

Agricultural Loans Should Repel High-Interest Loans

Although the government is promoting "two-five" rent reduction, "rent" is "rent," and "debt" is still "debt." The burden of "debt" can crush people to death. High-interest loans are rampant in the rural areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. It dries up the little water left in the rural areas, and it plunders the little financial activity left in the rural areas. Tens of millions of agricultural loans sound good and loud, but the villagers are eagerly hoping that the people who release agricultural loans can move their noble steps, go to the farmhouses in the rural areas more often, don't dislike them for being dirty, and ask them about the actual situation. How much practical benefit have they received from the loans? Has the power of agricultural loans reduced the poisonous flames of high-interest loans? Or has the power of high-interest loans surpassed agricultural loans? I heard the villagers say, "Is agricultural loan just a festering sore?" Some people also said, "The procedures are too troublesome." I think the people who organize agricultural loans should not just be done after lending the money. It's not that they don't care about being thorough after lending the money. But it is necessary to ensure that every penny, the villagers get the benefit of every penny. Every dime, the villagers get the practical benefit of every dime. Only then can the organizers of agricultural loans fulfill their responsibilities.

Rural Festivals Have Turned into Deserted Months

The cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line are, in fact, thriving because of the rural areas. The wealthy residents in the cities have at least a few mu of land and live a leisurely life by renting out rice. The shops in the cities sell luxury consumer goods to the wealthy residents and ordinary consumer goods to the villagers. During the so-called "rural festival" period, each store is three times more profitable, and its "rural festival" period is always after the autumn harvest. Summer is the busy farming season, and it is a deserted month. If you don't believe it, you can go to the cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line to investigate, and you will know that in late summer and early autumn, each store hoards a large amount of goods to sell in late autumn and winter. When winter comes, the villagers have to prepare for the New Year, slaughter pigs and chickens, pickle fish and bacon, and purchase New Year's goods to express respect for the blessings of the Bodhisattva and the ancestors, and finally eat and drink a lot by themselves. The rural areas are too depressed this year, and the rent rice and debts are almost impossible to pay back. How can there be money to celebrate the New Year in a big way? Due to the depression in the rural areas, an unprecedented commercial depression has formed. The originally lively "rural festival" has turned into a deserted day.

Predicting the Prosperity of Beidajie Will Collapse

From this major artery of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, there are three relatively large cities: Jiaxing, Songjiang, and Xiashi. These three cities are all in distress. Many stores are about to collapse. There is an old store in Jiaxing with more than 70 years of history, which was founded in the Tongzhi period and is called Shuntai Livestock and Porcelain Sesame Store. The scale is quite large, but it closed down before the Spring Festival. In Xiashi, Yuji Oil Store, which has always been a pioneer in the oil industry, Yongfeng Pharmaceutical Store, and Yongmaoxing Flour Store have all closed down one after another. Songjiang is no exception, and several stores have also closed down. Studying the reasons for their closure, it is nothing more than too high loan interest rates, slow sales, huge expenses, and the price of goods sold is not worth the price of goods purchased. At the same time, in places like Jiaxing, each store decorates its storefront, which costs a lot. The original intention was to show off their skills in the winter after decorating the storefront, but they didn't know that the winter was unbearably deserted, and there was no way to pay for the decoration fees. The closure of the Shuntai surname in Jiaxing this time is valued at more than 200 million yuan. When the reporter wrote this manuscript, according to reliable information, Jiuhe, a very large silk and cloth store in Jiaxing, has also closed down, valued at more than 130 million yuan. There are many other closures. Some people predict that around the Spring Festival, Beidajie, which was originally familiar, will become desolate and deserted, and there will be many shops vacant on Beidajie, which was originally difficult to find a branch. The depression and desolation of the cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line indirectly indicates the poverty of the villagers. They can't afford to buy things, which affects the stores, and they have no choice but to close down. Return home, return home, may the travelers see their own homes and think about why their homes have become so desolate. The travelers are nostalgic, how can they revive their hometowns?

### Vietnam: In Bitter Struggle From South to North

— January 1st Air Dispatch, Jié Sūn from Hanoi

The day before France received the four prefectures of Battambang, Pibul Khamsongkhram, Champasak, and Lan Xang on the Siam-Vietnam border, I, the reporter, arrived in Battambang. This capital, the most prosperous of the four, has experienced shop closures and mass emigration since its fate was decided to return to French rule, suddenly transforming from bustling to desolate.

Tall buildings were torched by Khmer revolutionaries, and bridges and railways were also destroyed. As French troops advanced into the prefectures, they suffered heavy casualties from revolutionary ambushes. In Battambang, on the day of the reception ceremony, the French had originally planned to make a grand display to show "welcome" and "celebration," but the residents either relocated or remained indoors. As a result, only a few hired poor people waved flags and shouted slogans on the streets, serving as a mere embellishment to the reception ceremony.

Reaching the bank of a Mekong River tributary, as we were preparing to cross by raft, French planes suddenly circled overhead. We quickly scattered and lay prone, but ultimately two people, a man and a woman, died in the machine-gun fire. After the French planes left, I looked at the dead and couldn't help but shed tears of sorrow. However, the Vietnamese youth accompanying me simply looked, gritted their teeth, clenched their fists, and walked forward without looking back. What a moving scene!

We arrived in Thái Bình after half a day. This is a town where both French and Vietnamese troops are stationed. Beyond this, the highway is still in good condition. I traveled by Việt Minh army vehicle to Nam Định. Nam Định, also a provincial capital, is a central point on the transportation line between Hanoi and Haiphong, holding an important position. Half of it faces the river, offering beautiful scenery. The magnificent buildings are second only to Hanoi and Hue in northern Vietnam. The scale of a textile factory there can be said to be the largest in Vietnam. There are over two thousand overseas Chinese in Nam Định. Amid the extremely dangerous situation between the French and Vietnamese, everyone feels insecure and unable to live peacefully. Seeing that I was escorted by Việt Minh troops and not interfered with by French soldiers, they assumed I was a high-ranking official sent by the Chinese government. They gathered to inquire what policies the motherland's government was adopting towards overseas Chinese in Vietnam. I couldn't answer, and tears welled up in my eyes. When friends who knew me saw me, they spoke of the future plight of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, even bursting into tears. The motherland has let down the overseas Chinese too much!

Việt Minh Army: Practicing Independent Struggle

Việt Minh troops have always been stationed in the center of Nam Định, while French troops are stationed on the outskirts. The Nam Định branch of the Banque de l'Indochine is jointly guarded by French and Vietnamese troops. On the second day of my arrival in Nam Định, French soldiers guarding the bank suddenly attacked the Vietnamese soldiers, triggering a large-scale conflict. Gunfire was incessant, shells flew everywhere, and an unknown number of citizens were killed and wounded. Amidst the chaos, at the urging of the Việt Minh side, I retreated from the city to the Việt Minh army headquarters in the nearby suburbs.

The commander, a middle-aged man, had lived in China for many years and spoke fluent Mandarin and Cantonese. I asked about the source and supply of the Việt Minh army's equipment. He said, "We rely entirely on our own struggle. You could say we are fighting an isolated battle. No one has ever provided us with supplies, nor do we expect anyone to provide us with any at this time. What we have is a heart full of enthusiasm. We and our parents have already been slaves, and we cannot let our descendants be slaves again."

I also asked about the Việt Minh's attitude towards maintaining the safety of overseas Chinese. He angrily read out the Việt Minh's statement to overseas Chinese: "…We deeply understand that an independent China is a guarantee of peace in Asia and tranquility in Vietnam. The friendship between China and Vietnam is a natural result between the two nations. You must know that the Vietnamese are your only protectors of your interests in Vietnam, and the necessary and sufficient guarantee of these interests is the independence and freedom of Vietnam." Finally, he emphasized, "We have already ordered our troops to earnestly protect overseas Chinese. At the same time, we also hope that Chinese friends will not be misled by the French side's divisive and provocative schemes."

Việt Minh soldiers, regardless of rank, receive a monthly salary of only six Vietnamese đồng. Coarse rice and simple dishes are the same for officers and soldiers alike. They are very concerned about China's attitude towards Vietnam, often asking me to talk about the current situation in China, with their commander acting as the translator. I stayed at the headquarters for five days, receiving courteous and preferential treatment. When I left Nam Định via Hanoi, several officers and soldiers were dispatched to escort me.

French and Vietnamese Sides: Conducting Emergency Preparations

All the iron bridges on the railway line were destroyed by Allied planes during the war. After Japan's surrender, they were hastily repaired, barely allowing traffic. Now, they have been destroyed again by the Việt Minh. Only parts of the highway are still passable. Residents along the way are stepping up evacuation and reinforcing defenses. French planes also frequently fly over to bomb and attack.

Since the conflicts in Haiphong and other places, both the French and Vietnamese sides in Hanoi have been on emergency alert. The streets are desolate, shops are closed, and war bunkers are everywhere. Government buildings and other important structures are fortified with sandbags and barbed wire. French and Vietnamese soldiers and civilians throw grenades and shoot at each other. The situation is terrifying, a complete mess.

During this period, French Commissioner for Northern Vietnam Sainteny attempted to mediate between the French and Vietnamese sides. However, as the Việt Minh newspapers said, "Due to the reactionary colonialists' firm will to conquer, it did not show any success." There was also a period when both the French and Vietnamese sides were watching the outcome of the French government's presidential election. The Việt Minh newspaper "National Daily" stated, "Regardless of whether the right-wing faction remains in power or the left-wing faction gains power, the Vietnamese nation will always maintain its original stance. The Vietnamese people are always prepared to welcome and support French people who support Vietnamese national independence and unity, and are even more prepared to forcefully resist conquest conspiracies and encroachment that infringe upon sovereignty." The "National Newspaper" also stated, "If Indochinese affairs are still entrusted to the High Commissioner (i.e., General D'Argenlieu), then war between France and Vietnam will be inevitable."

After the French government clearly expressed its attitude towards Vietnam, the "National Salvation Daily" said, "From now on, we are always prepared for long-term resistance, and we must be prepared to enter a more resolute stage. We should not ask when the war will end or when tranquility will come. We should only enter a stage of long-term combat from now on, and this war must end only when the reactionary elements of French colonialism fail in their conquest actions."

French Planes Mobilized, Ho Chi Minh Escapes

By December 17th, the situation became even more dangerous, and a large-scale war finally broke out. French planes mobilized to assist in the battle. The sound of artillery, machine guns, and bombs was deafening. Both sides, as well as Chinese and Vietnamese people, suffered heavy casualties, with corpses strewn on the streets. The Việt Minh Prime Minister's Office and Ho Chi Minh's residence were finally captured by French soldiers after fierce street fighting. According to the Việt Minh secret radio broadcast, Ho Chi Minh narrowly escaped, while Ngo Duy Diem was seriously injured.

It has been almost half a month since then. The French side claims to be conducting mopping-up operations, while the Việt Minh is firmly resisting in the city center. The Chinese Consul-General in Saigon, Ai Zijing, proposed the establishment of a neutral zone in the Chinese quarter, and the French military commander in Northern Vietnam, Molière, expressed agreement. However, this so-called neutral zone is not being respected. The losses to the lives and property of overseas Chinese are impossible to calculate. The most tragic thing is that two young Chinese girls, both under the age of twenty, were captured and raped by French soldiers, barely alive, and then stabbed to death with bayonets in their lower bodies, making it unbearable to witness.

Overseas Chinese are like orphans without recourse. Before the war, they were at the mercy of others, and after the war, they are still treated like beasts of burden, slaughtered at will. The Nanjing massacre, the Dutch East Indies massacre, the Vietnam massacre, are still happening every day. The motherland has let them down too much!

French military and political officials in Vietnam, including Colonial Minister Moutet, Far East Army Commander Valluy, and High Commissioner for Vietnam D'Argenlieu, frequently travel between Saigon and Hanoi to hold meetings or command military operations. Moutet said, "After so many violent incidents in Vietnam, it is of course impossible to reach an agreement with the Vietnamese party." D'Argenlieu said, "In the current stage of the Vietnamese people's development, France does not want to grant them unconditional independence." The French government has also officially announced its determination to deal with Vietnam by force. French soldiers are being transferred east in a steady stream. French Prime Minister Léon Blum, a socialist who often expresses humanitarian views, has also endorsed the use of force against Vietnamese nationalists. Therefore, the war has spread almost throughout Vietnam. In the days to come, the bloody struggle in Vietnam will inevitably become more tragic!

### Parisian Cultural and Educational Festival: A Good Finale, Sino-Foreign Cultural Cooperation as the Main Theme

— Paris 6th Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Hong Fu

"Gatherings are frequent, banquets are numerous," this beautiful line from Du Fu's Southern Suburban Rhapsody can be borrowed to describe Paris after the end of World War II, where grand gatherings are frequent. Today, there are two prominent figures named Xiao in the center of the Chinese intellectual community in France, sharing the same meaning of "banquets" and complementing and relating to each other. The immortal masterpiece of Old Du coincides unexpectedly. Both Xiaos are from Hunan Province, one is Mr. Xiao Shijun, the chief writer of the Kuomintang's typical publication, "Three Principles Guidance," and the other is Mr. Xiao Zisheng (Yu), the former Minister of Agriculture and Mines, the current chairman of the Sino-French Association, and the vice president of the Paris Advanced Chinese Academy. Male and female talents from Chinese universities, in a world of complex situations, cannot possess the skills of ancient philosophers in cultivating their character through calligraphy. Among the students studying abroad, there are many who are good at painting, but those who excel in running, cursive, and regular script are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. It is not easy to find even one in a hundred people, and it is even difficult to find them in various European and American countries. These two Xiaos are both proficient in Chinese studies and are also good at large Roman characters. Paris is a gathering place for talents from all over the world. This alone is enough to describe the rest. It is not easy to have such a wonderful encounter in the famous cities of the United States. Mr. Xiao Zisheng is a leading figure in overseas Sino-Western cultural cooperation. His wife is the daughter of Ling, the former Minister of Finance. She studied education in the United States, and after graduating and returning to China, she married Mr. Xiao. They became husband and wife through friendship, and after their marriage, they traveled to France together. Ling, the Minister of Finance's paintings, more than ten years ago, were once recorded in the world-renowned Paris "Illustration" with three-color printing, showing a rare and vigorous beauty just like himself, naturally forming his own style in Chinese painting. What Mrs. Xiao Ling has been working on in recent years is Western painting, and her figures and flower paintings are all exquisite. Fragrant orchids fill the room, and elegant writings spread their fragrance. The four walls are adorned with treasures, worthy of being combined with Mr. Xiao's cursive five-character couplet to adorn Mrs. Ling, shining with comparable beauty. The couplet reads, "The quiet person has many wonderful thoughts, and the transcendent person's thoughts are not ordinary." The demeanor and spirit of Mrs. Xiao Ling Xiaoyin (Zhuo) can be vividly described by these two sentences. In the past, Zhou Yu was the happy son-in-law of the Qiao family, and this has been passed down as a beautiful story for thousands of years. In comparison, this Xiao Lang is almost inferior. June 8th is the anniversary of the marriage of the two. The two are also leaders in Parisian social circles, with three thousand guests following them. Recently, Mr. Xiao, as an expert, attended the unprecedented United Nations Scientific and Cultural Conference, representing our country, advocating and campaigning. In mid-December, during the grand ceremony held by the University of Paris to commemorate the "Four Great Sinologists Who Passed Away During the European War," he followed Ambassador Qian Jiping, expressing his feelings through others, earnestly delivering a speech, and showing the virtue of the ancient civilized country of the East in treating respected elders with courtesy. Among the so-called four great Sinologists, only Louis Laloy focused on music in his studies. The rest, such as Paul Pelliot, Henri Maspero, and Marcel Granet, either excelled in Egyptian archaeology or were known for their Chinese studies in various countries, all contributing to the mutual assistance of international intellectuals. At the closing banquet of the Scientific Language Education Conference, the Xiao Ling couple hosted a gathering of all the sages (see attached picture of the signature ceremony of representatives and art scholars), soothing the fatigue of all the representatives who had been dedicated to their duties day and night, and even more so a good finale to the Cultural and Educational Festival. The banquet was arranged in a T-shape, with dozens of attendees. The host, Mr. Xiao, sat at the bottom of the T, holding six swallowtails straight, while the hostess, Mrs. Xiao Ling, sat at the center of the painting, at the head of the swallow. On both sides of Mrs. Xiao's seat were numerous talented people, all representatives of the conference in evening gowns. On the right side of Mr. Xiao's seat, the female painter Chen Yuan represented Mrs. Xiao, occupying the first seat, while the reporter and Ms. Zhou jointly occupied the end of the swallow's wing where the T is written to the right. There were four cold dishes: (1) gizzards and livers, (2) dried bean curd shreds, (3) celery shreds, and (4) roasted meat. It was agreed to have four hot dishes: (1) braised fish, (2) fried meat, (3) stir-fried tofu with salt and peppercorns, and (4) stir-fried cabbage with tofu. Finally, each person received a small bowl of seaweed, meat slice, and dried shrimp soup, brilliant and then entering a cool state, with an indescribable sense of surprise. Mr. Li Shizeng's theory of using soybeans to enrich the country, practiced overseas, showed remarkable foresight. Now, having two tofu dishes is not too much, and we should take this opportunity to declare soybeans as a national treasure. Guo Shouliang, Fang Zhong, and other sons in the neighboring seats, who are good at speaking well, competed to propose methods of toasting: (1) allowing single men and ladies to drink together, (2) people with the same surname Zhou, Wang, and Qian drinking together, (3) husbands and wives drinking together, (4) students toasting their teachers and the teachers' wives, (5) old staff members toasting the old minister, opening a new face, and dispersing in joy. The poem is recorded as follows: The paintings and calligraphy adorn the fragrant room. The spirit of fish and water shines like the sun and moon. Xiaoyin has accumulated years of artistry. Xiao Lang is as proud as the prince from another era. The flowers bloom near the river on the sixth and eighth days of the month. Three thousand guests report to the country. The mission is happy to follow the cultural and educational expansion. Ling Xiao spreads her wings over the vast ocean.

### Fuzhou People Worry About Rice

— 8th Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Chen Zheng Yu, this newspaper, Fuzhou

New Year's calendars of the Republic of China year 36 are hung on every household. The city streets are posted with slogans celebrating the New Year and the promulgation of the Constitution in red and green. Although Fuzhou citizens traditionally still attach great importance to the Lunar New Year, the New Year also gives them a new feeling and a lively atmosphere. Especially this New Year's Day, all sectors of Fuzhou were more enthusiastic than in previous years in celebrating the dual significance of the 36th anniversary of the Republic of China and the establishment of the Constitution.

After the New Year celebrations, everyone calmed down to welcome the New Year with good news. This good news is: Fuzhou grain prices have risen three levels, 60,000, 80,000, jumping over 90,000 yuan. The people of Fuzhou restrained their New Year's laughter, calculating with burdened shoulders how to get through the Lunar New Year.

With the firming of grain prices, all commodity prices have also taken the opportunity to change prices. In a word: prices have created a low pressure—the common people cannot breathe.

Two months ago, Fuzhou rice prices hovered around 60,000 yuan per picul, and it was also the autumn harvest season. Most people estimated that grain prices could be stabilized for a while. The laboring poor and public education people all had endless hope for this. However, good times do not last long. In just a few days, grain prices have risen by more than one-third since the beginning of the New Year. Observing the current situation, grain prices still have a tendency to rise again, and the closer it gets to the end of the year, the more serious the problem becomes.

For this reason, the reporter paid a special visit to Fuzhou Mayor Yan Lingfeng and the person in charge of the Municipal Government Grain Regulation Office to inquire about what measures could be taken to suppress the current Fuzhou grain prices to stabilize people's livelihood. According to them, Fuzhou rice mainly relies on transportation from the rice-producing counties in northern Fujian. Secondly, it comes from sea rice from Wenzhou, Shanghai and other places. Recently, with the end of the year approaching, the import of rice from various places has been somewhat affected. Moreover, the hoarding and waiting by rice merchants and the phenomenon of consumers buying New Year's rice are all enough to stimulate fluctuations in grain prices. Therefore, the Municipal Government Grain Regulation Office has opened its ten distribution stations located in various parts of the city, distributing rice to poor households at a price one-quarter lower than the market price, thereby implementing price stabilization. In addition, it is carrying out grain registration, prohibiting exports, cracking down on hoarding and profiteering, etc. Moreover, it has recently sent personnel to Wuhu to purchase a large amount of rice. The plan is really grand, but the rice prices on the market are burning and spreading like wildfire. Remote water cannot put out a nearby fire!

Fuzhou has a population of nearly 400,000 people. According to official statistics, it needs more than 2,000 dan of rice per day. How much rice does Fuzhou have in stock? There is no survey or statistics. The Municipal Government's Grain Regulation Office has reportedly been throwing out hundreds of dan of rice at low prices every day in recent days to supply equalization. Not to mention the fundamental solution, even the palliative solution has very little effect. The Municipal Government does not seem to be able to come up with a fundamental solution to crack down on rice merchants who hoard and manipulate the grain market; nor does it have the necessary means—controlling a large amount of grain (according to the person in charge of the Municipal Government's Grain Regulation Office, the office often controls 40,000 to 50,000 dan of grain at most, and 10,000 dan at least).

The social economy of Fuzhou is already on the verge of an unprecedented crisis—for example, the Fudian Iron Factory and the Fuzhou Electric and Steam Company, which are of considerable scale, are both facing shutdowns due to lack of raw materials, stagnation in sales, and unbearable losses. The Fudian Iron Factory is the only iron factory in the southeastern half of China, and it has been able to manufacture steam engines, hydraulic engines, gasoline engines, and machine tools for the use of industries in the southeastern provinces. Today, it is also unable to support itself. This alone is enough to give a glimpse of the desolate state of Fuzhou's industry and commerce today. Disputes between labor and capital are also frequently heard. If, amidst the overall social depression, the "rice" problem cannot be solved in a concrete way, the strong will fall into the ditches, and the strong will be forced to take risks. Society will form a turbulent and restless situation. Many riots in the past started from the panic of rice and the chaos of the currency system. How can we ignore it?

It is heard that the Fujian representatives of the National Assembly, because the Fuzhou grain problem is becoming more and more serious, have specially jointly requested the central government to exempt the grain levied and borrowed by the central government from the province for military rations, and reserve the price adjustment for the city's grain use. This is certainly good news. However, this alone is not enough to suppress the rice prices in Fuzhou.

The adjustment of supply and demand, the management of grain merchants, and the control of grain by the city government are the ways to solve the grain panic in Fuzhou. The Municipal Government may as well severely punish the grain merchants who hoard and profiteer on a large scale. Fuzhou is the leading area of Fujian, and Fuzhou's municipal facilities are qualified as a political assessment standard for the province. The Provincial Government should also issue an emergency order to the counties in northern Fujian to transport rice quickly to help stabilize the people's hearts.

Winter is deep, and spring is not far away. The people of Fuzhou shiver in the cold winter, and they hope that spring will bring spring news to relieve them of their rice worries.

### Difficult to Get Through the Underworld

— Liu Sui

"Lunar New Year is banned every year, but the New Year is celebrated vigorously every year. The old year is difficult to get through, year after year."

At first glance, this poem looks like a joke, but in fact, these few words express the cause and effect, the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy of "celebrating the New Year."

Do you think I'm talking nonsense? Let's see, there are facts to prove it:

Pork has been soaring to 360,000 yuan per dan in recent days due to increased demand; in order to supply the market with a large amount of cooking oil, the municipal government is considering allocating 5,000 dan of oil from the vegetable oil factory to try to stabilize the market price; the pawnshop industry's settlement is approaching, increasing interest rates and shortening the loan period, resulting in a doubling of profits, ranking above all industries. Why is this? Everyone wants to celebrate the Lunar New Year!

The demand for flour allocation is extremely urgent. Each flour factory specially purchases 48,000 bags of foreign flour to adjust the demand; the Four Joint Offices' production loans recently approved 700 billion first, but applicants are still extremely crowded, so they have to work as usual on Sundays. Why is this? It's still because everyone wants to celebrate the old year.

Starting from the 16th, the Beijing-Shanghai line will add a special train, called the "Returning Home Special Train"; schools will start winter vacation early, called "Ending Early"; institutions and groups will rest for a few days, called "Spring Festival"; the police station will increase patrols, preparing for tension, called "New Year's Eve Preparations"; in summary, isn't it because everyone wants to celebrate the old year?

Prostitution activities are frequent and have invaded the lively urban areas; prisoners released from prison after amnesty, philanthropists are donating winter clothes; postmen demand alcohol money, and the authorities have warned them in advance; civil servants are not allowed to dance, and the municipal government is reiterating the ban; where would there be so many tricks in the Gregorian calendar New Year?

Although the Gregorian calendar has been promoted in every way, the Lunar New Year's grand occasion has never declined. Although the "underworld gate" is more difficult to pass than the "Yangguan gate," everyone has not reduced their courage and interest in struggling to pass the gate. In this way, year after year, from birth to death, only the Lunar New Year seems to always be an indispensable embellishment and decoration in everyone's life history. The facts are all there, clear at a glance!

From this, we can also see a little bit of our moral sentiments: nothing in the world can escape the general rule of "disliking the old and liking the new," but we can do the opposite. We seem to ignore the "new" year, with irony in our hearts, but we treat the "old" year very differently, with drums beating, firecrackers shaking the ground, peach charms on every door, and incense smoke lingering, showing how enthusiastic! How nostalgic! Classical simplicity, dreamlike persistence; we are pursuing comfort and discovering hope in "old" things! Who says that people's hearts are not as good as before and that the world is dying?

However, there is also a regret: on one side of the road, vendors are loudly promoting price reductions, and on the other side, lawyers' announcements of liquidation have been posted next door. Shanghai is a city supported by businessmen, so in this case, the Lunar New Year is inevitably felt to be much more disappointing.

Precisely;

Business is booming? Frozen crabs!

Wealth is flourishing! Flirting corpses.

### Also Discussing Borrowing Umbrellas

— Shao Zhenhe

After Reading "Talking About Bankers"

Overture

The article "Talking About Bankers" begins by quoting a literary figure's definition of a banker, saying that a banker is someone who "lends you an umbrella on a sunny day, and takes it back when it rains." The following is the author's own extended discussion. The tone, while somewhat playful, is indeed based on facts and has a history. Assuming that the literary figure's words can be compared to a quick sketch of a banker, then Deng's article is like an X-ray film of a banker, providing a transparent view.

However, it must be said, "Being obscured by one note, and thus being ignorant of the whole picture" is also unavoidable. The tragic scene that I personally witnessed, in comparison, has some slight discrepancies. Because the story was performed so vividly and movingly that it is impossible to erase from my mind. Here, I also use Deng's approach to start with an opening statement:

Umbrellas, borrow in, borrow out, borrow as much as you like.

Sunny days, rainy days, it doesn't matter.

Just, be careful when dealing with the blind.

Especially, close friends and relatives, how close is close? How good is good? You have to understand it clearly and figure it out.

After the opening statement, let's get to the main topic:

A Banker

I have a friend who is a prestigious banker, but unfortunately, he comes from a scholarly background. This is not to say that scholars are not good bankers, but in fact, a strong scholarly atmosphere is not always suitable. You must know that bankers have basic requirements! The mind, vision, means, scheming, temper, physique, and even the strength of their legs (without leg strength, they can't stand firm) all require special skills to be qualified. My friend not only lacked these many qualities of a banker from head to toe, but also failed to grasp even the most basic facial expressions. Moreover, he has a most serious flaw, which is that he likes to "treat people kindly," specializing in borrowing umbrellas on sunny days and lending them out on rainy days. This is because he is a scholar, values ​​emotions, and fears trouble, and will take good words at face value. However, borrowing an umbrella on a sunny day is so easy; lending it out on a rainy day is so popular, so he kept doing it that way. Doing, doing, and problems arose!

The Blind Man Borrows an Umbrella

Last September, there was a period when money was tight. Naturally, this is what is called a rainy day. My friend usually has good credit and is honest, so for most people it's a rainy day, but for him, it's still a "partly cloudy" state. Umbrellas coming in still flowed in continuously, but the umbrellas lent out had problems at this time. Some said the rain was heavy and refused to return it, asking for an extension. Some even treated the borrowed umbrella as their own. What a joke! A real joke! Haven't you heard the story of "The Blind Man Borrowing an Umbrella" on the radio? I never thought that this well-known humorous story would actually be played out on my friend. As a result, his sunny day turned into a rainy day, and light rain turned into a downpour. It is said that one of the people who borrowed an umbrella from my friend was his closest relative. Being close, he naturally got the news first. As soon as he learned that my friend's umbrellas were being withheld, he was the first to demand the immediate return of the umbrella. After that, others knew that his closest relative was asking for an umbrella, how could they fall behind and show weakness, so they gathered around and forced him to return the umbrellas. So my friend had to return the umbrellas he borrowed, but he couldn't get back the umbrellas he lent out. Between laughter and tears, he felt a shortage of funds! He found that he couldn't balance things! He had no choice but to return all the umbrellas he had accumulated over thirty years to the umbrella owners. If it wasn't enough, he mortgaged the house he had lived in for twenty-five years to return the umbrellas. If it wasn't enough, he sold all the furniture up and down to return the umbrellas. If it wasn't enough, he priced the more delicate and valuable porcelain bowls in the kitchen to return the umbrellas. If it wasn't enough, he also included his beloved Bai Na Ben Twenty-Four Histories, several scattered collections of the Four Collections, plus a few volumes of Ming and Qing woodblock books, all to compensate for the umbrellas.

A Family in Tears

In seventy-two hours, a happy family was torn apart! Finally, on October 4th, dragging a wife who had just been diagnosed with lung disease and was taking medicine, and five boys and girls who were not yet self-sufficient, he left Shanghai quietly with tears in his eyes! Because he treated me as a confidant, he wrote me a letter. The letter was written like a prose poem, and I shed a lot of tears of sympathy for him! Moreover, between the lines, I could guess a little about his recent situation: although it may not be like what Yuan Zhonglang said, "begging in the houses of singing girls, sharing meals from the plates of lonely old men." However, "in a disheveled state, not knowing what tomorrow will bring" is indeed what he is experiencing!

The motivation for my writing this article is not to show any bias towards bankers or non-bankers, nor is it to oppose borrowing umbrellas in and out. To sum it up, it still comes down to the opening statement above! Let me write it again:

Umbrellas, borrow in, borrow out, borrow as much as you like.

Sunny days, rainy days, it doesn't matter.

Just, be careful when dealing with the blind.

Especially, close friends and relatives, how close is close? How good is good? You have to understand it clearly and figure it out.

### "Unfavorable to Go Out" and "Not Suitable for Construction"

— Wu Yu

The following story, although a fable, has profound meaning.

A certain father and son were both staunch believers in superstition, and in everything they did, they had to consult the almanac to choose auspicious or inauspicious days to proceed.

One day, the father was about to go out to collect debts, so he picked up the almanac to check it. Coincidentally, this day was "unfavorable to go out." He was extremely distressed, thinking hard and unable to come up with a solution. Suddenly, he thought of a way. He thought, "Unfavorable to go out" means I shouldn't go out through the "door," right? Can't I drill a hole in the wall and go out? He immediately started digging a hole in the wall and crawled out. But when half of his body had crawled out, the wall collapsed because the foundation was not good. Bricks, tiles, and dirt piled up on his body. He screamed. The son came out upon hearing the sound. The father said, "Son, quickly drag me out! I'm about to be crushed to death!" The son listened, but didn't immediately rescue him. Instead, he ran to the inner room to check the almanac and came out, saying: "Father, today is "not suitable for construction." I think you should lie there for another day! I'll come and drag you out tomorrow."

### On New Year's Eve Dinner

— Tianhong

"New Year's Eve Dinner" is full of the Chinese ethical spirit;

"New Year's Eve Dinner" occupies an important position in folklore.

"Are you returning home for the New Year, sir?"

Then "New Year's Eve Dinner" is the symbol of "celebrating the New Year." Countless "families" are barely maintaining the Chinese social structure. This is the basic and pitiful unit. In this kind of varied unit, it is actually so empty! For many hard-working couples, "home" is just their inn. "New Year's Eve Dinner" gives it substantial content. Although it's simple food, sitting down to eat in the warm candlelight, thinking about the hard work of the year, thinking about the struggle of the year, struggling on the line of life, how much bitterness? How much joy? Only in this unit can you experience it, can you understand it. What kind of emotions, what kind of taste is it to eat this meal!

If you are not Chinese, if you are Chinese but haven't struggled in society for a year, the Chinese "New Year's Eve Dinner" has no meaning for you. People without life's twists and turns, their "New Year's Eve Dinner" is also bland and tasteless. The glory of "New Year's Eve Dinner" should belong to people who work seriously and diligently, and should not be shared by those who are lewd and shameless. What have they done this year? How much blood and sweat of others does their New Year's Eve Dinner contain?

An old mother, in the warm candlelight, prepares a simple meal, thinking of her distant traveling son. With trembling hands, she fills a bowl of rice, puts on a few pieces of vegetables, and prepares a pair of chopsticks, counting it as eating "New Year's Eve Dinner" together, wishing her distant traveling son peace and health. This kind of short story occurs in countless families, and it contains a serious and devout Chinese ethical spirit.

Chinese society is so broken, and the various ways of eating "New Year's Eve Dinner" also contain the above-mentioned spirit. It is a stubborn and indestructible force. The New Year's Eve Dinner in a broad sense is eaten back and forth among friends and relatives, but the truly meaningful New Year's Eve Dinner is in his "home," in this real social cell, "New Year's Eve Dinner" produces positive life values.

Russians like to discuss life, Chinese people taste life, and "New Year's Eve Dinner" is the most obvious manifestation.

Weekend

### Unprecedented Prosperity of Peking Opera

— Chen

Drama

This Peking Opera charity performance jointly organized by eleven groups in this city, which lasted for fourteen days from January 8th, is unprecedented in terms of scale and duration. Famous actors from the North and South, leading male and female roles, perform at the same time. With Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu for female roles, and Tan Fuying, Chen Datao, Yang Baosen, and Li Shaochun for male roles, it is not easy to see so many even in Beijing. It can be called an unprecedented event.

The repertoire is also very complete. In addition to "Red Mane Horse," the evening of "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" was particularly wonderful. The "Linked Rings" by Li Shaochun and Yuan Shihai, the "Sangyuan Meeting" by Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying, capped with Dr. Mei's and the three great bearded actors Chen, Yang, and Zhao's complete "Visiting Mother," are truly all worth watching. Li Shaochun's appearance on stage at 7:30 is indeed rare. Yu-school famous bearded actor Chen Dalou has returned from Beijing with a reputation and has been in Shanghai for a long time. This time he also participated in the charity performance "Visiting Mother" as the messenger, playing the fourth son, singing and acting well from stealing the order to seeing his mother. His performance is above Yang Baosen and Zhao Peixin. The ease and beauty of his hanging beard deserves praise from the audience. Chen was the most popular in the whole play.

This charity performance had so many requests from all parties in advance that several famous actors could not cope, so it was changed to a joint performance, with unified planning and distribution, which reduced a lot of trouble.

On the first night of "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," during the scene in the palace, Zhao Peixin forgot to miss two sentences during the fast-paced duet, which made Dr. Mei rush to catch up. The next day, the scene in the palace was changed to be sung by Yang Baosen. Performing opera is indeed not easy.

Planes crash one after another, but those who travel still travel. Although Li Shifang was killed in Qingdao, Tan Fuying and his son, and Xiao Changhua, etc., still took a plane when returning to Beijing this time, which is quite courageous, and they have now safely arrived in Beijing.

Young male actor Jiang Miaoxiang will be marrying off his son Shao Xiang at the Nanhua Restaurant at 3:00 this afternoon. Invitations were widely sent out a week ago. Jiang has excellent personal connections and a wide range of acquaintances, and it is expected that many people will come to congratulate him.

It was previously rumored that Kun female actor Tong Zhiling would marry a wealthy businessman, but it has now been learned that this is not true. She still lives in Gancun, Luban Road, but often frequents social gatherings. It is said that she will go to a theater in Nanjing to perform during the Lunar New Year.

### Two Good Movies

— Zhang

Movie

"Madame Curie" and "The Great Dictator" are the best two first-run movies this week. Both are biographical films, but the former is serious (but not dull), and the latter is a bit richer in jokes because it tells the story of the famous American humorist Mark Twain. The story of the Curie couple is adapted from "Madame Curie Biography" written by their youngest daughter Eve, so it is quite faithful. However, the process of splitting pitchblende and radium, which they tried 5,677 times over four years before succeeding, is only lightly touched upon with a few shots on the screen—in fact, the suffering they endured in their difficult struggle in a poor environment at that time was more than this.

"Scalpers" will be active

In another three or four days, the Lunar New Year will arrive, and as usual, it will be a time to joyfully stroll around and laugh. Movie theaters will be crowded as usual, and scalpers will inevitably become active again. It is said that the authorities of various movie theaters are taking measures in advance to prevent this. Some want to purchase coupons with certificates, some want to sell tickets in advance, and some entrust "Mou Deli Company" to make reservations on their behalf. In fact, if police officers can strictly monitor in front of the theater doors, wouldn't things be simpler?

### A Goat-Bodied Man Playing the Flute

Music

This is a "fantasy painting": a "goat-bodied man" (with a × mark) who is good at playing the Western flute [a monster in Greek mythology] actually appears in the symphony orchestra, no wonder the music master in charge of the baton is also speechless. (Note: "Foreigners" once appeared in the "Fantasia" film.

Spring and Autumn

### The Sound of the Flute at Night

— Written by Spanish Azorin, Translated by Yan Dachun

1820. Someone is playing a flute at night, it is an elegant, undulating and deep melody.

If we go to the ancient city from the ancient city gate, we must climb a slope. At the bottom of the slope is a river, a plateau embraces a plain, and between two rows of lush old elm trees, there are benches carved from giant stones; in the haze of the night, their whiteness can be vaguely discerned.

Further away, at the end of the path between the elm trees, at the entrance of the village, a beam of light shines on the road; it shines out from a house. If we walk into the wide porch, there we can see a table, in front of the table is an old weaving loom, and next to it is a slanted writing desk, with several music scores on it. We can also see a short old man with white hair and a child. The child is playing a flute. It is playing a slow harmony, which sounds a bit dull in the stillness of the night.

The houses in the city are crowded around the cathedral, the courtyards are all equipped with clear water pools, and there are many small walkways occupied by retailers and harness merchants, and the large houses are decorated with granite badges. There is a garden behind the palace.

Those rare tourists, once they arrive there, always stay at the Astrella Hotel.

Every night, the public carriage quickly passes through the path between the elm trees near the river. When approaching the house with the light, the sound of wood and iron clashing from the bumpy carriage drowns out the sharp flute sounds for a few minutes. Afterwards, the flute resumes playing in the silence of the night. During the day, the old weaving loom in the house weaves, emitting a uniform tone.

1870. Fifty years have passed. If we want to enter the ancient city, we must pass through the ancient city gate. We get off at the bridgehead and cross the river. It is nine o'clock, a piece of silence. Above, in the gathering place of many old houses, several faint lights can be seen. We abandon the tanning works below—those decayed tanning works next to Seranstin, and climb the slope. We follow the path between the lush hundred-year-old elm trees. In the darkness, it is not easy to distinguish the white spots of the stone benches. Over there, a glow shines on the road.

We hear the sound of a flute. Is it coming from that house? The deep and lengthy harmony is like a line of crystal, about to break.

In the porch, an old man and two children are sitting. One of the children is playing the flute, and the other is watching silently, with joy on his face, his azure blue eyes wide open. The old man sometimes guides the child playing the flute. It has been a long time. A long time ago, this old man was also a child. Every night, in the same place, he plays the same harmony with the same flute.

The carriage passes by, and the deafening sound of wood and iron makes the soft flute sound inaudible for a short time. Then, it sings again in the night.

The old houses above are all asleep, the elm trees beside the path are also asleep, and the river is also asleep.

An hour later, the flute sound stops, and the silent and joyful child leaves there and goes to the city. In the city, in a tall old house next to the square, he studies. He studies very tired before going to sleep.

Tourists rarely visit this village. If you come, you have to stay at the Estrella Hotel, because there is no other hotel. That hotel is located on Navance Road, near Basso and Amudin. Most of the tourists come from the countryside and the Angela Road.

How many years have passed?

In Madrid, in a penthouse, there is a white-bearded man, with those azure blue eyes, just like that smiling child before - staring ecstatically at another child holding a flute and playing a deep and lengthy composition.

The man is dressed very plainly. In his room, there is a table with books on it. With the help of a strong ray of sunlight, several faded book traces can be seen. Hanging on the wall are two beautiful photos, one is a photo of a woman, with a pair of thoughtful beautiful eyes and slender sideburns hanging down to her forehead, and the other is a photo of a girl, as beautiful and thoughtful as the woman.

However, no woman's voice can be heard in this house.

The white-bearded man wrote for a long time, and then took his paper and ran to the street. He went in and out of people's houses, talking to people. He often took those papers back to the room and put them in a drawer, along with other forgotten papers full of dust.

1900. The carriage that used to climb the slope by the river every night and take the path between the elm trees to the ancient city no longer exists. There, a railway station has been built.

In the evening, the train also stops in front of the ancient city, but it stops on the other side of the old bridge and the path between the elm trees. Rarely do any passengers get off. One night, a passenger got off. He was an old man with white hair and blue eyes. He was wearing an old coat and carrying a broken suitcase. The old man read the station, and when he walked to the public carriage, the train had already left the station, heading into the wilderness in the dark.

The public carriage took the guest to the best Estrella Hotel in the city. That hotel is famous for its old brand. Its location—no longer on Navance Road, is now next to a major square, in a towering building.

The white-bearded old man was sitting in the carriage, and the car took him away. When the car drove in front of the hotel next to the square, the old man recognized this house, in which he had spent his childhood.

The waiter settled him in a room, the room where he had recited in his youth. He recognized everything, sat down, sighed deeply, and pressed his hand on his tight chest.

He longed to breathe a little air from an open place, walked out of the hotel, ran through those small paths, and he walked and walked. He arrived on the path between the elm trees. The night was clear and quiet. In the silence came the sound of a flute, a clear sound, reminiscent of a crystal-like thread, it was a slow, deep, old harmony.

A beam of light shone out from a house. The traveler approached, and he saw an old man and a child in the porch. The child was playing a soft harmony on the flute. So the white-bearded old man sat on a stone beside the path, with his hand on his tight chest, sadly recalling the past.

### The First Lie

— Qian Fan Jun

— Reminiscences of a Dream—

In the autumn of my fourteenth year, I successfully entered middle school. Having fortunately secured first place in the county-wide elementary school graduation examination, I was recommended by the County Bureau of Education for free admission to the county's middle school. The difference in environment between middle school and elementary school was far greater than the difference in academics, and my simple, youthful mind began to grasp the complexities of the world. In particular, the deliberate avoidance between male and female students made me also feel a sense of shame between the sexes. Studying and playing together, which were common in elementary school, had become a warm memory that could never be recovered, like withered flowers, causing a feeling of sadness. Thus, I became lonely, but my heart slowly grew fervent.

To tell the truth, at that time I did not understand "love" and "romance." However, I was attracted to a female classmate who was taller than me and not particularly pretty. She was like the winter sun; when she was gone, I felt cold and lonely. In that state of mind, I wanted to approach her silently. However, I was afraid of interacting with her, because shame had dug a deep trench between us, separating boys and girls on either side of the trench... In such a conflicted state of mind, I began a solitary, unrequited love.

She was a boarding student from afar, and her dormitory was next to our classroom. Those who arrived early could carefully count them as they held their bowls and scurried across the corridor to the dining hall for meals. From a certain morning onward, for her sake, fearing any delay, I became the earliest visitor every day. The sun always rose later than me; I had suddenly become so fond of early risers!

Like an engraved printing block, I leaned against the window sill every day, silently counting their footsteps, watching them enter the dining hall, and greeting them as they came out laughing. Their scurrying would increase the circulation of my blood, and a light glance from her eyes would paint my face with a feverish blush. But my heart was at ease, and the most important matter of the day was thus settled. So, I turned half of my attention back to studying my lessons. It was as if I had something, and every day I endured my own pain, thus obtaining a bit of warmth in my heart...

My parents loved me, my teachers also liked me, and my classmates respected and envied me. My early rising further increased their love for me, their liking for me, and their respect and envy for me. Whenever my parents heard the sound of me getting up, they always added a few words of instruction: "Although studies are important, health is even more important. You need a little more rest!" When the teacher saw me sitting alone in the classroom, they always stroked my shoulder and said, "You should pursue both learning and health together!" When my classmates saw that I had arrived at school before them, they always said, "You already got first place, do you want a special first place?" These words often made me feel pain, I certainly hadn't forgotten my studies... And in their misperception, I hid my secret very well.

Paper cannot contain fire, and studies cannot withstand the test of neglect. In the first monthly exam, I actually dropped to a grade of B. This surprised my parents, surprised my teachers, and surprised my classmates. Thus, the physical education teacher's "famous saying" spread throughout the school: "The intelligence of young people during puberty will decline." I became a witness to this "famous saying"... But the clearest was still myself. Although I regretted that the glory of the past would fade from now on, I rejoiced that my secret would be hidden forever...

From the second month onwards, even she looked at me with disdain. My early rising only made my parents doubly affectionate and the class teacher puzzled. My classmates no longer provoked me. In a more solitary environment, I needed more warmth, and I did not neglect a single morning.

After all, there came a day when I leaned against the window sill as usual, watching them skip and jump into the dining hall, and greeting them as they came out laughing. When I was about to turn half of my attention back to studying my lessons, I suddenly realized that the class teacher's breath was close to my shoulder. I was forced to cry out, fearing what kind of humiliation I would encounter after my secret was discovered...

"Fan Jun! What's wrong? What's wrong? You're too strange!"

"..."

Silence seemed to be revealing my secret, and terror forced me to blurt out the first lie: "I saw a bearded man..."

A lie earned me the bad name of "seeing a ghost in broad daylight." The teacher and my parents also forced me to rest for a week. But who understands my true heart!

### Comedy

— Li Wenxun

Mrs. Gao got up today after ten o'clock. The weather was really too cold. Getting up every day was like a kind of torture for Mrs. Gao.

Although she woke up very early, she was a little reluctant to leave the warm blanket. Finally, she made up her mind, jumped out of bed in one go, put on her coat, and sat on the toilet reading the newspaper. This was Mrs. Gao's habit. This always took a full half hour, and then she got up with the greatest determination and began to groom herself in front of the vanity. She washed her face, gargled, powdered herself, drew her eyebrows, applied lipstick, and turned and looked in the full-length mirror. She was satisfied with her waist, hips, chest, back, and hairstyle. A very charming expression moved the old woman greatly, and she stood in front of the mirror in a daze for a long time, then sighed softly. She nodded slightly, and couldn't help feeling a little pity for her own youth-like beauty.

Mrs. Gao—judging by appearance, she was no more than forty years old. She wore a seal fur coat, a red woolen scarf, high-heeled leather shoes, a French cap, glass silk stockings, and her ten fingernails were red and lovely, and pointed and lovely. Her small eyes were full of affection under her crescent-shaped eyebrows. Her cheeks were as coy and red as a virgin's. Her hairstyle was also very young and fashionable. From head to toe, even from her seductive sleeping posture, from her smoking and toilet habits, everything was completely "Shanghai-style." Her breasts and waist, needless to say, were even more "Shanghai-style."

She sat on the velvet sofa reading the newspaper. Zhang Ma brought in a glass of milk. Mrs. Gao said, "Zhang Ma, go to Lu Gao Jian on ×× Road today to buy some braised duck to change the taste."

As she spoke, she took out five thousand dollars from her glass leather bag and handed it to Zhang Ma. The maid, who was in her thirties and had just arrived, said timidly, "Madam, I don't recognize Lu Gao Jian."

"You confused idiot, it's the one we went to buy chicken butts with you last week." Mrs. Gao glared at her, then lowered her head to read the newspaper.

Zhang Ma was a little confused as she walked on the road. Although she had gone to buy it last week, she had long forgotten how to get there. She wandered around aimlessly, not knowing where to go. Finally, with no other choice, she bought five thousand dollars' worth of braised duck from a shop called "Shan San Zhen" and brought it home.

Mrs. Gao's sense of smell was very keen. She picked it up and smelled it, and her face suddenly changed. She shouted loudly:

"Can you fool me? This is not Lu Gao Jian's duck, take it back and exchange it!"

Mrs. Gao's temper had always been like this. Mrs. Gao was one of Lu Gao Jian's old customers. After eating it too much, she couldn't do without Lu Gao Jian's food. She even developed an addiction, and only Lu Gao Jian's things could satisfy her craving.

Zhang Ma had no choice but to return to the bustling street, turning around and around, her brows furrowed and her face full of worry. Suddenly, she remembered that the last time she went to Lu Gao Jian to buy duck with her madam, there was still a sign paper left in the kitchen.

"I've got a solution, I've got a solution now." She thought happily in her heart.

She hurried home, went to the kitchen first, replaced the Lu Gao Jian's sign wrapping paper, and happily took it to the room, shouting happily:

"Madam, I finally bought it, it was so hard to find."

"You confused idiot." Mrs. Gao glared at her again, then picked it up and smelled it, and couldn't help laughing like an old cat, hehe said:

"This is Lu Gao Jian's duck, the taste is very different!"

### Still Water

— Dong Fangming

Still Water

This is a pool of dead, still water.

There is no chattering of fish, no chirping of birds, no fragrance of flowers, no human voices. It is just quietly, quietly alone there, as if it has long been forgotten.

Occasionally, a gentle breeze blows past, and ripples appear on the surface of the water.

Occasionally, a few streaks of sunset clouds sneak in at the edge of the sky, painting it with a few strokes of splendor.

This moment is beautiful, but it disappears immediately.

A frog jumps in from somewhere, and the edge of the still water has the singing of "ge ge."

This moment is lively, but it also disappears immediately; because the frog also cannot bear the loneliness of the still water.

Only the affectionate breeze and the gentle sunset clouds still come to comfort it from time to time; blowing up ripples for it, painting it with a few strokes of splendor.

But in an instant, they all disappear, disappear, and it is still quietly, quietly a pool of dead, still water.

Plain Candle

A small, plain candle that deeply loves to illuminate this dark, small room.

Every night, when the electric light habitually closes its eyes, when all sounds are silent in the vast darkness, in the desolate and lonely midnight, the candle is my best companion.

It is not needed at grand banquets; it is despised in places of red lights and green wine; all those who are lively in the human world will not remember it; it only lives in dark corners, it lives in the hearts of the lonely.

In the darkness, it peacefully shines. It will not flatter, be trendy, or cajole. It will always be lonely and peacefully emit a faint light, illuminating itself, illuminating the darkness, illuminating lonely eyes.

How many odes of the times, how many sentimental writings, are resonating on the heartstrings of the lonely, it will not be understood by all those who are lively in the human world.

It burns, emitting light and heat. It is always a sinner of the darkness, warming the hearts of the lonely, sacrificing its body.

Has anyone ever seen a bean-like candlelight in the immense darkness and cheered and danced? It not only warms the hearts of the lonely, but also illuminates countless people groping in the darkness.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 154

— Ye Jingfeng

The two exchanged blows with their weapons, and the person stumbled back three steps. Squatting low, they assumed a half-sitting, half-kneeling posture, holding the sword with both hands, the sharp point facing He Jian. This posture indicated that the person was a woman; He Jian was, of course, immediately aware. The woman was rather short but quite sturdy, without any delicate or graceful figure. Her head and face were covered with a white veil, making it impossible to see her features, but she was wearing a dark, fitted outfit. If it weren't for that white veil covering her head and face, He Jian would have mistaken her for a member of the Black Dragon Society.

What does "Hirano Sect" mean? It is a sect of Japanese swordsmanship. There are many sects of Japanese swordsmanship; famous families all have a sword master, and each lineage has a few different skillful moves. This "Hirano Sect" occupies the position of the orthodox leader among the various sects, so it is naturally powerful. When Xian He Jian turned around to meet the attack, he was already surprised, because judging from the sword's movements, he knew that her swordsmanship had already reached the seventh level, and he wasn't necessarily much better than her. The only way to win was to use oiling.

The two exchanged blows, and a formal battle began immediately. In the seventh level, the outcome cannot be calculated in rounds; sometimes the winner is decided in just one round, and there is no fixed length of time between the first and second rounds. Sometimes it is very short, but sometimes it takes ten minutes or more, with both sides fighting fiercely. In the midst of fierce fighting, although there are retreats and advances, they are all using their own spirit and aura to confront each other. However, this female swordsman had a rather impetuous nature. In the first few rounds, there were still one or two minutes of fierce fighting without engaging weapons. When she saw that He Jian was using an oily fighting style, she changed to an offensive posture. After attacking about ten times, she suddenly passed the long sword to her right hand and drew a seven-section staff from her side, attacking even more fiercely. As a result, He Jian saw that the opponent was actually a formidable enemy, because wielding blades with both hands was rare even among men; this woman was actually so audacious, which showed that her skills were very high, and he had to be very careful.

Who knew that just when He Jian was fighting one against one and felt that the opponent was not easy to deal with, he suddenly caught sight of several swordsmen from the Black Dragon Society falling to the ground at the same time. One of the enemies, who had gained the upper hand on the opposite side, flew towards He Jian, seemingly to support the audacious woman and attack him together. At this moment, a distant, muffled, steady sound like "shakuhachi" (Japanese flute) suddenly came, sounding like a ghostly wail carried by the wind. Immediately, a similar muffled sound echoed from under the trees on this side, making him very surprised and suspicious, not knowing what was going on. None of his own men were visible, and he couldn't even get a signal or other warning.

The sound of the flute under the trees was choked and mournful. The person who had come forward to attack had already rushed to He Jian like a gust of wind. He Jian was prepared and feigned a move, then moved two steps to the side, so the three of them formed a triangular formation. The person who came up was also a small person, dressed exactly like the female swordsman; but his movements were much more agile, and his body looked like a woman's, with a slender and graceful waist. His head and face were also covered with a white veil.

Just as the three of them were about to adjust their swords, the person who had arrived later took only one step forward, feigned a swing of his weapon, and then spoke. He was facing He Jian, but the words were directed to his accomplice. Hearing the voice, He Jian knew it was Pingzi again:

"Sister Chunzi, how is it?... Have you tested his weight, probably?... The flute is playing, we should go." Then he changed his tone: "Brother Qin, what kind of hero are you being?... Your comrades have already retreated safely, hee hee..." As he spoke, the small groups dueling in other directions had already dispersed their formations. The mixed group retreated while defending. The strange thing was that the members of the Black Dragon Society didn't seem to intensify their pursuit, as if they were somewhat hesitant, allowing the foreign swordsmen to retreat.

### Living in Paradise

— Shu Xiang

Do you know the tricks of how people in paradise live? Here is a story for you.

A young master in paradise only had a thousand dollars in his pocket. He wanted to live a young master's life for a day, but a thousand dollars is so pitiful in this high-priced life! But he has a way to deal with it.

He got out of bed. As usual, his wife was the first to go to the Tiger Stove to get hot water. A hundred dollars for hot water, half of it was left in the thermos, and half of it was used to wash his face.

The sun shone on the courtyard, and it was time to buy groceries. He took the grocery basket to the street and ran to the entrance of the dim sum shop, swaggering in.

"Bring me an order of pork soup dumplings," he shouted.

The waiter brought it to him.

He hunched over the corner of the dining table to eat. First, he ate the skin of the soup dumplings, drank the soup, and while the diners weren't paying attention, he wrapped the meat filling in a lotus leaf, looking like he had bought it from Lu Gao Jian.

After paying the bill, he went to the vegetable market and bought two hundred dollars worth of cabbage, filling the grocery basket to the brim.

"Meatballs in vegetable soup," the young master ordered his wife when he returned home.

It was time for lunch, and his wife knowingly cooked the meat filling and cabbage together for the two of them to eat.

"What kind of vegetable is it?" a neighbor friend walked in and asked.

"Meatballs in soup," the young master replied cheerfully.
