There were 227 graduates from St. John's (including four Americans), 61 from Zhijiang, and 133 from Soochow. Over a thousand people attended, including faculty members from the three universities, honored guests such as Ambassador Stuart, Po Huiqing, Kung Hsiang-hsi, and Gu Yuxiu, as well as Dong Xifan, president of Tongji University, representing Minister Zhu. The auditorium was decorated simply and solemnly, with the national flag hung high in the center and the school flags of the three universities displayed below. The graduates wore academic gowns, and Ambassador Stuart, Po Huiqing, Dong Xifan, and the presidents of the three universities, Tu Yuqing, Li Pei'en, and Yang Yongqing, all wore doctoral gowns and sat in the front row of the rostrum. The Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra played music at the invitation, and the graduation ceremony began precisely at 10:00 AM. The graduates entered in order to the sound of music. After the national anthem was played, Reverend Xie led the prayer. First, President Yang Yongqing of Soochow University delivered a speech, explaining that the three universities have always educated and trained students with moral principles. At this time when the country is facing many challenges, the graduates should serve the country in accordance with these principles after graduation, so that their brilliant contributions may be magnified.

Following this, Mr. Dong Xifan gave a speech, saying in brief: "Unity can increase strength, and unity is also the noble principle of modern times. The three universities will be united in the next semester to become East China University. Today, we are holding a joint graduation ceremony. In the future, the joint management of the three universities will definitely make brilliant contributions to the country," then he continued with the two points of encouraging everyone to carry forward the excellent traditions of the three universities and teach by example. As the ceremony was held in the Grand Theater, Mr. Dong concluded his speech with the four characters "Magnify the Light," expressing his congratulations. After Mr. Dong's speech, Dr. Lin Qingjun gave a solo performance to add to the atmosphere.

Citizens as Leaders Should Practice Constitutionalism

Ambassador Stuart then delivered a speech in fluent Chinese, stating briefly: "I feel very honored to participate in today's grand ceremony. Every time I participate in your country's student graduation ceremonies, I have infinite feelings. Today, your studies have come to an end, and your careers are just beginning, just as the three universities are now merging and will become a united university in the future, which will definitely make historical and complete contributions. This is both an end and a beginning." The ambassador then pointed out: "The Constitution passed by your country at the end of last year will begin to be implemented at the end of this year. This is truly a new era, unrepeatable in your country's thousands of years of history. The fact that you are completing your studies at this time when the Constitution is about to be established has profound significance, and the responsibilities you bear are also immeasurable. The current international and domestic situation in your country is facing extreme crises, and you will inevitably feel depressed. Fortunately, your country's democratic system is about to be realized, and you should act as 'citizen leaders,' earnestly practice constitutionalism, so that the democratic system can avoid being merely nominal."

Support the Government and Realize Democracy

The ambassador also explained that there are currently two major ideologies in the world: one is autocratic dictatorship, and the other is democratic freedom. The latter is extremely valuable, so President Roosevelt's Four Freedoms should be accepted and promoted by your country's enlightened youth, and become the goal that your country's people unanimously pursue. The ambassador quoted the words of the philosopher Plato: "The task of young people is to be dissatisfied with reality." But this should not be a passive dissatisfaction with reality, but rather a striving for reasonable improvement and progress. The government should meet the demands of the people, and the people should sincerely support the government, supervise each other, and work together to fully realize the democratic system. He also hoped that China and the United States would permanently maintain their traditional friendship and cooperate closely to strengthen ties in the current turbulent international situation. The ambassador's speech lasted half an hour. The awarding of degrees then began, and Dr. Yan Huiqing reported on the progress of the preparations for East China United University. The ceremony concluded at half-past twelve.

### Wimbledon Tennis Tournament Opens; Kramer Calls for Supreme Effort; Three Australian Players Will Be Formidable Opponents

[United Press, London, 22nd] The All England Tennis Championships are scheduled to open on the 23rd at Wimbledon. American and Australian players will compete on the grass courts. British tennis critics, due to the poor attitude of Australian players who withdrew from the Queen's Club Championships, have essentially rejected them from the Empire and are leaning towards the United States, believing that American players winning various championships is in line with the people's choice. Wimbledon officials have allocated seeded players in a way that gives American players the right to hope for victory. Kramer, who lost the singles championship last year due to a hand injury against Czech left-handed player Drobny, has now worked hard to refine his skills and is the number one seed for singles. The Sunday Times commented that Kramer is a great tennis player and a good sportsman. If Kramer wins, he will be warmly welcomed by the admirers here. The Sunday Pictorial stated that Brown, Pails, and Geoff Brown are the three most likely to defeat Kramer, all of whom are Australian players. However, an American winning another British championship would be a victory that deeply resonates with the people.

Former Chairman of the Board of the Physical Education College, Zhang Boling, visited the school and found that the restoration work was practical and rapid, and everything was gradually returning to its former state. He urged Principal Lu to restore the Physical Education College as soon as possible to make great achievements. In addition, the school buildings and land formerly occupied by the Eighth Grain Depot have been recovered, making the school site even more spacious. It is reported that the two board meetings of the Physical Education College and the Middle School Department will be held soon to decide on future expansion plans. Moreover, this year coincides with the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Physical Education College and the 1st anniversary of the establishment of the Middle School Department. It is planned to hold a joint celebration ceremony at the same time. Alumni from all over the world are preparing to celebrate and discuss assisting the school's restoration. It is planned to convene a general alumni meeting in Shanghai in mid-July. The period will coincide with the opening of the Liangjiang Swimming Pool, and the board meeting and school celebration will be held at the same time, which is expected to be a grand occasion.

### The United States Assists China in Stabilizing Prices with Six Daily Necessities; A Special Allocation Committee Affiliated with the Central Trust Bureau Will Sell at Parity Prices in Eight Major Cities

The United States recently assisted us in selling six daily necessities at parity prices. President Zhang Jia'ao of the Central Bank, upon instruction, organized an agency to be responsible for handling the matter. After consulting with various parties, President Zhang decided to form another committee to preside over the allocation. According to inquiries by a reporter from the Associated Press, this committee has already been formed and is temporarily affiliated with the Central Trust Bureau. The organization is named the Advisory Committee on Allocated Materials of the Central Trust Bureau, with seven to nine members. Representatives from relevant agencies such as the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, the Grain Department, the Central Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau will serve as members. This committee is a planning agency, and in the future, various materials will still be executed by the competent authorities responsible for the allocation. These materials include six types: rice, fuel, cloth, cotton, flour, and sugar, valued at 60 million US dollars. They will be sold at parity prices in eight major cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, in order to stabilize prices and stabilize people's lives. The position of Chairman of the Committee has been appointed by President Zhang to Ren Xianqun, a current affairs member of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee, and preparations are actively underway.

### Credit Tightens; Rumors Abound; Hua Stock Market Reveals Fatigue at Closing; Yong Yarn Once Reached a New High But Ultimately Rose Slightly

Although there were many rising stocks in the Hua stock market yesterday, credit has tightened. Bullish operators added to their positions, and although there was some movement in the middle, the underlying trend was clearly weak. Hong Kong Shanghai Electric Company shrunk drastically, the wind of rising material prices was fierce, and Yong Yarn once again reached a high price. In addition to the fact that Meiya rose to the limit, business also stopped rising, revealing signs of fatigue. Yong Yarn gradually showed signs of exhaustion, and near noon, rumors of a suppression order spread. There were many securities firms, plus forced sales, and the market closed in a tired state, with an unfavorable trend appearing.

In the early morning, news that there were signs of free buying and selling of gold caused considerable confusion. But the opening was still expensive, and after the opening of Yong Yarn, No. 157, No. 129, No. 224, and No. 200 were released one after another, and the market fell to 8,750 yuan. No. 89, No. 61, No. 85, No. 60, No. 213, and No. 171 came in, and rose to 9,100 yuan. No. 224, No. 223, No. 89, No. 235, No. 24, No. 76, and No. 102 were still released, and fell back to 8,900 yuan.

No. 235, No. 224, No. 106, No. 164, No. 112, and No. 89 bought more, forcing it down to 8,800 yuan. No. 102, No. 153, No. 117, and No. 129 once advanced to 8,950 yuan. No. 224, No. 85, No. 186, No. 144, No. 31, and No. 30 discussed again, and lithium root saw tightening and fell to 8,780 yuan. No. 129, No. 32, No. 223, No. 224, No. 89, No. 119, No. 232, No. 117, and No. 219 all came in. After No. 30 was released, the counter was depleted. Business was raised from No. 226 to the limit, and Yong Yarn rose to a new high price of 9,350 yuan. After entering, No. 222, No. 102, No. 157, No. 160, No. 36, No. 224, No. 14, and No. 89 released one after another. Meiya spot was raised to the limit by No. 153, and then fell to 9,000 yuan. The various small investments and miscellaneous brands were extremely sluggish. No. 215 and No. 85 bought in to 9,100 yuan. No. 231, No. 224, and No. 91, as well as retail investors, released one after another, and returned slightly to 8,800 yuan. No. 76, No. 32, No. 24, and No. 142 came in. The initial report of the shrinking of the Hong Kong Shanghai Electric Company to 12 and a half yuan rose to over 9,100 yuan. No. 224 and No. 91 did not stop releasing, falling to 8,900 yuan. The secondary report of the shrinking of the Hong Kong Shanghai Electric Company to 12 yuan and 3 cents was bought in by No. 171. After No. 32 and No. 91 were released, they rose again to over 9,150 yuan. The rise ended here. The multiple parties in the industry, such as No. 129, No. 85, No. 224, No. 183, and No. 157, all sold. It was reported that the National Government would issue a suppression order to the Communist Party within the next week, and the closing was declared to be disintegrated. Liann also fell to the limit. The Shanghai and Yong Yarn fell to within 8,800 yuan, and then stabilized. After closing, the shout price was first lowered to below 8,750 yuan, and finally stood at around 8,780 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the stock market, Meiya rose to the limit and then recovered, rising by 10%.

### External Stock Market Environment is Poor; Uniform Bonds All Return Slightly

The high prices of foreign stocks yesterday could not last. Some people in the speaking industry and the gold industry released, and the Guang Gang, the Northern Gang, and Hesheng and others came in. Although the Hong Kong Shanghai Electric Company reported a shrinkage to 12 yuan and 3 cents (lower to 12 yuan in the afternoon), due to the poor environment, Yisha fell from 8,000 yuan in the early morning to within 76,000 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the industry, the Guang Industry, the Shipping Industry, and the Steel Industry were flat, Yisha fell half a percent weaker, Huiduo rose slightly, and Yinglian Paper Yipi fell slightly.

Government bonds returned slightly after yesterday's low. Tong Bing saw a low price of 6,000 yuan in the morning.

### To Save the Decline and Develop Business, the Pharmaceutical Industry Formulates Countermeasures; Five Key Points Submitted to the Authorities for Assistance

[Our Correspondent] According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: There are a total of 85 members of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association in this city, of which 7 are manufacturers of sanitary equipment. Those with more complete scale, such as Xinyi, Xinya, Shenghua, and Yangshi, are equipped with pharmaceutical preparation, dispensing, and processing work. Most of the others are engaged in dispensing and processing. During the Anti-Japanese War, the source of Western medicines was cut off, and many factories made inventions and progress, but the cost was very high and could not compete with imported products. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, the pharmaceutical industry presented a deformed prosperity, and the number of pharmaceutical factories increased greatly for a time, and many of them took the opportunity to pursue profits without a solid foundation. Since the victory, imported goods have entered one after another, and a large number of surplus materials have been sold at low prices, resulting in small factories weaving and closing down, and large factories also shrinking their scope. The dangerous situation is the most serious of all industries. Since the establishment of the Transport Management Committee, there has been a slight turnaround. It has been heard that the Pharmaceutical Industry Association has formulated countermeasures to save the decline, and the main points are as follows: (1) Request the government to issue a notice to all military and civil agencies and public hospitals to give priority to ordering domestic medicines when purchasing goods. (2) The US military's surplus medicines of the Material Supply Bureau are estimated to be enough for the whole country for five years. It is planned to ask the Bureau to allocate 20% of domestic products when allocating US military medicines to Ye merchants, so that the domestic art products market will not be completely occupied by foreign goods. (3) Foreign medicines should be restricted and prohibited from import according to their different properties. Among them, primary raw materials are restricted from import, and complex chemical products that can be made in China are planned to be prohibited from import. Preparations and biological agents are in principle not allowed to be imported. (4) Imported medicines should be strictly inspected by the health authorities before being sold, in order to protect the health of the people. (5) When surplus materials are sold, the original labels should be removed to avoid doing propaganda for foreign goods for free.

### Artificial Silk Sees a New High Price

Yesterday, the opening of artificial silk in the city was slightly better because the stock market was small, so No. 120 Jin Sanma first sold 22.3 million yuan, and it circled to 2.6 million yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, because factory silk reached a new high price, the holder insisted on rebounding, from 3 million yuan to the final 3.7 million yuan, an increase of 700,000 yuan compared to the previous week. The other brands of goods rose and fell accordingly.

The factory silk market yesterday also reported a frenzy, and the asking prices at all levels reached new highs. However, because the asking prices were too expensive, no one cared about them, so the five-needle tops had only asking prices in the market yesterday, and there were no transactions. There were some transactions in the middle grade, with the opening price between 28 million and 9 million yuan, and the high grade had a transaction of 30 million yuan. The opening price of the dry warp was 19 million yuan in the morning, and the asking price rose again in the afternoon, but because the stomach was weak, the rise was slightly inferior to that of the factory silk.

Yesterday's silk market, silk quilts, Dèª  goods were 11.4 million yuan, Huaqiang goods were 1.15 million to 1.2 million yuan, which was 450,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend, and 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Dèª  checked crepe opened at 41,200 to 300 yuan, and there were slight transactions. Later, because many parties sold, the support was weak and gradually decreased. From 1,100 yuan to 40,500 yuan, the scene shrank to 200 yuan, and some people absorbed it at low prices, and then it rose back, and the final closing price was 40,400 yuan, and the next day was 40,700 yuan. Sheng goods, power spinning, etc. are all exchanged for new high prices, washed power spinning is 330,000 yuan, 20-yard full factory goods, 700,000 to 720,000 yuan, washed brocade is 22,000 yuan for a transaction, and all other goods have reported an increase.

Central Trust Sells Silk

[Our Correspondent] The Central Trust Zhou yesterday distributed artificial silk for the thirty-second time. A total of 320 silk weaving industries were approved, and 173 boxes of artificial silk were distributed. The allocation price remains the same.

Textile Construction Sells Yarn

[Our Correspondent] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 556 pieces, all sold to manufacturers. There were a total of 492 application forms.

### Soap Raw Materials Are Not Exclusive to One Industry; All Industries Must Negotiate and Link Up Properly

[Our Correspondent] The Soap Industry Association of the Fourth District of this city previously submitted a document to the Transfer Management Committee through the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, requesting that the entire import quota of the industry be handed over to the Association for direct application. The Transfer Management Committee has now replied, with the general idea: The main raw materials required for the soap industry are coconut oil and coconut dried meat, which belong to Appendix 3A. You can apply to the Non-Quota Import Review Office of this Committee for import; the second is soda ash, which can already be supplied domestically; the third is the most important raw material, caustic soda, of which the North China Yongli Company and the Taiwan Alkali Manufacturing Company can supply part of the needs, and has been included by this office in 15 important chemical raw materials within the import quota, and the import quota is not small. The so-called direct application by the Association is that the factory is not an importer, which is not in line with the provisions of Item B of Article 12 of the Provisional Regulations on Import and Export Trade Management. At the same time, the above-mentioned raw materials are not exclusive to the soap industry. The past regulations that the importer must obtain a certificate from the Association when applying are to hope that there can be contact between the importer and the producer. After research, this method still needs to be improved, not only between this office and the various industry associations, but also between the associations that use the same raw materials, between the factories, and between the importers and wholesalers, all must obtain contact and cooperation. It is now known that the Transfer Management Committee is discussing effective methods with the Industrial Association and the City Chamber of Commerce in order to achieve coordination.

### Cotton Transaction is Weak

Yesterday's cotton market, coinciding with the old calendar Dragon Boat Festival, the transaction was quite deserted. However, the off-site asking price of cotton yarn was high, and because the Hong Kong exchange rate reported a shrinkage, people's hearts were very high. Customers had no intention to sell, and colleagues were slack in their intentions due to slightly tight credit. There were no transactions in the morning, and colleagues slightly opened for business in the afternoon, totaling 1.85 million for Indian cotton white rock, 1.9 million for ã, 1.7 million for Shashi, 1.42 million for South Taicang (foreign shelves), and 1.23 million to 1.25 million for lighters, all were transaction prices. The price was slightly better than last Saturday.

### Wool Transactions are Scarce

Yesterday was Monday, also known as the Old Calendar Dragon Boat Festival. Wool transactions were scarce in both Changle Teahouse and Qipan Street. Both buyers and sellers wanted to spend the festival, so all deliveries and new negotiations were postponed for one day as usual. The trend of the market is that autumn and winter wools are always tight, and high-priced women's colors and wool goods are rarely humiliated. Vanley, top, and Liciss's summer wools are mostly reduced and tired, and white birches and white straight tributes have fallen particularly sharply.

### American Vessel Arrives with More Than 8,000 Bales of Cotton

[Our Correspondent] The American President Lines' President Jefferson arrived in Shanghai the night before last, carrying more than 8,500 bales of cotton from the United States, and docked at the Gonghexing Wharf for unloading.

Exported There Were Tea and Tung Oil to Hong, The Norwegian vessel Dick Cha, managed by Tianjin Yanghang, left Shanghai for Europe yesterday, loaded with 180 tons of tung oil, 1,150 tons of tea, and about 1,500 tons of intestines, bristles, etc., and shipped to Marseille.

### Taipei Japan Airlines News, Special Correspondent Jiang Yun of Tai Bao: The position of harbor pilot on Hong Kong ships earns a monthly income of over thirty times that of a mid-level civil servant, approximately NT$400,000 to NT$500,000, a staggering sum of over NT$20 million in legal tender. In this province, ships over 500 tons are required to use pilots, but this remuneration is not calculated based on tonnage as it is domestically. Instead, it is based on the draft depth, regardless of the size of the ship. Therefore, a single trip can earn NT$50,000 to NT$60,000, resulting in ship captains in Taiwan feeling that there is an "unjust enrichment of harbor pilots."

### Forum of the Week: On the Chinese Communist Party (Part Two) by Zhang Yuechao

(III)

Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the issue of Communism itself. Before the War of Resistance, I, personally, would probably be classified as a "petit bourgeois" according to Communist classifications of people. After the war, everything was reduced to nothing, and I almost became a person unable to support myself, a true "proletarian." Materialist Communists say that a person's "ideology" is determined by their economic background. According to this theory, I should have nothing against Communism and should even welcome it. However, I have some doubts as to whether Communism can be implemented in China without any compromises and whether it can solve China's current socio-economic problems. Let us first look at the situation in the Soviet Union.

Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Joseph E. Davis, had a sympathetic understanding of the Soviet Union and was one of the most welcomed U.S. ambassadors by the Soviet authorities. In his "Mission to Moscow," he stated that the Soviet Union's current policies have gradually deviated from Communism, with the following two prominent signs: First, the ideal Communist society is a classless society where everyone enjoys the same benefits without any differences. However, Soviet society has gradually developed classes due to differences in income. While everyone has generally equal educational opportunities, people's natural abilities and intelligence vary, and their capabilities differ. This cannot be forcibly unified by human effort. People with higher abilities can do more and better work. To enable them to fully utilize their talents, they must be given higher rewards. The accumulation of these rewards becomes private property. If a person is allowed to have more assets than the average person, they naturally have greater consumption power. Davis stated that the Soviet government has been forced to abandon the Communist principle of distribution according to need and has adopted the principle of distribution according to work to provide compensation. After satisfying basic needs, people invariably seek further enjoyment if they have the means. Who does not enjoy delicacies, high-rise buildings, and fine clothes? This is human nature! Flower shops, cosmetic stores selling lipstick and rouge, and other such shops, which Soviets previously considered the frills of capitalist society, now adorn the streets of Moscow. Today, Soviet government officials, engineers, artists, and others enjoy far greater privileges than the average person.

Second, the capitalist system is built on "individual interests," while Communism does not allow such interests. Webb stated that Soviet Communism is a new culture, with the novelty being that the motive for all economic activities is not "profit-seeking" but the advancement of social welfare. However, Davis stated that Soviet policies are gradually acknowledging "individual interests," and profit-seeking behavior is gradually emerging in economic activities. Davis traveled to many famous industrial areas in the Soviet Union, such as Leningrad, the Don River Basin, and the Donets Basin, and visited many large factories. He acknowledged the Soviet Union's remarkable achievements in industry and expressed great admiration. However, he also noted that their production was sometimes uneconomical, failing to achieve maximum output with minimal capital and labor. Production efficiency was lower than in other capitalist countries, and production costs were higher. He personally witnessed overstaffing, worker laziness, and underutilization of equipment in factories. The reason for this is the absence of free competition under Communism, especially the absence of individual interests. Undoubtedly, individual interest is an important factor in stimulating production. The selfishness of "for myself" and "accumulate for myself" is inherent in everyone. The Soviet government has now recognized this pointâthe inherent selfishness of human natureâand has had to reluctantly compromise. To improve production efficiency and implement its production plans, the Soviet government has implemented a work-quota system and promoted the so-called "Stakhanovite movement," encouraging "shock workers" (i.e., workers with the highest output and quality) and giving them special bonuses. Workers can own private savings and use capital to earn interest. This profit from capital is a form of "unearned income" that completely violates Communist philosophy. The Soviet government now acknowledges it.

To say that Communism has not fully succeeded in the Soviet Union, and therefore conclude that it cannot succeed in China, is logically unsound. However, the emergence of a particular ideology must have its profound background, and its implementation must have its objective conditions. For thousands of years, China has been an agricultural economic society. Its production technology and methods have not progressed much compared to pre-industrial revolution England, and may even be lagging behind. China's general economic situation is certainly not comparable to that of modern capitalist countries like Britain and the United States. Even compared to pre-revolution Russia, it is probably still an extremely poor and impoverished country. We feel that the problem in China today is not about Communism or non-Communism, but about how to create wealth for the country and its people. The problem today, on the whole, seems not to be inequality but scarcity. We should find ways to transform scarcity into abundance, and nothing into something. In addition to production, attention should also be paid to distribution because we do not want a few people to have too much while the majority have too little, a few people to be wealthy while the majority are destitute. Capitalist-style production, due to its lack of planning and attention to distribution and consumers, leads to much waste and even economic downturns, which we should strive to avoid. I believe that the policies of the British Labour Party today are the most worthy of emulation. Its policies are not Communist because it still recognizes the private property system; nor are they capitalist because it does not adopt a laissez-faire approach to individual economic activity. Instead, it adopts a form of social planning under democratic control, allowing public and private enterprises to coexist without conflict. It advances step by step under a comprehensive production plan to achieve social and economic prosperity. The British Labour Party's policies remedy the shortcomings of both Communism and Capitalism, opening up a new path that harmonizes the contradictions between public and private ownership, fully demonstrating British political wisdom. Such policies are not unique to the British, and most major countries in the world are trending in this direction. The United States and Canada may be the only exceptions. I believe that politicians in the United States and Canada will discover the shortcomings of their economic systems and change course one day.

The above discussion is intended to humbly offer some perspectives of a junior scholar. We hope that Chinese Communists can dispel our doubts in the future, carefully examine the national conditions, and avoid being one-sided. The British scholar Matthew Arnold said that a great person should have "openness of mind" and "intellectual flexibility." Openness of mind starts with being able to understand and respect others' viewpoints. Intellectual flexibility does not mean being indecisive, but rather having one's own intellectual principles while being able to absorb different ideas, evolve with the times, and constantly innovate. If this is true for an individual, it should certainly be true for a promising political party. (End of the article)

### The Great Treasure in the South China Sea: Exhibition of Products from the Xisha and Nansha Islands

Guangzhou, December 12th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng of this newspaper:

The Exhibition of Products from the Xisha and Nansha Islands opened at the Guangzhou Literature Museum on June 11th. It is indeed a most valuable exhibition that increases our understanding of territorial sovereignty and allows us to discover this treasure in the South China Sea. Moreover, the holding of this exhibition, immediately after the 15th Guangdong Provincial Games and the first provincial Boy Scout rally, allows over ten thousand young friends from various counties and cities to see the abundance of our maritime resources, arousing their interest in marine research. This will undoubtedly provide much assistance in the future development of these islands. Therefore, this exhibition has profound educational significance.

The Twists and Turns of the Takeover

The Xisha and Nansha Islands were only recovered last year, and the takeover process encountered some difficulties. At the time, the central government sent naval forces to garrison the islands and experts to inspect them, while also ordering the Guangdong provincial government to send personnel to take over the islands and place them under the jurisdiction of Guangdong province. The Guangdong provincial government sent staff members Ji Yuanziyin and advisor Mai Yunyu as commissioners, along with naval commanders Lin Zun and Yao Ruyu, to take over the Xisha and Nansha Islands. Before their departure, they did not have a clear understanding of the situation on the islands. However, recognizing the importance of their mission, they braved difficulties and dangers, endured hardships, and finally completed the takeover and garrisoning of the Xisha Islands on November 28th of last year and the Nansha Islands on December 22nd. The Dongsha Islands had been recovered earlier after the war and were taken over by the navy. Thus, the Dongsha, Xisha, and Nansha Islands in the South China Sea were fully recovered and returned to our territory. They completed this historically great mission. After the takeover, the French raised a dispute and sent warships to threaten. However, our soldiers guarding the territory were unyielding and forced them to retreat. Their loyalty and bravery are admirable. This issue is still being pursued through diplomatic channels, but these places have been part of our territory for over a thousand years, as evidenced by historical records from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Sovereignty rests with us, without a doubt. The radio stations established on the Dongsha, Xisha, and Nansha Islands now officially report weather conditions, serving maritime navigation worldwide. This service further affirms our territorial sovereignty.

Exhibition Divided into Five Rooms

The exhibits were collected by personnel who went to take over the islands and experts who went to investigate them. The total number of items exceeds 1,300 and is divided into five rooms. The richness of the content can be imagined. When this reporter arrived at the first room, all the items related to the history, geography, literature, and books of the islands were on display. Most of these were provided by the Guangdong Provincial Library, including historical records from various dynasties. From these historical records, we can conclude that since the Han Dynasty's governance of Annam, the Xisha Islands have been part of our territory. They were governed successively during the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, with frequent envoys sent. Zheng He carried gold, money, and silk to Xisha to comfort the people. The Qing Dynasty sent officials to Xisha to inspect the islands and erect stone monuments. The Nansha Islands were also part of our territory, known as the Twelve Sons Stones during the Song Dynasty. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, they have served as fishing bases for our country. In 1886, the British surveying vessel "Rifleman" saw Chinese fishermen living on the islands. In the 6th year of the Republic of China (1917), the Japanese mined phosphate ore there. In the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), foreigners forcibly occupied the islands. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), they fell into the hands of the Japanese and were placed under the administration of Taiwan. At the same time, the room also displays sixteen Chinese ancient coins of the most value, which Professor Wang Guangwei unearthed from a depth of 15 meters on the Xisha Islands. The ancient coins have characters with year names such as Kaiyuan, Song, Hongwu, and Yongle from after the Tang Dynasty. This shows the traces left by the Chinese at that time. Therefore, these historical relics are powerful evidence of our territorial sovereignty, which no country can infringe upon.

Specimens of Marine Products

In the second and third rooms, there are fish and marine product drawings and specimens, mostly provided by the Provincial College of Arts and Sciences and the Maritime School. There are various types of fish, mostly from the South Seas, including tiger fish, horsehead fish, dogfish, ribbonfish, sailfish, grass carp, and mackerel. Some fish are simply unheard of and unseen, with a variety of bizarre shapes and features. One feels as if they are in a marine kingdom. Although these are all specimens, they are enough to arouse people's interest in marine research.

Corals and Shells

Moving on to the fourth and fifth rooms, these are the most important parts of the exhibition, displaying products brought back from the islands. The most pleasing to the eye are the corals and shells. They grow into different shapes, including flower shapes, fan shapes, tree shapes, and ball shapes. They also come in different colors, including vermilion, snow-white, yellow, and green. Some are small and exquisite, while others are dazzling. These are the best materials for women's decorations. This part can be described as a dazzling array of beautiful objects, providing visitors with a feast for the eyes. Among them, there is a strange type of fish called the electric ray, which is said to be able to generate eighty volts of electricity. There is also a special product of the Dongsha Islands called marine wormwood, which is a good anthelmintic. In addition, the marine products on the islands include dried skipjack tuna, pomfret, grouper, sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, sea cucumbers, sponges, abalone, seaweed, and other valuable items. The islands also have rich vegetation, such as coconuts, papayas, bananas, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, loofahs, and pumpkins, which are produced in large quantities.

Wonderful Guano

In addition to marine products, the islands also have a valuable resource: guano. The formation of this guano is due to seabirds preying on fish. The bones of the fish, which are rich in phosphorus, are not easily digested and remain in the birds' excrement. If the excrement is in areas with sparse rainfall, it dries quickly and accumulates into guano mountains. However, if it is in areas with more rainfall, the soluble substances are leached away, leaving behind calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and minerals such as iron and aluminum. The phosphoric acid gradually penetrates into the coral reefs. Over the years, it eventually forms hard phosphate ore. Today, this phosphate ore is abundant on the islands, estimated to be millions of tons spread across the islands. This is the best fertilizer for crops. It was mined by the Lasha and South Seas companies, with a total output of 26,000 tons. It is a pity if this important resource is not developed on a large scale!

Currently, the Guangdong provincial government has established the Xisha and Nansha Islands Gazetteer Editorial Committee and invited many experts to conduct specialized research and development. After visiting the exhibition, in addition to being excited about the return of these islands to the motherland, we also envision the beautiful future of these islands after development. In particular, we hope that the rich special products of our sea border can be introduced to people in Beijing and Shanghai so that everyone can recognize this treasure in the South China Sea.

### The Difficulty of the Shu Road in Spring and Autumn by Ye Dingluo

I Still Say the Shu Road is Difficult

Although transportation in Sichuan is more convenient than before, I still find the Shu Road difficult to travel. Having grown up in the water towns of Jiangnan and traveled on the northern plains, my personality is somewhat indecisive yet straightforward, a little suspicious yet also frank. I am truly unaccustomed to trivialities, complications, ruggedness, unevenness, twists, and turns. Li Bai said, "The Shu Road is difficult, more difficult than ascending to Heaven!" As a Sichuan native in the Tang Dynasty, traveling in and out of the plank roads would naturally be difficult, so he exaggerated so much. However, having arrived by car from the Northwest, I am fortunate to have avoided the danger of overturning. Although the wheels rolled along the road quite well, I always felt like I was passing through thorns. The experience was much worse than taking a train or ship. Therefore, I still say, "The Shu Road is difficult."

Walking on the Tail End of the Railroad

It seems like ancient history now, but when I departed from Xi'an, the Japanese were threatening Tongguan. Xi'an was quite chaotic. To enjoy the excitement, I traveled with a group of friends from the theater world. At the train station, I suddenly encountered a former student who held a position in a military organization. He wore a military uniform, high boots, a Sam Browne belt, and the insignia of a major general. He was followed by an orderly and two women. Although my student would never be a real soldier, I couldn't rule out the possibility of his joining the army, because he was young and looked the part. I was also wearing a military uniform, but it only made me look more out of place. I certainly didn't have the air of a military man. Squeezed among many strong and sturdy people, I was prepared to endure all hardships in the spirit of Gandhi. Fortunately, I saw him, and even more fortunately, this student remembered his teacher. I and the only girl were able to squeeze into a second-class carriage. Around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival, the weather was quite hot. The train station and carriages were filled with refugees.

In the dining car, I sat next to him, with the two women he was traveling with across from us. I had met one of them before, his wife. I didn't recognize the other, and he said she was his sister. But from their expressions, they didn't seem very much alike. He also seemed a little embarrassed. I understood. A teacher is not a matchmaker. Even for his students, there is no need to approve or disapprove of their affairs. In this world, being constrained by a theory and criticizing others as if out of jealousy is just seeking trouble. I've never wanted to be that foolish, so I just looked at them calmly, appreciating their theatrical expressions and gestures. However, I felt that someone who once stood on a platform spouting words from books, mostly the ghosts of dead people, sitting silently next to young lovers, was a very unappealing sight. So I had to leave. In reality, I felt that those who had taught school were among the most unfortunate people in this world.

Xi'an to Baoji is a journey of an hour by train. Baoji is the end of the Longhai Railway. The shortness of the remaining stretch of railway was imaginable. At that time, Changsha had already fallen, Hengyang seemed unable to resist, and Guangdong and Guangxi had been occupied by the enemy. The railways throughout the country, given our Chinese-style travel, consisted of only this small section. This had become the tail end of the railways, and I was traveling on this short tail end. I felt only distress and sadness.

Trying to dispel the unpleasant emotions in my heart, I looked intently at the scenery outside the train window that was racing in the opposite direction. The mountain peak of "Wuzhang Plains" flashed before my eyes. Zhuge Liang, who was pitied and revered by many generations, died here. In order to repay a rogue's kindness, he toiled and worried himself, finally ending his extremely weary life in this desolate place. Thinking of this historical and tragic figure, the sorrow in my heart only increased.

Scorpions

For several years, I have been living with my daughter, relying on each other for support. A man in his forties or fifties traveling with a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl in this chaotic land certainly had the air of someone from "Fishing Village." In Baoji, a fellow townsman in the business world hosted us in an old house that had just been vacated but not yet cleaned. Because it was an old house, it was very cool in the already hot summer weather. The fellow townsman brought me a large table, two chairs, two small iron beds, a large thermos, and a set of cooking utensils. This was enough for my daughter and me to live comfortably. I was a bit like Liu Adou, "Here is happiness, I do not think of Shu," temporarily putting all my worries aside.

I dislike hustle and bustle. This old temple-like house was much quieter than a hotel. However, a certain small animal constantly threatened me, making me feel like I was living in thorns. This was the scorpion.

In elementary school, I heard stories about scorpions from a teacher. Scorpions were products of the north. He described them as so terrifying that the impression of scorpions was deeply ingrained in my imagination. In my childhood, I suffered from centipedes and wasps. My fear of scorpions, which I had never encountered, only increased. However, I lived in the north for many years without encountering scorpions and never knew how dangerous they were. One night, I suddenly heard the old maid screaming in the courtyard:

"Scorpion!"

It was a loud, shrill scream, as if a knife had pierced her heart. She had been stung by a scorpion and cried out in pain all night. That was the first time I saw a scorpion.

My daughter, who is naturally active, had been eager to buy things herself at the hotel a month earlier. She grabbed the butcher's sharp knife to use, but accidentally cut the artery on the top of her right foot, leaving a pool of blood. After being bandaged at the hospital, she was still using a cane to recover. I had to take on the tasks of fetching water and calling for meals alone. In the evening, the door at the back of the old house, facing the earthen wall, was open. I sat in a chair to rest, lighting a candle and letting the wind brush my back, listening to the sound of melon vines hitting the earthen wall. Suddenly, I felt a tingling and stinging sensation on the back of my foot. I picked up the candle to look and found a small scorpion that I had already stepped on and killed. The memory made me alert. I carefully examined the ground and walls of the old house. I realized that I had moved into a scorpion's lair.

Scorpions, with their tails raised and venomous stingers, scurried across the walls. The sound of their claws touching was often heard on the walls. From then on, I dared not rest peacefully at night. I used my shoe sole as a weapon to fight these small animals. It was a situation of "I kill it, or it kills me." Even during the day, I had to check the walls several times. It was common for scorpions to crawl on the hanging clothes. However, my daughter was ultimately unlucky because she touched a scorpion hidden in the rag while wiping the table!

"Scorpion!"

The familiar scream came from her mouth again. Her knife wound had just healed, and she had been stung again. Her painful cries and jumps were even more unpleasant than hearing an air raid siren. I already knew that the small courtyard behind the old house was the scorpion's headquarters. At night, scissors had a special use for me. The scorpions hiding in the mud walls and soil mounds were almost two inches long. One by one, I clipped off the venomous stingers from their tails. I felt that depriving them of their weapons of defense and attack, and letting them live in pain, was the best way to take revenge.

The appearance of many lower animals is unpleasant, such as snakes, centipedes, toads, and geckos. Scorpions are the same. In fact, their soft but seemingly rigid bodies, with a pair of pincers in front and a venomous stinger in back, and their squirming crawling made people shudder. They are one of the silent venomous creatures, crawling quietly, silently raising their weapons, waiting for the enemy to arrive, and calmly giving them a sting. This method of using stillness to control movement and using leisure to gain advantage is truly terrifying.

Chencang Moonlight

One hot day, I went with a fellow townsman to visit his yarn factory in Shilipu and also to visit some fellow townsmen. It took less than ten minutes by train to get there. First, I met Mr. Y at the office, and then I took the factory's horse-drawn carriage, following a winding mountain road, to their dormitory. After drinking mung bean soup at Mr. M's house, I joined their banquet. The food and drinks were entirely in the style of my hometown. The staff were mostly from my hometown. Under the bright electric lights, looking at the faces of people from Shanghai and Nanjing, I felt like I had returned to my hometown. These friends were all younger than me, so I realized that my attitude had become northernized and that I could no longer speak my hometown dialect.

They are well organized. Foreign-style houses are built up and down the mountain, with trees planted and paved asphalt roads. Electricity and running water are all provided by the factory. The employees are well treated, can work harmoniously, live comfortably, share joys and hardships, and have common goals and wills. It is truly like a collective. I drank almost to the point of being drunk. I went down the mountain with Mr. W. It was a summer night with picture-perfect moonlight. From the top of the mountain, overlooking the valley below, there was a scene of machine sounds and electric lights. The artificial and regular buildings were surrounded by the natural mountains. Moonlight and electric light shone together, blurring the mountains in the distance.

The horse-drawn carriage took us from the factory to Baoji. Two drunks were sitting unceremoniously in the carriage, staggering along as the carriage dragged us through the narrow path between the mountains. This is where Chen Ping used his ingenious plan during the Chu-Han contentionâChencang. In our drunken state, we reflected on the past and the present. We only heard the sound of horse hooves and wheels echoing on the official road. The mountains were dark, the trees swayed, and the fields were silent.

### Street Lamp by Tang Kuangying

Street Lamp

Residing near the corner of a small, sloping street, there stands a street lamp, unwavering through wind and rain. Each evening, an elderly woman over eighty years of age tends to it, adding oil and lighting the lamp. On rainy nights, I can hear the hurried steps of those traveling at night, weighed down by the rain. They pause beneath the lamp, shaking off their soaked garments, examining the state of their rain-beaten attire. Then, they pat their clothes and continue onward.

Regarding such a genuine street lamp, dedicated to serving the people, I occasionally lie in bed, contemplating and pondering it with a somewhat pretentious philosophical air. Yet, to a night traveler emerging from the darkness, it undoubtedly serves as a warm beacon.

The Mahavairocana Sutra states: "Sound is like a bright lamp, diminishing the width of the path. If concealed, it cannot be called a lamp." In the past, I have never held much affection for Buddhist scriptures that advocate "tranquility" as the ultimate goal. However, I hold a particular fondness for these words! Throughout history, countless sages and fools, wise and foolish alike, have been judged based on the subjective likes and dislikes of certain individuals, blurring the distinction between right and wrong. Although the Buddhist scriptures were created merely to offer solace to those seeking refuge in emptiness, they are ultimately different from the creators of human heroic tales who smear facts with bloodshed, making them horrifying.

For example, tonight, that lamp is still there. Night travelers should be passing beneath it, leaving an impression of warmth and clarity. And like me, lying in bed at this moment, peering through the darkness from the window, I see children, large and small, frolicking and dancing in the lamplight. I imagine they are experiencing the utmost joy.

It is merely a street lamp on a small street, yet it provides so much. What more can be said about the lighthouses at sea?

Distance

Last summer, I lived in a remote village in a small county. A small plot of land near the window, due to my loneliness, I planted some cannas and other flowers. The merchant living next door, whenever he saw me, frowned and advised me to plant cabbages and beans instead, to engage in production. However, I, being a person of extreme tendencies, knew that planting vegetables and beans could earn money, but it could not satisfy me.

Later, the cannas bloomed, and the flowers withered. Several withered petals were blown into the merchant's courtyard. The merchant, filled with anger, grabbed those petals and threw them at my doorstep, then ran back in anger and slammed his door shut.

I cannot fathom how the distance between people could be so vast.

This year, I am idle in eastern Zhejiang. Having no leisurely fields to allow a scavenger to plant cannas, I have not had the chance to witness the exasperated expressions of merchants like him. However, in these past few years, I have indeed come to understand the sentiment of "Why not plant some cabbages and beans?"

Sometimes, the faces of petty individuals, when recalled later, can be quite heartwarming.

Frog Sounds

After several days of rain, not only have the rice seedlings in the fields grown stronger, but the ponds have also been filled with the cacophony of frog sounds.

"Ko... ko... ko..."!

Whether it is early morning or late at night, the ponds are filled with incessant croaking. Although this never attracts the attention of villagers, nor do they pause by the pond's edge, whenever the moon is bright and the breeze is gentle, and I am gazing lonely toward the mountains across the way, finding no subtle answers, I always console myself:

"In the future, I can diminish my loneliness."

Although I cannot understand whether these frog sounds are sad or joyful, the human world is already too complicated. Who would bother to investigate whether the clamor of all things is joy or sorrow? People cannot even sort out their own affairs, let alone worry about so much else.

However, I have diminished much loneliness from the frog sounds. At least, that is how it is for me.

But after a few more days, the farmers will have drained the pond almost dry. The reason: the water in the pond is stored for irrigating the rice fields. What should I say! I have no reason to cherish the water in the pond, but I am disheartened that I will no longer be able to hear the frog sounds. However, the farmers have worn a slight smile on their faces for the past few days.

### Letter by Zhao Qing

Pu:

My reason for asking you to see the movie "The Lost Weekend" today is that I have decided to quit drinking too, but before I do, I want to have one last drink with you. Even though Shan warned me the day before yesterday: if you drink again, your body will completely collapse. I agreed to listen to her and never drink again! But I thought that I should have a farewell memorial since it's a vice I've indulged in for a long time (not a short history). Otherwise, it would be a little too heartless, wouldn't it?

In "The Lost Weekend," the drunkard who loves alcohol has many actions that you are familiar with because you often see me being greedy and loving it, to the point of being drunk! So you laugh and quietly say: "Look, that's how ugly you are when you drink yourself!" I don't think so. I don't find it funny at all; I want to cry! I sympathize with the drunkard. He has to give up drinking because he is poor, and I am also giving up drinking because I am afraid of being sick and not having money for treatment, aren't I? There is nothing more painful in life than unnatural control! Even so, I am still determined to quit, in order to live a few more years.

I felt an unprecedented joy when we drank at Xiangxue Garden. I deliberately used a lot of nonsense to prolong the time I slowly sipped my wine. But your restrictions ultimately left me unsatisfied, so I had to invade your glass, letting you criticize: "Everything is civilized, only drinking is barbaric. And greedy." Because this is the last time! You didn't see that when I swallowed the last sip of wine, my eyes were a little wet! I silently cursed my useless body. I complained that God wouldn't even give me this little bit of pitiful enjoyment! Think about it, Ying! In such a depressed era, I cannot even have a moment of numbness. What great perseverance will I need to endure this unbearable torment! I'm really afraid I will shake that "unnatural control."

My body is failing, maybe it's related to my mood. We didn't drink much wine today. Wasn't I clear-headed enough to go for coffee and stroll on the road with you, and even take the trolley car by myself? But when I got to the Bund, as soon as I got off the trolley, I got confused. I blindly followed others and transferred to the No. 8 trolley. I got off at a baffling stop. At this time, my self-confidence was still very strong, so I cleverly crossed two unknown roads, thinking that I could walk home like this. But I didn't expect to walk further and further away, until I reached the Huangpu River, and I realized something was wrong. I stood by the river, staring blankly, looking around. I calculated that I had clearly already passed the Huangpu River, so how did I come back here? At the same time, this place was very strange, unlike the scenery by the Waibaidu Bridge and Sichuan Road, I had clearly never been here before. My God! Could I also be as insane as the drunkard in "The Lost Weekend"? I was a little panicked! I let the river wind blow my less-than-sober mind, while I tried to find a way home. However, unfortunately, I was completely disoriented, and I could no longer find a way out of this confusing area. I had no choice but to give up my self-confidence and start asking rickshaws for help. Finally, I hailed a rickshaw. Without bothering to haggle, I sat down. I don't remember how many circles we made before we got to North Sichuan Road, and I saw the standard clock of the General Post Office, and then I suddenly realized. I asked the rickshaw puller, and he told me that I was just at Yangshupu Wharf. How interesting, I sleepwalked to Yangshupu! It's like the drunkard in "The Lost Weekend" went on a drunken tour of a terrifying hell, it can be said that an ordinary person makes trouble for himself! But isn't it also a symbol of many things?

Now I have safely returned to my little house. While I still have some residual wine spirit, I am telling you about this experience, you must also feel that my quitting drinking is worth commemorating!

Okay, let me go and check the pile of wine bottles to see if there is a drop or two left, but don't worry, even if there is, I will never drink it again. I will use it to extinguish my cigarette butts.

Starting tomorrow, I will forever (let's say that for now, maybe my body will one day be in better shape, and I will allow myself to start drinking again). I'm saying goodbye to the glass that I've been friends with for more than ten years! I will no longer show "" or shameful drunkenness in front of you!

Goodbye, dear friend!

### Early Summer Sketches by Li Zhi

Verdant

When the countryside is verdant, a hope seems to arise spontaneously in our hearts. We feel that the days are more satisfying, and that the days ahead will be full of interest and warmth. We feel that the power of life is inexhaustible, that what is withered can be reborn, and that what is reborn can flourish, so there is no need to despair or regret.

Verdant is inherently lovely, its greatest revelation being that hope cannot be extinguished, nor can life be extinguished. So when we see the withered grass of the wilderness, we have vivid memories of green in the cold and desolate surroundings. If at this time we find a stalk of green grass or a lingering green leaf in the withered vegetation, we are truly delighted. Because it represents a spirit of perseverance and struggle.

This spirit is what we need, so we love verdant.

Early Summer

Among the seasons, spring is the most lovely, but when we think of the severe cold of winter, we no longer reject the arrival of summer.

Now, early summer has arrived, and late spring has said goodbye to us. We begin to fear the scorching sun, its affectation reminding us of its stinginess in winter. Fortunately, early summer makes the forests dense, giving us a place to shade, which is still comforting.

I'm just afraid that as soon as early summer arrives, high summer will come, causing us to sweat without respite, then we will have to ask the wind god and rain master for help. In early spring, we are afraid that late spring will arrive soon; in late spring, we worry about the impending early summer; once early summer has arrived, we can only hope that high summer will arrive slowly; after high summer, we really don't want to see the bleak autumn days and cold winter.

Then, early summer, please stay a little longer, this is such a pitiful world.

Amidst Forest Vines and Flowers

There is nothing more relaxing than looking at and appreciating the white clouds in the blue sky.

Some say that white clouds are a fickle girl, others say that white clouds are a graceful lady. Whether fickle or graceful, I am a traveler in a foreign land, and in the depths of the white clouds, I can find thousands of bushels and ten thousand pecks of homesickness. Homesickness is so lovely, it ultimately stirs a traveler: My country will be revived, why

### Reserve Fund Utilization Funds Total 10 Billion Yuan

Additional Borrowing Under Negotiation

[Our Newspaper] It was reported in this newspaper on the 22nd that the United Reserve Board of Silver and Money Dealers applied to the Central Bank for funds, increasing to 10 billion yuan. Of the 10 billion yuan, commercial banks shared 1.7 billion yuan, money shops shared 800 million yuan, and for national banks, Bank of China and Bank of Communications each shared 1 billion yuan, and Farmers Bank of China shared 500 million yuan, totaling 5 billion yuan. Another 5 billion yuan can be overdrawn from the Central Bank, totaling 10 billion yuan. As for rumors that the utilized funds will increase to 15 billion yuan, neither the national banks nor the United Reserve Board could confirm this. It is only requested that the amount of borrowing beyond the 10 billion yuan limit is under negotiation, but it is not yet determined to be 5 billion yuan.

### Zheng Branch of Agricultural Bank Distributes Cotton and Tobacco Loans

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd] The Zheng Branch of the Agricultural Bank has been approved to issue 47.91 billion yuan in loans for cotton and tobacco. Currently, more than 15 billion yuan has been loaned out, of which more than 10 billion yuan in cotton loans were issued through the Zheng, Luo, and Xia Ling branches, and 5 billion yuan in fertilizer loans were issued through the Zheng Xu branch. It is expected that another 25 billion yuan will be loaned out this month. In addition, the share capital of the local agricultural machinery company has reached 10 million yuan from local banks and farmers, and the remaining 1 billion yuan is being raised.

### All Businesses of the Textile Control Commission to be Transferred to the Textile Adjustment Commission Today; Adjustments Under Negotiation with Manufacturers

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning at around 10 o'clock, the Textile Adjustment Commission dispatched Gao Bingtai, Deputy Director of the Business Department, and Deng Yuan, Auditor, to the Textile Control Commission to discuss the handover of business procedures with Liu, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Commission. It is heard that the business of the Textile Control Commission was ordered to cease operation on the 21st, and yesterday it began to be sorted out. Starting today, it can be gradually transferred. The Textile Adjustment Commission will also begin accepting applications for the north-south transportation of yarn and cloth starting today. Regarding all the original personnel of the Textile Control Commission, the Textile Adjustment Commission stated: It is hoped that the original personnel and affairs can be maintained without much change, so that business can continue uninterrupted.

Furthermore, Wu Weijing, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Adjustment Commission, told reporters: Whether there will be any adjustments after the Textile Adjustment Commission takes over the business of the Textile Control Commission is currently under consideration. He is exchanging opinions with various related manufacturers in order to prepare specific proposals for discussion at the second regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Commission this Thursday. According to his opinion: The method of transporting yarn and cloth to the north seems to be able to be appropriately adjusted based on the current situation. The method of transporting yarn and cloth to the south involves issues such as foreign exchange smuggling, so its nature is not limited to the yarn and cloth itself. Therefore, even if there are adjustments, it is necessary to obtain joint efforts from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.

### The Progressing Xikang

â Ya'an, 14th (Airmail Dispatch) Special Correspondent Xu Renchang

The administrative region of Xikang is divided into three zones: Kang, Ning, and Ya, with a total of thirty-four counties and a governing bureau. Before the establishment of the province, Xikang was limited to the current Kang-controlled territory.

The Kang territory has been subjected to a laissez-faire approach by successive governments, without any real management. Although Zhao Erfeng changed the laissez-faire policy of thousands of years at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and vigorously implemented the policy of replacing native officials with appointed officials and establishing counties and officials, it was soon abandoned due to the revolution. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been many domestic troubles, and it has not been possible to focus on managing the border. Until 1917, when Chen Xialing was the garrison commander of the Sichuan border, he wanted to eliminate the false views and mistakes of Peng Risheng, the commander of the border army, by using the Tibetan army. He sat idly by as the Tibetan army invaded the north and south routes. When Dege fell and Ganzi was in urgent need of assistance, he sent troops to Rongkaicha and signed a truce agreement with the Tibetan army, recognizing the area south of Bailong Zengka as the defense line of the Han army, and the area west as the defense line of the Tibetan army. As a result, the northern route lost the four counties of Dege, Tongpu, Dengke, and Shiqu, the far west lost the counties of Qamdo and Enda, the central region lost the three counties of Gonjo, Baiyu, and Shicheng, and the southern region lost the two counties of Ningjing and Chaya, totaling the loss of eleven counties. Together with the five counties of Kemai, Chayu, Taizhao, Shuodu, and Jiali, which were occupied by the Tibetan army during the founding of the Republic of China, a total of sixteen counties were lost.

When Liu Wenhui of the Sixteenth Army took over the defense of Xikang, the area he actually ruled was only eleven and a half counties. After Liu's arduous efforts, he successively recovered the four counties of Dengke, Dege, Baiyu, and Shiqu between the 22nd and 23rd armies, and reorganized the four counties of Xiangcheng, Daocheng, Dengke, and Yajiang, barely maintaining the ruling situation east of the Jinsha River. Currently, he only governs the twenty counties on the east bank of the Jinsha River. As for how to recover the west bank, it concerns the entire national policy and is not something that the local government can decide on its own.

Ning Territory

There are a total of eight counties and one governing bureau under its jurisdiction. It is bordered by the Zhongtou Mountains and the Jinsha River, which separates it from Sichuan and Yunnan. It is adjacent to Jiulong in Kang territory and Zhongdian and Yongning in Yunnan Province to the west, and Hanyuan in Ya territory and Ebian in Sichuan Province to the north. Since Han opened Yuesong, it has been established as a commandery and county. Due to Yi rebellions, it failed to implement policies. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties, it all became the territory of the Meichao. In the Yuan Dynasty, it began to appease the native chieftains and rebuild prefectures and counties, belonging to Yunnan. In the Ming Dynasty, it was changed to Sichuan, and the Qing Dynasty continued this. In the 28th year of the Republic of China, it was formally assigned to Xikang by the central government.

Ya Territory

The area under its jurisdiction has always belonged to Sichuan. Originally, there were seven counties. In the 28th year of the Republic of China, it was assigned to Xikang at the same time as Ning territory. Mingshan still belongs to Sichuan, leaving only six counties and one bureau.

Special Features of Each Territory

The population of Kang territory is approximately 300,000, of which Han Chinese and relocated Kang people account for one-fifth of the total population. The rest belong to the Tibetan ethnic group. In addition, there are uncivilized savages living in the Orol area. It is still impossible to count the exact number. These ethnic groups are still living in nomadic and tribal times. Their politics, education, and economy are entirely controlled by temples, lamas, tusi chieftains, and headmen. They are mostly ignorant of everything outside. Even if the government has good laws and intentions, they sometimes cannot penetrate into the people.

The situation in Ning territory is different from that in Kang territory. Han Chinese account for more than 900,000 of the total population, but they only occupy a line along the Zhongtong passage. Judging from the total area of Ningkun, it only accounts for one-quarter. There are as many as eight ethnic groups, of which the Yi ethnic group is the most powerful. There is no accurate survey of the number of people, but it is estimated to be around one million, accounting for about three-quarters of the area of Ning territory. In the past, during the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing dynasties, it was often a border area. The governments at that time did not have any fundamental methods to govern them. Until the end of the Qing Dynasty, the disaster became more severe. The property and lives of the Han people were lost to the Yi ethnic group, which can be said to be incalculable.

Because Ya territory has been established for a long time and assimilated earlier, except for a small number of Western Fan descendants in Shixing and a small number of Lolo tribes in Hanyuan, the rest are all Han Chinese. The customs and habits are no different from those in the interior. The policies implemented are applicable in the interior and can also be implemented in Ya territory. However, the land is barren, and the people are poor. The population of the six counties and one governing bureau is only more than one million.

Policy Guidelines

Since the 27th year of the Republic of China, after the two territories of Ning and Ya were incorporated, the work of establishing the province, which had been under consideration for many years, was completed. The provincial government was formally established on New Year's Day of the following year. The provincial government authorities have proposed "transforming the borderland into the hinterland" as the highest goal for political, economic, and cultural facilities, in addition to adapting to the special circumstances of the three territories. Based on this goal, six central tasks of governance were proposed: 1. Implement economic policies, that is, collect talents and resources to develop the special products on the ground and the underground resources to increase production. 2. Strengthen ethnic unity, that is, follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism, confirm that all ethnic groups in Kang are equal, and respect the inherent culture and religious customs of each ethnic group, and treat Kang and Lolo people with equality, love, mutual assistance, and cooperation to strengthen their unity and consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups. 3. Develop border education, that is, adapt to the needs of nation-building, and also adapt to the special environment of Kang Province, and strive to meet the special requirements of each ethnic group to improve their cultural level. 4. Strengthen the organization and training of the people, that is, in view of the current needs of nation-building and the long-term significance of strengthening border defense, the organization and training of the people should also be carried out appropriately based on their special environment. 5. Improve people's lives, that is, actively devote themselves to production and construction, develop culture and education, and improve the conditions of people's spiritual and material lives. On the negative side, reduce the burden on the people and relieve the people's suffering. 6. Thoroughly clarify official corruption to complete the above five tasks and build a new Xikang. And Liu Wenhui also proposed a detailed plan for the construction of the new Xikang with the theory of the entire system, and implemented it step by step. A, Four Power Program: (1) Cultivate the people's "organizational power" to overcome laxity. (2) Cultivate the people's "intellectual power" to overcome ignorance. (3) Cultivate the people's "productive power" to overcome poverty. (4) Cultivate the people's "survival power" to overcome weakness. B, Three Transformation Policies: (1) Replace the conquest policy with the "moral transformation policy." (2) Replace the divisive policy with the "assimilation policy." (3) Replace the decadent policy with the "evolutionary policy." C, Three Advance Principles: (1) Use the spirit of "initiative" to change passivity into activity, change passivity into initiative, change timidity into determination, and change vanity into perseverance. (2) Use the method of "progress" to adapt to local conditions, adapt to people, adapt to time, and adapt to customs. (3) Use the purpose of "evolution" to transform laxity into unity, transform the borderland into the hinterland, and transform agriculture into industry. These "six tasks," "four power programs," "three transformation policies," and "three advance principles" are completely the basic guidelines and highest principles of governance since the establishment of the province. In today's Xikang, we can see from all aspects that although it is far behind the provinces in the interior, it has made a lot of progress and considerable achievements.

Governance Methods

Because Xikang has the relationship of Kang, Ning, and Ya, and the bases of geography, history, ethnicity, language, writing, etc. are also very different, the governance of the authorities is also based on the above-mentioned highest principles, and they are also trying to adjust and respond accordingly.

Temples

In Kang territory, it is a social structure of Tusi chieftains and semi-clan. They hold the right to rule the people in each county. Religious customs have a history of more than a thousand years, and the latent forces are very strong. Spiritual life can not only dominate the people, but also has the closest relationship with the people in real life. For example, in terms of economy, the surplus wealth and post-mortem inheritance of the Kang people are mostly donated to temples. The temples then use them to do business or lend them to the people, becoming the financial core of each place. In terms of security, temples mostly possess considerable armed forces, which not only protect the residents in peacetime, but also defend against foreign aggression in times of crisis. In their daily social life, most of the outstanding men in various places are sent to temples to study as lamas. Residents all regard temples as the center of gatherings, and temples have also become political places for opinions and resolving disputes in one place. It can be said that in the Kang territory, the appeal of religion has generated considerable power. In the past, those who ruled Kang completely suppressed Buddhism with force, destroying temples and burning scriptures, killing monks and insulting Buddhas. As a result, they aroused the resentment of the Kang people. The turmoil in Xikang since the Ming Dynasty is a clear proof. The provincial police authorities govern Kang by respecting their inherent culture and religious customs on the one hand, using religion to assist politics, so that politics does not hinder religion, and using politics to control religion, so that religion does not degenerate. At the same time, they implement modern construction and improve from the perspective of social life, so that Kang people can stand on the position of modern citizens. In the past few years, they have achieved considerable success in the maintenance of Buddhism and the rectification of religious rules, and have established the Five Brightness Academy, hiring Western Tibetan virtues as the president and teachers. They have also selected virtues from the north and south routes to serve as preachers and auxiliary teachers, responsible for regional Buddhist teaching and guidance. In recent years, because of this relationship, ethnic unity and the implementation of government orders have indeed been effective.

Yi Affairs

The governance of Yi is centered on Yi affairs. Because the ethnic groups are extremely complex, in addition to Han and Lolo, there are also Western Fan, Mosuo, Miao, Gapmi, Shuitian, Jian Yi, and Lao Yi. Only the Yi ethnic group is scattered in various counties, occupying the largest area and the greatest power. They have always plundered various ethnic groups and resisted the government. The so-called "Yi disaster" in Ning territory refers to the Lolo ethnic group. The government's so-called governance of Shuang refers to the Lolo ethnic group. The Lolo ethnic group calls themselves "Nosu," which means black people. Therefore, they are generally called Black Yi, and they are regarded as the aristocracy among the Yi ethnic group, wielding the power of rule and taking the responsibility of leading the White Yi. They specialize in looting and regard being content andå®å·± as a shame. The reason why the Lolo ethnic group can stubbornly defend themselves also has to do with his special abilities and virtues, such as being self-respecting, valuing bravery, assimilating other ethnic groups, treating the White Yi kindly, and valuing chastity. In addition, people who governed Yi affairs in the past had a traditional concept of "people of different races must have different hearts," believing that the Yi people were stubborn people who could not be influenced, and that they were a race that feared power but did not appreciate virtue. They would either establish prestige immediately or immediately suppress them. After the victory, they would only make perfunctory gestures of drinking blood and sitting in shifts, or adopt a policy of "using Yi to control Yi," alienating and provoking, secretly assisting and feigning attacks, causing the Yi people to kill each other and fight each other. As a result, they would get rid of one stubborn Yi and another stubborn Yi would come. There was still no progress in the control structure. Even worse, they randomly appointed officials to fill the positions of local officials to perfunctorily fulfill policies, causing temporary decadence and leaving behind hidden dangers, which would be inherited by future generations. The provincial government authorities, with the achievements and failures of the past, determined the century-long plan for governing the Yi, and with politics, education, finance, and armaments, they divided labor, cooperated, and advanced together. In terms of armaments, the main focus was on preventing riots and protecting the good people. In politics, they treated the Yi people with the psychology of fathers and brothers treating their sons and brothers, so as to achieve a state where Han and Yi people were not divided and were all equal. Even among the Black Yi, there was no distinction of ranks, and they were treated equally. In education, the main focus was on confusing and Tao, enlightening the foolish and expressing their voices, and achieving the effect of "using Xia to transform the Yi." In economics, the focus was on self-sufficiency, enriching the local area, and reclaiming wasteland to make the best use of the land and ensure the smooth flow of goods. In addition, they also formulated regulations for Yi people to surrender and guarantee, as well as preferential measures such as Yi people visiting the interior and Yi people serving in the interior to arouse the psychology of acceptance and remembrance. They also set up a Ning territory reclamation committee in Xilu to take political responsibility nearby, and opened a training institute for reclamation personnel and a border practical school to train specialized talents for developing Ning territory. Yi territories that have surrendered one after another, with a length and width of about one hundred miles and a population of about two or three thousand households, are designated as a political guidance area. The guidance areas that have already been set up are Yi Wu, Jian Tian, and Luning. Ten Yi affairs guidance areas, such as Hubao, have been set up in the area where Yanyuan borders Yunnan, and their headmen have been improved according to the original customs and habits as district members and Baojia chiefs. Last year, the central government ordered the suppression of the rebellious Puxiong Ye Yi, and after months of war, the Puxiong Ye Yi were suppressed. Now the Cheng Yi Affairs Management Office is handling the aftermath, setting up two districts to promote all government affairs, setting up border people's schools, extensively implementing education, and setting up health centers to benefit the Yi people. Puxiong is divided into three upper, middle, and lower Puxiongs, with a width of hundreds of miles. If we can manage diligently and develop painstakingly, the future achievements are immeasurable. In addition, efforts such as relieving poor Yi people, relocating stubborn Black Yi, and promoting people's primary schools are also continuing to develop. Recently, the number of Lolo youths who have gone to various central military schools and Kang province for training has exceeded one thousand. This kind of Yi people's psychology can also be said to be unprecedented in the past thousands of years.

Han Chinese

Ya territory is generally a place where Han Chinese live. The situation is simpler than that of Kang and Ning territories. All government affairs can be fully implemented in accordance with the central laws. However, the people in these places are relatively strong, and the private grievances between the people are the deepest. The power of the Gelaohui is quite strong, and they all carry guns for self-defense. Occasionally, misunderstandings occur, and they fight each other endlessly. The banditry in Ya territory, which was noticed by the people of the country last winter and spring, was entirely caused by these internal factors. However, after this administrative review meeting in Ya territory, the government is implementing all the resolutions one by one. These shortcomings can be gradually remedied and reversed.

Current Achievements

Xikang is "poor in the present, but promising in the future." The authorities are trying their best to shorten the distance between "poor" and "rich." Although there are many difficulties and obstacles, they will never shy away from them. They have finally overcome the difficulties and obstacles, and have achieved several economic construction projects:

Industry

In terms of industry, there are leather, wool, papermaking, machinery, and chemical machinery factories. Although these factories are not very large in scale, they have a considerable amount and effect on the supply of materials during the war. After the victory, due to the pressure of funds and foreign goods, they felt a serious crisis. Now they are being adjusted and strengthened, and the future is very promising.

Agriculture

In terms of agriculture, there are Taili Pasture, Ya'an Farm, Tianquan Forest Farm, Simaqiao Farm, Bone Meal Factory, etc. The improvement of agricultural products in Kang Province has been quite successful. This year, the promotion of American cotton in Ning territory is about four to five thousand acres, and the land closed is about tens of thousands of acres. In terms of livestock, blood serum factories have been established to prevent and control animal epidemics, and emphasis is placed on the breeding of hybrid dairy cattle, the training of new cattle, and the improvement and breeding of yak and sheep. The progress is smooth and successful.

Mining

In terms of mining, the Huili Yimen Coal Mine and the Tianzishan Lead-Zinc Mine, as well as the coal in Rongjing and other places, have all increased capital and expanded the scope of work, and they will definitely achieve success in the future.

Water Conservancy

In terms of water conservancy, the Ya'an Qingyi Canal, Lichang Anning Canal, and Tianquan Shiyang Canal have all been completed one after another, irrigating a total of approximately 30,000 mu of farmland. Currently, the engineering of the Ya'an Zhougong Canal is being planned. In the future, when the first phase of the project is completed, it is estimated that 6,000 mu of farmland will benefit, and the annual increase will be up to 80 million yuan.

Transportation

In terms of transportation, after years of hard work, important transportation lines such as the Sichuan-Kang Highway, the Le-Xi Highway, the Xi-Xiang Road, and the Kang-Qing Highway have all been completed and opened to traffic. This year, the provincial government will also concentrate all the business expenses to build the Yafu Road, which runs through Sichuan-Kang, Le-Xi roads and connects Kang, Ning, and Ya. It will soon be possible to start construction and renovation. As for the freight transportation, such as the old Xi-Ri road, the Tai-Dan freight road, the Ya-Kang freight road, and the old Kang-Leng road, all have been reorganized and repaired. With the current transportation situation, there are highways directly connecting Sichuan and Kang provinces to the outside, and the important cities within the province can travel freely.

Looking at the current Xikang, in the border Kang, which used to see no smoke and motors, there are now emerging factories. In the past, there was no human agriculture, but now there are farms and pastures. In the past, no one paid attention to the mineral resources, but now scientific exploration has begun. In the past, Xikang could not see water conservancy, but now there are irrigation projects. In the past, there were no highways in Xikang, but now cars are running. We think it is much more advanced than before. If compared with Sichuan or the belly provinces with a long history of establishment, it is naturally behind. However, compared with the past Xi Kang, the facts are quite advanced.

Continue to Strive

Although Xikang has made progress and achieved good results in the present, it is entirely due to the efforts and struggles of the Kang people, because the acquired nutrition is insufficient and the tonic is too lacking. And there is another noteworthy issue, that is, Tibet, which the central government declared to be highly autonomous, is connected to Xikang. Due to the similarity of ethnic religion, culture, and customs, the relationship is very close. In today's complex international situation and the high call for national self-determination, how will the political direction of the moving Tibet change in the future? We are unwilling to speculate in advance. In short, her problem deserves close attention. The only hope is to accelerate the development of Xikang, arm it, make transportation convenient, and have sufficient military equipment, so as to control Tibet and consolidate national defense.
