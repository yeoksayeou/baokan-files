### Receiving Dalian and Lüda Repeatedly Obstructed; We Lodged a Protest with the Soviets; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issued a Public Statement Detailing the Process

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the obstruction of the reception of Dalian and Lüda, our government has lodged a protest with the Soviet side. (The main points of the protest can be found at the end of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' public statement.) It was delivered by Foreign Minister Wang to Mr. Federin, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy, on the morning of the 25th.

[China News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Mr. Federin, the counselor and Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy, visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie on the morning of the 25th, had a brief conversation, and then departed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the progress of the Dalian and Lüda reception issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following public statement on the 25th:

(1) After the surrender of Japan, in October 1945, when the Chinese government was about to take over the northeast, it decided to send some troops to land in Dalian and first receive the administration of Dalian and Lüda. Unexpectedly, the Soviet government, citing that Dalian was a free commercial port, firmly opposed the Chinese government sending troops to land in Dalian. Therefore, the first step of the Chinese government's reception of Dalian and Lüda administration was obstructed. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed in August 1945, Dalian was designated as a free commercial port, which meant that transit goods were exempt from transit taxes. This was unrelated to the stationing of Chinese troops in Dalian. The treaty clearly stipulated that sovereignty and administration of Dalian belonged to China. Except for those expressly stipulated in the treaty, the Chinese administration was not subject to any other restrictions. The treaty did not contain any explicit provisions restricting the entry of Chinese troops into Dalian. Therefore, the Chinese government's dispatch of troops to land in Dalian did not violate the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then refuted the Soviet view based on the above reasons.

(2) At that time, due to Soviet obstruction, Chinese troops could not be stationed in Dalian, and the reception of Dalian and Lüda administration could not proceed because Dalian and Lüda were still under Soviet military occupation. After the Soviet side refused the Chinese government's troops to land in Dalian, the military strength of the Chinese Communist Party rapidly developed in the vicinity of Dalian and Lüda. The existence and development of this military force also severely hindered the Chinese government's reception of Dalian and Lüda from land.

(3) In March of this year, the Soviet side expressed its hope that the Chinese government would establish its administrative authority in Dalian and Lüda. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that the reason why the Chinese government has not been able to receive Dalian and Lüda is the above-mentioned two obstacles.

(4) In the past three months, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly negotiated with the Soviet side regarding the reception of Dalian and Lüda. The Soviet side stated that there was no force against the Chinese government in the entire area of the Dalian and Lüshun naval base. The Soviet side guaranteed the safety of the administrative personnel sent by the Chinese government to Dalian and Lüda and that they would be able to freely exercise their functions. The number of armed police officers sent by the Chinese government to Lüshun and their stationing locations should be agreed upon locally by both parties. As for the Chinese government's decision to send troops to station in the Lüshun naval base area, the Soviet government stated that it could not agree because, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the protection of the naval base had been entrusted by the Chinese government to the Soviet government.

### The Sino-Soviet Treaty Did Not Restrict Our Sending Troops to Dalian and Lüda

Regarding the entry of Chinese military police into Dalian, the Soviet side cited that the state of war against Japan had not ended at that time, and according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Dalian should still be subject to the military control of the Lüshun naval base area. Therefore, the Soviet government believed that Chinese troops could not enter Dalian at present. China could only send police to Lüshun and Dalian, and the number and stationing locations must be agreed upon by China and the Soviet Union. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that according to the agreement on Lüshunkou in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the entire area of the Lüshun naval base is an area of "joint use" by China and the Soviet Union, and China of course has the right to send troops to the Lüshun military region. Therefore, it expressed its disagreement with the Soviet interpretation that Chinese troops could not be stationed in Lüshun. As for the Chinese army's entry into Dalian, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Dalian was under the control of the Lüshun military region during the "war against Japan." However, more than a year has passed since Japan surrendered, and the so-called "war against Japan" no longer exists in reality. Even during the "war against Japan," the Sino-Soviet Treaty did not contain any provisions restricting Chinese troops from entering Dalian. The control of Dalian by the Lüshun military region during the "war against Japan" should also be limited to meeting the needs of the joint Sino-Soviet war against Japan. The entry of our army and police into Dalian to maintain the safety of its administration, even during the "war against Japan," should not be seen as hindering the needs of the joint war against Japan. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly expressed its disagreement with the Soviet view in writing and requested the Soviet side to fully understand China's decision to send troops to Dalian and Lüda, because under the current circumstances, the Dalian and Lüda area can be threatened or attacked by forces resisting the government at any time. The Chinese government has the right to send troops under the treaty to ensure the safety and freedom of administrative personnel, and there is also a practical need for this. However, the Soviet side still did not express its agreement.

(5) Our government continued to negotiate with the Soviet side while sending Dong Yanhang and others to Dalian and Lüda to inspect the local situation in preparation for restoring the administrative power of Dalian and Lüda. Regarding the dispatch of personnel for inspection, our side had obtained the prior consent of the Soviet side, and the Soviet side stated that it should provide full assistance to Dong Yanhang and others' inspection so that they could freely perform their inspection tasks. However, after Dong and others arrived in Lüshun, they failed to obtain the assistance promised by the Soviet side and were obstructed by the so-called local administrative institutions, and their inspection mission could not be accomplished. The result of this inspection proves even more that without a sufficient number of Chinese military police stationed in Dalian and Lüda, Chinese administrative personnel will not be able to exercise their functions.

### Our Side Can Implement the Reception of the Administrative Power of Dalian and Lüda at Any Time

(6) In short, the administration of Dalian and Lüda has not yet been received by the Chinese government: (1) Due to the Soviet government's repeated refusal of Chinese government troops to station in Dalian and Lüda, (2) Because after the Soviet side refused the Chinese government's troops to land in Dalian, the Chinese Communist Party established a large military force near Dalian and Lüda to obstruct the Chinese government's reception. The Chinese government must solemnly call upon the Soviet government to pay attention to the following two provisions stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty: 1. "The Soviet government agrees to provide China with moral, military supplies and other material assistance. This assistance shall be provided entirely to the central government of China, to the National Government." 2. "The Soviet government considers the three northeastern provinces as part of China, reiterates its respect for China's full sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces, and reiterates its recognition of their territorial and administrative integrity." The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Soviet government will take into account its above-mentioned obligations and not distort the interpretation of matters not explicitly stipulated in the treaty, so as to undermine China's sovereignty and administrative integrity and obstruct the reception of Dalian and Lüda administration. The Chinese government is willing to continue negotiations in a friendly spirit to reach a consensus on each other's views. At the same time, China should solemnly declare that the Chinese government's right to send military police to receive Dalian and Lüda administration is not restricted by any treaty, and the Chinese government can decide to exercise its full power at any time.

### Xu Chuanlin Arrives in Shanghai; Talks About the Situation in Beijing

[Our Newspaper] Xu Fusu arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. When interviewed by reporters, he said: "When attending the State Council meeting in Beijing, many people in the meeting advocated suppressing the Communists, but no decision has been made yet. Under the current situation, I believe that reforming politics and winning people's hearts may be more effective.

### Song Ziwen Arrives in Beijing; Meets Chairman Chiang

### The Sino-Soviet Treaty Has Not Been Implemented; Causing General Unease; Dong Xian Guang Speaks at a Press Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau held a press conference on the afternoon of the 25th. Director Dong answered inquiries as follows:

Question: Vice-Chairman Sun met with reporters from the Central Daily News the other day. Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, he advocated that the Chinese government should protest to the Soviet government. Vice-Chairman Sun also said that he believed that the government had considered this step. Can Director Dong make a statement on behalf of the government?

Question: Does Vice-Chairman Sun's recent conversation with the Sino-American press represent the government's opinion?

Question: Does Vice-Chairman Sun's statement prove that Sino-Soviet relations have deteriorated greatly?

Answer: I cannot speak on behalf of Vice-Chairman Sun. However, Vice-Chairman Sun is extremely friendly to the Soviet Union and strongly advocates that China and the Soviet Union should establish close friendship. This is well known throughout the country. China's more than eight years of war of resistance and the recovery of the northeastern provinces are also its main purposes. China signed a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union after Japan declared its unconditional surrender in order to restore China's sovereignty over the northeastern provinces and to lay a permanent foundation for peace in the Far East. This treaty has been concluded for one year and eleven months, and it has not yet been implemented, thus creating a general state of unease and suspicion. Vice-Chairman Sun's expression of his concern about the serious consequences is natural.

### Issue of 50,000 Yuan Bills; Director Dong Says He Has Heard Nothing About It

Question: Yesterday's Shanghai newspapers reported that the government will issue large bills with a face value of 50,000 yuan. Does Director Dong know anything about this?

Answer: I have not heard anything about this. I don't think the government will issue such large bills.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] It is rumored that the government will issue a suppression order. At the press conference on the afternoon of the 25th, a reporter asked about this. Director Dong replied, "I have not heard anything about it."

### The Information Bureau Opens a Room for Reporters' Entertainment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Dong Xian Guang, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, in order to seek closer ties with the press, recently agreed to the reporters' request to allocate the small room used for the bureau's daily news meetings to the reporters as a permanent clubhouse.

### Lin Wei and Huang Zhenqiu Exchange Positions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced that the Vice Minister of the Ministry, General Lin Wei, and the Deputy Chief of Staff, General Ji Zhenqiu, will exchange positions. It is said that the two will take office in their new positions in the next few days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Bai Chongxi, the Minister of National Defense, will host a luncheon on the 26th for Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian, Minister of Education Song Jiahuo, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and will also invite Lin Wei, Qin Dechun, and others to accompany him.

### Measures for Announcing Population Statistics

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Population Bureau of the Ministry of Interior has formulated measures for the national population statistics and the timing of their announcement, that is, the statistics for half a year will be announced separately in January and July each year, and the population number will not be changed during this half year.

### Outer Mongolia's Reply to Our Protest Against the Xinjiang Incident Has Been Delivered; The Content Is the Same as the Soviet Broadcast

### An Observer of the International Situation Discusses: American Aid is Not a Problem; Sun Ke's Remarks are Only Personal Opinions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] An observer of the international situation here believes that Sun Ke's two talks with Chinese and foreign reporters are generally valued because Sun Ke is the Vice-Chairman of the National Government. However, before the Kuomintang and the National Government have expressed a decision, Sun Ke's remarks can only be regarded as his personal opinions. He said that regarding the northeast war situation, although the Communist army has an international background, the military authorities of the National Government are confident that they will be able to ensure their strongholds. The Beitashan incident in Xinjiang has no new developments. It can be seen that the Soviet Union may not show up and get involved in the vortex of debate on the Chinese Communist Party issue at this time. It is not a problem for the United States to support the National Government. It is only hoped that the Chinese government itself has a definite policy and a concrete plan for the use and repayment of loans. We can agree with the United States on the timing of the appropriation, and there is no such thing as abandoning China. Therefore, how the Chinese government rectifies politics, stabilizes people's livelihood, and stops the war is a problem for China itself, and there is no need to consider the timing of American loans.

### Ambassador Gu Discusses with American Businessmen; The Rumored Content Includes Two Points: Allocation of Loans and Other Assistance

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: Regarding American foreign economic assistance, Marshall's statement only stated that the State Department is considering possible assistance plans that the US Congress and American taxpayers believe are justified. However, authoritative sources said that the proposals discussed by the US authorities and Ambassador Gu Weijun included two points: (1) Designate the import-export bank loans lent to China before June 30 for immediate allocation, or provide assistance from other aspects. (2) A long-term plan for the construction of railways and industry, funded by the United States with loans totaling one billion yuan. Apart from Ambassador Gu saying that the State Department expressed its sympathy, there are no other decisions. Ambassador Gu told reporters that he hoped the June 30 deadline could be extended.

### American Congressmen Call for Aid to China; Advocate Fundraising to Aid China

[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] Joute, a Republican congressman and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently told the Washington branch of the United China Relief Association that the United States must help the Chinese people for moral, humanitarian and legal reasons. China has been an ally of the United States in the past two wars, and it should receive the assistance of the United States.

裘氏 continued, The American people should not stop helping the Chinese people. He also pointed out that there is a clear difference between donating funds from a friend's point of view to directly benefit the Chinese people and providing assistance through government-led loans.

The United China Relief Association stands on a non-partisan standpoint and allocates the funds raised to several Chinese institutions to train leaders in public health, welfare, medicine, and social work. The Washington branch's fundraising target is 80,000 US dollars. The association is now planning to launch a special donation campaign to make up for the shortfall. The national fundraising target is 8 million US dollars.

Former Ambassador to China Johnson also spoke.

The Forward Force of the National Army in southern Chang is now using fierce firepower to advance along both sides of the railway to the line of Gongzhuling.

The smoke filled the sky. The Communist army in Gongzhuling is quite strong. Some of the Communist troops in Siping withdrew to the east and west, with the east being Xisui and the west being Bamiancheng.

[Hapdong News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] According to reliable semi-official sources on the 25th, the Soviet Union has in fact handed over all military supplies seized from the Japanese Kwantung Army to the CCP forces in the three northeastern provinces, and has even supplied the CCP with its own materials on occasion. It is reported that the CCP forces received a total of 151 aircraft, 155 tanks, 186 armored vehicles, and 787 artillery pieces of various sizes.

The second phase was in May 1946, immediately after the CCP's disastrous defeat in Sipingjie, and it is rumored that some pillboxes were included in the materials allotted this time. The third phase was from January 1947 to June 15, and the quantity was the largest this time, enabling the "Democratic United Army" to launch four spring offensives earlier this month and the large-scale fifth offensive this time.

Northeastern People Feel Excited After Sun Ke's Speech

[Our Correspondent, Changchun, 24th] After local newspapers published Vice President Sun's speech to Chinese and foreign reporters, issuing a warning about the new world crisis, the general public was extremely excited, especially the people of the Northeast who had been under enemy puppet rule for fourteen years. Since experiencing the so-called "restoration life" after liberation, it was like injecting a shot of cooling and invigorating medicine into their numb nerves. They recalled the growth of the CCP army in the Northeast and the destruction of the industrial and mining equipment and all construction that had been obtained in exchange for fourteen years of enslaved life. Now, with the flames of war spreading, life and property are constantly threatened. Therefore, rather than coexisting and muddling along with the CCP, they would prefer a clarification of the current situation and unanimously support Sun's speech.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] Regarding Vice President Sun's speech on the new world crisis, this reporter specifically visited Director Xiong at the Executive Headquarters. He received the reporter and said: "I have been in charge of the Northeast takeover for more than a year, and based on my personal experience, I deeply believe that the Chinese Communist Party's reliance on foreign support is ruining our country's lifeline and brewing a third world war. I completely agree with all points of Vice President Sun's speech." In his conversation with the reporter, Director Xiong recalled the difficulties encountered everywhere in the takeover of sovereignty in the Northeast after the Japanese surrender, as well as the fact that most of the weapons seized from the Kwantung Army were used by the CCP forces. He also mentioned with emotion that trained Japanese prisoners and Korean communists are now openly collaborating with the CCP forces in combat.

### Next General Assembly Scheduled for November; Representatives from Various Countries to Go to the Capital Tonight to Meet the Chairman

[Our Correspondent] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its first meeting at the Hua Lian Hotel starting on the 16th of this month. After nine days, it officially concluded at 1:20 PM yesterday. The committee discussed its final agenda item yesterday, namely the date and location of the next meeting. There was some debate at the time, and it was eventually decided that the next meeting would be held in the second half of November, with the exact date to be determined by the secretariat. As for the venue, due to differing opinions, it was decided to move the decision to the plenary committee meeting of the commission to be held in New York on July 10.

The purpose of this meeting was to plan and organize a United Nations economic organization for Asia and the Far East in order to assist in the economic reconstruction and recovery of Asia and the Far East after the war.

The Chinese and Filipino representatives will also go to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to lay wreaths and pay their respects.

### Relaxed Debate During Discussion of Date and Location of Next General Assembly

During yesterday's general assembly discussion of the date of the next meeting, Walden, Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, suggested holding it in late November, so that the secretariat would have sufficient time to complete the heavy workload assigned by the committee, and the committee itself would have sufficient time to prepare a report to submit to the Economic and Social Council. Soviet Representative Styechenko suggested convening it around December 1, while French Representative Molnor suggested November 17. The final decision was to hold it in the second half of November.

When the issue of the meeting venue was raised, representatives from Qian, the Philippines, China, and India all invited the meeting to be held in their respective countries on behalf of their governments, and all guaranteed that the participating representatives would receive various conveniences. Philippine Representative Guaderno also emphasized that the climate in the Philippines is good and transportation is convenient.

Chinese and American Representatives' Apt Analogies

Chinese Representative Li Mu-an likened the meeting venue to a young person showing off, whom everyone wants to woo. The Chinese government also hopes that the next meeting will be held in China again. If the representatives feel that the supply and transportation are convenient this time in Shanghai, they are welcome to hold the next meeting in Shanghai, the metropolis of the East. Moreover, Article 2 of the rules of procedure states that the meeting venue should be held at the office of the United Nations organization. At the same time, the Economic and Social Council has resolved that before the permanent office is decided, it will be temporarily located in Shanghai, so Shanghai can be the venue for the next meeting.

The Soviet representative advocated holding the meeting in India.

Just as this issue was deadlocked, British Representative Crowe suggested handing it over to the plenary committee to discuss further when it meets in Lake Success, New York. Representatives from Britain, Australia, and France all agreed. Davis even changed Li Mu-an's analogy, saying: The meeting venue is not like a young person showing off, but like a young girl showing off, being pursued by a group of admirers. We are very grateful for everyone's enthusiastic welcome, but it would be more appropriate to discuss it at the New York meeting.

However, the Soviet representative strongly opposed, saying: The Soviet representative will not participate in the plenary committee in New York, so they insist that it must be decided at the current meeting.

A final vote was taken, and it passed by a vote of nine to one (Soviet Union) to discuss it at the New York meeting.

The temporary headquarters of the committee will also be temporarily located in Shanghai.

Furthermore, Chairman Chiang Ting-fu brought up the resolution passed by the general assembly the day before, which had not been formally processed, and requested that it be formally approved. The Soviet representative stated that this resolution did not satisfy the Soviet delegation, so they abstained from voting, while other representatives believed that the resolution could not completely satisfy all representatives, so they supported its formal passage.

Gratitude to the Chairman and Secretary

Before the closing of the first meeting of the Economic Commission, British Representative Crowe specially thanked Chairman Chiang Ting-fu for leading the meeting, the secretariat for its excellent work in a short period of time, and the Chinese government for its enthusiastic hospitality and all supplies.

Chiang responded by thanking the representatives for their spirit of cooperation and their thoughtful consideration. He said: The Chinese government is very pleased to provide everything for the representatives. Walden thanked all the secretariat staff on behalf of them for the representatives' praise of their work, and stated that there were fewer staff members than any similar meeting, and at the same time, the time was tight, resulting in many shortcomings. In addition, he also thanked the Chinese government for all the conveniences it provided.

### UNRRA China Office Urges Kuomintang and Communist Parties to Cease Military Operations and Expedite Yellow River Levee Restoration

[Our Correspondent in This City] The UNRRA China Office recently requested that both the Chinese Kuomintang and Communist parties immediately cease any military operations within the entire Yellow River riverbed and five miles on either side of the levees, so that the levee restoration work can proceed at the highest speed before the end of July. When Cleveland, Director of the UNRRA China Office, issued the above appeal, he also warned both sides that if they do not maintain "a high degree of statesmanship, then the floods in July will breach the levees in one or more places, not only will millions of farmers in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces suffer greatly, but also the parts of the levee restoration work that have been completed will be completely destroyed. Cleveland suggested a cessation of all military operations along the entire Yellow River from Huayuankou downstream, so that the minimum levee restoration work can be completed. It is said that even if both sides issue the order and work together to restore the levees, the annual floods may still come, but if the order to cease military operations is not issued, then UNRRA will be unable to assist in undertaking the necessary levee repair work. The above suggestion was personally delivered by Cleveland to Chief of Staff Chen Cheng and Premier Zhang Qun, and at the same time telegraphed to the UNRRA North China Office for transmission to the highest authorities of the Communist side."

### Major Flood Season Approaching for the Yellow River; Shandong and Henan Hastening Levee Repair

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th] The major flood season of the Yellow River will arrive in a month, so the levee restoration project is even more urgent. Now, the government, the CCP, and UNRRA have formed a joint committee dedicated to handling the engineering work in the more complex areas within Shandong Province. UNRRA consultant Todd recently went from here to Cao County to attend the first meeting of the committee. At present, the levee restoration work within Henan Province, except for the Meng County area, where construction is more difficult due to the presence of CCP troops, can be completed on time in other areas as long as there are sufficient materials. The Dasha River within the Wu'an area, which connects to the Yellow River, also needs to be blocked and repaired at the same time. However, the south bank of the river is controlled by the CCP army, so construction is also difficult. The Henan Province Flood Prevention Office here plans to ask the joint committee to find a way to solve the problems that have arisen in the areas where the CCP army is hindering construction.

### Longyan Iron Mine to Resume Operations

Expediting Repair of Railway Branch Line; Moving Out Stored Iron

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 25th] The Longyan Iron Mine of the National Resources Commission recently received orders to resume operations as soon as possible, and the mine is actively preparing for an early resumption of operations. At the same time, the Pingjin Railway Bureau immediately began work to repair the branch line from Xuanhua to Yantongshan for the mine. The materials for construction, in addition to dismantling the secondary branch lines in various places, can reach Xuanhua and be extended for about five kilometers. For the remaining five kilometers, 32-pound light rails will be used. Once the branch line is repaired, the stored iron in Yantongshan can be transported out first.

### Amendment to Inheritance Tax Law to be Discussed by the Political Affairs Council

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The draft amendment to the Inheritance Tax Law has been prepared by the responsible authorities and will be discussed and approved by the Political Affairs Council before being sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The Inheritance Tax Law was promulgated and implemented on April 16th last year. According to the provisions of the law, estates with a total value of over one million yuan are subject to taxation, and the tax rate adopts a progressive system. Those over one million yuan are taxed at 2%, those over two million yuan are taxed at 2%, and so on, up to those over ten million yuan, which are taxed at 60%, which is the highest tax rate. Since the law was implemented, due to currency devaluation, the originally set tax threshold of one million yuan has become too low, and taxing those over ten million yuan at 60% is also too high. The threshold for taxation in this amendment has been raised to thirty million yuan, and the tax rate starts at 1%, still using a progressive system, with the maximum amount changed to 30%, in order to achieve fairness and rationality.

### Far East Military Tribunal Adjourns for Six Weeks; Mei Ruan and Others Arrive in Shanghai; To Report to the Capital Within Days; Scheduled to Return to Japan at the End of Next Month

[Our Correspondent] Mei Ruan, judge of our country's presence on the Far East International Military Tribunal, along with prosecutors Wu Xueyi and Xiang Zhejun, flew from Tokyo to Longhua Airport in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday.

Mei's Remarks

When interviewed by reporters, Mei said: The Far East Military Tribunal has decided to adjourn for six weeks starting from June 27th, until August 4th. This move was in response to the request of all the defendants' lawyers, so that they could make full preparations during this adjournment period. On the other hand, the Far East International Military Tribunal has been continuously in session for fourteen months, and no court in the world has ever been in session for such a long time. All staff members should be tired, and they can also take advantage of the adjournment to take a short break. I have been on leave from the Legislative Yuan for more than a year and a half, and now that the Legislative Yuan is about to be reorganized, I also need to return to the country to report. I plan to go to the capital to report in two or three days. If time and transportation permit, the two prosecutors Wu and Xiang will go to the Southwest to investigate evidence of war crimes. Mei continued: The outside world feels impatient because the trial of war criminals by the Far East Military Tribunal has been delayed for so long, which is understandable. During the trial process, the quality of the various aspects involved and the difficulty of collecting evidence were somewhat unexpected by the judges. The entire history of Japanese military aggression, stretched to ten years, has made the trial situation even more complicated. Before leaving Tokyo, all the judges of the court invited all the defendants' lawyers to discuss how to speed up the proceedings, and the presiding judge also expressed the hope that the trial work could be completed by the end of this year. However, it is still unknown whether this wish can be fulfilled. Moreover, Mei and his party are scheduled to return to Japan at the end of July.

### First Group of Refugees Evacuated from Vietnam Arrives in Kunming

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 25th] The first group of sixty-four Chinese refugees evacuated from Vietnam (one person died after arriving in Kunming), who were connected by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Kunming delivery station, departed from Hekou on the 4th and arrived in Kunming by train on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway on the morning of the 23rd. They were received and accommodated by the Liangguang Guild Hall, and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration provided them with food expenses of 3,000 yuan per day. This group of refugees was extremely tired along the way, and more than half of them contracted illnesses. Efforts are being made to treat them. There are still over a thousand refugees staying in Hekou, and the second group of over three hundred people is expected to arrive in Kunming on the evening of the 26th.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Routine Meeting Decides on This Year's Field Tax Quota

Two Dou Two Sheng Four Ge Per Yuan

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 25th] In order to reduce the burden on the people, the Jiangsu Provincial Government re-decided on this year's Tianfu (field tax) quota at yesterday's routine meeting. The additional levy was completely abolished, with a levy in kind of one dou six sheng, and a levy in public grain of 40%, totaling two dou two sheng four ge per fu (tax unit). All additional levies are strictly prohibited. The expenses for the levy in kind will be borne by the central government, and the expenses for the levy in currency will be raised locally. The starting date for the levy will be in mid-July for counties levying in currency, and will be determined based on the earliness or lateness of harvests in counties levying in kind.

### Northeastern Cloth Prices Are Low; Rushing Back to Pingjin

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 25th] Northeastern cloth used to be transported out of the Guan (mountain pass/Northeast), but recently, due to the war, the Northeast has experienced low prices and high gold prices. Each piece of Shenyang Da Wufu cloth is only worth 25,000 yuan in circulating currency. Pingjin merchants, seeing the potential for profit, have rushed out of the Guan to return to Pingjin to sell cloth, resulting in a phenomenon of cloth flowing backwards.

### Sichuan Opens Grain Controls; Chengdu Rice Prices Already Trending Downward

[Our Correspondent, Chengdu, 24th] In order to stabilize the soaring rice prices, the Sichuan Provincial Government, following the request of the provincial and municipal councils, opened grain controls on the 24th, restoring free purchase, and dispatched dozens of inspection vehicles to various counties in the production areas to clear the grain routes and investigate hoarding.

The central government has specially proposed a total project cost of 7 billion, and construction has actively begun.

### Australian Minister to China Hosts Reception for Reporters in Shanghai; Expresses Opinions on Policies for Controlling Japan; And Points Out Reasons for Sluggish Sino-Australian Trade

[Our Correspondent] Australian Minister to China Dr. Keith Officer hosted a reception for reporters at 4:30 PM yesterday, expressing his opinions on the Allied policies for controlling Japan, saying: Australia and China are both now concerned that MacArthur's control policies will create an excessively powerful Japan. The British Empire will hold an imperial conference in Australia on August 26th to conduct a thorough discussion of the Japanese peace treaty. Japan's whaling in Antarctica (for news on this matter, please see page 3) and the scheduled opening of private Japanese trade in mid-August were both unilateral decisions made by MacArthur's headquarters. The execution of Japanese reparations should be part of the peace treaty with Japan, and should not be decided by the occupying forces. When discussing commerce between China and Australia, the Australian Minister said that the current sluggishness is due to two reasons: one is that Australia currently has large domestic needs and has no goods to sell, and the other is that it is affected by China's import controls. However, Australia's industry has developed very rapidly during the war, especially the steel industry. Due to its geographic environment and superior management technology, it can now produce the cheapest steel in the world. In the future, wool textiles and steel products will be exported in large quantities. The Sino-Australian immigration issue can also be resolved under the principle of reciprocity.

### US Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Wang; Issues Statement on Eve of United Nations Anniversary; Tradition of Sino-US Friendship Has Significance for World Peace

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] Ambassador Stuart visited Foreign Minister Wang on the morning of the 25th and had discussions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] US Ambassador Stuart issued a statement to reporters on the 25th on the eve of the United Nations Anniversary. Stuart stated that the long tradition of Sino-US friendship has great significance for postwar world and Pacific peace. He also said that the US "Fulbright Act" is expected to be implemented by the end of this year or early next year. According to the Act, payments from various countries for US surplus materials will be entirely transferred to cultural cooperation projects between those countries and the US. Of this, US$20 million will be used in China, totaling US$1 million per year for twenty years. When applied, this amount will be converted into Chinese currency and used to send American professors and students to China and encourage Americans to study Chinese culture. Stuart expressed his deep sympathy for the Chinese student movement. He said that the main motive of the Chinese student movement is based on patriotism and concern for the government's pursuit of peace. He continued that Chinese students going to the US for further study are feeling overly crowded because US universities are accommodating soldiers. At the same time, the English proficiency of Chinese students is uneven, so the US Consulate General in Shanghai holds English tests for students going to the US, and only those who pass are given visas to avoid wasting the students' time and money. The Ambassador continued to describe the recent situation at Yenching University, saying that Yenching University is experiencing financial difficulties and will reduce the number of faculty and staff in the second half of the year. The reason for the difficulty is that the interest rates on US savings after the war are low, and the income from the endowment fund is very small. US taxes after the war are heavier, and most people are unable to donate.

### Japan Promotes "Starvation Export" Movement; Our Government Should Seek Countermeasures; Industrial and Commercial Circles Must Not Continue to Produce Shoddy Goods and Invite Their Own Demise

Jian Guansan's Observations

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] According to Tokyo dispatches, Japanese trade with China is about to open, and Japan is promoting "starvation exports." As Japan was originally the most developed country in light industry, its military may have failed, but its light industry has not failed. Now that it is revitalizing foreign trade, the first country to be affected will be our country, which is lagging behind in industry. Japan has recently had a movement to produce cheap goods, and now there is a "starvation export" movement, which should indeed alert our people. Our country does not oppose Japan's economic adjustment, but it should be subject to appropriate restrictions to avoid hindering our industry and commerce. To cope with this, in addition to the government quickly submitting countermeasures to the Far East Commission, industrial and commercial circles should deeply awaken, change the bad habits of price-increasing competition and shoddy production, so as not to invite their own demise. All sectors should launch a campaign to love and use domestic goods to maintain the weak life of the national industry.

### Measures Planned Internally to Prevent Election Fraud

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The general election is approaching, and in order to prevent election fraud, the Ministry of Interior has drafted a "Method for Preventing and Sanctioning Possible Malpractices in Elections," the main points of which are recorded as follows:

(1) Illegal handling of elections: Based on experience in elections of provincial, municipal, and county councilors, local administrative authorities, in order to manipulate public opinion or due to collusion with candidates, may illegally handle elections in a way that is unfavorable to certain candidates being elected. This includes (A) forging voter registration lists or election results, (B) not handling election affairs according to legal procedures, such as not announcing the election date within the statutory time limit, or not holding elections on the statutory seven days, or not holding elections in all units and districts simultaneously. Although situation (A) is rare, specific provisions should be made to stipulate penalties. Whether situation (B) is still invalid or valid, or under what circumstances it should be considered valid or invalid, should be clearly stipulated, and penalties should be prescribed.

(2) Ineligible voters: Such as (A) citizens who do not belong to this area participating in voting in this area, (B) those who do not have membership qualifications in vocational groups participating in vocational group elections, (C) impersonating voters, (D) one person having more than two voting rights, who should choose one to participate according to regulations, but instead participate in more than two units. To prevent ineligible voters, a system of public inspection of voter registration lists should be adopted, that is, several days before the election, the voter registration list should be compiled, and the competent election authority of the district or group should prepare a copy and place it in an appropriate place to allow voters to request inspection at any time within a certain number of days and to make copies.

(3) Ineligible candidates: Such as (A) those who have circumstances under Article 6 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law, or who are under the statutory age, (B) those whose right to stand for election has been suspended, (C) those who have more than two rights to stand for election and violate the rule of not participating in multiple elections simultaneously. To prevent ineligible candidates, a similar approach to public inspection of voter registration lists should be adopted, allowing voters to raise objections to candidates within a certain number of days before the election. Those who have been determined by a final judgment to be ineligible to stand for election should have their candidate status revoked. Even after the election is announced, if voters or candidates confirm that the elected candidate is not qualified, they may still file a lawsuit within the statutory period. Those who participate in elections in more than two regions and are elected simultaneously should be deemed invalid, and those whose election is ruled invalid should be fined.

(4) Using coercion or violence or other illegal methods to prevent voters from freely exercising their right to vote, or intimidating voters: (A) abducting voters, (B) intimidating voters, (C) using force to coerce voters at the time of voting to exercise their voting rights in a certain way, (D) disrupting the voting with fraud or force, making it impossible to conduct the voting.

Regarding situation (A), it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the criminal law regarding crimes against freedom. Regarding situation (B), conscription should be temporarily suspended within a certain number of days before and after the election, or imprisonment should be imposed, and their right to vote or to stand for election should be suspended, and those elected should be deemed invalid. Regarding situations (C) and (D), non-voters must be prohibited from entering polling places, and voters must be strictly prohibited from carrying weapons into the polling places. It is also necessary to stop all campaign activities during voting.

(5) Offering wine and meat, loans, positions, or other benefits to bribe voters, promising not to exercise their right to vote or to exercise it in a certain way. Prevention measures: (A) During a certain period before the election, candidates or others are strictly prohibited from holding banquets or giving gifts to voters to solicit votes, and those who violate this should be fined, and candidates who do so should have their candidate status revoked. (B) Specific provisions should be made for Article 143 of the Criminal Law, stipulating the years of suspension of voting rights and the right to stand for election for those who commit violations, and those elected should be deemed invalid.

(6) Secretly investigating election secrets: Such as (A) election officials numbering election ballots or using other symbols, (B) using authority to monitor voters writing ballots, (C) revealing the contents of ballots on behalf of voters. Regarding situation (A), the election should be invalid, and the officials responsible for handling the election and those who direct them should be sentenced to eight months in prison. Prevention methods for (B) and (C) include (i) using fixed candidate methods to replace ballot writing methods, (ii) setting up a number of single-person ballot-writing booths, and appointing people from open areas to serve as substitute examiners, (iii) arriving in the area as late as possible before voting and leaving as soon as possible after the election, (iv) prohibiting specific personnel from communicating with anyone in the area except for necessary official duties, (v) not publicizing their names.

Editorial

### The Second Anniversary of the Birth of the United Nations Charter

Today is the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco. As we commemorate the signing of this historical document, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is still holding its meeting in Shanghai. We recall that when the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco, it was at the time of the collapse of the Nazis and the intensification of the war against Japan. The birth of this Charter gave people all over the world a beautiful vision for world peace after enduring the suffering of war. The war against Japan had not yet ended at that time, but a new world organization had already emerged in the fog of war. All mankind placed their hopes on this new institution. They knew that the failure of past international organizations lay in their inherent shortcomings. The League of Nations was created at the same time as the Paris Peace Conference, making it inseparable from the peace treaty, and thus it met its doom. The United Nations Charter was born in the suffering of war, expressing an awakening among people all over the world: that mankind must continue to survive in international cooperation, that the order of international society must be maintained, and that the maintenance of this order must be sought through a strong international organization. Two years ago today, when representatives of various countries signed this historic document in San Francisco, the mood of the general public was extremely high. They believed that with this institution, the order of international society would be ensured thereafter. However, the facts that have unfolded in the past two years have inevitably made those who were in high spirits back then feel a sense of disappointment. The cessation of hostilities against Japan is now almost two years past, but the current international order has not yet tended toward stability. Now, on the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, we cannot help but feel a great deal of emotion.

The United Nations organization was created under more suitable conditions than the League of Nations. The failure of the international situation to stabilize in the past two years is a fact, but this is not necessarily related to the United Nations organization itself. The United Nations organization itself has been constantly developing in the past two years, and its internal organization has become increasingly sound. The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East holding its meeting in Shanghai today is enough to show that the United Nations itself is growing and developing every day. In the past two years, at the various meetings of the United Nations organization, representatives of various countries have gathered together to exchange opinions. Although agreements may not necessarily be reached on some major issues, it is already a welcome thing to have this opportunity to present the views of all parties. The world thinks that the use of the veto power by the United Nations Security Council will turn the United Nations organization into a very incapable organization; but we feel that the capability of the United Nations organization does not lie in the provision of the veto power, but in how the veto power is used. From a theoretical interpretation of the Charter's veto provision, we feel that having this provision is not necessarily harmful: the problem lies in how it is actually used. And how it is actually used is unrelated to the United Nations organization itself, and cannot be controlled by the United Nations organization itself. From an organizational point of view, the United Nations organization can indeed be said to be an ideal international organization. The reason why its performance in the past two years has disappointed some people should be sought outside the United Nations organization.

What is the main reason for this: It is the world's abuse of the United Nations. The United Nations organization has not failed to exert its powers and functions. And the abuse of the veto power is a sign of the failure to give the United Nations organization the care it deserves. If this organization is cherished, it will surely be able to develop smoothly and fully exert its due powers and functions. The abuse of the veto power, therefore, has a destructive meaning. However, the core of the problem is still a lack of faith in the United Nations organization; there must be faith in this organization before there can be care for it. The United Nations organization is something that was created. Those who created it must have faith in and care for what they created, and then what was created can grow and develop. What the United Nations organization has encountered is not an inherent shortcoming, but a lack of care and a lack of faith in it. Today, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, we want to emphasize this point in particular: We must cherish this organization and strengthen our faith in it. Speaking of faith in this organization, we still remember that the Chinese representative who attended the San Francisco conference at that time proposed that China was prepared to give up a part of its sovereignty in order to strengthen this international organization, which shows how deeply we cherish this organization. If all countries could have as much care for this organization as we do, the United Nations organization could exert its power.

If we pursue the question further, we can see that the coordination and international cooperation of the United Nations organization have suddenly become diplomatic rhetoric. The main reason for the failure of international coordination lies in suspicion and distrust. We must eliminate those situations that can cause suspicion and distrust, and there must be an awareness of force and deceit, transforming suspicion into harmony and turning distrust into coordination. The Nazis failed, and the Japanese militarists failed; but today there are still people who want to follow their path to establish world domination. The unrest that appears in various parts of the world is a direct cause of this. We must eliminate this hegemonic doctrine of world domination, and then there can be true international cooperation. The so-called abuse of the veto power also stems from this. Only when there can be full cooperation among nations can international organizations like the United Nations exert their power. Now, on the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, we call for closer cooperation among nations.

### Leaders of Four Powers to Broadcast Today on Second Anniversary of Signing of United Nations Charter. Stalin Refuses to Participate for Unclear Reasons.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 24th] Marshal Stalin has refused an invitation to participate in a broadcast program by other leaders on the anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter on June 26. The United Nations Radio and the American Broadcasting Corporation have agreed to allocate half an hour on that day to broadcast talks by Chinese Chairman Chiang, American President Truman, British Prime Minister Attlee, French Premier Reynaud, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, and United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie. Stalin's refusal to participate did not specify a reason.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 24th, Associated Press] The United Nations announced that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall will pay an informal visit to the United Nations headquarters on the 26th to attend the second anniversary ceremony of the signing of the United Nations Charter. Both the U.S. government and United Nations officials solemnly stated that Secretary Marshall's first visit to the United Nations has "absolutely no special mission." It was also announced that Stalin has notified the United Nations that he will not participate in the broadcast by the other four power leaders to celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter. The notification was delivered to the United Nations by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko. U.S. President Truman, British Prime Minister Attlee, Chairman Chiang, and French Premier Reynaud, upon receiving Stalin's refusal to deliver a broadcast speech, have agreed to broadcast their own recordings on the anniversary of the Charter. Officials from the United Nations Broadcasting Team stated that they will broadcast to the world in twenty-one languages as originally planned.

### Review of Work Over the Past Two Years

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 25th] As the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter approaches, representatives of various countries generally acknowledge that the success or failure of the United Nations organization depends on the member states themselves, especially the five major powers of China, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Currently, there are no signs of any country withdrawing. However, the general consensus is that the United Nations organization is still in its infancy and is not up to the task of an adult. Two years ago, on June 26, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco by fifty countries, with a place reserved for Poland. Membership has now increased to fifty-five countries, and other countries are still applying for membership. The United Nations has had active achievements and many setbacks in the past two years. Records of vetoes and continued disputes. The Security Council has discussed a variety of issues, including the Iranian issue, the Syrian and Lebanese issue, the Indonesian issue, the Spanish incident, and three cases involving Greece and the Balkans. The processing records show that the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from Iran, and British and French troops have also withdrawn from Syria and Lebanon. The Balkan investigation team has conducted on-the-spot investigations. The Indonesian issue was not submitted for discussion because the Netherlands regarded it as an internal affair, and the Spanish issue was temporarily put on hold because the United Nations organization was busy dealing with the Palestinian issue. In the social and economic spheres, dozens of conscientious representatives have spent a great deal of time trying to find ways to save the world from poverty, and their work is worthy of attention.

Few Achievements

United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie recently delivered a speech stating that the United Nations organization is a "growing organization." Lie pointed out that the disputes among the five major powers remain the greatest difficulty hindering the United Nations organization in the past two years. The embers of war still exist, important peace treaties have not been signed, and disputes continue unabated, which will have repercussions in the discussions of various United Nations agencies and will delay and complicate the world's reconstruction efforts.

Organizational Overview

The organization of the United Nations organization is becoming increasingly complex. The center of the organization is six bodies, namely (1) the "General Assembly," which has held three sessions and is scheduled to hold its fourth session this fall, with the Palestinian issue at the top of the agenda. (2) The "Security Council" is a watchdog for peace and meets at least once a week, being the most powerful agency of the United Nations organization. The General Assembly only has the power to make recommendations, while the Security Council has the power to enforce resolutions. (3) The "Economic and Social Council" has met four times and is formulating extensive plans to eliminate social and economic ills around the world, and will meet again in July. (4) The "Trusteeship Council" This council was established the latest and held a meeting once in March this year. (5) The "International Court of Justice" has always been located in The Hague. The Security Council has entrusted it with the British and Albanian mine dispute case. (6) The "Secretariat" is headed by Norwegian representative Trygve Lie as Secretary-General, with a term of five years, starting in 1946, with an annual salary of US$20,000 plus an office expense of US$20,000, with 2,600 employees. The budget for 1946 was over US$19 million, and the budget for 1947 was over US$27 million. In addition, a permanent headquarters is under construction. The cost is enormous.

### Holy Land Investigation Team Has Contacted Jewish Groups

[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 25th] According to news received here, the United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee has contacted Jewish terrorist elements. The chairman of the committee, Ster Strom, and committee member Hu Shize have contacted Jewish groups in Tel Aviv and stayed there anonymously overnight.

[Reuters, Gaza, 24th] When the United Nations Palestine Investigation Team arrived in Gaza by car from Jerusalem today, 30,000 Jewish residents kept their doors closed. The 54,000 Muslims and Christians of the Arab population also seemed disinterested. Only the Mayor of Gaza formally welcomed the thirty-car convoy of the investigation team, with very few onlookers. The boycott of the Palestinian Arab Higher Executive Committee seems to be strictly enforced.

### Secretary Marshall to Deliver Speech Explaining U.S. Foreign Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The State Department recently announced that Secretary of State Marshall will deliver a speech at the Governors' Conference in Salt Lake City on July 14. According to political sources, since July 14th is the French National Day, Marshal Marshall will likely explain the Truman Doctrine, U.S. foreign policy, and the aid plan he himself proposed.

### U.S. Aid to Europe Plan is a Product of Enlightened Policy

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall's plan for European economic recovery is to promote the enlightened doctrine of self-interest and is an effort to find practical ways to assist European industry. The plan is based on the principle of the United States helping Europe to avoid a major disaster in the future, and calls for the following steps: First, European countries that adopt the plan should join a joint plan for economic cooperation. These countries will provide resources, break down economic barriers, and receive the materials they need based on continental principles. Secondly, they should develop a plan outlining the foreign aid needed so that the United States can review this plan with reference to its own strength. Finally, the United States Congress should decide on the amount of aid to be provided by the United States and how to provide it.

### Revival of West Germany Should Be the Foundation of U.S. Aid to Europe

Secretary Marshall Emphasizes This Point in Letter to Bevin

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] "The Yorkshire Post" reported today that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall wrote to British Foreign Secretary Bevin stating that the revival of West Germany must be the foundation of the U.S. aid to Europe plan.

### Poland Willing to Cooperate with Other Countries to Implement Marshall Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The Polish Ambassador to the United States, Winiewicz, told the new U.S. Undersecretary of State Lovett today that Poland will cooperate with other European countries to implement the plan for aiding European economic recovery proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. Poland is ready to participate in drafting the European reconstruction plan. Poland is currently encountering numerous economic difficulties and needs U.S. economic assistance.

### Britain Emphasizes the German Question; Memorandum on Germany Being Drafted; Foreign Secretary Bevin to Take It to Paris

[United Press, London, 25th] After two discussions between Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Under Secretary of State Clayton, it was decided that he will fly to Paris tomorrow to meet with French Foreign Minister Bidault and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this Friday. They will discuss the best way for Europe to adapt to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's European Recovery Program and will suggest convening a conference of European nations as soon as possible.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Authoritative sources here revealed today that Foreign Secretary Bevin will bring a specially prepared memorandum on Germany's place in the Marshall Plan when he departs for the three-country talks in Paris. After receiving notification of Molotov's agreement to participate in the three-country talks, Bevin immediately instructed Air Marshal Douglas, Commander of the British Zone in Germany, to prepare an analytical report on the relationship between the German problem and the overall European post-war recovery problem. This plan is still being drafted in Berlin. Observers believe that the German question will be the most delicate and promising issue at the Paris talks. Although the German economic problem must be revisited during a detailed study of the Marshall Plan, the large-scale U.S. assistance now anticipated may reduce the severity of Soviet demands for reparations from Germany.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 24th] Diplomatic observers here commented that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's proposal concerns economic recovery, and the United States cannot stand aloof from this because one-fourth of Germany's territory is currently controlled by U.S. occupation forces; thus, the United States is also a European nation.

### Molotov to Fly to France Today for Three Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris; Clayton May Attend as Observer

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has informed the French government that he is scheduled to fly to Paris on Thursday morning to participate in the discussion of the Marshall Plan.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] According to reliable sources, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference may be kept confidential, with only a brief statement to the press each day. However, the procedures for this matter will be decided by the three foreign ministers themselves.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] According to well-informed sources, Clayton may travel to Paris on the 27th to attend the Three Foreign Ministers Conference on the Marshall Plan as an observer.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] France is pleased that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov accepted the invitation to attend the Three Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan and is even more gratified that the Soviet Union has not imposed any restrictions on the scope of the discussion. According to well-informed sources, it is highly likely that the British, Soviet, and French foreign ministers will temporarily avoid discussing fundamental issues (i.e., the actual distribution of U.S. aid) when they meet on the 27th and will only exchange general views. If the three foreign ministers were to immediately begin dealing with this issue in detail, it would not only be premature but also sufficient to provoke various political issues on which agreements have not yet been reached. If, as rumored, the United Kingdom and the United States want to give priority to western Germany, which is under British and American occupation and the nerve center of continental Europe, then France will likely express dissent on the grounds of security. The Soviet side believes that countries whose current difficulties were caused by German aggression should be given priority for aid. This view may receive sympathy from the French government. However, one thing we must understand is that local and national interests must be subordinated to the overall interests of continental Europe. The primary task of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference will be to determine the method for formulating the European Recovery Program. France has already notified the U.S. government that it supports the establishment of a special committee. According to responsible sources, this is the initial response. The three foreign ministers must be open-minded and discuss the entire issue together in Paris.

U.S. Attention Focused on Soviet Attitude

[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned today that although Secretary of State Marshall has flatly denied that the United States is taking an active role in the future of European economic recovery, the United States will still be forced to participate. This is because the United States' power in Europe not only controls the U.S. occupation zone in Germany but also cooperates economically with the British occupation zone in western Germany. The State Department's course of action depends largely on the Soviet Union's attitude toward the Marshall Plan for European economic recovery. If the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate, the United States may be more inclined to maintain a strictly detached position. Conversely, the United States will inevitably begin to organize a Western European economic group, and the United States will be either forced or willing to assume the supreme task of leading Europe. The Soviet Union's agreement to participate in the British, French, and Soviet three-country conference is considered here to be an encouraging sign.

### U.S. House Military Affairs Committee Passes Bill on Sending Military Missions

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 24th] The U.S. House Military Affairs Committee passed a bill today that provides detailed regulations on the issue of the United States sending military and naval missions abroad. Currently, the United States has such missions in China and Iran. The bill authorizes the President, in peacetime, to exercise wartime powers to send such missions to foreign governments at their request and under conditions deemed beneficial to the nation by the President. Secretary of State Marshall previously expressed support for this bill, stating that these missions are advisory groups and should not be regarded as combat units or expeditionary forces.

Mine owners have also indicated that they may be forced to close the mines tomorrow. John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, and other union leaders have remained silent today.

[Reuters, New York, 24th] Representatives of the bituminous coal mining industry in Washington estimate that at least half of the bituminous coal miners nationwide have begun a slowdown, which may inevitably expand into a full-scale coal miners' strike. In addition, workers in the construction and livestock industries have also slowed down to protest the new labor law. 12,000 workers at Brooklyn, New York, and New Jersey shipyards have also decided to stage a protest strike tomorrow.

### Labor Unrest Spreads in France in Protest of Fiscal Bill

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The French General Confederation of Labor recently issued a statement expressing disagreement with the fiscal bill recently passed by the National Assembly, saying that this bill will increase the burden on the working class.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The miners' strike in northern France is spreading today.

### Implementation of Constitutional Government Relies on Support of Public Opinion; Journalists Association Resolves to Petition Government to Increase Number of Reporter Representatives in National Assembly

The city's Journalists Association held a meeting of its executive directors yesterday. The executive supervisors and the group leaders of the administrative, organizational, research, and benefit groups of the board of directors also attended. After each group leader reported on association affairs, the following important matters were resolved: (1) Approval of the list of new members; (2) Petitioning the Ministries of Interior and Social Affairs to increase, as much as possible, the number of representatives that journalistic organizations should elect from within the total number of National Assembly representatives from occupational groups. The original wording of the petition is recorded below:

"It is noted that the number of National Assembly representatives from national occupational groups has been explicitly stipulated by the National Government in Article 4, Paragraph 6 of the 'Regulations on the Election of National Assembly Representatives After the Promulgation of the Constitution' promulgated on March 31 of this year: 'Four hundred and fifty are to be elected from occupational groups.' The same article also stipulates that 'the allocation of quotas for each of the preceding items will be determined by law separately.' Recently, it has been learned that the method for allocating the number of National Assembly representatives from occupational groups has been jointly drafted by your ministry and the Ministry of Social Affairs (Interior), in which the number of representatives from journalistic organizations is even less than that of the First National Assembly. Upon hearing this, the colleagues of this association were extremely astonished. Since the victory, the national news industry has developed rapidly, and the number of journalists in various places has increased several times compared with before the war. Therefore, in terms of the increase in the number of journalists, the number of representatives to be elected to this National Assembly should also be greater than that of the First National Assembly. In addition, the implementation of democratic constitutional government relies heavily on the support of public opinion. After the implementation of constitutional government, the position of journalists is obviously more important than before the war. The number of National Assembly representatives to be elected by them must be increased within the total number of occupational groups, in order to show the government's emphasis on the news industry and freedom of speech. In view of this, the colleagues of this association, after a meeting of the executive directors, decided to submit a petition to your ministry and the Ministry of Social Affairs (Interior) to properly regulate the allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives from occupational groups so that journalists across the country can elect a reasonable number of representatives in accordance with the law to attend the Constitutional National Assembly, exercise political power, and jointly seek the implementation and promotion of democratic constitutional government, in order to meet the ardent expectations of the people of the country."

The Executive Yuan has approved a fourfold increase in postal rates, that is, ordinary letters will increase from 100 yuan to 400 yuan. It is generally believed that the Legislative Yuan may also pass it. The central government has stipulated that the increase in telegram and long-distance telephone fees shall not exceed five times. The regulations are being discussed by the relevant authorities and are expected to be decided within this month.

### Dispute in the Performing Arts Circle: Mediation Underway

[Our Report] On the evening of the 22nd, Zhou Jianxing, manager of both the Golden Theater and the Tianchan Stage, ordered Yue Yunqing, a lighting technician at the Golden Theater, to go to the Tianchan Stage for contact.

[Our Report] Wang Xuanqing, 27, from Ningbo, who runs a cotton cloth business at No. 1 Jifuli, Ningbo Road, was recently defrauded of two rolls of black cloth by a Mr. Ma using bad checks. The cloth was handed over to Shi Huasheng, an accomplice of Ma, who stored it. Shi then transferred it to his female accomplice Luo Jingxin (a teacher at Xingye Elementary School).

### Verdict in Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor Drowning Case: Second Landlord and Wife Sentenced to Seven Months Imprisonment Each

[Our Report] The widely publicized case of the second landlord, Shao Kunshan, forcing the death of tenant Zheng Zongjing, was concluded yesterday morning in the Ninth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Zhu Qinghuang.

The District Prosecutor's Office prosecuted for the crime of obstructing freedom. Yesterday, the District Court ruled that Shao Kunshan and Shao Lu were jointly guilty of violence and obstructing the exercise of rights and were each sentenced to seven months in prison. The defendants were taken into custody after the verdict.

### Soviet Union's Expansionist Ambitions: Related to Communist Rampage; American Journalists Hosted Reporters Yesterday: Discussing the International Situation

[Our Report] The American newspaper tycoons, who arrived in Shanghai on a Pan American company round-the-world flight, hosted reporters from the city yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the conference hall on the second floor of the Capital Hotel. The American newspaper representatives attending were: Fred S. Ferguson, publisher of International News Service; Paul Patterson, publisher of the Baltimore Sun; Frank Gannett, publisher of the Gannett newspaper group; John S. Knight, publisher of the Minneapolis Star-Journal and Tribune; Leonard K. Nicholson, publisher of the New Orleans Times-Picayune; Erwin D. Canham, editor of the Christian Science Monitor; Helen Rogers Reid, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune; and Oveta Culp Hobby, publisher of the Houston Post. They answered questions about Sino-American relations and the international situation, respectively. (1) On the issue of loans to China, Fred Ferguson of INS stated: "The American people are generally headache over any loans; however, Americans generally sympathize with China, so China should have priority." Frank Gannett of the Rochester newspapers stated: "The world often misunderstands that the United States has sufficient power to arbitrarily help other countries, but in fact, we cannot create something from nothing. The source of loans is nothing more than increasing taxes and issuing banknotes, and both are harmful, so they must be taken seriously." Erwin Canham of the Christian Science Monitor expressed his personal opinion on the recent remarks of Vice President Sun of the National Government, stating: "The United States' assistance to China is not only in the economic and political aspects but is also broadly assisting in domestic welfare construction to make itself strong and prevent the expansion of the Soviet Union." He believes that the Soviet Union's expansionist ambitions are "intertwined" with the Communist Party's arrogance. (2) On the issue of America's attitude towards China, John Knight of the Minneapolis Star stated: "Americans generally hold a friendly attitude towards China. Marshall's statement when leaving China is largely sufficient to represent the thoughts of the general American people, hoping that China can stop the internal strife and unite." (3) Regarding the future of the United Nations organization, Frank Gannett of the Rochester newspaper believed that whether the United Nations can succeed can be summed up in one sentence: it depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union is willing to compromise, there is hope for success. Although the Soviet Union has already accepted Marshall's proposal for European recovery, in light of past events, it cannot give people extravagant hope. Although we very much hope that the plan will be successful to unify the European economy and solve the current difficulties. John Knight of the Minneapolis Star expressed: "I am quite skeptical of the value of the United Nations, unless the Soviet Union abandons the veto power, otherwise even revising the charter is useless." (4) Regarding the issue of freedom of speech, the reporters all denied that freedom of speech in the United States has been threatened. They believe that if freedom of speech is suppressed in China, the situation will become even worse. In addition, the reporters all expressed their utmost pleasure for this trip to Shanghai and Jinan, and Mrs. Reid and Mrs. Hobby hope to learn more about China so that they can find ways to assist after returning to the United States.

### Howard on Japan's Inability to Rise Again

Yesterday, American newspaper magnate Howard told reporters that Chairman Chiang is a true patriot, dedicated to improving the lives of the people and building democracy. China is still far from the goal of democracy, but the development process of democracy is inherently slow. Regarding possible American loans, he noted that China had wasted too much on loans in the past. If it wants new loans in the future, it must have a plan for their use and must have American personnel to monitor their use, only then will the loan have a chance of success. When asked about his views on the Far East situation, Howard believed that the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Far East, its past history, and the current situation in Northeast China all illustrate this. It is very difficult for the United States to counter this kind of expansion because the United States cannot start World War III. To make the Soviet Union respect treaties, it is naive to think that diplomatic pressure can make the Soviet Union yield.

The Soviet government is now propagandizing to its people at home that the United States is weakening, reminiscent of the domestic propaganda of Germany and Japan before World War II. In fact, even during the war, the Soviet government removed the trademarks on Lend-Lease materials and told its people that these American-supplied planes, tanks, and trucks were made in their own country. Of course, the Soviet army's heroic sacrifices are worthy of admiration, but without American material assistance, it would undoubtedly have failed. All Soviet politics are decided by the fourteen members of the Politburo, and the people know nothing about the international situation, allowing themselves to be led by the nose. I dare to make a bold prediction that although the United States does not want to go to war, if the situation continues to develop in this way, the United States will one day be forced to go to war, just like the Marco Polo Bridge Incident for China and the Pearl Harbor Incident for the United States. Regarding the

issue of controlling Japan, when reporters told him that the people of the country could not sympathize with MacArthur's policies, Howard did not quite agree, believing that MacArthur's control policies were extremely wise. Such achievements in two years could only be achieved by a political genius. His being selected as the first of the world's top ten greatest people is no accident. Japan's military and industrial potential has now been completely destroyed. As for supporting its industry and allowing it to fish, this is a practical necessity. The United States cannot afford to support Japan for a long time, just as China cannot afford to supply Japan with food for a long time. However, it cannot allow it to starve, so it is right to help it recover. As for fearing Japan's resurgence, China need not worry too much, because on the one hand, Japan's losses in the war are rare in modern history, and on the other hand, the United States suffered no less from Japan in the war than China. Strict supervision in the future is a matter of course. I have visited Japan several times after the war, so what I say has a basis.

### America Clipper Continues Flight to Tokyo This Morning

[Report from this newspaper] The American company's America Clipper, a global flight, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and will leave Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning to continue its flight to Tokyo. The plane has already been filled with 3,000 gallons of oil by Texaco in Shanghai, and the mechanical personnel of China Airlines have carefully inspected the parts, engines, etc., to prepare for completing the second half of the round-the-world flight. The American newspaper tycoon Howard, who traveled around the world on the plane, was warmly welcomed by all walks of life upon arriving in Shanghai. Last night at 6:00 PM, American Consul Davis held a grand cocktail party at his private residence at 1082 Lin Sen West Road, and at 8:00 PM, Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at his official residence at 201 Anfu Road, with Chinese and foreign dignitaries gathering together, making it a grand occasion. Howard and others will leave Shanghai this morning, and it is reported that they are taking with them a lot of information about the current situation in our country.

[Another report] According to the president of American Airlines, Che Li Bo, told reporters: The American global route was originally intended to have Shanghai as a central station, but due to the current difficulty in remitting foreign exchange, it will not pass through Shanghai for the time being. However, he believes that Shanghai will be included in the near future. The global flight is tentatively scheduled once a week, flying east and west, with Calcutta as the center. After that, it will gradually develop, planning to increase to three times a week, and hoping to have one flight every day by next year.

### Aurora University Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday, Mayor Wu Attended and Gave a Speech

The private Aurora University in this city held its graduation ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday in the university's auditorium. More than 100 people attended, including Mayor Wu, Bishop Hui, Dean Fang, and the French Consul General. First, President Hu gave a speech, encouraging graduates to maintain reason and serve the country. Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, praising the excellent academic style of Aurora University and detailing the government's painstaking efforts in handling the student unrest. He mentioned that the government had obtained detailed information in advance about the steps taken by the communist personnel remaining in Shanghai to instigate strikes, class boycotts, and market strikes. At first, it did not fully believe it, but later all of them were realized one by one. At this time, if the government waited for the chaos to take shape before forcibly suppressing it, the great losses suffered by the city could be imagined. Therefore, it had to take precautions. However, the arrested students were given all kinds of preferential treatment to ensure that their living arrangements were better than those at school. Once the danger was reduced, they were released. Even those with conclusive evidence were not detained for long. This proves the government's intention to protect young people, and it is hoped that young people will understand. In contrast, the cruel punishments suffered by the arrested people in the so-called liberated areas cannot be compared.

[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing on the 25th] In order to improve the administrative efficiency of secondary schools, the Ministry of Education issued a special order to public and private secondary schools across the country to pay attention to improving eight points: (1) After receiving various educational laws and regulations, they should be announced immediately or submitted to the school affairs meeting to report those related to the welfare of staff and students, and they should be publicly announced and followed. (2) The appointment of teachers in various subjects should be based on regulations. The initial appointment should be for one academic year in principle, and the renewal appointment should be for two academic years. (3) The number of teaching hours for full-time teachers in various subjects should be determined according to the complexity of the homework and practice in each subject. During the summer vacation, teachers and staff who are not at school should still be paid their salaries as usual. (5) The fees collected from students by various schools should comply with regulations and should not be collected under false pretenses or excessively. (6) The opening and closing of school semesters in various schools should be handled in accordance with the prescribed dates, and the opening of school should not be arbitrarily delayed or the vacation should be advanced.

### Public and Private Secondary Schools in This City Were Ordered by the Ministry of Education to Improve Separately, and Principal Tao Guangchuan of Jingye Middle School Was Commended by Order

The Ministry of Education previously sent supervisors to Shanghai to inspect secondary education, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has been notified based on the inspection report. The main points of the original order are as follows: (1) A small number of municipal schools have only one building, which is not only insufficient for classrooms but also has a small address and no place for extracurricular activities. The school buildings of private schools are mostly dilapidated and even more unsuitable, which has a great impact on the physical and mental development of students. The Bureau's plan to build secondary education districts should be gradually realized. (2) The equipment of municipal middle schools is mostly simple and should be planned in detail by the Bureau and enriched in stages. Schools with a long history and outstanding performance should be given priority to enrichment to show encouragement. (3) The number of public and private secondary schools in the city has reached a considerable number, and in the future, efforts should be devoted to the equipment of normal schools and vocational schools. The establishment of middle schools should be temporarily slowed down. (4) A small number of administrative personnel in charge of public and private secondary schools are unable to familiarize themselves with the current secondary education laws and regulations. The Bureau should distribute abstracts to each school separately for compliance. (5) Private secondary schools shall not concurrently run elementary schools. Those who have established elementary schools should be ordered to set up separate school sites. Registered private schools should be strengthened in supervision and gradually reach a considerable level according to their equipment and teachers. Unregistered private schools should be urged to improve, and those that are poorly run should be banned. (6) A small number of teachers in public and private middle schools are still not serious about marking students' textbooks. The personnel in charge of student discipline in various schools are also mostly unable to guide students' daily habits well. When teachers are absent for reasons, it is rare to see supplementary lessons or other remedial measures. These are all inappropriate and should be supervised and improved by the Bureau of Education. (7) The school boards of private secondary schools mostly do not ask about the school's various income and expenditure situations, and the school's economic audit committees are mostly in name only. The Bureau should order the school boards of each school to effectively handle them, or order each school to follow the example of the private Nanyang Middle School and hire an accountant to review the accounts at the end of each semester by the school board and report the audit opinions for review. (8) Tao Guangchuan, principal of Jingye Middle School, Cheng Kuanzheng, principal of Wusong Middle School, Cui Jianwu, principal of Daozhong Girls' Middle School, and Shen Jun, principal of Yunzhong Girls' Middle School, are enthusiastic about running schools, diligent, and practical. Yu Liwen, director of the junior high school department of the private Zhaohe Middle School, is diligent in his service. Zhu Guanlu, a Chinese teacher at the Municipal Xinlu Normal School, Jia Bingru, a science teacher at the private Nanyang Model Middle School, Wu Youfen, an English teacher at the private Peiming Girls' Middle School, and Chu Shaotang, a geography teacher at the private Xiaoguang Middle School, have good teaching methods and are worthy of observation. They should be commended separately by order.

### Ping Pong League Finals Begin: Shanghai Star Faces Hualianhua in First Battle Tonight at 8:00 PM in the Central Assembly Hall

The champions and runners-up of the various divisions of the second Shanghai Ping Pong League, organized by the Municipal Sports Association's Ping Pong Committee, have already been determined. The first final battle of the top eight teams will be held tonight (the 26th) starting at 8:00 PM at the Central Assembly Hall of the Jingwu Association near the Yokohama Bridge. Shanghai Star, the champion of the first division, will face Hualianhua, the runner-up of the second division. Chen Linsheng and Shen Bohong will be the referees, and Hu Shousheng will be the recorder. Admission is free, and visitors are requested to maintain order.

Shanghai Star was the champion of the Jinliang Cup last year. A few months ago, it traveled to Hong Kong and Macau, achieving seven wins and two losses, returning with a good reputation. This year, its strength has been significantly weakened due to its main player, Wang Youxin, working for the Jingwu Association. In the nine matches of the first division, it was slightly less impressive because veteran Lu Hanjun went to Hong Kong to do business, and Wang Changhou was sick and Huang Zhijun's skills deteriorated. Fortunately, due to the efforts of the four knights Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, Li Zongpei, and Yu Cheng, it was still able to win the first division. Hualianhua is unfortunately facing a strong opponent in its first match, and defeat is undoubtedly inevitable. However, with everyone working together, it should be able to put up a tenacious resistance against Shanghai Star. The lineups of both teams are recorded below:

(Shanghai Star) Ying Yaokang (Leader), Xue Xuchu (Captain), Fu Qifang, Li Zongpei, Yu Cheng, Cheng Aixin, Huang Gaoyuan, Huang Zhijun, Huang Zhisong.

(Hualianhua) Liang Jintang (Leader), Li Feixiang (Captain), Zhou Weixin, Ye Xuebin, Gu Jinxiang, Xu Jinfu, Mu Yunzhang, Liu Baotai, Ying Houjun.

### Hua Shares Rebound Sharply, Yong Yarn Spot and Deferred Both Halt

Hua shares initially showed anxiety yesterday, mainly because the settlement period was approaching, and the prospect of deferred delivery was still unclear. In addition, the interest rate outside the market remained at the original price, so there was fear, and repeated declines were seen. Unexpectedly, the gold black market was still rising, and telegrams from Hong Kong and Shanghai only showed a slight decrease, but the black price in this city had already fallen to within ten yuan. The price of yarn soared. A group of yarn and cotton giants from the Yarn and Cloth Building continued to add leverage, and the Cantonese gang occasionally encouraged them from the side, gradually rebounding. Near noon, the rising trend suddenly started again, forming a short squeeze. Yong Yarn spot and deferred both announced limit up, and deferred delivery also increased by more than 100 yuan, creating a new peak of 9600 yuan.

No. 162, No. 94, No. 89, No. 54, and No. 186 took advantage of the high price to sell slightly and have a return, but people's hearts have already turned against it. No. 224, No. 223, No. 212, No. 152, No. 197, No. 151, No. 97, and No. 35 all entered. Now, Yong Yarn spot rose from No. 42, No. 43, No. 99, No. 83, and No. 158 to the limit up limit.

### Yarn and Cloth Rise Fiercely, Authorities Closely Monitor, Resolving to Thoroughly Investigate Non-Industry Hoarders, Once Discovered, They Will Be Strictly Punished According to Law

The price of yarn and cloth has been soaring for several days, and the rising trend was even stronger yesterday. The price of 20-count yarn has soared to over 10 million yuan, and the prices of various cotton cloths have also skyrocketed. Since yarn and cloth are necessities for people's livelihood, the livelihood of ordinary people is greatly threatened after the price surge. Relevant authorities in this city have been paying close attention to this matter. If there are non-industry merchants engaging in speculation, pushing up prices, or engaging in hoarding, they will be thoroughly investigated. Once there is solid evidence, they will be strictly punished according to law.

The Price of Yarn Soars

Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual, a total of 433 pieces. The price of 20-count Shuiyue opened at 5.4 million yuan. Trading on the market was brisk, and people inside and outside the industry were eager to buy. The purchasing appetite of textile dyeing factories on this street was also strong, causing the prices of all fine yarns to reach new highs. The price of 42-count Lanfeng soared to 18.6 million yuan, continuing to rise by 1.1 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 20-count Special Ma was 11.4 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 yuan. The price of Shuangma yarn also exceeded the 10 million yuan mark, rising to 10.4 million, an increase of 950,000 yuan. The prices of the remaining 16-count and other yarns all rose by varying amounts of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

The Cloth Market is Strong

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was boosted by the participation of outside speculative funds and rumors that the Hong Kong exchange rate had shrunk sharply, and people's hearts were abnormally agitated.

### The Cotton Market Continues to Soar

Yesterday's spot cotton market situation was that the price of cotton yarn continued to rise strongly, and the price of cotton was driven up again. People's hearts were more and more optimistic. However, the side was quite willing to offer prices to buy, and customers sold at high prices, and trading was very active. Because yarn factories did not offer high prices, they replenished very little. Most of the transactions were internal industry trades. The transaction volume was about 2,000 pieces in each grade. The average price increase was 300,000 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. The factory price was calculated at 2.3 million for Mittlering, 1.95 million for N.T., 1.91 million to 2.06 million for Lingbao, 1.78 million for Shandong Tuolisi, 1.74 million for Hanxi, 1.78 million for Germany.

### The International Monetary Fund Opposes Buying and Selling Gold at Unfair Prices, Recommending Member States Take Effective Action to Stop Transactions

Reuters, Washington, 24th: The International Monetary Fund has requested that all member states take immediate action to stop gold transactions that exceed the gold price or exchange rate registered with the Fund. A statement issued by the Fund today said that the International Monetary Fund has considered international gold transactions around the world that exceed the registered value. Due to the importance of this matter, the Fund is preparing the following statement to express its views. The main purpose of the Fund is to stabilize world exchange rates. The Fund believes that continuing to buy or sell gold at prices that directly or indirectly cause the devaluation of foreign exchange transactions is sufficient to undermine the stability of exchange rates. Based on the information it has obtained, the Society believes that if it is not stopped, the aforementioned activities will become more and more extensive, and the exchange rate relations between the member states will be disrupted. Moreover, as a result of these transactions, most of the gold is in the hands of private individuals and is not concentrated in central institutions, so that monetary reserves are gradually reduced. For this reason, the Society strongly opposes engaging in international gold transactions at unfair prices. It also recommends that member states take effective action to stop such transactions with other countries or nationals of other countries. The Society also recommends that the governments of member states, based on the needs of the situation, contact the governments of other non-member states to jointly eliminate this source of exchange rate instability. However, the Golden Society will also study the problems caused by domestic gold transactions that exceed the registered price. As a result, it was decided that unless these transactions are sufficient to affect the establishment of new exchange rates, damage the exchange rates of other member states, or seriously weaken the international financial position of a member state, resulting in affecting that country's use of the Fund, it is not intended to oppose it temporarily. The Fund has requested that its member states promptly take action to implement the recommendations listed in this announcement.

Huajin Crepe was still priced at the previous day in the morning. High-end goods were quoted at 2,000 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rayon's skyrocketing, the price also rose to 24,000 yuan.

### Market Trading Quiet; Rice Prices Shift from Firm to Weak; Raw Materials for Oil Extraction Scarce, Prices Soar

Yesterday, the combined North and South markets received over 8,100 piculs of rice. Shops cleared their stock, but market trading was sluggish, and the market situation re-entered a downturn.  Jing rice fell by more than 10,000 yuan, while Zhongxia and lower grades of you rice fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Baiyuan rice also followed, dropping by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and Xian rice also decreased by 10,000 yuan.

Mung beans saw little activity in both arrivals and sales, with minimal price fluctuations. Red beans saw slight inquiries from Guangdong, gradually rising and increasing by another 10,000 yuan.

Broad beans from Shantou and Taiwan were suspended, causing them to soften and fall sharply by 10,000 yuan.

The oil market showed mixed trends, with crude oil purchases from Guangdong leading to firmer prices. Soybean oil supply from factories continued steadily, maintaining average prices. Clear oil softened, rapeseed oil remained stable, and sesame oil held firm.

[Our Newspaper] Edible oil prices rose again today. According to industry insiders, the recent halt of soybean exports from the Northeast has disrupted the source of raw materials for oil extraction, causing public panic and leading to panic buying.  Secondly, the sharp rise in black market foreign exchange and the resurgence of rice prices directly and indirectly contributed to the price increases.  Generally, oil merchants are still looking at the pre-war ratio of edible oil to rice prices. It is said that at that time, the market price of edible oil per dan could be equivalent to two dan of rice.

Yesterday, foreign stocks were stimulated by the gold exchange and black market, causing another price surge. Ewo Yarns opened at 760,000 yuan, with securities firms and banks buying, while Guangdong firms and retail investors offered some. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram rate dropped to 10.04, reaching a high price of 860,000 yuan before slightly leveling off.

They also stipulated the dates for foreign exchange advances in various regions with Central Bank branches to serve as a standard for handling rediscounts.

Regarding the collateral for pledge loans, according to bank lending procedures, the collateral should originally be stored in a food warehouse. To facilitate manufacturers' use of raw materials under pledge and sales of finished products under pledge, the committee has relaxed the procedures for storing collateral for rediscount loans, changing it to finished products or raw materials, with the principle of storing half of the collateral in the industry warehouse and providing convenience for the exchange of collateral at any time. For loans not exceeding 100 million yuan, the collateral does not need to be stored in a warehouse and is managed by the lending bank.

### Random Thoughts on the Western Frontier from Xinjiang

— Quick Report on the 22nd, Jiang Xin

Residing in the Northwest for three years cannot be considered a short time; but perhaps due to being accustomed to hearing, seeing, and living there, I have become somewhat unclear whether I am residing in a room filled with orchids or a market selling salted fish.  Initially, I couldn't help but feel surprised, but after a long time, yesterday was like this, today is like this, and tomorrow will probably be like this.  Since the facts are like this, what is there to be surprised about? Furthermore, seeing that everyone residing in this region seemed to be indifferent, if I alone felt strange and odd, wouldn't that be even stranger? Therefore, not long after I first arrived in the Northwest, I thought of writing about my experiences and feelings to report to the people of the country, but due to being busy and lazy, I didn't get around to writing. Later, I felt that since reality was already like this, what was there to say? Even if I spoke, it might not attract the attention of others.

Border Warning

It has only been three months since I left the Northwest in early March, which cannot be considered a long time, but I truly feel like "three autumns have passed." Everything in the Northwest seems strange to me. The Xinjiang warning has alarmed the whole country, and I cannot help but be alarmed as well, eagerly wanting to share my past experiences with the people of the country! However, because I was ordered to leave the country in a hurry, I was unable to bring all the materials I had collected in the past. Now, I can only talk casually based on my memory.

Anyone living in the Northwest is very familiar with the phrase "border disputes." What is unique is that in the past, everyone was limited to enthusiastic oral communication or could see a little in the local newspapers in the Northwest. This time is the "first" time it has been formally telegraphed by the Central News Agency and spread throughout the country. Important events, such as the so-called "Yining Incident" that disturbed the entire Northwest the year before last, only sparingly revealed their "pretty faces" twice when the "peace agreement" was about to be signed. The truly tense scenes of artillery fire and bloodshed were deleted by the red pens of diplomats. I remember that at that time, when we were touring Dunhuang, we made a detour to visit the oil mine in Yumen, Gansu. The oil mine had a branch mine in Wusu, Xinjiang. During the emergency, the Wusu branch mine sent an urgent telegram every hour, asking the head office to quickly send vehicles to pick up the employees for evacuation. At that time, only one battalion of the National Army and hundreds of miners were guarding the oil mine, while the enemy had two regiments with several cannons. Although the head office immediately dispatched more than a dozen Mack trucks to pick them up, it was estimated that the trucks would not reach Hami in time, and the Wusu mine would have already fallen. Later, an official in charge of the Wusu mine told me that when we evacuated, we automatically blocked and destroyed the mine shafts, lost all the machinery, and suffered many casualties among the employees. From the reflection of the oil mine bureau alone, one can infer the overall scale of the war at that time. However, from beginning to end, except for waiting for a peaceful resolution, there was not a single word of news in the newspapers. Furthermore, an officer who participated in the war personally told me that every time they fought, the ones charging in the front line were our own compatriots, while the officers supervising the battle and the artillery shooters were all genuine "X-country people." Especially when attacking large cities, it was all the same! However, at that time, even the words "certain country" could not be seen in the newspapers, as if those two words were only used in the "Northeast region" and could not be used in the "Northwest region." Now, they suddenly shout out that "there are planes with Soviet markings assisting in the battle, which is truly unprecedented."

Even more so, the great tragedy in January of this year. According to the provisions of the Yining Incident peace agreement, Han compatriots could originally return to live in the Yining, Tacheng, and other regions. However, on a certain day in January, when hundreds of Han compatriots returned to the Tacheng area on the Russian border, it happened to be dusk. Because they had no homes to return to, they had to sleep in the open. As a result, they heard a burst of intense gunfire at night. The next morning, they saw that most of the refugees, except for a few who pretended to be dead and then escaped, were lying there permanently. This incident was never reported in the newspapers either; only the suffering compatriots used mimeographed leaflets to distribute appeals everywhere, but the result was like a faint cry for help in the vast ocean, which would not receive any response!

We are truly surprised! These kinds of border disputes have indeed occurred "repeatedly" in the past, but why hasn't the government publicized them to the people of the country at any time, but has been suppressing them until now? Is it really trying to give the people of the country a "sudden" shock? The main reason is probably: in the past year, in order to safeguard friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, our government has been tolerant and silent about various facts of the Soviet Union violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty, such as preventing our country from taking over Lushun and Dalian, supporting the Northeast Communist Army and the Korean Communist Army in combat, and instigating Outer Mongolia to invade our border, causing the Beitashan Incident, etc. Judging from today's situation, it is no longer possible to sit idly by. It is reported that our government has decided to no longer adopt the appeasement policy of the past, but to adopt a tough diplomatic approach and accuse all the facts to the world!

Leaving the Country from Tacheng

An air force friend who has been stationed in Xinjiang for a long time told me the following facts:

"Just taking the Tacheng 'zone' as an example, the border line between China and the Soviet Union was originally very far north of Tacheng, but in less than a few years, the border markers have now run to the foot of the city of Tacheng. The city of Tacheng is on a small hill, and the foot of the hill north of the city has become Russian territory. The reason is that others can carry the border markers and run around at will, killing at will, and no one cares about us. If this phenomenon continues to develop, Tacheng will truly have to leave the country without a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.…"

He also said: "We have no troops stationed on the border, let alone any defense measures. On the contrary, others are not like this. Along the border, there are bunkers everywhere, and troops are stationed to guard them. Furthermore, the trains in the country can go all the way to places not far from the border, which is extremely convenient for transportation! If any Chinese people walk within ten miles of the border, they are in danger of being shot, because the troops stationed in the neighboring country often like to use this opportunity for target practice.…"

Barbarian Cavalry Grazing Horses

I climbed the Mazongling on the border line, visited the ancient battlefield where Li Hua once sang sadly, and crossed Mazongling, which is not far from Outer Yehugu. According to the local people, groups of barbarian cavalry (in the past, they were compatriots, but now we can say this) often come to the south of the mountain to graze horses. If travelers are encountered by them, they will be robbed clean, and even their lives may not be spared!

In short, with such a border and such a national defense, it is no wonder that once a border warning is discovered, it is already 600 miles deep into the country.

For many years, Xinjiang has been a place of many troubles. Those who discuss the reasons for this believe that it is due to the excessive complexity of the ethnic groups. However, according to my actual observations in the Northwest for several years, I do not want to agree with this statement. I believe that ethnic complexity and the lack of unified language are only conditions that may constitute social disorder, but not its inevitable causes. Because in fact, there are countries with more complex ethnic groups and more diverse languages than Xinjiang, but they can still achieve stability. Just like the neighboring provinces of Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu, the ethnic groups are not simple and the languages are also different, but the disputes are not as many as in Xinjiang. We live in the Northwest and can say that we are in contact with compatriots with different clothes, customs, and habits at all times, but everyone can get along with each other equally, and no disputes often occur between the ethnic groups. On the contrary, even in the most simple Han ethnic group, a cruel civil war has been going on since the Republic of China, and now it is even more out of control. Therefore, ethnic complexity is only a condition that may cause chaos. Only when someone wants to use it and provoke it can it show the facts of chaos. The internal situation in Xinjiang is exactly like this. Unfortunately, in the past, a tragic history was created due to mistakes. Now, there are ambitious politicians internally and special forces externally who want to use it, which makes it impossible for Xinjiang to achieve stability. Most people who are familiar with the internal situation in Xinjiang know that the people of all ethnic groups hope to have a relatively stable life and do not want to make a career out of killing each other. Even those who have been trained by a certain party have now become aware that a certain party only wants to use them and does not really want to make them free and happy. However, until today, we can still cooperate with the majority of the people's desire for stability, win them over, and make it impossible for internal and external schemers to sell their schemes.

Agriculture and Minerals

We do not want to discuss the intentions of the internal schemers who deliberately want to create unrest in Xinjiang. However, we should study the intentions of the external forces. According to my observations, economic factors and political factors are very important. In the past, the disturbances created in Xinjiang would not directly help the Yan'an headquarters much. Now, it is not necessarily to cooperate with the military actions in the Northeast. Even if it now has the effect of killing two birds with one stone, it cannot be explained. The main thing is still in the economic aspect.

After the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship," we see today that the troops of Outer Mongolia have invaded. This is indeed an obvious plot, but at the time of the signing of the treaty, China also had a fleeting benefit, which was to make the situation in Xinjiang temporarily clear. The Soviet troops withdrew from Hami, Dihua, Wusu, and other places in Xinjiang, and the business institutions were also taken over by China. Especially the Wusu oil mine, according to a person in charge, the Soviet troops filled the mine shafts and moved the machines away before leaving. It was originally believed that China would not be able to repair it in three to five years, but we quickly made it able to produce oil again. The Wusu oil mine is not very large in scale, but the oil quality is higher than that of Yumen. According to experts, the Wusu mine and the Caucasus oil field are the same oil source. If China massively exploits it in Wusu (the original plan was to carry out large-scale mining and refining), it will directly affect the Caucasus. This is like two children eating the same mother's milk, which is inevitable to be jealous of each other. As a result of jealousy, the stronger brother naturally wants to push the younger brother away. Therefore, from an economic standpoint, it cannot be said that there is no part of the reason for explaining the last Yining Incident with the agricultural products of the Ili River Basin (the entire Xinjiang's demand for food relies on this region) and the oil mines of Wusu. At least because of this change, the main essence of Xinjiang has been completely lost. Furthermore, Xinjiang has a lot of coal reserves, and the quality is good. This has already been proven. In addition, in the past, it was also rumored that Xinjiang produces a lot of tungsten, which is a rare metal and indispensable for steelmaking. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, China sold it all to the United States, while the neighboring country could not get it, so it often felt dissatisfied. In the past year or so, after the atomic bomb was born, everyone has been rumored that Xinjiang has reserves of uranium raw materials, which are indispensable for making atomic bombs. The mine has been discovered by the neighboring country and is said to be near the Altai Mountains. I am not a mining expert, so I do not dare to say whether the rumors are true or not, but these vivid rumors are often heard. Regarding this, the neighboring country initially asked to mine it alone, but China did not allow it. Then it asked to jointly operate it, but was rejected again. Therefore, it is also difficult to make it satisfied. According to the above two unpleasant mentalities, we can see that there may be some clues to the relationship between this invasion of Outer Mongolia.

Raise Vigilance

With an Outer Mongolia with a population of only 900,000, if there is no external support, it will not be enough to realize the dream of using force to conquer people. However, even if a temporary compromise can be reached diplomatically, the problem is still not truly solved. Maybe there will be a second or third Beitashan Incident coming, making the border disputes that are already constantly spreading even more! To solve this problem, we must start from the inside. Because if the internal stability can be achieved, it is equivalent to blocking the doors and windows of external forces and cutting off the wings of internal schemers, so that they will never have the opportunity to display their magic.

The most important task for those in charge of Xinjiang now is how to compensate for the historical debts and take back the lost people's hearts. This work seems difficult, but it is not difficult in practice! Because the instability in the past allowed all kinds of monsters to take advantage of the opportunity. It is undeniable that Xinjiang has now become a paradise for schemers and adventurers. If this phenomenon is not cleared up as soon as possible, the future will be unimaginable. Stability, stability, only stability is a good medicine to save Xinjiang.

After the Beitashan Incident, many people advocated "raising vigilance" and "watching the changes." I think it is very right. Xinjiang is indeed a troublesome area in our country, and it is important. We should not ignore it. Unfortunately, it seems that it has not yet aroused the general attention of the people of the country. Xinjiang is our door, which is related to the safety of our entire national destiny. We must guard it firmly. But in the current attitude, we must not be too hasty. Problems that can be reasonably solved should be resolved through reason. Finally, I hope that the people of the country will not regard Xinjiang as a barren area in the Northwest. It is not only important in its location, but also has abundant agricultural products and rich mineral deposits. Especially the petroleum, according to the report after the expert survey, almost the entire Northwest has storage. All of this is closely related to our future nation-building. I remember when I was in Jiuquan, Gansu, I heard a song from a Kazakh girl, which gave me a very deep impression. Now I transcribe a paragraph below as the end of this article, in order to arouse the attention of the people of the country:

"The grapes of Turpan, the melons of Hami!

The furs of Yanqi and Kuqa are endless!…"

### The Isolated City of Anyang, Rescued from Battle

— Air Report from Zhengzhou on the 20th, Our Reporter Fan Shiqin

Zhengzhou Station sees a lot of comings and goings every day, but these days, people from all walks of life are welcoming the wounded soldiers and young students evacuated from Anyang, which is the most sincere. Just from the fact that elementary school students are using some of their candy money to comfort those soldiers and young people, you will know that being unreasonably coerced by one kind of person must be compensated by double the comfort from another kind of person. Those wounded soldiers and young students, who have priority, are transported by plane to Xinxiang, and then transferred to Zhengzhou by car. The students are transported back and forth through a lottery system, which can be said to be very fair.

When Anyang was in danger and the planes had not yet dropped food, the livelihood of the 500,000 people inside and outside Anyang City was the most worrying thing for everyone. It is said that at that time, most of the refugees were filling their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark, and the students were eating the worst mixed grains and horse feed. All life was entrusted to brave battles, and brave battles were entrusted to full stomachs. Originally, precious food naturally became even more precious. Every time the National Army attacked, thousands of refugees followed behind them. When the National Army returned victorious, thousands of refugees followed behind them. When the refugees went, each of them carried an empty bag. When they returned, each of them carried a full bag. At first, the National Army persuaded the refugees to grab food, and later the refugees persuaded the National Army to attack. It is really unclear whether it was attacking to grab food or grabbing food to attack. At that time, the authorities in the city asked the people to store two months' worth of food. The wealthy families and businesses had to use most of their money to buy food. Where to buy food in this besieged isolated city? But in fact, there was a market for buying and selling food. The formation of this market was a

War Miracle. Every day, people who wanted to buy food in the city ran to a quiet open space outside the city. There, many people selling food were waiting for them. After they finished trading, the people who came out of the city to buy food returned to the city, and the people selling food disappeared. This happened every day. According to the statistics of the students who guarded the city gate, more than 2,000 dan of grain were brought into the city every day. This quiet open space outside the city seemed to have magic power, and it had never been hit by a single bullet. The people who came and went to sell food in this market every day were quite like the incarnation of the gods in magical novels, who came to save those suffering people. In fact, they were also like those suffering people. They were a kind of villagers from the four villages who had surplus grain and stole away through the

fire line to exchange for the surplus salt of the people in the city. The people were saving themselves in this situation, which is really great. But in the meantime, we cannot deny that there is some divine power helping them. It is said that this year's harvest in the four villages of Anyang is the most prosperous that has never been seen in the past.

According to them, during the siege of Anyang, except for the curfew from 8:00 pm or short-term curfews at any time during the day, everything was the same as usual. Rickshaw drivers were still pulling cars, and there was still meat and fish in the restaurants. The prices of general things, of course, fell, and of course, food was particularly expensive, once costing 30,000 yuan per catty.

Li Zhenqing, the division commander of the 40th Division who guarded Dongyang City, was seen by the common people and soldiers every day. The only difference was in the time difference, that is, he appeared in front of the common people when there was no battle, and he appeared in front of the soldiers when there was a battle. His troops had

iron discipline. A soldier was shot and killed by him for robbing someone of more than 30,000 yuan. This is how one thing happened. The students helped him prevent bad people from mixing into the city. At night, the students climbed on the roofs to guard. After discovering that someone hung a signal gun on a tree and pulled it with a rope at the bottom of the tree, the city became even quieter.

A section of the railway outside the city was always controlled by the National Army. Two armored vehicles patrolled back and forth. The common people said that these were two lions guarding the gate.

It is said that Liu Bocheng still wanted to attack Dongyang, but this time I have not heard that he prepared to take Dongyang in three weeks. Perhaps he was prepared to lose all his "capital" in Dongyang!

### On Guangdong Series

— Lu Danlin

Published by the Guangdong Series Editorial and Printing Committee, Printed by The Commercial Press

The Guangdong Series is one of the greatest classics published in our country after the Anti-Japanese War. It is the first collection compiled and printed by the Guangdong Series Editorial and Printing Committee. This committee was established in Hong Kong in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), with funding mostly provided by the government of Guangdong Province. It was a semi-public, semi-private organization. The standing committee members were Ye Gongchuo (also serving as the chairman), Jian Youwen, and Lu Danlin. The committee also included thirteen members such as Xu Dishan, Xu Xinfu, Huang Huabiao, Huang Yinpu, and Chen Lesu, as well as fifty-three advisors including Xu Chongqing, Li Hanhun, Jiang Fucong, Chen Yuan, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Yuanji, Li Yinglin, and Yuan Tongli. The guidelines for compilation and printing were based on Guangdong-related literature, with a focus on collecting works by Guangdong natives. (Works by living authors were not included, except for edited versions of old works.) The selected editions were all rare and hard to find, and when less ideal editions were chosen, there were specific reasons for doing so. For example, the Qujiang Collection was used this time because it was the detailed annotation copy of Wen Rushi.

The list of books for the first collection was finalized in the winter of the 29th year (1940). After detailed proofreading, publication was discussed with The Commercial Press. It was originally scheduled to be fully published in the winter of the 30th year (1941). Unexpectedly, after a portion of the books had been printed, the Japanese invaders launched the Pacific War. Consequently, some of the printed books that had been transported to Hong Kong were lost. The manuscripts that were in Shanghai and being worked on could not be continued due to labor and material shortages. After the victory, the two parties negotiated several times, selected workers, and added materials. It took about a year to completely publish the entire series. In total, it took seven years from the initial submission of manuscripts to the final completion. During the Anti-Japanese War, countless public and private cultural relics were lost. The fact that this series was finally published unscathed after so many twists and turns can only be described as a joyous event for the publishing industry.

The first collection of the Guangdong Series consists of seven books, bound in twenty-eight volumes. The entire series is exquisitely printed on high-quality Lian Shi paper, bound in thread. About seventy to eighty percent of the books are reproduced from the original editions, while twenty to thirty percent are typeset. Each book, except for those with previous annotations, has been carefully proofread. If there were any doubts, various editions were collated to ensure perfection before printing. A brief description of the content of each book is provided below:

(1) The Collected Works of Zhang Qujiang, written by Zhang Jiuling of the Tang Dynasty. This twelve-volume, eight-book edition with annotations by Wen Rushi is stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family in Panyu. It includes Wen Rushi's original carved edition of the textual research of Qujiang Collection in two volumes, and a chronicle in one volume, stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. Zhang Qujiang is the oldest literary figure in Lingnan. There are eight known carved editions of the Qujiang Collection. The one used here is Wen Rushi's annotated edition, which is the result of over twenty years of in-depth research and can be said to be the most valuable Zhang Qujiang edition in the country.

(2) The Beauty of Wuxi, written by Yu Jing of the Song Dynasty. This twenty-volume, six-book edition is a Ming Chenghua carved edition stored in the Tieqin Tongjian Lou Library of the Qu family in Changshu. It includes Yu Xiangong's memorial to the throne in two volumes, and Huang Foyi's compilation of missing works from the Wuxi Collection in one volume. Yu Jing and Zhang Qujiang were both outstanding figures from Shaozhou during the Tang and Song dynasties. Yu Jing's talent lay in adaptability, and his writing style reflected this, defying categorization. Qiu Jun's preface to the Chenghua edition places him alongside Zhang Qujiang, and there is a reason for this.

(3) The Collection of Beiyan Cliff, written by Huang Gongfu of the Ming Dynasty. This four-volume, two-book edition is the original carved edition stored in the Qiubo Qin Guan Library of the Li family in Zhongshan and the Yijiangnan Guan Library of the Huang family in Panyu. During the Wei Zhongxian era, Huang Gongfu impeached Wei Zhongxian, earning him a reputation for righteousness throughout the country. He loved his ruler and was loyal to his country. He self-immolated at the age of eighty-four, leaving behind a legacy that will last for millennia. His poetry and prose have their own unique style.

(4) Drafts Preserved in the Ministry of Rites, written by Chen Zizhuang of the Ming Dynasty. This eight-volume, three-book edition is the original carved edition stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. Chen Zizhuang sacrificed himself for his country with unwavering loyalty, and his opposition to foreign invasion makes him a beacon of national glory. This book mainly contains routine drafts, such as caring for the crown prince and assisting the royal family. His commitment to the major principles of the court can be seen between the lines. The proposals he put forward are all essential and feasible, demonstrating his ambitions. Chen Zizhuang's posthumous collections, such as the Nangong Yuncong Collections, are no longer available, and the Lianyaotang Collection is also incomplete. Only this collection is complete, making it even more precious.

(5) Literary Manuscripts of the Lotus Beard Pavilion, written by Li Suiqiu of the Ming Dynasty. This eighteen-volume, three-book edition is an old manuscript stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. It is a collection of poetry and prose by Li Meishu, a talented Lingnan scholar and Zhuangyuan (top scholar) known as the Peony Zhuangyuan. This book has never been published and is a treasured hand-copied manuscript. Pan Lai commented on his collection: "Reading his writing is like looking at exquisite workmanship with an ingenious mind, carving the moon and tailoring the clouds... He was willing to sacrifice his life for his country and achieve benevolence through righteousness! He fearlessly pointed at traitors and angrily gnawed at the tyrants of Suiyang..." This gives a general idea of its value.

(6) The Yuyuan Collection, written by Liang Chaozhong of the Ming Dynasty. This four-volume, three-book edition is the original carved edition stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. Liang Chaozhong sacrificed himself in resisting the Qing army, showing unwavering integrity and deserving praise. His writing is highly regarded by the world. The Yuyuan Collection was destroyed by the Qing government during the Qianlong era, making this a unique copy in the country. The righteousness of Yushan remains forever, and the national spirit has an indelible existence.

(7) Literary Manuscripts of Wengshan, written by Qu Dajun of the Ming Dynasty. This four-volume, three-book edition is an early Qing carved edition stored in the Yijiangnan Guan Library of the Huang family, with Xu Xinfu's compilation of Wengshan's literary selections in three volumes. Qu Dajun's lifelong immortal work, though belonging to the Record of Righteousness under the Four Dynasties, is being organized and proofread. The four volumes of literary manuscripts are divided into prefaces, records, inscriptions, epitaphs, biographies, etc. Wang Shizhen praised Qu Dajun's poems as Li Bai himself said: "Coughs and saliva fall from the nine heavens, generating pearls and jade with the wind." His prose is learned and eloquent, possessing an unstoppable force. This collection is the most abundant.

Due to the war, a portion of the entire series was lost. Only two hundred copies could be fully assembled. Each book is composed of unique copies, first editions, meticulously proofread editions, and secret manuscripts. It is not only a great classic in the publishing industry after the war, but it also has a special position and contribution in Chinese literature. It is not only related to the local culture of Lingnan, but also promotes the national spirit. Most of these books have been shipped to Guangdong for sale. Soon, they will also be publicly sold in Shanghai. The list of books for the second collection is currently being selected and discussed, and it will be decided and sent to print soon.

### Principles and Applications of Radio

— Nianhong

Written by H.Q. Sun, translated by Ding Xi, published by Kaiming Bookstore, 12,000 yuan

Translations of radio books often err on the side of being too specialized and obscure, failing to meet the needs of ordinary amateur enthusiasts. Moreover, those proficient in radio are not necessarily proficient in foreign languages, especially the latter. Generally, radio scholars tend to have less comprehensive cultivation. Introducing and translating renowned foreign scientific works into the local language is no easy task. Therefore, many translations, while based on masterpieces that were popular abroad, read awkwardly and are difficult to digest in Chinese. Furthermore, the lack of unified terminology and the vast differences between domestic and foreign situations mean that many things considered ordinary in countries with advanced radio industries become difficult to even find parts for when brought to China. This situation is extremely common. Besides, translating a book requires considerable effort, which is even more difficult in the current environment. Due to these various factors, it is difficult to find a suitable book on the market.

In addition to its appropriate and substantial content, this book is particularly valuable for its fluent translation, making it almost indistinguishable from an original work. From beginning to end, it flows seamlessly, demonstrating considerable effort. The translator has added personal opinions and annotations regarding aspects that are incompatible with China's national conditions, supplemented the shortcomings of the original work by referencing the state of China's radio market, and included photographs and features of many excellent domestic products, preventing readers from feeling lost and disconnected from the outside world.

The book consists of twelve chapters. The first chapter briefly describes several of the most basic electrical principles, making the book accessible to friends with a special interest in radio who have not received higher education and can use it as a beginner's reader to enter the circle. The last section briefly describes relatively new radio knowledge (not in a deep and didactic theoretical style). Using simple language and based on the level of knowledge readers have after completing the book, it explains "television," "telephonic sound movies," and "telephotography," enabling readers to understand the basic concepts of these new things, thereby stimulating their curiosity about radio and dispelling the negative perception that radio is a difficult and unattainable science. The book balances theory and practice, though it seems to lean slightly towards the former. In the later chapters, when discussing applications, it often interweaves deeper principles, which is a strength of the book. It progresses from simple to profound, rather than being a flat exposition, preventing readers from simply copying experiments by following circuit diagrams and parts lists, and instead enabling them to design and apply things themselves, creatively inspiring their intelligence. The chapter on vacuum tubes also includes the characteristics, curve diagrams, and base diagrams of various commonly used vacuum tubes of each model, providing readers with a reference during installation and facilitating their work considerably. The chapter on new-style multi-tube radios provides detailed explanations of the detection stage, low-frequency amplification stage, high-frequency amplification stage, and output stage, and teaches readers how to connect, match, and design these stages. This is far superior to ordinary editions that simply collect a few circuit diagrams.

Radio is a rapidly evolving field. This book is based on the original author's revised and reprinted edition from 1933, which is already fourteen years old. During this period, radio technology has advanced rapidly, to say the least. Due to the book's popularity, the original author must have naturally added new material to each edition to keep up with the times. However, although the Chinese translation of this book has already sold around ten editions, its content and writing style remain unchanged. The translator and publisher should pay attention to this. Although China's radio industry is lagging behind and the latest foreign innovations may not be entirely suitable for our needs, we must strive to improve as much as possible to avoid falling too far behind!

### People's Weekly (Edited by Gu Jiegang)

— Meng Kun

In the currently sluggish publishing industry, the emphasis is disproportionately on magazines. However, regardless of the periodical, they are all aimed at intellectuals or small-town residents. Even the latter often only provide entertainment. The "People's Weekly" is aimed at readers among the lower and middle classes with limited literacy. We feel this is very necessary and should be recommended and encouraged.

Four issues of "People's Weekly" have been published to date. These four issues clearly demonstrate its overall style and direction. It introduces very simple current events, very popular common knowledge, and includes many learning-oriented articles, with a particular emphasis on reading and writing skills. Every article is so simple in form, even adopting ballad formats where possible. The content is also easy to understand and accept. Most importantly, every article is related to the lives of the masses.

At a time when popular education is stagnant and there is a lack of popular reading materials, the publication of such a magazine deserves attention. We should appreciate Mr. Gu Jiegang's efforts and the publisher's good intentions.

However, in our criticism, we should also offer some hopes, hoping that it can get even closer to the masses and become a truly universal primer. The authors should ideally have a preliminary plan, defining a certain number of essential vocabulary words as a long-term standard for national literacy. There should be more pictures to introduce the surrounding environment, or to use picture-based literacy methods to enable common people with little time to learn more words and expand their reading abilities. If printing technology permits, the National Phonetic Alphabet should be added next to each character.

Most importantly, the publishing industry should follow suit and produce similar publications.

### World Political Reference Map

— Xin Jun

Edited by Jin Zhonghua, illustrated by Zhu Yu, printed and distributed by World Knowledge Society

For anyone who studies or enjoys international current affairs, having an accurate political reference map is essential, because it can strengthen our deeper understanding of international current events.

The international situation after World War II is obviously very different from before. After several years of brutal warfare, the world has changed. It has resulted in the confrontation between the two major camps of capitalism and socialism, and at the same time, the contradictions within capitalism have intensified. Under this new world situation, old maps always feel somewhat disconnected.

In the publishing industry, there are many books on international politics, but few reference maps on international politics. Currently, it can be said that there are almost none. Now, the World Knowledge Society has published this "World Political Reference Map," which can be said to be good news for anyone who pays attention to international issues.

This is a relatively complete and systematic international political map, compiled and produced from the collection of post-World War II international political activities. It is detailed and accurate.

It includes a total of sixty-one maps, divided into six parts:

The first part: is the post-war world situation, with eight maps: (1) Post-War World Situation Map, (2) The Full Picture of the United Nations, (3) United Nations Trusteeship Territories Map, (4) History of Atomic Bomb Development Map, (5) The Situation Around the Arctic Under the Confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, (6) The Situation of the Antarctic Continent Under the Competition of Various Countries, (7) The Route Map of the Byrd Expedition to Antarctica, (8) World Oil Zone Distribution Map.

These maps show the post-war world situation in detail, and each map is accompanied by a brief explanation. This proves that every map has one.

The second part is the part on the five major powers. It draws out the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, China, and France in the post-war world, with a total of twelve maps explaining each sector of the five major powers in full detail.

The third part is the European part, which includes more countries: Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Spain, and so on. It divides into twenty-two explanations and maps to draw out the characteristics and prospects of these countries.

The fourth part is the Middle East part, which uses nine maps to show the various aspects of this region, such as international struggle, oil problems, and other items.

The fifth part is the Far East part, which includes Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, and parts of India.

The sixth part is the Americas part, which is relatively simple, including Argentina, Alaska, and Canada.

Looking at these contents, their richness and brilliance are obvious at a glance.

Finally, I must think of the editor and illustrator of this map. The editor, Mr. Jin Zhonghua, works for the United States Information Service. Everyone knows about his international research. The explanations in these maps were all written by Mr. Jin.

The illustrator, Mr. Zhu Yu, is a young illustrator, and his achievements can be summed up in facts.

The only shortcomings of this map are the lack of zoning colors and the poor quality of the paper, which are probably limited by publishing conditions, and there is no way to avoid it.

### "Street Literary Talk"

— Jia

Written by Xu Maoyong, printed by Guangming Bookstore

The book "Street Literary Talk" contains twenty-eight short essays. According to their content, they can be roughly divided into three parts: creative preparation, popular literature, and miscellaneous thoughts.

At the beginning of the book, the author advises every literary worker to pay attention to their own preparation before writing: First, they must train their ability to observe and constantly educate themselves in the face of reality, cultivating a correct outlook on life and the world. When observing, their minds must be calm. The main condition for Gorky's success was "seeing a lot." He noted before his short story "Autumn Night": "This is a record of someone who has seen a lot." Second, the reason why works of art are moving is because they contain powerful emotions. Therefore, a literary worker must have the ability to sense everything. Emotion is not "sentimentality." Sentimentality is just a kind of weak emotion that is harmful to life, and it has no value. Writing must start from society in order to actively promote the development of life. Writers must cultivate powerful emotions, and they must experience pure and great emotions from the work of the masses. Third, in terms of descriptive ability, one must grasp the most characteristic image of things, arrange them, and then express them correctly. This is the basic condition for description. Observation, feeling, and description cannot transcend reality. Oscar Wilde's aestheticism, because it was divorced from life, was eventually destroyed in the fire of reality. He replaced "art for art" with "art for life," simply because he later saw a deeper and more real life in prison. He praised Dostoevsky's works as great because they contained the element of "sympathy." Literary writers are not only writing for a few people. The scope of their consciousness should transcend their own class and feel the thoughts and emotions of other classes. Only in this way can they gain a wide readership, and their works can be highly evaluated. For whom are today's writers writing? Jean-Richard Bloch said: "I only see two desirable attitudes: 'Either leave the world and devote oneself entirely to the inner struggle, regarding the conflict of the self as the most intense and arduous, but resolute struggle; or welcome a society around him, a society that is transforming, re-planning, fighting heroically, full of vigor, burning with passion, and moving forward beyond itself. It needs poets who are in step with it and who鼓鼓 its rhythm forward.'"

Those engaged in popular literature must seek themes from the lives of the masses, approach them, and understand their living conditions and level of knowledge. Then, they must write in "understandable words." "Clarity, simplicity, and conciseness" are the essence that Tolstoy extracted from popular language. Gorky's works are welcomed by the masses of all countries because his style is clear and simple, and his content expresses the suffering and joy, creation and struggle of the oppressed. "Art for life" must have compassion. Popular literature is not simply about depicting workers or farmers, pitying them from the perspective of an outsider. Nor is it simply about speaking in the tone of the masses, recounting the harshness of living conditions, complaining endlessly, and hanging one's head in despair, as if that is enough to be a popular literary scholar. If he cannot express a positive attitude towards reality, does not have the steel-like strength of labor and will for life, lacks enthusiasm for building a new life, and lacks the power to destroy the bad heritage of old traditions, he is still a failure. Popular literature hopes to truly change the world.

The book ends with a few short essays on "Literary Miscellany," talking about aesthetics, humor, scientific essays, rural literature, etc. Although there is a lack of unity in the arrangement, they are still works that have been put together with much effort. In particular, when the author frankly stated that he had given up the idea of becoming a writer, it was full of sincerity and a sense of desolation. He said: "My failure was originally due to the emptiness of life. People whose own lives are empty will not deeply recognize the fulfilled lives of others, and of course it will be even more difficult to express them deeply... After this realization, I became even more alienated from literature." These words, when seen by aspiring literary beginners, cannot help but feel a little "heroic spirit shortened." But isn't it also a powerful warning, encouraging us how urgently we need to enrich our own lives!

The book's writing style is simple and clear. When explaining the essentials, it often cites famous works by various writers for explanation, so it is quite easy to read. It is a pity that a bibliography is not attached behind each book, and at the same time, when quoting the words of others in several places, it is not explained in detail, which may not be very appropriate.

### Random Talks on Independence

— Wang Cong

I happened to see a sentence in a small book, meaning: "Thoughts are like nuns, they must cover their faces when they go out."

From this, I thought of the Buddhist explanation of the human mind as a mirror, with all worldly fame and wealth accumulating on the mind's mirror like ashes. Over time, this precious mirror loses its ability to illuminate.

In today's decline, the狂desires of matter have the appearance of sweeping across the souls of the world. Many bright heart mirrors are buried in the mud of matter and flesh.

True value is being denied. (I will never believe that truth will die, this is just a dark cloud temporarily obscuring the sun.)

Why should thoughts dress up as a nun, and cover their faces?

Someone said:

"Love is like a warm cough, you can't hold it in forever; let it double in your throat." Naturally, this is a clever metaphor. Because even the smartest person cannot hide his love.

I have the same view on thoughts.

Because they are often born of existing social oppression. Even if we cover them with a veil, we cannot stop them from going out.

A philosopher said:

"The books that record my thoughts are like a mirror. If a donkey looks at it, it will never see an unparalleled beauty."

Although this is an overly pretentious statement, it is not without truth.

There is a saying in ancient Chinese books that there are different views on wisdom and benevolence.

Differences in perspective often make people doubt the truth. Sages often suffer from hardship, perhaps for this reason.

### Purging Japanese Cultural War Criminals

— Bao Qing

Under the urging of the Allied occupation authorities, the Japanese government's purge efforts began at the start of the year, targeting problematic figures in the news industry (such as newspaper editors-in-chief, managers, leading writers, and news editors). Those who played a prominent role in propaganda have also been banned from holding official positions, with restrictions extended to their immediate family members.

Like other Allied control measures in Japan, the purge is proceeding slowly. The Japanese Central Purge Committee has only recently finalized specific plans for purging war criminals in the media, which will be announced soon. The targets of the purge include organizations involved in newspapers, news agencies, film and theater, and broadcasting associations, for producing and supporting war rhetoric between July 7th and the surrender.

In the past, Japan's efforts to purge these problematic figures were not thorough, allowing many war criminals to escape punishment. Some members of the Purge Committee themselves are suspected of being problematic figures, using the excuse that the Allied headquarters had not specified a deadline for the purge and that the wartime activities of various problematic figures could not be investigated clearly in a short time, repeatedly delaying the process and using the purge to attack their political enemies.

Now that the purge of war criminals in the media has begun, those mouthpieces who spread militarist ideas must, of course, be purged. As for those lackeys who waved the flag and cheered in the literary world, such as Kan Kikuchi, Ki Kimura, and Bumbō Niwa, who flattered the military during the war and now sing the praises of democracy, they should be exposed and identified by progressive cultural circles so that readers can recognize the truth. As part of the purge of cultural war criminals, an investigation into the wartime military propaganda activities of journalists is about to begin, and the possibility of current Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida being purged has already been widely rumored outside of the Three Islands.

Hitoshi Ashida is the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan. The formation of the Katayama three-party coalition cabinet relied entirely on the coordination of the Democratic Party, and Ashida's assistance was significant. Therefore, his political enemies want to use the purge to settle scores with him and attempt to disintegrate the Katayama cabinet. In particular, Ashida recently made statements demanding the recovery of the Kuril Islands and Okinawa, making his purge even more likely. From 1933 to 1940, he served as president and leading writer of the English-language *Japan Times* as an international affairs expert, expounding his high theories during the period of aggression against our country, even earning the title of "critic who kills with a single phrase." Now, holding the high position of Foreign Minister, he speaks out demanding the recovery of Okinawa and other places, hoping the Allies will reduce reparations, and even hoping for a loan from the United States.

As we hope that Japan will move towards democratization today, we must also hope that when Japan purges cultural war criminals, it will conduct a fair investigation, not only targeting individuals and local institutions, but also conducting a thorough investigation of the entire cultural system and purging it, in order to truly achieve the work of cultural rectification.

### Sable and Lynx Fur

— Ji Ming

Our country claims to be a "land of etiquette," so the dress codes of past dynasties were strictly regulated, with the color and quality of clothing corresponding to official rank. Except for musicians and performers, no one was allowed to overstep the bounds. The Qing Dynasty, with its Manchu rulers, had even more unique regulations. Emperor Shengzu decreed that officials of the second rank and above in the Censorate could wear sable and lynx fur to court in winter, while those below the second rank could choose fox or sheepskin. After the Yongzheng and Qianlong eras, the ancestral system gradually fell into disuse, and even members of the Hanlin Academy and censors began to presumptuously wear sable and lynx fur. At that time, Ren Kuizun, known for his uprightness, served as Deputy Censor-in-Chief and petitioned for the restoration of the old system. The Emperor agreed. Beijing was cold, and the officials who had initially made sable fur waited outside the hall, shivering. Therefore, they cursed Ren Kuizun. A busybody wrote a poem: "Hanlin Academy and the Censorate, stripped of sable and lynx fur. Last night, the fifth watch was bone-chilling, who in the court does not resent Ren Kuizun?" In my opinion, the strict regulations on clothing should not be adopted today, but the complete absence of a system is also prone to chaos. When we watch Beijing opera, we know the identity of each character from their clothes. Nowadays, in the streets and alleys, all kinds of strange clothes appear. Poor university professors dress like grooms, while entertainers and servants dress like high officials. Is this not going too far? (Anecdotes from the Qing Dynasty, Part 3)

### China New Journalism College Social Gathering

— Bai Shui

Under the pouring rain, the China New Journalism College held a social gathering, the first of its kind since its establishment, finally taking place at Yiyuan at 2 PM on the 21st. Participants, including students, alumni, reporters, and guests, numbered no fewer than 300. Despite the adverse effects of the uncooperative weather, participants still gathered in large numbers, truly creating a new record for social gatherings in Shanghai's news industry.

In front of Yiyuan, traffic was heavy and the scene was unprecedented. Guests braved the rain to attend, which was truly unexpected. No wonder the chairman of the gathering, Bu Youfu, and the college president, Chen Gaoyong, were always smiling, greeting every guest. In fact, President Chen was also one of the guests (because the gathering was organized by the students), but he still displayed the straightforward style typical of northerners, helping the chairman to receive guests, thus making everyone feel an unexpected warmth and encouragement, adding another lively atmosphere to the venue.

The venue was already crowded enough, and the gazes of more than 600 eyes were unanimously focused on the microphone at the front. After the chairman of the gathering, Bu Youfu, delivered a brief opening speech, President Chen, guest Shu Mou, and others delivered speeches in succession.

After the ceremony, various recreational activities began. Finally, all the guests and students danced together to the accompaniment of music.

When they dispersed, the torrential rain outside had not yet stopped!

### Setting the Wind

Attacking newspaper offices, cases occur one after another

Why keep attacking? Isn't it enough? Could this be an evil trend of the times? How can newspapers carry news when they are repeatedly attacked? Strange! It seems like a deep hatred that leads to this destruction?

Freedom of speech, alas, a dream! Shut your mouth! You should know what's what and look at the fists! It would be better for everyone to change professions, be coerced, and wear red balls on their heads every day!

### A Scalding Hot Potato

— Translated by Ge Chunliang

I have a friend who told me that he had learned a very, very valuable lesson from his mother. One day, his mother took him to the kitchen and put a potato in a pot of boiling water. After boiling it for a while, she took it out with tongs and said to me, "Hey, son, hold on tight!"—and threw the scalding potato to him.

He held it in his hands, agonizing, but his mother was laughing and saying, "You don't know what to do, do you!"

"Suddenly, I knew," my friend said, writing: "I threw the scalding potato back to my mother. She seemed a little surprised, but she caught it and threw it back into the pot of water. Then she said, 'This can make you never forget this lesson in your life. Whenever anyone throws a scalding potato at you—what should you do? Throw it back at them!'"

My friend said that at first, for many years, he didn't understand why. Although his mother explained that a "scalding potato" is a difficult situation to deal with, or a difficult question to answer—often given to you without warning. She said that in your life, you will meet many clever people who will pretend to be deaf and dumb and throw the problem back at you, without answering it themselves; you will meet even more clever people who will throw the problem at you and then sit comfortably, studying what you know, observing how you handle the difficult problem—in other words, after you grab that scalding potato, what should you do? Perhaps the scalding potato has been "stroked" in your hands for a long time, and even if you throw it back at him, it is no longer hot—in this way, you have suffered from his potato. Or, because of your struggling situation, he also understands how to handle the potato without getting burned.

Although this is a very ordinary little matter, it can be etched in your mind and is very thought-provoking. Speaking of this story, it reminds me of what my father often said to me: "Child. If you remember this sentence, you will definitely be able to cope with the world with ease. When you express your opinions, you are merely repeating what you already know—but if you listen quietly to what others say, you may learn something."

I often pay attention to a very successful young man, a thin and quiet figure. Since leaving the military, he can now get millions of US dollars from several large companies and factories. In board meetings, when he encounters problems, he always cleverly passes them on to others, often adding a pleasing remark: "You know more about this than I do—what are your opinions?" Then, as the meeting is about to end, that friend collects all the most brilliant proposals, eliminates the trivial and unsuitable, extracts the essence, transforms it into his own components, and thus transforms the "scalding potatoes" thrown from all over the meeting room into a delicious dish.

He told me that he learned this method in the military from a junior officer, who always listened quietly and nodded gracefully in meetings. When problems came to him, he always humbly introduced them to his superiors, who were always very happy to hear his sincere remarks. Then, as the meeting was about to end, when everyone was asked if there were any other suggestions, this silent man would stand up and try to express a speech that contained all the most brilliant ideas.

"I learned the importance of timing," my friend said: "How to observe, how to wait, how to study, how to think—once you get the opportunity, throw that 'scalding potato' out." (Self-translated from the June Reader's Digest)

### Sundries from America

— Xu Shuyuan

The Spirit of Price Controls is Not Dead

The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) died with the victory of the war, and ceiling prices have become a thing of the past. But during the war, the people benefited greatly from it, and unscrupulous merchants and hoarders had no way to do anything. Prices were frozen, taking the day before the Pearl Harbor incident as the baseline. Complementary to price controls were rationing and punishment for raising prices, with national prices being completely uniform. For example, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes sold for 15 cents in New York and also sold for 15 cents in Los Angeles. Food price limits were the strictest, with the limit price per pound clearly marked on each type of canned food or vegetable and meat. Shopping required a Ration Book. A ration book was issued every year, with various colored stamps. The stamp for buying eggs had a picture of an egg. Red ones counted for a certain number of points, and blue ones counted for a certain number of points. Vegetables and fish did not require stamps. Among fruits, grape juice required the most points, about 36 or 37 points. At first, I did not apply for a ration book because I ate in the officers' mess and did not need a ration book at all. However, in order to make braised pork, I could not buy pork without a ration book, so I also registered with the Ration Board, and a ration book was sent by mail. So, I cooked Chinese food in the cafeteria every day and indulged myself. The Office of Price Administration encouraged people to report unscrupulous merchants who raised prices, punishing them thousands of times the amount of the overcharge, with half of the fine being used as a bonus and the rest going to the government. Rent valuation was less standardized and had to be reported to the Office of Price Administration to set the rent, with a monthly rent of about 30 yuan per room. The Office of Price Administration was able to successfully implement its policies with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Federal Bureau of Investigation was known for exposing unscrupulous merchants and capturing "tigers," and even the cunning Jews did not dare to test the law. The official residence of a certain provincial governor was found to have hundreds of cans, and he was punished for hoarding and profiteering. (3)
