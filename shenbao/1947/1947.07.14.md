### National Army Uses Annihilation Tactics; Situation in Central Shandong Gradually Improves; Jieshou Recovered, Taian Imminent

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] In the Yishan Mountain area between Yishui, Linqu, and Nanma in Shandong Province, the National Army has launched a large-scale annihilation campaign. Approximately 70,000 remnant communist troops are trapped in a heavy encirclement by the National Army. For days, troops have been dispatched to encircle and annihilate them, resulting in fierce fighting. On the morning of the 12th, the National Army routed the 26th and 2nd Columns of the communist forces, successively capturing more than ten strongholds north of Donglidian, including Songshan Wangzhuang, Bada Zhuang, and Woshan Baizilan, annihilating eight regiments of the communist forces. Another mobile force of the National Army is intensifying its encirclement and annihilation of the main force of the 7th and 9th Columns of the communist forces in the area southeast of Nanma, including Nanbei Anle, Dahongyu, and northeast of Yue Zhuang. Furthermore, the communist forces that have been harassing Yixian and Zaozhuang are being surrounded by the National Army and are showing signs of fleeing back to the northeast.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 13th] The new deployment of the National Army in Shandong Province has been completed. Mobile tactics are being used, and troops are being freely deployed according to needs to achieve the goal of annihilating the communist forces. Currently, the National Army in central and southern Shandong is defending positions in Yishui, Jiangyu, Yue Zhuang, Nanma, Donglidian, Tanbu, Mengyin, Xintai, Laiwu, and other places, launching attacks on the communist forces from various directions. Although Linqu was abandoned, the recovery of Yishui and Jiangyu still gives the military an absolute advantage. The communist forces have been cut off by the National Army, with six columns fleeing to the area north of Donglidian, Laiwu, and Nanma, and five columns fleeing to the Liangqiu Mountain area.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 13th] On the 13th, fighting in the Yimeng Mountain area remained intense. Communist forces in Yixian and Zaozhuang are retreating north. The National Army, launching a counter-offensive towards Taian, reached south of Jieshou early on the 13th and the outskirts of the city in the afternoon, expecting to recover Taian that night.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] The Wang Yaowu corps of the National Army, which came south from Jinan to provide reinforcements, routed the main force of the 10th Column of the communist forces. On the afternoon of the 12th, it continued to capture Jiemu, and by noon on the 13th, it had reached the outskirts of Taian city, engaging in fierce fighting with the 8th Column of the communist forces. Taian is expected to be captured soon.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] The situation in the central Shandong mountain area is gradually improving. Seven columns of communist bandits are being transferred from Donglidian, Nanma, and north of Laiwu to Zibo in recent days, resembling roaming bandits, attempting to probe the outer defenses of Jinan.

[Our Correspondent in Qingdao, 13th] 30,000 communist troops fled east from the periphery of Weixian in several routes. 20,000 of the Shandong Liberation Army fled to Da Xiao Fange Zhuang and attacked Jiaoxian. Another 10,000 or so communist troops of unknown designation crossed the Jiao River eastward yesterday. The National Army west of Jiaoxian is prepared to repel them.

[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 13th] After Liu Bocheng's forces in western Shandong captured Dingtao on the 11th, they began on the 12th to deploy their five elite columns, harassing Chengwu, Cao County, and the border area between Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan in three directions. The National Army is intercepting them.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 13th] Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification Area, and Zhang Xuezhong, commander of the Huaihai Pacification Area, have recently returned to their posts from Xuzhou. It is reported that Commander-in-Chief Gu gave instructions to Li and Zhang on clearing out the remaining communist bandits in northern Jiangsu. It is also learned that a part of the elite National Army forces returning to northern Jiangsu from southern Shandong has entered the territory of Ganyu County to eliminate the remaining bandits in the Haishu area, stabilizing the situation in the East Sea.

### Baoding Shortens Martial Law; National Army in Hebei Province to Join Forces in Renqiu; Pingjinbao Triangle Area Can Be Cleared

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 10th] The large forces of the National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway are sweeping through central Hebei in several directions, making rapid progress. The National Army advancing south from Baoding crossed the Qingshui River yesterday and attacked into the territory of  County, engaging in fierce battles on the outskirts of the city. The eastern route recovered Gaoyang County yesterday afternoon, and the cavalry division is rapidly advancing towards Hejian via a roundabout route. The National Army advancing south from Xiong County recovered the new county seat of Shouxin on the afternoon of the 13th and stationed in Renqiu. The remaining communist forces are retreating towards Hejian and Suning. Furthermore, the 4th Column of the communist forces is currently entrenched in Boye and south of Li County, having fled from Quyang. The 2nd Column moved from Gaoyang to Hejian yesterday.

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] The National Army in Baoding and Shijiazhuang is actively sweeping through the area. The recovery of Xiong County has been confirmed, and Baxian was captured again yesterday, so the Pingjinbao triangle area can be cleared. The troops advancing south from Baoding, after capturing Wangdu Station, were still engaged in fierce fighting with the communist forces in the vicinity on the 13th. The National Army advancing north from Shijiazhuang captured Xin'an Station yesterday after recovering Zhengding.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 13th] Military intelligence: The National Army advancing north from Shijiazhuang, after recovering Zhengding County at 4 p.m. on the 10th, continued to advance in three directions. Currently, the central route of the National Army has approached Dong Changshou, and the left and right wings are searching and advancing along the northern bank of the Hutuo River. The Gao Yang armored vehicles met with the troops advancing south from Xiong and Baxian in Renqiu in three routes on the morning of the 13th, and are now pressing towards Hejian, so the Baocang Road can be opened.

[Another dispatch] Baoding and Yuan were peaceful as ever, no bandit activity reported within twenty Chinese miles and martial law has been delayed from 10pm to 12am.

### The Tense Situation in Taiyuan Is Now a Thing of the Past

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek received Chu  Chun, commander-in-chief of the First Army Group, and Guo Zongfen, chief of staff of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, at 1 p.m. on the 13th, inquiring about the recent military and political situation in Shanxi Province. Afterwards, Guo told reporters that the tense situation in Taiyuan a month ago is now a thing of the past. The airlift of supplies has boosted morale and popular sentiment, and the National Army has smoothly launched attacks on the periphery of Taiyuan to thwart the communist forces' plan to seize grain before the autumn harvest. Their mission in Nanjing has been completed, and they will return to Taiyuan after negotiating the discounted price of military grain with the Ministry of Food. [Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 13th] Chen Geng led his troops back to southern Shanxi via Yangcheng, where they joined the original bandit forces, totaling eight brigades, and occupied Jicheng, Jiangxian, Quwo, Wenxi, Hejin, and Yishi. They also began attacking Xia County, occupying the bunker positions in Sanlidun and Zhangdongcun, north of the city, on the 11th.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] The National Army launched attacks on Dingxiang in several directions on the morning of the 8th, capturing the county seat by nightfall. The remaining communist forces fled northeast.

### It Is Reported That Two Islands in the Miaodao Islands Have Soviet Troops Stationed There.

If true, we will file a negotiation.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The Miaodao Islands in the Bohai Strait have long been a bridge for the communist bandits in Northeast China and Shandong Province. Sailing boats come and go frequently, transporting supplies. In the past, the communist forces used this route to reinforce their troops and transport weapons from Dalian to Shandong, which greatly affected the war in Shandong. Our maritime patrol fleet has long paid attention to this. However, it is reported that both Dazhushan Island and Xiaozhushan Island in the archipelago are stationed with Soviet armed forces, providing a great deal of support to the CCP's maritime connections. A reporter inquired about this matter from diplomatic officials, who said that the government had also heard of this rumor, but had not yet received an official report. If it is true, we will, in order to safeguard the integrity of our territorial sovereignty, file a negotiation. As for any accidental disputes caused by our coastal defense forces in carrying out their missions, our country will not bear any responsibility.

### The Chinese Communists Want to Organize a Communist Regime on the Ruins

Manchester Evening News Commentary

[Central News Agency, London, 12th] The Manchester Evening News today commented on the war in China, saying that since Marshall left China in May, the Soviet Union has undoubtedly been assisting the CCP, just as it did in the past to help the CCP gain a foothold in Northeast China. The CCP's threat has greatly increased in the past six months, and it is believed that the CCP has occupied vast amounts of land in Northeast China. At the same time, the CCP is using Dalian and Lushun (which the Soviet Union still occupies despite the Sino-Soviet Treaty) to continuously transport reinforcements to North China. The newspaper stated that the CCP has recently established a Xinhua News Agency in London, publishing a large number of weekly propaganda materials, which is very important. The Kuomintang's mistakes have been widely publicized, but those who promote the CCP abroad as the only friend of the peasants are either deliberately or intentionally deceiving themselves. We have confirmed that in every village infiltrated by the Communist Party, the peasants are swept away with all their belongings and flee in terror. The Communist Party's goal is to create chaos in order to overthrow the government and then establish a Communist government on the ruins.

### Chief of Staff Chen Will Fly to Siping Today; He Held a Military Conference in Shenyang Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] Chief of Staff Chen is scheduled to fly to Siping with Chen Mingren on the 14th and will stay in Shenyang for four more days after returning.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] Chief of Staff Chen, accompanied by Commissioner Feng Yong, visited Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, and Ma Zhanshan, three gentlemen of the Northeast, at 10 a.m. on the 13th, and then attended a luncheon hosted by Director Xiong. In the afternoon, he held a military conference at the Commander's Headquarters at approximately 4 p.m. In the evening, Commander Du hosted a banquet for Chief of Staff Chen, Commander-in-Chief Guo, and others at his residence, inviting various military and political officials to accompany him.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] The Shenyang Air Defense Command Headquarters held its first protection meeting on the 13th, deciding to build trenches and instill air defense knowledge in the people to cope with the tense situation at home and abroad. It is also learned that the Northeast will continue to increase its troop strength.

Northeast War Situation Focus Shifts Eastward; National Army Encirclement of Meihekou on Three Sides

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] It has been raining continuously in the Changnan area. The focus of the war situation in the Northeast is gradually shifting eastward from the muddy roads on the left side of the Changchun Railway. Since the National Army successively captured Xifeng, Yitong, and Shuangyang, and controlled Xian and Dongfeng counties, the square area in southern Jilin, surrounded by the Changchun, Pingmei, and Jimei railway lines, has returned to the control of the National Army. Currently, the main force of the bandit army continues to retreat eastward from the Pingmei line (Siping to Meihekou), and the National Army is currently pursuing in several directions, tightening the encirclement and annihilation of the main force of the communist bandits in Meihekou. The bandit army on the west side of the Jihai Road is currently entrenched in Chaoyangtong (70 miles west of Panshi), Shahe Town, and Taiping Town, hindering the eastward advance of the National Army. It is generally expected that if the bandit army insists on defending Meihekou to the death, it will inevitably suffer the fate of being encircled and annihilated, as the National Army's forces advancing east in a roundabout way from Yantongshan, Yitong, and Pingmei have now completed the encirclement of Meihekou on three sides.

### Wedemeyer Will Depart This Week; American Newspapers Value Wedemeyer's Assignment to China; The White House and the State Department Remain Silent

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The White House and the State Department remain silent on the true meaning of General Wedemeyer's mission, awaiting the results of Wedemeyer's comprehensive assessment of the local situation. It is reported that Wedemeyer will depart within the next week and return to the United States in the second half of August.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Wu Tiecheng, vice president of the Legislative Yuan, told a United Press reporter today: "General Wedemeyer's visit to China and Korea as a special envoy of the President is very welcome news. Wedemeyer cooperated with us in Chongqing in the past, and he was aware of our problems and examined our difficulties at that time. We greatly admire his talent and vision. We are very pleased that he has come in person to inspect and analyze our current problems. We firmly believe that the results of Wedemeyer's inspection will clarify misunderstandings about our government. The results of the inspection will make an appropriate contribution to the United States' formation of its long-term policy on Asian issues."

[Central News Agency, This City] According to Li Ruoquan, chief secretary of the Sino-Korean Cultural Association in this city, the association is preparing sufficient materials for General Wedemeyer to refer to when he visits China and Korea, and will also convene cultural figures and experts on Eastern issues to hold a symposium to gather valuable opinions for General Wedemeyer.

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The significance of General Wedemeyer's appointment to China lies not only in the selection of the person (Wedemeyer is considered one of the top military strategists in the United States), but also in the timing of his appointment. Previously, it was believed that the United States' policy toward China needed to be re-considered on fundamental issues after Walter Bedell Smith, the Counselor of the Embassy to China, returned home. Truman's appointment of Wedemeyer before Smith's return may indicate the urgency of the situation in the Far East. In light of the tense struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, the situation in China and Korea can no longer be isolated from European issues. The Christian Science Monitor first interviewed Stanford, a reporter for the State Department, and reported yesterday that "the United States is conducting a major review of its China policy," making the following meaningful argument. Stanford said: "Well-informed sources in Washington unanimously believe that the events that have occurred in Europe in recent months cannot be separated from developments in Asia. Washington authorities believe that Soviet foreign policy contains expansionist pressure when it comes into contact with the non-Soviet world. If this is the case, then the United States is taking the lead in sending one of America's top strategists, General Wedemeyer, to China and Korea to conduct an on-site assessment of the critical situation in order to guard against the Soviet Union's experiments! The White House's statement that Wedemeyer will 'make an assessment of the situation' raises the question of whether Wedemeyer's mission will go beyond economic assistance to the two countries. New York newspapers have not yet commented on Wedemeyer's appointment."

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 13th] TASS reported from Washington on the 12th, commenting on Wedemeyer's mission to China, saying that the Truman administration plans to provide new assistance to China.

### The United States Will Conduct a Thorough Review of Its China Policy

[United Press, Washington, 13th] President Truman's dispatch of former U.S. military commander of the China theater, General Wedemeyer, to China and Korea to investigate the actual situation confirms that the United States will conduct a thorough review of its China policy. Wedemeyer's investigation results can help the authorities decide whether the United States is willing to risk Soviet opposition to assist Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in suppressing the communists, and to what extent it will provide assistance. Wedemeyer's review of U.S. policy toward China will involve the  foundations of loans and arms supplies. According to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, China needs a "political loan" of US$200 billion for construction purposes. Small loans from the Export-Import Bank will be handled separately. However, diplomatic officials here still believe that if the U.S. government decides to provide assistance, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek must effectively eliminate diehards and accommodate more democratic elements.

### Effective Assistance to China to Make It a Pillar of Asia

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Reliable sources familiar with Far Eastern events suggested on the 13th that the Wedemeyer delegation to the Far East will help U.S. officials decide whether there is a "center" in the East where economic and political stability is possible, and whose position is as important as that of the Ruhr in the Marshall Plan for European recovery. One of the strong opinions among officials here is that China under the rule of the Kuomintang should be supported in its industrial development. This would not only preserve China from communist control, but also make China a pillar of all of Asia. Another faction believes that this development in China is not guaranteed, and at best will be very slow and difficult.

Within the latter faction, some believe that Japan is more suitable as a potential economic center in Asia. Others argue that the economic strength of the Philippines, Korea, China, Japan, and Indonesia must be gradually adjusted and increased.

In Europe, the Ruhr has become the center of the recovery plan because it is a source of coal production and industry. For example, Ruhr coal production, if there is a significant expansion of production, will enable factories to increase steel production, and the increase in Ruhr coal will also increase the production of chemical fertilizer plants. This would further increase food production and expand the productive capacity of workers. All of this is expected to make the people of many countries more satisfied, leading to greater political stability and reducing the threat of communism.

The Paris Conference will pay close attention to the Ruhr. Although there is deep skepticism in U.S. political circles about whether a type of European-style reconstruction can be carried out in Asia, there is a consensus that the Wedemeyer delegation will help formulate a policy that will translate into action, so that progress in one area can contribute its strength. One official said that what the Wedemeyer delegation can do, at the very least, is to include China and Korea in the U.S.'s broad global aid assessment, which the United States may be obligated to do in the next few years. He said: "It is especially important to assess the situation in China based on this position, because U.S. taxpayers feel heavily burdened by the recovery plans for Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Therefore, they believe that they should be carefully adjusted, with the intention of minimizing costs. Efforts are now being made to encourage every part of the world to bear all expenses on its own. This is the  core thinking of the Marshall Plan."

### The Principles for Reorganizing Local Governments Have Been Decided

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Hu Haidou of the Democratic Socialist Party told reporters on the morning of the 13th that when Zhang Junmai visited the Chairman in Nanjing last time, he discussed not only the Mobilization Edict, but also made decisions on the reorganization of local governments. The revitalization of local politics discussed in recent political meetings will reorganize a portion of local governments, and the opinions of the Democratic Socialist Party, the China Youth Party, and the government on this issue have converged. Both the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party will participate in the reorganization of local governments. In addition, the reorganization of local governments across the country this time is in the nature of a transfer, because current officials are not allowed to be elected locally during this year's elections. Therefore, after this exchange, local officials can be successfully elected.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Wang Shiming, an opponent of the Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Beiping from Shanghai yesterday to conduct activities. It is said that the National Congress of the Renovation Society will be held in Shanghai on July 15th, and he will travel to Shanghai with Zhang Chongsun next week. Zhang and Wang met at Liang Qishui's residence on the 13th, and Zhang Dongsun said that he would decide whether to join the Renovation Society after arriving in Shanghai.

### Legislative Yuan Delegation Visits the United States to Exchange Legal Opinions Between China and the United States

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th, United Press] Chinese officials said that Dr. Wu Shangteng, Secretary-General of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, and his party are here to exchange views with U.S. officials and non-officials on legislative issues involving important interests of the people of both countries. Dr. Wu is one of the legal scholars responsible for drafting China's constitution. He visited U.S. House Speaker Martin and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton, accompanied by Ambassador Gu Weijun, and is scheduled to visit Senate Speaker Vandenberg next week. Chinese officials explained that the United States has abolished consular jurisdiction in China, so Sino-U.S. relations have entered a new phase in terms of legislative issues. In view of this, the Chinese Legislative Yuan has decided to send a delegation to the United States to explain China's legislative system and clarify the meaning and implementation of Chinese laws, thereby promoting further understanding between the two countries. Dr. Wu is prepared to answer any questions about Chinese law. The Legislative Yuan delegation will visit Chinese communities throughout the United States, and conduct a comprehensive survey of overseas Chinese's opinions on U.S. laws that are particularly relevant to them. They will also visit major cities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, South America, and the Union of South Africa.

### Zhang Jia'ao in Beiping

Discusses the North China Grain Issue

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Zhang Jia'ao's visit to the north is mainly to cooperate with the General Mobilization Order and solve the  famine problem in the north. After Zhang deplaned yesterday, he immediately held a meeting with the Fifth Supply Zone Commander, etc., to discuss the issue of military supplies. On the morning of the 13th, he also discussed the North China grain issue with the Beiping Municipal Government and the Pingjin District Railway Bureau, etc. In the afternoon, he invited those responsible for the local coal mines to discuss the issues of protecting mines, strengthening production and transportation. According to Zhang, economic measures will be  taken into consideration after the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, and the national economic plan is being  considered by the economic, financial, and food policy groups.

### Flying Saucers Spotted in Shenyang and Xi'an

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The flying saucer, which has become a world mystery, has been spotted over Shenyang. The first to discover it was Mr. Yan Jinbo, an employee of the Anshan Company's Shenyang office. Mr. Yan stated that at 10:30 PM on the 10th, while enjoying the cool air in front of his dormitory, he suddenly caught sight of a white, round object swiftly gliding across the high sky from northeast to southwest, lasting only a few seconds. Subsequently, at intervals of less than a minute, another one would appear, all flying in the same direction, seemingly with great regularity. Initially, he thought it was smoke from a neighboring chimney, but he later realized that if it were gas, it could not be so round and shiny. Mr. Yan said, "At that time, all his family members were already asleep, so he called his colleague Zhang Rongshao to watch together, and the objects continued to fly for an hour. They disappeared at 11:30 PM." According to Mr. Zhang's calculations, they saw more than 80 of them in one hour. Mr. Zhang said that the object was very round, and from the ground, it appeared to be about four feet in diameter, milky white with a slight hint of light blue, resembling a jade plate. However, he believed that it was not a substantial object, nor was it a searchlight, as searchlights would have beams of light radiating from the ground, which this did not. Mr. Zhang said that he immediately thought that this might be the flying saucer discovered in the United States, but he could not obtain any strong evidence.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] According to reporters informed by firefighters in this city, at around 11:00 AM on the 13th, a radiant, circular object was spotted at an altitude of over 3,000 meters above the urban area, slowly ascending. After about fifteen minutes, it drifted towards the southeast. It is generally speculated that it may be a flying saucer.

### Sophistry and Strong Arguments Regarding the Lushun-Dalian Issue: USSR Lacks Sincerity in Fulfilling the Treaty; We Firmly Demand Military Police Entry into Both Areas

Talks with a Certain Key Official in Charge of Northeast Takeover

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] According to a TASS report published on the 11th, the Soviet Union's communique regarding our statement on Lushun-Dalian contained many defenses. A Central News Agency reporter recently inquired about this with a military official from our Northeast takeover agency, who said: "The Soviet government's communique is clearly sophistry, as anyone with discerning eyes can see, and there is no need for us to argue further. What our government firmly demands is that Chinese troops and police be allowed to enter Dalian and Lushun to protect the safety and freedom of Chinese takeover administrative personnel. This is clearly permitted by the Sino-Soviet Treaty, or at least not prohibited by the Sino-Soviet Treaty. If the Chinese takeover agency cannot obtain full protection from government troops and police, the result can be inferred from the situation when Soviet troops occupied Changchun last year. At that time, the Soviet army was responsible for the area, similar to today's Lushun. At that time, the Soviet government also promised to give us all assistance, but because our takeover agency had no government troops or police and no freedom to send troops and police to Changchun, it almost became a prisoner of the CCP. At that time, the threats and harassment from the CCP inside and outside the city even cut off our headquarters' external communications. If our Lushun-Dalian takeover agency does not have sufficient government troops and police to protect it, based on past experience, it must prepare to be a prisoner of those who oppose the government or a puppet of others. Our diplomatic authorities insist that our military police must be able to freely reside in Dalian because we do not want our Lushun-Dalian takeover personnel to be prisoners or puppets of any party. Their stance and attitude are extremely proper. The Soviet government should quickly correct its attitude, otherwise, everyone will believe that it has no sincerity in fulfilling the treaty."

Note: The TASS statement carried by Soviet newspapers on the 11th is roughly as follows: "As early as December 1945 and January 1946, the Soviet military authorities notified Chinese representatives that the Soviet Union intended to provide all assistance to China in establishing a government in Dalian. However, although China appointed officials to the area, not a single one went to Dalian to take office. Because the Soviet side requested the Chinese government again in December 1946 to reappoint officials to Lushun-Dalian, and then again on March 7, 1947, but received no response. This has caused those who do not understand the truth to draw incorrect conclusions. The Chinese communique also states that the CCP is increasing its forces in the Lushun-Dalian area, which is also without basis, as there are no CCP troops in the area. Furthermore, China's dispatch of troops to the Lushun naval base violates Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Agreement, which entrusts the defense to the Soviet Union. Therefore, Chinese troops are not allowed to be stationed in the area. The agreement on Dalian also does not allow Chinese troops to be stationed in the urban area, and during the war against Japan, Dalian should be managed by the wartime government of the wartime naval zone. Currently, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, and we are still in a state of war against Japan, so Dalian is still under the administration of the military government. The Soviet government believes that the Chinese government's claim that the Chinese government in the area cannot perform its duties without the assistance of Chinese troops has no basis, because the Soviet government allows the Chinese police to be sent to the area, which can fully maintain order. The Soviet Union has fulfilled its obligations in supporting and providing military assistance to the Chinese government and respecting China's sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces, eliminating Japanese troops in the three northeastern provinces, and then withdrawing its troops to respect China's sovereignty."

### Joint Effort by the Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to Dredge Accumulated Water in the Yellow River Flooded Area; Project Planned and Ready for Construction

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] In view of the fact that accumulated water in the Yellow River flooded area is hindering the return of refugees to their farms, Chen Panling, Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, has reportedly obtained the consent of the Henan branch of UNRRA to jointly form a Flood Area Water Conservancy Engineering Supervision Committee to determine construction methods. The scope of the project is limited to the southern waterways of the Jialu River system, including the triangular area west of the Jialu River, south of the Shuangbo River, and west of the Sha River. Due to incomplete data, the construction plan is temporarily based on the original preliminary plan of the Yellow River, selecting key points for drafting. A total of 5 billion yuan in construction funds and 5,000 tons of work rations will be used to complete the project by the end of the year. Regarding the funding and organization of the construction team, the branch office will allocate 1 billion yuan for management fees from the 5 billion yuan in water conservancy funds in the flooded area. From the six survey teams of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau in the flooded area, four teams will specialize in surveying. The other two teams will be reorganized into construction teams, and one more team will be added to handle construction matters. The salaries of all employees will be in accordance with the Bureau's salaries, plus 50%. It is heard that construction can begin soon, so that the flooded area of the past decade can be transformed into a paradise with crisscrossing ditches.

### Does the Yellow River Flow Through Sichuan Province? So Says Sichuan Provincial Assemblyman Ma Bijie

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 13th] According to Sichuan Provincial Assemblyman Ma Bijie of Songpan, when talking to reporters, the Yellow River originates from the Bayan Har Mountains, and most people believe that it flows through nine provinces including Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi, but this is not entirely true. After originating from the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai, the Yellow River turns southeast and flows through the Sanheba area in Songpan, Sichuan, and then turns north and flows into Gansu. The length of the Yellow River in Sichuan is approximately 300 li, and there is a river bend. The cattle, sheep, and horses raised by the local aborigines depend on this for drinking water and grazing. The terrain of Songpan resembles a snake, extending westward from Songpan County to the Kunlun Mountains, a length of approximately 2,000 li. The people in this area are purely aborigines, still living an ancient nomadic life, with no culture to speak of. They do not communicate with the outside world, so the fact that the upper reaches of the Yellow River flow through Sichuan is rarely known to the world. It is unknown whether Ma's statement is true, but it is worthy of exploration by geographers.

### Laid-Off Workers of the Shanghai Naval Shipyard Petition

Relevant Authorities Discussing Solutions

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] A delegation of petitioners from the laid-off workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Shanghai Gaochang Temple Naval Shipyard, led by Le Junyu, came to Nanjing to petition various relevant ministries and departments. On the 13th at 2 PM, they received reporters and reported their five key demands: (1) Requesting the government to subsidize shipbuilding funds; (2) Requesting the government to quickly allocate US$500,000 in foreign exchange; (3) Requesting job security; (4) Requesting the reinstatement of 800 laid-off workers; (5) Opposing shift adjustments. The Naval Headquarters was very sympathetic to them, but due to the lack of domestic materials and the department's tight budget, this problem could not be solved independently. After contacting other agencies, a response will be given. The representatives of the petition delegation will continue to petition the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Labor Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs on the 14th.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Various agencies of the Executive Yuan will hold a meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs at 3 PM on the 14th to resolve the issue of laid-off workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard. The representatives attending the meeting will be Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs; Sun Bo, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau; Qian Yuanfu, Director of the Sixth Department of the Ministry of National Defense; Zhou Yongneng, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance; Peng Erkang, Secretary of the Central Organization Department; and Yuan Qijiong, Director of the Labor Movement Division of the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department. The meeting will be presided over by Secretary-General Gan Yongguang. It is reported that the meeting may involve the principle of handling Japan's compensation to China for shipbuilding equipment. During the time when Song Ziwen was the head of the Executive Yuan, it was planned to use the equipment to set up another shipbuilding factory in Wusong. The naval authorities believed that the Jiangnan Shipyard had a long history and that accepting commercial ship repairs was its normal business. It was proposed to use the compensation equipment to expand the Jiangnan Shipyard. Therefore, the principle has been suspended for a long time. Recently, Jiangnan has been unable to obtain copper and iron, and its business has been sluggish, so it has had to lay off workers. If the meeting can make a decision on this principle and resolve the supply of shipbuilding materials, and with the gradual arrival of the equipment and ships compensated by the Japanese side, the layoff problem can be solved in conjunction.

### Sister's Brother-in-Law of Yoshiko Kawashima Arrested for Swindling; Hirokuni Otsuka Impersonated a Chinese General and Deceived Japanese Companies, Exposed

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Hirokuni Otsuka, the brother-in-law of the Japanese female spy Yoshiko Kawashima, has been swindling in Osaka and Tokyo for a year, impersonating a Chinese general and claiming to be very friendly with Chairman Chiang. He has now been arrested by the Tokyo Prison for fraud. The suspect is 55 years old, bald, and has a large belly. He held forged certificates from the Chinese government, calling himself General Wang Zhike, and recommended himself to the financial world, exposing the goods hidden by the Japanese army and navy. He claimed that some of the goods should have been transferred to the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, but are still hidden. After these goods are discovered, the Chinese government will order them to be transported to China, and some of them will be used in Japan. Therefore, he falsely promised Japanese companies preferential rights and defrauded them of approximately 20 million yen. After a long time, the goods were not delivered, and the companies became suspicious and inquired with the Osaka office of our delegation in Japan. After investigation, he was finally arrested last month. The suspect is from Tokyo, born in Osaka. At the age of 17, he went to the Northeast to train children, and trained a large number of Japanese children to pretend to be Chinese. In 1933, he was tried for defrauding a famous Northeast businessman in Osaka of 2 million yen and fabricating sensational news. After his arrest last month, the police found a large number of penicillin and cigars in his home, worth approximately 700,000 yen. According to the Osaka Prison, after being imprisoned, he still denied smuggling goods and committing fraud, claiming: "I am under the command of the Chinese government's Peace Allied Forces." Such troops have never been heard of, and his lies are ridiculous.

Editorial

### The Merger of the Party and the Youth League

The Central Standing Committee passed the unified organization of the Party and the Youth League on the 9th. The reason given was to unify the revolutionary front, strengthen the power of the Party and the Youth League, take unified steps, and quell the communist rebellion. Minister Bai, on the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Youth League, encouraged the youth, saying: "In our revolutionary camp, there are still remnants of feudalism existing within it. The head of the Youth League has a far-sighted vision, so he recently gave clear instructions that the Party and the Youth League must be merged to thoroughly transform our Party, so as to unify our strength to cooperate with the national policy of suppressing the communist rebellion. This is to adapt to the needs of the current stage of the revolution and is also a good opportunity for the rebirth of the Party and the Youth League." This is a clear and decisive decision to transform the affairs of the Youth League and the Party to adapt to the needs of the times.

The Three Principles of the People Youth League was established in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). On March 29th of that year, the Kuomintang Provisional National Congress decided to revise the Party Constitution and add Article 5: "This Party establishes the Three Principles of the People Youth League to train youth." On June 16th of that year, President Chiang, concurrently the head of the Youth League, issued a letter to the youth of the whole country and announced the constitution of the Youth League. On August 1st, the head of the Youth League and all those below took an oath to join the Youth League. From then on, the Youth League carried out national policies and participated in the War of Resistance with full vigor, shedding blood on the front lines and sweating in the rear, and once wrote magnificent poems that were inspiring and worthy of praise.

During the most critical period of the War of Resistance, the Central Government launched the "100,000 Youth Volunteering for Military Service" campaign. The youth responded enthusiastically, rolled up their sleeves, and volunteered to kill the enemy. In less than a day, more than 150,000 people were registered and enlisted, and more than 93,000 people were called up and enlisted by the Youth League at all levels, exceeding the original quota by almost one fold, eventually encouraging the military and the people, eliminating the strong enemy, and winning the victory. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Youth League organizations at all levels in the enemy areas changed from secret activities to public activities, assisting the National Army in taking over and cooperating with the government in repatriation work, making great achievements.

At this time, the Communist bandits are rebelling against the country and dismembering the nation. Domestic disturbances are imminent, and there is a fierce ideological struggle internationally. In order to strengthen the revolutionary ranks and concentrate revolutionary forces, the central authorities believe that the Party and the Youth League must be unified, and Party members and Youth League members must be united as one family. This is very consistent with what President Chiang said: "The Kuomintang is the artery of the country, and the Three Principles of the People Youth League is the fresh blood输 in the artery." Arteries and fresh blood输 originally belong to one family and are absolutely inseparable from each other. The artery is the engine of all life forces, and blood is the source of all abilities. The Kuomintang is older and fears arteriosclerosis. The addition of the fresh blood输 of the young Youth League can produce a new and renewed effect. This is an important .

The Party and the Youth League are originally inseparable. The leaders are the same, the principles are the same, the ideology is consistent, and the goals are the same. Now the work is also similar. The Youth League accepts the leadership of the Party, and the Party supports the development of the Youth League. It has always been a case of different paths leading to the same goal. In the future, forming an integrated whole will be even more a matter of being in the same boat. The Youth League has joined the Party's organization, and the Party has gained a new force from the Youth League, and should exert its strength even more. The youth movement of the past sixty years has always been a revolutionary movement. The first period was to eliminate the autocratic regime and create the Republic of China. The second period was to overthrow the warlords and unify the country. The third period was to fight the war of resistance while abolishing unequal treaties. Today, we have stepped into the fourth period, which is also the later period of the revolutionary movement. The main task is to quell the communist rebellion and establish the country under the constitution. This is the new work after the rebirth of the Party and the Youth League, but it is a consistent old mission of the revolution.

How will the Party and the Youth League be unified? How to merge the families? The central authorities have decided to set up a "Research Association for the Unified Organization of the Party and the Youth League" and a "Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and the Youth League" to study and implement the matter separately. There is no need for further discussion. However, one point to note is that the organizations should become unified, and must become "chemical" organizations, so as to avoid setting up separate factions and dividing each other. At the same time, it is hoped that the Party will not "rely on its age to sell its experience", but will "stay young as it gets older", and that the Youth League will avoid "youthful vigor", but should bring some "precociousness" so that they can be as harmonious as water and milk, and be united against the outside world. This time, President Chiang, on the ninth anniversary of the Youth League, earnestly encouraged us, saying: "We should recognize the importance of the current revolutionary environment and revolutionary responsibilities, and, based on the spirit of self-criticism, thoroughly review the past, improve all shortcomings, strengthen the revolutionary organization, and strengthen discipline and concentrate our forces to eliminate revolutionary obstacles." Only in this way can we complete the great cause of the revolution.

### Celebrating French National Day

Today is French National Day. 158 years ago today, the French people heroically stormed the Bastille prison, overthrew the French monarchy, and established the First Republic. They also issued the "Declaration of the Rights of Man," using "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" as their slogan, calling out to the people of all countries in the world. From then on, the revolutionary movements in various countries surged like a storm, all caused by the inspiration of the French Revolution. Today, as we celebrate French National Day, in addition to admiring the spirit of the French Revolution, we especially admire the ideals of the French Revolution—Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.

Although the slogan of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity has been shouted for 158 years, it has not yet been fully realized. Taking France itself as an example, although it has gone through four revolutions and established four republican regimes, the ideals that were envisioned during the French Revolution of 1789 have not yet been fully realized. Post-war France, on the surface, appears to be progressive and leaning to the left, but in reality, it is still quite far from the ideals of the French Revolution. The Ramadier cabinet, although it is a united government representing the entire country, the Communist Party recently withdrew from the government again, becoming a united government in name only. The French government faces the possibility of political unrest every day. In terms of economy, France was exhausted after the war and is still full of scars. To rebuild from the ruins, it is all in vain without foreign aid. At the same time, France still adopts the previous imperialist attitude towards its overseas colonies and adopts a high-pressure policy against the Viet Minh, which is a perfect example. Therefore, we are not very optimistic about the future of the French Fourth Republic government.

If we re-evaluate the current world with the three slogans of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, we feel that the progress of mankind is really too slow. Since the French Revolution, the revolutionary movements in various countries have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, either demanding independent national movements or democratic revolutionary movements internally. However, 150 years later, looking at the situation in various countries around the world, there are still many countries that, although they are independent and autonomous on the surface, inevitably have to be vassals of major powers. Their internal affairs are subject to interference, and their diplomacy cannot be independent. The fact that some European countries recently could not freely decide to participate in the European Economic Conference is a powerful proof.

From this, we can see that the ideals of the French Revolution, whether from the perspective of France itself or from the perspective of various countries in the world, have not been fully realized even after 158 years of human struggle, and still require the joint efforts of the people of all countries to strive for the realization of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity!

### European Conference Progressing Rapidly; General Assembly Passes Report of the Working Committee; Small Countries Obtain Decisive Right to Speak

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 13th broadcast: The European Economic Cooperation Conference held its second plenary session today, lasting one hour and fifteen minutes. It unanimously passed the report of the Working Committee and announced that the conference's door remains open to Central and Eastern Europe, which are controlled by the Soviet Union and refuse to attend the conference. The conference will also establish a and institution to determine the joint relief plan for various European countries. The Working Committee will meet on the afternoon of the 14th to finalize its report.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The Paris Conference opened on the morning of the 12th. The preliminary stage of the Paris Conference, under the leadership of Britain and France, has been advancing rapidly and in a completely unified atmosphere, which is rare in various international conferences after the end of the war. This rapid action is probably due to the absence of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries such as Poland and Yugoslavia.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Well-informed British sources here said today that the European Economic Conference is expected to make great progress by the 16th of this month. At that time, Foreign Secretary Bevin will be able to return to London quickly.

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The Working Committee of the European Conference, composed of representatives from 16 countries, met here this afternoon for nearly five hours to discuss the next action of the General Assembly. Achille Alphand, Director of Economic Affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was unanimously elected as Chairman of the Working Committee, and another French representative, Serruys, was elected as Secretary-General. The meeting discussed the draft procedures and organization proposed by Britain and France. After listening to the opinions of other countries, the Chairman will prepare a revised organizational plan and submit it to the Working Committee meeting at noon tomorrow. The Working Committee has four tasks: (1) to prepare a draft procedure; (2) to prepare a draft organization; (3) to decide on the organization and personnel of the committees established in accordance with the first two drafts; (4) to recommend the Secretary-General of each committee and subcommittee. Regarding the organizational plan, it is roughly similar to what is outlined in the British and French invitations, including the establishment of a permanent Executive Committee and four permanent technical committees to study food and agriculture, steel, fuel and electricity, and transportation separately. The Working Committee is expected to submit a report to the Plenary Assembly before Tuesday.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The small European countries won a victory in the 16-nation European Economic Recovery Conference on the 12th, obtaining a decisive right to speak when drafting the European relief plan. The small countries decided in a four-and-a-half-hour "Working Committee meeting" that all countries should obtain seats to draft the relief and economic plans required by each participating country and submit them to the United States before September 1. The Working Committee has agreed on the establishment methods of more than half of the organizations in the European relief plan and hopes to reach a complete agreement by the afternoon of the 15th. The organizations that have been agreed upon are: (1) the Working Committee, composed of representatives from 16 countries; (2) the Executive Committee, which implements the resolutions of the Working Committee. How it will be organized has not yet been determined; (3) four technical subcommittees on fuel and electricity, food, steel, and transportation. The main members of each subcommittee are limited to those from the producing countries.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] According to authoritative sources here: Britain and France plan to make a final appeal to the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe before the end of the Paris Conference, inviting them to participate in the Marshall Plan in time before it is too late. This appeal may ease the diplomatic counterattack against the Marshall Plan. It is rumored that the Soviet Union is planning to organize a firmer economic group in Eastern Europe under the auspices of Moscow. Regarding what senior American officials here said two days ago that the Paris Conference was the "final invitation," any country that does not respond will not be able to enjoy the aid of the Marshall Plan. According to news from Washington, the door to assistance is still open. The leaders of Britain and France are deeply concerned about this apparent disagreement and hope that authoritative parties will clarify this point as soon as possible.

### Attempting to Sabotage Marshall's Plan to Aid Europe; The Soviet Union Will Eventually Work Hard in Vain; The United States Is Determined to Deal with Any Provocation by the Soviet Union

[United Press, Washington, 12th] American officials said today that the Soviet Union's attempt to split Europe and sabotage Marshall's plan to aid Europe will eventually work hard in vain and achieve nothing. It is reported that although the countries of the Soviet bloc refuse to participate in the Paris Economic Conference, they are still willing to share the United States' economic aid to Europe. The United States' attitude from now on is roughly as follows: (1) The United States government is determined to do its best to support the reasonable European recovery plan produced by the Paris Conference, regardless of how the Soviet Union opposes it. (2) The United States government does not want to force a showdown with the Soviet Union in political and economic relations and in the United Nations organization at this time, but will deal with any provocation by the Soviet Union's forces. (3) The United States government may expedite the resolution of certain cases between the United States and the Soviet Union, such as the political situation in Hungary and the situation in the Balkans. These issues are probably major disputes in the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly in September of this year. (4) The United States government does not want to close any road to cooperation between Eastern and Western Europe at this time. The United States does not recognize fixed Eastern and Western blocs. (5) The current competition in Europe is a test of all the political and economic resources between the United States and the Soviet Union, that is, a struggle between American capitalism and democracy and Soviet communism and dictatorship. This test will continue for many years, and the economic prosperity of Europe is one stage of it, but the relationship is extremely important.

American Trade Experts Observe European Economy

[United Press, Washington, 13th] A trade expert on the Soviet Union in the Department of Commerce said today that, based on a study of Soviet publications and Eastern European trade statistics, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Paris Economic Conference was a foolish move that caused great damage to itself, and its industry and commerce will become even more unable to recover. The Soviet Union has a population of 196 million, and the Eastern European countries have a population of 90 million. They will all suffer the same fate and need more machinery and more skilled workers. Now that both are lacking, the Soviet Union's standard of living cannot be improved, and the standard of living in Eastern European countries will decline. The Soviet authorities' attempt to "sell" communism to their people will be hit.

### Austria Participates in the European Conference; The Communist Party Expresses Support

[Associated Press, Vienna, 12th] Electrical Minister Jardemenn, the only member of the Austrian government who is a Communist, told this agency's reporter on the 12th that the Austrian Communist Party fully supports the Austrian delegation attending the European Conference. The Austrian Communist Party believes that no loyal Austrian or Communist is willing to lose the opportunity for relief, so it advocates participating in the European Conference. The Austrian Communist Party also hopes that the European Conference can formulate a relief plan that can be fully endorsed by the Communist Party.

### Laski Dissatisfied With Marshall's Plan to Aid Europe

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] Former British Labour Party leader Laski recently expressed his views on the Marshall Plan at a Labour Party meeting in Essex City, saying: Britain does not want to become the 49th state of the United States. We are unwilling to cater to the United States, nor are we willing to change our policies in exchange for its financial assistance. Britain cannot be controlled by foreign countries. I do not know what Marshall's plan is. I think Marshall himself does not know it either. If Britain does not want to suffer an "economic Dunkirk," Britain only needs the friendship of the Soviet Union and the United States.

### Czech Republic Changes Course Midway; French Leaders Express Concern

Will Question Bidault

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Schumann, leader of the French Popular Republican Movement, recently declared: When the National Assembly meets next time, I will question Foreign Minister Bidault about the Czech Republic's change of heart and refusal to participate in the Paris Conference. The Czech Republic is the only country within the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union that once accepted the invitation of Britain and France, but the result was a change of heart midway.

### Romanian Prime Minister Visits Bulgaria to Discuss Molotov's Plan

[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 12th] Five senior Romanian government leaders left here today for Sofia to hold important talks with the Bulgarian government in order to establish another close link within the framework of the Soviet Union's organization of Eastern Europe. Economic Minister and Communist Party Secretary-General Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej is also one of the representatives. Before his departure, he gave a speech expressing that he would try to strengthen Balkan cooperation to prevent reactionary elements from infringing on the independence and sovereignty of the Balkan democratic countries. Gheorghiu-Dej has just returned from Moscow. He stayed in the Soviet capital for eight days and discussed with various leaders the policies of the "Molotov Plan" aimed at countering the "Marshall Plan." According to extremely reliable sources, the main agenda of the Sofia conference is to discuss the mutual assistance treaty and close economic relations between Romania and Bulgaria. The Romanian delegation is personally led by Prime Minister Groza. Prime Minister Groza has also declared that after completing his trip to Sofia, he will go to Prague to hold similar negotiations with the Czech government.

### British Newspaper Comments on European Conference; Exposing Soviet Intentions

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The "Sunday Times" warned today that Yugoslavia may invade the Austrian provinces of Carinthia and Styria as part of its efforts to disrupt the Paris Economic Recovery Conference. Once the Austrian peace treaty is signed and British troops withdraw from Austria, Yugoslavia will launch a violent coup in these two provinces to complete the Eastern European bloc. The Soviet Union can enter Italy directly from Hungary, and Yugoslavia's transportation can also be improved. However, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault regard the Paris Conference as a business conference and are wholeheartedly making it a success. The "Sunday Herald" said that the Soviet Union's next action will be to launch a Molotov Plan in Eastern Europe to compete with the Marshall Plan in Western Europe, but this plan can only give the Eastern European countries lukewarm comfort. At most, the Soviet Union can only provide these countries with some limited industrial assistance. The Soviet Union is clearly determined to make Europe into two mutually hostile Eastern and Western blocs. The biggest difficulty of the Paris Conference is that the Soviet Union not only refuses to participate in the conference, but also clearly wants to do its best to disrupt it.

### Eastern Europe Welcomes American Loans but Opposes Britain and France as Intermediaries

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th] Soviet commentator Marinin and Léontiev published an article in "Pravda" today commenting on the European Economic Cooperation Conference currently being held in Paris. The article said: The Eastern European countries have often declared that they are willing to accept foreign loans, but they are unwilling to have Britain and France as brokers. Is it right for the British and French leaders to instruct the drafting of the European economic plan, or even draft it alone? Britain and France rely more on American financial assistance and less on their own economic plans in carrying out their reconstruction work. In the Eastern and Central European countries, they all base their plans on their own resources and are currently achieving undeniable success. Britain and France are far behind the Eastern European countries in this regard. Can they give the Eastern European countries lessons? In short, the Eastern European countries hope to negotiate directly with their lending countries, while Britain and France are attempting to monopolize the power to distribute American loans.

### Romania Arrests Opposition Party Members - British and American Protests Rejected

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 12th] Regarding the Romanian government's recent large-scale arrest of opposition party members, the British and American governments have issued notes to Romania expressing their protests. It is now learned that the Romanian government delivered replies to the British and American chargés d'affaires in Romania today, rejecting the British and American protests, calling them interference in Romania's internal affairs, and stating that there are no provisions in the peace treaty with Romania that allow signatory countries to interfere in Romania's internal affairs.

### American Experts Predict - Economic Decline in the United States Can Be Avoided

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Advisors to the US government and President Truman are no longer afraid of a decline in national business in mid-1947. Instead, they are studying whether the high level of the US economy will tend towards inflation. Most government economic experts had predicted that prices would fall slightly after July 1st, but now they mostly predict that prices will reach a high point again in August and September. According to a report from the Census Bureau, civilian employment in the United States reached 60 million in June, which is a peak in both peacetime and wartime. Therefore, there will be no immediate decline, and the income and purchasing power of this large group of employed people must be considered by President Truman in his mid-year report on the national economy. This report will be submitted to Congress next week. The President's Economic Advisory Council presented the President and the Cabinet with various facts on the prosperity issue yesterday. Based on various figures and forecasts, there are concerns that the nation's ability to resist the inflationary tide may weaken.

### Bevin Meets with Ramadier

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with French Prime Minister Ramadier at 6:30 this afternoon, talked for fifty minutes, and left at 7:20.

### Eva Perón to Visit England

[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th Broadcast: According to a member of the Argentine President's wife's entourage, Eva Perón has changed her itinerary and plans to visit London. She is expected to depart on Wednesday. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Rome said that the embassy had returned a document from the British Foreign Office to Eva Perón, welcoming her visit to Britain. At the same time, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: Princess Elizabeth had previously expressed her willingness to meet with Eva Perón.

### Soviet-Czech Trade Agreement Signed - Soviets to Export Wheat in Exchange for Industrial Products

[Reuters, Prague, 12th] Following the conclusion of a five-year trade agreement between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, Prague and Moscow simultaneously issued communiqués, stating that Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on "important issues of international politics." The communiqué did not detail the political issues discussed, but said that special attention was paid to economic issues, and it was decided to expand economic relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. According to the trade agreement signed between the two countries, the Soviet Union should supply Czechoslovakia with 200,000 tons each of wheat and feed, as well as wool, fertilizer, hemp, cotton, iron, magnesium, and chromium ore next year. Czechoslovakia will supply the Soviet Union with industrial products, including train locomotives and generators, the quantity of which will be determined annually. The Soviet Union can order the goods it needs for the entire term from Czechoslovakia. Observers expect that this trade agreement may immediately stimulate Czech industry and agriculture. However, it is difficult to say for the time being whether Czechoslovakia can completely avoid relying on Western countries as a result.

[United Press, London, 12th] Diplomatic circles here believe that if the British-Soviet commercial negotiations break down, the Soviet Union will export its abundant wheat harvest this year to its satellite countries. Although the Soviet satellite countries refused to attend the Paris Conference, they indicated that they hoped to obtain foreign loans.

### British and American Occupation Zones in Germany - Increase German Industrial Production

[United Press, Berlin, 13th] US Military Commander Clay and British Military Commander Robertson held a meeting here today to discuss a new level agreement for industrial production in the US and British occupation zones in Germany. The agreement will be signed and announced next Wednesday. It is reported that this new level will stipulate an annual steel production of about 12 million tons, which is approximately half of Germany's total pre-war output, more than double the 5.8 million tons last year.

[United Press, London, 12th] Authoritative government sources announced today: The US proposal to postpone the implementation of the British-proposed Ruhr coal mine nationalization plan for five years is causing divergent opinions among the authorities of the British and American occupation forces in Germany. Discussions on this matter have been ongoing for almost a year, and have now reached a deadlock. However, the two governments have agreed to continue seeking a compromise solution. Former US Secretary of State Byrnes expressed his opinion last summer that socialism could be implemented if the German people expressed their support.

### Former US Ambassador to the Philippines Declares - The United States Should Pay Attention to the Far East - The Marshall Plan Should Be Expanded to Asia

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Howard newspaper writer Edson, after interviewing former US Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt, said: McNutt very much wants a "Far East Marshall Plan," but "the biggest problem is where to start." McNutt suggested that a survey should be conducted before starting. How much assistance can the United States give to the war-torn areas? At the same time, attention should be paid to what the United States needs from various parts of the world. After the forms are collected, McNutt believes that this will show that what the United States needs most is raw materials, such as leather, fat, vegetable oil, tin, copper, lead, zinc, ramie, coconut, spices, medicines, and other items that cannot be adequately supplied in the United States. Europe cannot fully supply this, but Asia and the Pacific Islands can produce everything we need. McNutt believes that all the necessary factors for increasing trade are now available, which is why he said we should pay more attention to the East.

### France Celebrates National Day

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] Tomorrow is the French National Day. The entire city has begun to hang flags to celebrate, and citizens are preparing to hold street dances to celebrate wildly. Shelters are being built along the roadside, bands are playing songs, and the original cafes are expanding their sites, encroaching on the road surface, and arranging small tables and chairs, making it difficult for cars to drive through the crowds. The authorities have now specially permitted people to dance all night in public squares from tonight until Monday.

### Bevin to Broadcast Today

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] It was officially announced here today that tomorrow is the French Revolution Memorial Day.

### British Mediterranean Fleet to Visit the Black Sea

[United Press, London, 12th] The Naval Command announced today that the British Mediterranean Fleet is scheduled to depart from Malta on the 17th of this month, led by the 10,000-ton cruiser "Liverpool" of Commander-in-Chief Williams, for a summer cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, Aegean Sea, and Black Sea, lasting five weeks. The ships will visit various ports in Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Palestine, Turkey, and the Soviet Crimean port of Sevastopol.

### French Civil Servants' Demands Not Met - General Strike Difficult to Avoid

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The new proposals put forward by the Federation of French Civil Servants and the General Confederation of Labor delegation have been rejected by Prime Minister Ramadier. According to the representatives' talks with the press, the civil servants' demands require an expenditure of 280 billion francs, which is equal to half of the national budget. The government's plan can only pay 27 billion francs in cash. Prime Minister Ramadier stated that this number is the maximum amount the government can give, and urged civil servants not to make excessive demands that endanger the country. Therefore, today's meeting ended in failure. Although the civil servants' strike has been allowed to be postponed, hope that it can be avoided is dim.

### Egypt to Promulgate Compulsory Military Service Law

Will Increase the Army's Strength Tenfold

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 12th] It is learned that Egypt will promulgate a compulsory military service bill early next week, stipulating that the number of Egyptian army personnel will be increased from 25,000 to 250,000 in the next few years. Steps have now been taken to recruit 10,000 soldiers. Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy, taking advantage of his stay in the United States, will negotiate with the United States to purchase military equipment in accordance with the recommendations of the recent Egyptian military delegation to the United States. Nokrashy will also seek to obtain the cooperation of American military experts. To date, the Egyptian army has relied entirely on British experts and supplies.

British and Egyptian Accusations Continue

[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] British officials today accused Egypt of attempting to undermine legitimate treaties in order to gain complete control of Sudan, thereby responding to Egypt's request to the Security Council that British troops immediately and completely withdraw from Egypt and Sudan. The chief British representative, Jebb, is prepared to reply and will make a counterclaim, saying that this complaint has no legitimate basis and should be dismissed immediately. Egypt filed a complaint with the United Nations organization on Friday because it failed to amend the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. However, the Security Council has a backlog of cases such as the Balkan issue, the establishment of international security forces, disarmament issues, and the control of atomic energy, and it is expected that it will not be able to discuss it within one or two weeks. Egypt accused Britain of pursuing a policy aimed at separating Sudan from Egypt, making Egyptians not trusted by Sudanese, causing discord between the two parties, and hindering the unity of the Nile Valley. British officials refuted this, saying they would prove the true basis of the issue. British and Egyptian negotiations to amend the treaty were conducted last year, but ultimately broke down due to the future status of Sudan.

### Economic and Social Council - US Representative Changes

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] President Truman has withdrawn the appointment of former Roosevelt administration Attorney General Biddle as the US representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and has instead appointed Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp to serve concurrently in this position.

### Australian Representative Reserves Statement on Basic Post-War Policy Toward Japan - Britain and New Zealand Express Sympathy

[United Press, Washington, 12th] A spokesman for the Australian Embassy in the United States said on the 12th: Australian Ambassador to the Far Eastern Commission Makin issued a statement saying that Australia has reservations about the basic post-war policy toward Japan. Makin also said that when voting on the basic policy toward Japan, Australia voted in favor based on an understanding that this policy would be submitted for discussion without being bound during negotiations on the peace treaty with Japan. This reservation has been recorded in the proceedings of the Far Eastern Commission. Although the representatives of Britain and New Zealand did not adopt the same reservation, they sympathized with Australia's reservation. No representative in the Far Eastern Commission would oppose this reservation. US Representative McCoy believed that this reservation was unnecessary, believing that it was a matter of course, but Makin did not think it was a matter of course.

### Issue of Joint Security Force - India and the Netherlands Still Deadlocked - Britain Willing to Mediate

[Reuters, Batavia, 13th] Reliable sources say: Britain has proposed that the Netherlands assist in establishing a neutral committee to establish internal security in Indonesia and overcome the main obstacle to complete understanding between India and the Netherlands. The formation of this obstacle is due to the Indonesian Republic's rejection of the Dutch proposal to jointly form a security force with the Dutch to maintain law and order.

### Atomic Secret Document Theft - Two Main Culprits Arrested

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The US Department of Justice announced today: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has arrested two former Army sergeants who stole atomic information from the Los Alamos atomic bomb factory in New Mexico and filed a public prosecution.

He also revealed the details of the investigation, saying that Luft was assigned to the Lochton Engineer by the Army Department before he left the military on March 8, 1946. Willis was an Army Department photographer at the Los Alamos plant and obtained "more than 200 photos and negatives of the manufacturing process and explosion tests of various parts of the atomic bomb." The FBI has now returned the missing documents to the Atomic Energy Commission.

### US Plans Six-Year Plan to Store Military Raw Materials - Especially Need Middle Eastern Oil

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] US Under Secretary of the Army Royal announced today that the United States has drafted a six-year plan to store military raw materials that are difficult to obtain on the American continent but are necessary for the recurrence of war. The cost of implementing this plan is approximately $2.5 billion. The list of required raw materials, with detailed descriptions of the required quantities, was drafted this year. The list includes rare metals mainly found in the Soviet Union, Africa, China, and India. The quantity of oil that the United States should import from the Middle East should be increased in order to maintain the amount of oil stored in the United States. Once war breaks out again, it is estimated that the United States will need 8 million barrels of oil per day, while the United States' current oil production is only 5 million barrels, which is approximately 65% of the world's oil production.

[Report from this newspaper] The number of merchant ships seized by Japan during the War of Resistance against Japan was very large. As of now, only one, the Xing An Steamer, has been found and recovered by our delegation stationed in Japan.

In addition to insisting on requesting government subsidies for shipbuilding funds, allocating foreign exchange, demanding job security, resuming work, and opposing shift changes, the following resolutions were also made: (1) Requesting a quick resumption of work, (2) Requesting support from the public opinion, (3) Expanding publicity. According to employees, the shipyard has undertaken to repair two icebreakers (contracts are being signed), and eight Japanese ships have been received and will also be repaired. If foreign exchange is available, two giant ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can also be built. Therefore, all laid-off workers are now hoping that the government authorities will urgently provide assistance to maintain the livelihood of the workers.

### Tragedy Amid Housing Shortage - Landlord Killed with One Punch

[Report from this newspaper] Tenant Gu Guisheng, a native of Pudong, who lived in the back building of No. 14 Houde Lane, Tongbei Road, works at the Xin Xin Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Xuchang Road. Recently, the tenants asked the sub-landlord Lin Wenqing to build a wooden shed on the drying platform. Lin Wenqing strictly refused. Unexpectedly, Lin recently built two wooden sheds for his own use. The tenants jointly filed a complaint with the Yulin Road Police Station, accusing him of endangering public safety. The police station summoned Lin's wife to the case and set a deadline of four days to demolish the sheds. At around 6 pm the day before yesterday, Gu Guisheng returned home from the factory. Lin then summoned him for a conversation. Suddenly, a conflict arose, followed by violence. Lin was punched in a vital spot by Gu and died on the spot. Lin's wife reported to the police station and sent police to detain Gu for questioning. It is scheduled to be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office this morning for further investigation.

### Expansion of Cargo Depot and Warehouse Area, Enlargement of North Railway Station Passenger Terminal: Four Decisions Made by Zhabei West District Planning Committee

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Zhabei West District Planning Committee convened a meeting at the Bureau of Public Works conference room at 3 PM the day before yesterday. During the meeting, the scope of the Zhabei West District was defined as the area west of North Xizang Road, between the Suzhou River and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, covering approximately 140 hectares. The land use decisions were as follows: (1) Seven neighborhood units (residential types: 3,326 two-story houses, 1,112 four-story houses, and 44 detached houses); (2) Adding a Suzhou River wharf and cargo depot/warehouse area; (3) Expanding the passenger terminal of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway's North Station; (4) Establishing a Shanghai automobile repair plant for the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Considering that the Zhabei area is close to the city center and that most of the original buildings there were destroyed by gunfire, and that the current population is over 78,500, mostly living in shantytowns, a planned revival could help solve the urban housing shortage and traffic problems. Therefore, the Urban Planning Committee has designated Zhabei as a demonstration area, and all improvement plans should be implemented as soon as possible.

### "The Imposter" Dispute: Social Bureau to Mediate Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The film "The Imposter" has caused widespread public outrage among barbers in the city. So far, the labor union has not directly negotiated with the film company. However, to strengthen their position, the union has reached out to the barbers' guild and the Yangzhou Association for support. They held a meeting the day before yesterday at Huguo Temple on Puan Road and decided that the next step would be to demand a ban on the film's public screening. On the same day, the film company also approached the Social Bureau, claiming to be victims, and requesting assistance. It is learned that the Social Bureau has scheduled a meeting today to bring together the responsible parties from both sides for mediation.

[Another Report] The barber industry of the whole city continued to discuss countermeasures last night at the Barber's Guild. Over two hundred people attended, including Wang Zhenchuan, chairman of the Barber's Guild, Gao Deyu of the labor union, and the heads of various groups. Jiao Dingkai, chairman of the Yangzhou seven-county association in Shanghai, was invited to provide guidance. Chairman Jiao expressed his opinion on the insulting aspects of the "The Imposter" film and gave several instructions to ensure that actions are reasonable and legal: (1) Abide by the law and maintain order; (2) Negotiate with the Wen Hua Film Company. Remain calm before a resolution, and do not be exploited or exceed the boundaries; (3) Before the film is revised, request various authorities to order Wen Hua Company to temporarily suspend screenings; (4) Send a letter to director Huang Zuolin questioning the basis of his portrayals, pointing out that he should not arbitrarily create and deliberately insult the profession; (5) The scene of "suicide by razor in pursuit of marriage" not only defames barbers but also affects social security. Depictions of barbers with hands pressed on the shoulders of female customers and various other unsightly poses affect public morals, leaving the audience with an unbelievable impression. Furthermore, the same trade in Nanjing and Hankou are sending inquiries and telegrams should be sent in return.

### Application for Exemption or Deferment from Military Service Must Be Completed by the 25th of This Month: Commander to Hold Reception for Various Sectors to Explain Situation, No Decision Yet on Whether Additional Conscription Will Occur During General Mobilization

[Our Newspaper's Report] Gao Baoshu, spokesperson for the Shanghai Garrison Command, told our reporter that the conscription quota for the Garrison Command this year has been formally ordered by the National Government to implement a voluntary military service system. If there are not enough volunteers, the shortfall will be supplemented through conscription. The conscription quota for this year is set at 3,000 people for Shanghai City, and the conscription quota for the Shanghai Regiment Command under the Garrison Command is 200. The conscription age is for men born from 1923 to 1927 (years 12 to 16 of the Republic). Conscription will begin on the first of next month. Applications for exemption or deferment from military service and the review process have already begun, and the residents are being urged by the baojia system to complete the application process. This work must be completed by the 25th of this month and will end at the latest by the end of this month. Gao concluded: According to the investigation by the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, there are approximately 460,000 able-bodied men born between 1923 and 1927 in Shanghai. Considering that Shanghai is a commercial and industrial area, the government has only allocated a quota of 3,000, which is very few compared to other places. The settlement allowance for conscripted men going to war in the future has been set by the Municipal Military Service Association at 4 million yuan per person, which is also higher than in other places. The conscription work in this city is expected to proceed smoothly. Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Garrison Command, is scheduled to host the press on the 16th and representatives from various sectors on the 17th, and issue a proclamation to explain the situation.

[Another Report] The conscription quota for the Garrison Command this year has been allocated by order. As for whether additional conscription will occur during this period of general mobilization, there is currently no decision.

### "Mansion" Visit to "Female Judge": Husband is a Young Import-Export Merchant, Matchmaking Caused Unexpected Storm, She Declares She Never Said She Was a "Judge"

[Our Newspaper's Report] At No. 282 Jianli, Jinling East Road, Fujian South Road, there is a mailbox with "Zhu Piye" written on one side and "Huang Fangbai" on the other. Ascending to the third floor, one finds the Min residence of Zhu Huang Fangbai (pictured), the protagonist of the sensational imposter female judge case. In order to investigate the truth of the case, our reporter paid a visit yesterday in the rain.

Walking out to greet us was Huang's husband, Zhu Piye, dressed in a tunic suit and trousers, looking very capable. After inviting us to sit down, Huang Fangbai (reported as Huo Fenbai, actually a mistake) also came out, without makeup, with a furrowed brow, wearing a red and blue patterned silk cheongsam and a pair of blue slippers embroidered with silver flowers. After the reporter explained the purpose of the visit, they told the story from beginning to end:

Zhu Piye is from Fujian and is 29 years old this year. He studied at the Guizhou Daxia University Political Science Department for three years. Huang Fangbai is from Haimen, Jiangsu, and is 25 years old this year. She graduated from the junior high school department of Nanjing Oriental Middle School. In 1940, because Zhu's father died in Shanghai, Zhu rushed from Guiyang to Shanghai to attend the funeral. His father was in the import-export business. Being the eldest son, Zhu inherited his father's business, traveling between Shanghai and Xiamen, buying and selling Chinese and foreign goods for customers. Zhu and Huang married in 1941 and now have three children.

A month ago, He Zhen, a Suzhou native, married a woman introduced by Huang. To thank Huang for the matchmaking, He invited Huang to Qingmeiju for dinner on the 28th of last month. After dinner, He invited Huang to Venus Dance Hall on Madang Road to listen to music. Because He and his wife had other business to attend to, Huang waited alone at Venus, sipping tea. He was mistaken by four dancers at a nearby table, Zhou Jiahua and others, for a dance hostess. They wrote a note requesting a dance. When He Zhen arrived, he questioned Zhou and the others, stating that they should not harass respectable women, which led to a conflict. The Songshan Police Station took them to the station for questioning and reprimanded Zhou and the others, ordering them to sign a bond.

The matter would have been over, but the next day a newspaper published a story that Huang was a female judge, causing a great uproar. According to Huang, she never said she was a "judge" at the police station, which can be checked in the police record. She asked lawyer Li Pu to publish a statement in the newspaper and telegraphed her husband, Zhu Piye, in Xiamen, asking him to return to Shanghai. On the 8th of this month, she suddenly received a summons from the District Procuratorate. She was questioned at the Procuratorate the day before yesterday. To this day, she does not understand why the title of female judge was placed on her head. She said, "I don't know Huang Liang at all. I know Huang Meiping, the female prosecutor at the District Procuratorate, but I have never used her name to boast."

Zhu Piye added a few sentences from the side: "There must be evidence to prove a crime. Where did she say she was a female judge? Who was harmed? Is there an accuser? You can't arbitrarily wrong someone! This matter has had a great impact on my spirit and career. My mother is troubled by this matter and has moved out. We hope that the media will provide fair coverage so that the case can be clarified as soon as possible. For example, some newspapers said that I had served in the military, but in fact, I have been in business since returning to Shanghai from Guiyang and have never served in the military." As for a Xia surname person secretly reporting to the District Procuratorate, he said that he had heard of it, but did not know the person.

### More Than 600 German and Austrian Refugees to Be Repatriated This Month

The refugee repatriation work, after the formal appointment of Wang Renlin, the former director of the Fisheries Management Office of the Executive Yuan, by relevant authorities, has now formally established the United Nations International Refugee Organization to actively carry out the work. There are a large number of European refugees in China. When the "Marnix" ship sails from Shanghai on the 25th of this month, 650 German and Austrian refugees will be repatriated. These refugees reside in Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Shantou and other places in China and have come to Shanghai from different routes. In addition to providing travel assistance to the repatriated refugees, the International Refugee Organization also dispatches nurses and doctors to take care of them on board. The refugees' return to their home countries also requires the permission of the respective governments.

### American Starlet Returns Alive, Anonymous Letter Missing

[Our Newspaper's Report] It has now been proven that the widely rumored suicide in Suzhou of the "American Starlet" Huada was a prank. Our reporter met Huada herself at her residence yesterday and couldn't help but laugh when discussing the past. According to Huada, she returned to Shanghai from Qingdao about two weeks ago. She went to Suzhou this time because she was invited to perform, but due to various reasons, she could not agree. Perhaps someone misunderstood this and played this "joke." As for the anonymous letter sent to Xin Liqin, it has disappeared after being passed around for viewing by many people. Huada said about this: She has been to Xin Liqin twice, hoping to get the original letter so that the handwriting can be verified and the truth can be revealed.

### Yu Shuping's Broadcast: Economic Police Must Possess Profound Knowledge and Integrity to Work Diligently and Maximize Effectiveness

[Our Newspaper's Report] Our newspaper held its fifteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at New Shanghai Radio Station. We invited Yu Shuping, the acting director of the Municipal Police Bureau, to broadcast on "Economic Police." Here is a transcript of his speech:

Economic police are a coercive power that assists the government in implementing national economic policies and preventing general economic crimes. Economic crimes refer to acts that violate relevant economic control laws and regulations by economic means. Because economic crimes have a criminal nature, they fall under the scope of criminal police, which is fundamentally different from business police, who are specifically responsible for suppressing prohibited activities. The first countries to establish economic police were the German-Austrian alliance during the late World War I. Because German-Austrian ports were blockaded by the Allied fleet, the source of materials was cut off, and the original materials in the country were not enough to be distributed. Jewish merchants, who were accustomed to speculation, took the opportunity to hoard and manipulate, resulting in extreme economic panic. In order to resolve this crisis, the German-Austrian governments established economic police in 1917, specializing in the prevention of economic crimes. Although they were unable to save the economic collapse due to the short time of establishment, the importance of economic police - especially during wartime - cannot be ignored.

Weak Concept of National Economy and People's Livelihood

Our Republic of China is a completely free economic country. In order to win the War of Resistance, the government promulgated the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during the Emergency Period in October 1938. The purpose was to control the wartime economy. To implement this plan, the government successively established many institutions, such as the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Materials Bureau, the National General Mobilization Committee, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Bureau, the Ministry of Food, and the price control bureaus, grain transportation bureaus, and production bureaus in various provinces. However, although the government established many of the above-mentioned institutions and was determined to implement economic controls, prices continued to rise. There are many reasons for the rise in prices, but one of the main reasons is that the Chinese people have always been accustomed to living in a free economic society. All production is centered on individual will and aims to make money, and the concept of national economy and people's livelihood is very weak. Currently, in terms of production, except for military factories and yarn factories, other production enterprises cannot be strictly controlled during wartime. Wealthy people can find ways to buy any expensive item, while poor people have difficulty even eating white rice. This situation of unplanned production and uneven distribution still exists today, even after the victory!

Controlling Prices is Essential

As for wartime consumption, all unnecessary waste should be avoided, and everyone should be able to save everything except for the necessities of life so that supply and demand can be balanced. We must consider the war situation and practice strict frugality, but in our country, under a free economic system, the necessary items for the general poverty class cannot be obtained, and at the same time, there are no accurate statistics on the quantity of existing items to use as a basis. It is really a very difficult task to strictly manage during wartime. Because the management of materials is difficult, we have to manage prices. This is a passive method and a last resort. In a planned economy, there is no need to control prices at all, but in a free economy, managing prices is more important because prices are the pivot of production, distribution, and consumption. The rise and fall of prices can stimulate production, regulate distribution, and stretch consumption. In other words, if prices can be controlled, production, distribution, and consumption can be controlled. Therefore, in a free economy, controlling prices is essential.

Analysis of Economic Crimes

The determination of economic crimes, in addition to those clearly stipulated in ordinary criminal law, must also be based on whether they violate relevant economic, financial, and other control laws and regulations. Many were promulgated during the War of Resistance.

Acts that violate the above-mentioned laws and regulations are either violations of administrative orders or violations of special criminal control laws and regulations. Acts that violate administrative orders are handled by administrative agencies; acts that violate special criminal control laws and regulations are tried by judicial or military judicial agencies. Those who violate Articles 17 and 18 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities or Article 16 of the National General Mobilization Law were originally handled by military judicial agencies, but are now under the jurisdiction of ordinary judicial agencies.

As for acts that violate controls, they include (1) hoarding and speculation, (2) failure to operate in accordance with regulations, (3) speculation and manipulation, (4) evading controls, (5) improper gains, (6) raising prices, wages, or rents, (7) issuing post-dated checks to inflate credit, (8) counterfeiting and adulteration, (9) changing weights and measures, (10) secret competition, (11) tax evasion, (12) clandestine transportation of materials, etc. Regarding the standards for punishing criminal acts, in addition to handling them in accordance with the provisions of the laws and regulations mentioned in the previous section, the local government may also dispose of them according to the actual situation of the event, time, and place. It is precisely because most of the above-mentioned laws and regulations are time-sensitive that many economic acts that were considered illegal and criminal during wartime are irrelevant in peacetime. Since the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures Plan, many wartime economic, financial, and other control laws and regulations have now been strengthened.

Basic Work of Economic Police

Enforcing control laws and preventing acts that violate control laws and regulations is the main task of economic police. However, although criminal acts such as profiteering, fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust, and malicious bankruptcy have clear provisions in ordinary criminal law, preventing and investigating these criminal acts, because they are carried out by economic means, is also the task of economic police. However, if economic police personnel want to accomplish this task, they must complete the following basic work of economic police: 1. Household registration and statistics. 2. Registration of population and cargo movement. 3. Resource investigation and statistics. 4. Audit of store accounts. 5. Strengthening the organization of labor unions or guilds. 6. Supervision and management of markets, factories, farms, warehouses, companies, money shops, etc.

After completing the above basic work, the economic police can then promote the government's economic control decisions based on joint authority and safeguard the authority of the government's economic control laws and regulations.

Organization and Training of Economic Police

The scope of economic crimes is very wide and the impact is very large. Police personnel responsible for this task must have a higher level of knowledge. In addition to studying law and economics in depth and being familiar with economic geography, they also need to understand common commercial customs and the psychology and behavior of merchants. Therefore, an economic police officer cannot be competent with just a graduation from an ordinary police academy and requires the selection of graduates from agricultural, industrial, commercial, accounting, taxation, economics, and other specialized schools, plus training in investigation techniques, to be competent. If you want to select economic police from the existing police cadre, it is not easy.

In short, economic police are modern police, who need to have profound knowledge, integrity, and capable talents. The task is heavy, and the responsibility is arduous. Whether the national economic order can be stable and whether the government's control laws and regulations can be implemented is greatly related to the good or bad performance of the economic police. In the current stage of severe economic crisis and drastic price fluctuations, economic police should maximize their effectiveness, supervise society to thoroughly implement the emergency economic measures plan, and prevent the occurrence of economic crimes by the people. Only by working hard can they achieve success.

Regarding the proposal to establish an additional branch between the Xujiahui Branch and the Sinan Road Branch due to the long distance, this Bureau has long been aware of it.

The following three locations have already been opened in the area: Yongtai, 741 Yongjia Road; Jufu, 250 Dihua South Road; Shanghai Youth Center, 454 Huashan Road. All these locations receive and send mail, resembling a small branch, and can be used nearby. In addition, there are six agency offices still in the planning stages in the area. Once the procedures are complete, they can be opened. There are also three postal kiosks, which can be planned once the approval of the Municipal Government is obtained. In the future, when all these institutions are fully established, it will greatly facilitate the public's delivery of letters.

### Ye Guanxiong Played Despite Illness, but Lost to Tao Guanqiu: Hong Kong Tennis Charity Match, Two Heroes from North and South Meet

[Reported by this newspaper, Hong Kong] The last game of the Hong Kong Disaster Relief Tennis Charity Tournament, on the 7th, because of Ye Guanxiong's playing despite illness, the battle of the four heroes was held at the Chinese Recreation Club.

First, Xu Weipei and Wang Wenzheng played against each other. "Big Xu" performed excellently, with long shots and short interceptions, making Wang Wenzheng unable to parry. In the first set, Wenzheng lost two games, barely struggling to tie it at 2-2, and was then taken down by "Big Xu" for four games, losing the first set 2-6. At the beginning of the second set, when "Big Xu" led 3-1, Wenhua took a short rest and was in excellent spirits, taking back two games to make it 3-3. However, he lacked stamina and was taken again by "Big Xu" for three games, ending the game 6-3, with Weipei winning two sets. During this game, Wenzheng did his best and struggled in the last game, which was commendable.

The final match was "Little Ye" playing with illness against Tao Guanqiu. Indeed, in these two sets of battle, except for the first three games, "Little Ye" was able to control the battle, and Guanqiu had the upper hand. We can see that Guanqiu's baseline long shots are not easy to overcome, and his ball-out skills are also extremely cunning. If "Little Ye" was as spirited as before, it would be a spectacle to play against each other. In fact, "Little Ye" lost his composure due to lack of energy. His "housekeeping" skills, volleying and intercepting, were self-defeating, with as many as eight shots into the net, and five "dead balls" were served. As a result, Guanqiu lost two sets in a row, the results being 6-3 and 6-2. As for serving "ace" balls, Ye and Xu each hit five, and Tao and Wang each hit two.

Wang and Tao will leave for Shanghai in a few days. In terms of the results, Tao Guanqiu defeated Jiang Daozhang, Xu Weipei, and Ye Guanxiong in singles, which was a great harvest.

Ye Guanxiong will go to the United States in the short term, sent by the foreign company he serves. With his skills, he will definitely have unlimited achievements in the future after training in the United States.

According to the plan, Japan wants to obtain a trade surplus of more than 51.6 million US dollars from China in the three and a half months from August 15, when it resumes foreign trade, to the end of the year, which deserves our attention. Although judging from the high-quality goods that Japan plans to export to China, certain categories of goods will be difficult for our government to approve for import, and whether our country can supply the goods it plans to purchase from us, such as coal and soybeans, will depend on the situation at that time. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the extent to which this plan can be realized. However, we should be warned that although Japan was defeated, its industrial production capacity is still considerable. If it dumps a large number of cheap goods to our country, it will become a fatal blow to our national industry, and our government must devise countermeasures.

### Profit Tax Inspection Begins; Schedule for Hardware and Other Industries Has Been Set

The auditing and taxation work of the income tax for the first category of profit-making enterprises in this city in the 36th year was once slowed down due to issues such as the burden on industry and commerce and the discipline of auditing. Later, representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce went to Beijing and earnestly suggested a simplified standard method to the central government. Mr. Xu Baiyuan, the Director of Finance, and Mr. Wang Fuzhou, the Director of the Direct Taxation Department, repeatedly came to Shanghai to investigate the truth and decided to change to a sampling inspection system. At the end of last week, the account books of 133 households in the hardware, import and export, woolen cloth, paper, and paint industries were inspected, and it is expected to be completed this week. Then, other industries will be sampled and inspected one after another.

It is reported that there are more than 2,000 tax-reporting units in these five industries. About 500 households have already been audited, so this time only those with annual turnover of more than 400 million are sampled, as mentioned above. The secondary audit standard profit rate will be used as the tax standard for the entire industry. Compared with the previous method, about 1,000 households are exempted from inspection. If the work goes smoothly, other industries will be inspected. Officials have stated that it must be completed within two or three months.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has requested the authorities: (1) to value the habits of the business community when handling old accounts and allowing write-offs, and to be as lenient as possible. (2) The profit tax on deposit (i.e., interbank lending) interest should be borne by the borrower. (3) When inspecting account books, please allow representatives from the relevant trade associations and the Chamber of Commerce to participate in the inspection. The authorities have expressed their acceptance. At the end of last week, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce also made the above requests to the tax bureau, and requested that when the results of the previous audit are adopted as the tax standard for each industry, a public announcement should be made and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce should be given the opportunity to review it. In recent days, various industry associations have attached great importance to the tax bureau's reopening of the auditing work. However, whether the sentiment can be stabilized depends on the results of the five industry audits. According to qualified observers, the sampling inspection of the five industries should be free of friction. Especially for the woolen cloth and paint industries, more than 260 households have been inspected, and only about 20 households remain to be inspected, so there should be no problems. However, it is necessary for both officials and businesses to be calm and rational in their judgment. Related parties revealed that the scheduled dates for submitting account books for inspection within this week for the five industries are: woolen cloth on Monday, hardware on Tuesday, paper on Wednesday, import and export on Thursday, and paint on Friday. The bureau is also supplementing personnel and responding seriously.

### China Farmers Bank Improves Cocoon Goods; Begins Dry Cocoon Pledge Loan

The cocoon loan procedures implemented by the China Farmers Bank, according to the contract signed with the silk merchants in the past, only had one provision: the amount of the loan applied for and the method of repayment at the end, either by paying money or paying silk, was at the borrower's convenience. This year, the China Farmers Bank, in view of the fact that the fresh cocoon loan center is concentrated in Shanghai, while the factories are in the Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, and it is quite difficult for the Shanghai office to manage during the dry cocoon period, has changed the procedure to be handled by the local branches. Therefore, this year's Farmers Bank cocoon loan stipulates that the fresh cocoon part is still in Shanghai, while the dry cocoon pledge is handled by the branches.

It is also learned that, in order to help factories start work as soon as possible, before the fresh cocoon accounts are completely closed, the dry cocoons that have been put into storage can be contracted with the local Farmers Bank branches to start work first. As of now, it has already started to be handled, and the total amount is still allocated from the total loan amount of 270 billion yuan.

### Export Promotion Association to Purchase Raw Silk in Sichuan and Guangdong Provinces

Regarding the purchase and sale of spring and autumn raw silk in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this year, the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economics is actively promoting it. According to the output of raw silk in Sichuan and Guangdong, the number is also not small. It is learned that the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Commission has noticed this and decided in the program for foreign sales of raw silk discussed at the 15th meeting of the association that the purchase and promotion of raw silk in the Sichuan and Guangdong regions should be handled in accordance with the Shanghai raw silk method. Ge Jingzhong and Chen Xianzhang are requested to prepare a detailed plan and submit it to the association's "Silk and Silk Products Subgroup" for approval, and then submit it to the Executive Committee for discussion. It is also learned that this notice was sent separately at the end of last week, and the preliminary plan is expected to be completed within this week.

### Statistics of Financial Institutions in Provinces and Cities Across the Country

[Our Report] According to the statistics released by the Audit Office of the Central Bank: As of May 31 this year, there are a total of 5,141 financial institutions in provinces and cities across the country, including 2,100 head offices and 3,041 branches.

### Cigarette Market Declines

Yesterday's cigarette market situation: The market opened weakly. It was heard that Wing Tai Wo still had a large number of shipments before the tax increase, and foreign counterparts also distributed goods. The market's sentiment suddenly became weak, and buyers waited and watched. In addition, the money market was tight, and selling occurred frequently. Finally, in a tentative selling situation, 10-cigarette packs of British American Tobacco (BAT) fell by more than 100,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to more than 8.8 million yuan. Old Knife also fell by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, to 7.75 million yuan. Transactions in the market were very rare.

The prices of other Chinese cigarettes also fell, and American carton cigarettes and 50-cigarette packs were also sluggish. After the close, it was heard that BAT cigarettes were quoted at 8.85 million yuan, but there were few buyers. 20-cigarette packs were sold at 40,500 yuan per pack, Beautiful cigarettes at 52,600 yuan, Brandy cigarettes at 34,000 yuan, Double Axe cigarettes at 26,700 yuan, and Old Knife cigarettes at 7.75 million yuan per carton. There were only sellers and no buyers.

### Affected by Lack of Raw Materials, the Rubber Industry Faces Crisis; Some Factories in the City Have Partially Suspended Work

[Our Report] According to the person in charge of the Rubber Industry Association, the rubber industry is now facing difficulties due to a lack of raw materials. From February to April this year, the rubber import quota was 560,000 US dollars, which could import about 1,000 tons of raw rubber. However, the actual need in Shanghai is about 2,000 tons per month. The usual shortfall is supplemented by entrepot trade between Hong Kong and South China. However, since July, this type of entrepot trade has also been prohibited, so the rubber industry is facing a crisis of insufficient raw materials. Some factories in the city have partially suspended work. It is hoped that the relevant authorities can pay attention to this.

At the same time, in the past six months, the price of raw materials used by the rubber industry has increased by more than five times, but the price of finished products has only increased by about one time, which is disproportionate. Moreover, due to the expansion of the civil war, the sales markets in Northeast and North China have shrunk, and the purchasing power of rural areas has declined. All these factors make it difficult for the rubber industry to maintain its operations. The previous rumor that Dunlop tires planned to dump products in China would not become a reality due to foreign exchange and import controls. In fact, China can already supply bicycles and tricycle tires. Large and medium-sized rubber factories can also manufacture car tires. At the same time, Shenyang, Qingdao, and Taiwan have received large-scale car tire factories, but unfortunately, due to various reasons, they are currently in a state of semi-shutdown. If they can all start work in the future, car tires can also be self-sufficient, and there is no need to rely on foreign goods.

### Tianjin Carpet Industry's Foreign Sales Gradually Improve

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] The carpet industry in Tianjin, which is on the verge of extinction, has now gained a glimmer of life due to the gradual improvement of foreign sales. Some foreign and Chinese merchants in Tianjin are exporting carpets in large quantities. During its heyday, there were 200 to 300 carpet factories in Tianjin. During World War II, they withered away one after another. Today, there are only 8,000 factories left. The main raw material is wool from the Northwest, so the cost is too high, which has become the biggest obstacle to promoting sales. In addition, Japan once sent female workers to China to learn carpet weaving techniques. Currently, carpets made in Japan are being shipped to the US market, and Turkey and Vietnam also produce carpets, forming a competitive situation overseas. All of this should be a concern for our carpet industry, and efforts need to be made to overcome it.

### Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Hosts Banquet for Textile Adjustment Committee Members

[Our Report] Minister Chen Qitian of the Ministry of Economic Affairs hosted a banquet for the members of the Textile Adjustment Committee at around 7:00 PM last night. Mayor Wu was also invited to attend. Minister Chen talked about the government's promulgation of the mobilization order and the need for the yarn and cloth adjustment policies to be effectively coordinated. He then exchanged ideas with the attending members and the meeting was adjourned. Chen left for Beijing on the night train yesterday.

### Soap Prices Show Slight Decline

Yesterday's prices of daily necessities on the market showed a decline. Few people in the industry arrived due to the rain, and transactions were also light. The opening prices showed a slight decline. Huang Xiangmao soap fell by 2,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 338,000 yuan. The market was even weaker after the close. It was heard that a large household offered 333,000 yuan, with a large amount of selling, but there were few buyers. In addition, Gu Ben, Jian Dao, Li Niu, and other brands of soap also fell by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. The match market was also sluggish, but candles showed strength.

Raw Materials for Soap and Candles, Caustic Soda Step Up

Yesterday, the market for caustic soda, the raw material for soap and candles, was stable because the digestion of goods from all parties was very smooth, and the current inventory in the market was not sufficient. Yue Pai caustic soda rose to 13.5 million per barrel, continuing to rise by 50,000 yuan compared with the previous day. US caustic soda also rose by 400,000 yuan, to 13.2 million yuan. US-made Siling's multiple sales, with each dan rapidly declining by 1 million yuan, to 5 million yuan. N rosin was 750,000 per can, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. Highly refined paraffin wax also fell by 150,000 yuan per dan, to 1.65 million yuan, but coconut oil was still 1.9 million yuan.

### Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Investigates the Overview of the Cosmetics Industry; Proposes Five Points That Should Be Improved

[Our Report] According to statistics from the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are a total of 129 members of the Cosmetics Industry Association in the city. The production equipment and technical level vary greatly among the companies, and the range of products is even more scattered. After investigation by the Guidance Office, it is believed that the following points need to be improved:

(1) The products of the cosmetics industry are mainly daily necessities such as toothpaste, soap, mosquito coils, cologne, talcum powder, and skin moisturizers. Other products such as face powder, rouge, lipstick, and eyebrow pencils have a narrower range of production and sales. Therefore, cosmetics are not purely a luxury goods industry. It seems that the name should be changed to daily cosmetics industry to avoid misunderstanding by the general public.

(2) Many types of face powder are made with lead powder (lead carbonate) as the raw material. Lead agents are harmful to the skin, and the health authorities should inspect and ban them. The factories in this industry should especially cherish themselves and refrain from using this raw material, and replace it with zinc white, titanium white, and zinc fatty acid.

(3) Toothpaste metal tubes contain a variety of metals such as tin, zinc, and lead. Among them, green lead is soft and cheap. Manufacturers use green lead to greedily seek high profits, making the manufacturing of soft tubes substandard. Toothpaste adhering to lead is harmful to health. The health authorities should follow the example of food and drug examples, to chemically test it. Those that do not meet health standards should be prohibited, and those that meet the standards should be given a certificate, so that purchasers have a choice.

(4) Stearic acid produced by Sino-French Grease Factory and glycerin produced by Wuzhou Joint Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, and Daxin Chemical Factory can all meet the standards and can be used to promote domestic products.

(5) The soap manufacturing equipment left by the enemy and puppet Five Star Soap Factory and Mei Hua Soap Factory is very complete. The Five Star Soap Factory has two sets of fully continuous automatic equipment for cutting, drying, harmonizing, grinding, rolling, and printing soap bases. Mei Hua has one set of this type of equipment and two 125-ton soap pots, with a potentially large output. Unfortunately, there is no glycerin by-product equipment. As the business of taking over the business has not been promoted for a long time, the receivers are working hard to promote mass production.

### General Meeting of Bank Members; Sets Date for Proposals

[Our Report] The 14th General Meeting of Members of the Shanghai Bank Commercial Association has been scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

It is reported that in addition to reporting on the association's work over the past year, the meeting will discuss the revision of the association's regulations, special business tax, and profit tax.

In addition, the Association's Regulations Revision Subcommittee held a meeting at 4:00 PM the other day. Regarding the draft regulations proposed by the Bank Association, it was generally advocated that a chapter on endorsement should be added, so it has been submitted to the Bank Association for further revision.

### Sulfur Allocation; Principles Determined by the Export Control Committee

[Our Report] The Export Control Committee's quota for the second quarter (May to July) of input limit, the allocation of the sulfur item, there are disputes. The industrial sector argued for more raw materials to meet industrial needs. The business community argues for more finished goods to meet general requirements of different views, opinions are also different. After the allocation office convened a discussion committee, both sides expressed their views, which were reasonable. Finally, a fair decision was made: 55% of the quota was allocated to raw materials and 45% was allocated to finished products, which was handled separately by industrial users and importers.

### Fuxin and Five Other Flour Mills To Fully Produce for the Government Authorities Stipulate Individual Applications for Wheat Purchases

The Ministry of Food has allocated 300 billion yuan to entrust five major flour mills, including Fuxin and Fufeng, to grind flour. According to relevant sources, this substitute grinding method entails the joint handling of all procedures, from purchasing wheat to grinding it into flour, by the five mills. The Ministry of Food only purchases all the finished products at the production cost plus legitimate profit to meet the needs of public consumption. The participating mills will focus on production for the government and will no longer purchase wheat for their own grinding purposes. However, the authorities are still willing to assist in the application for wheat loans from the Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, and it has been stipulated that each flour mill can individually apply to the Joint Treasury.

### The Graves of Thirty Thousand Communist Soldiers: A Record of Cremating Corpses in Siping

— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao, Shenyang Air Report

Suddenly, an odor of burning and decay invaded my nostrils. Looking down, Siping was spread out beneath the aircraft's wings.

Flying low, alongside the railway line, countless piles of soybeans were burning, wisps of green smoke rising. The lower we descended, the more intense the smoke became.

We landed at the airport in the western suburbs of Siping. Many buildings and facilities were severely damaged during the two occupations by the Communist forces. Besides that, several wrecked aircraft lay there. What remained intact were the runway and an aircraft hangar.

The Tiexi Area

Heading towards the city, we passed through earthen walls riddled with fortifications. On Zhongshan West Road, the orderly rows of houses were pockmarked with holes from artillery shells and bombs. This was a section of the famous Tiexi district battlefield, where the Nationalists initially held their ground, facing the Communist artillery barrage, and later, after the Communist forces invaded, it was bombed by the Air Force.

The Electricity Bureau in Ashes

A company of Nationalist soldiers in the Electricity Bureau were completely wiped out after the Communist forces set fire to the building from below and threw yellow explosives. The Communist forces first seized the lower floors, and the Nationalist soldiers gradually retreated to the upper floors, the second and third floors, putting up resistance step by step. Injured and killed, they ultimately perished in the flames!

In front of the Electricity Bureau lay countless corpses of Communist soldiers that could not be moved, and dead warhorses. Some were reddish-brown and swollen, others were crushed, leaving only empty black shells, lying crisscrossed in pools of blood and melted fat, swarming with green-headed flies.

White Bones in the Square

Turning south from here, we detoured towards the southwest corner, which was the Siping Square. The Provincial Government, the Municipal Government, and the Qiqihar Railway Bureau were all located there. This area was even more tragic. At the foot of the steps in front of the Municipal Government, there was a pile of corpses, one or two lying on their backs, exposing white ribs.

In the northeast corner of the square was the core Nationalist stronghold, a school that General Chen Mingren and his troops planned to defend to the death. The surrounding fortifications were constructed very firmly and meticulously.

Yellow Explosives

The Communist forces relied entirely on the explosive power of yellow explosives to capture this position. Most of the explosives were delivered to the openings of the bunkers. In front of the bunkers, we saw the remains of Communist soldiers, some covered in dog skin, others wrapped in cotton quilts. This was to facilitate rolling towards the bunkers. There were still remnants of rectangular yellow explosive packages with a hand grenade tied to the top and attached to a wooden stick, left there.

The surroundings of the square were filled with broken walls and ruins, a scene of desolation. Only rows of trees, lush and verdant, displayed signs of life in the setting sun. Apart from that, everything was deathly still.

Soybeans Burning

The overpass was the connecting point between Tiexi and Tiedong. On the raised bridge, defensive works were built using sacks of soybeans. Piles of soybeans were burning south of the bridge, the smoke stinging everyone's eyes and mouths. Gunshots crackled overhead, accompanied by rumbling explosions. Smoke, fire, and gunfire merged into one, creating an extremely tense scene.

East of the railway, warehouses were piled with soybeans and miscellaneous grains, estimated to be over 100,000 tons. These golden northeastern products, rich in oil and with large grains, were left to burn,无人施救。During my two days in Siping, I felt pained by this.

A Glimpse of Tiedong

Crossing the overpass and stepping onto Zhongshan East Road, the ground was scattered with soybeans. All defensive works were also built using sacks of soybeans. Besides that, there were obstacles made of tables, chairs, beds, benches, and other furniture. These were obstacles that the Nationalist army set up when they retreated to the Tiedong area, fearing that the Communist army would rush across the overpass.

In the Tiedong area, every street and every building was surrounded by pits and wooden stakes; barbed wire and wooden fences were everywhere. It was as if I had seen the "plum blossom pile," "tripping rope," and "entrances," from novels. This told people that the Nationalist army was "advancing step by step, building defenses in every house," determined to fight to the death here.

Newspapers had reported that the Communist forces broke into Siping's Tiedong district from the southern suburbs, reaching the water source and the Catholic Church. Indeed, the last Nationalist stronghold in Siping, the site of the fierce fighting to the death in Tiedong, was in this area.

When this reporter walked into South First, Second, and Third Latitude Roads and South First, Second, Third, and Fourth Main Roads, what I saw were bullets, hand grenades, yellow explosive packages, cotton, clothes, shoes, corpses, and destruction!

A street called "Chongqing Street" was the site of even more unprecedentedly fierce combat. Nationalist and Communist forces were separated by a single wall, throwing hand grenades at each other. The Communist forces dug tunnels to bomb the Nationalist forces, and the Nationalist forces defended to the death.

When a workshop or house collapsed, it was immediately repaired, sometimes even incorporating corpses. In front of the bunkers were corpses, and corpses in the corners of walls and in front of doors. Both sides were red-eyed at the time.

### An Old Woman Tragically Shot, Fell into a Cellar But Miraculously Survived

An old woman, with white cloth stained with blood wrapped around her front and back, squatted in a pile of tiles. I asked her, "What happened?" She said, "One night, the Nationalist and Communist forces were fighting fiercely. We lay prostrate on the ground. Later, the Nationalist forces retreated from our courtyard, but the Communist forces were still firing guns and throwing hand grenades. I and another old woman crawled out, shouting, 'These are all civilians, don't shoot!' Before we could finish speaking, a shot rang out, hitting me in the chest, followed by another shot in the back. I stumbled into the cellar and lost consciousness. I can't believe I'm still alive now!"

Crawling Out of the Cellar

The Tiexi district of Siping has been reduced to a rubble field. The southern corner of the Tiedong district is in a similar situation. The northern and eastern parts are mostly able to maintain their original state. At the same time, there are more residents here, but many houses have been hit by Communist artillery fire.

These people crawled out of their cellars and began to work to survive. The refugees also returned from all directions, supporting the old and leading the young. Many were homeless, and their means of livelihood were gone. Their faces were filled with sorrow, and they were extremely miserable!

A Hand Reaching Out for Help

The Northeast Headquarters urgently allocated 30 million yuan for disaster relief in the Northeast and advanced 50 million yuan in circulating currency. Liu Handong, the chairman of Liaobei Province, has extended a hand for help, appealing for national assistance. He said with a heavy heart, "Post-war reconstruction is difficult. Leaving aside the military, the casualties among the people and public educators in Siping are at least ten thousand. Nine-tenths of the city's houses have been destroyed by artillery fire, and 100,000 tons of grain have been lost. At the same time, 50,000 people have no food. Siping's reconstruction will not be accomplished in four or five decades!"

### The Puppet Manchukuo's Saito Commander Serves as a Communist Artillery Officer

During the bloody battle of Siping, the Communist forces mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops. After May 20th, they formed a siege around Siping, actively launching battles to isolate the city. With the worries about the rear eliminated, they began the siege of Siping on June 11th.

The officers and soldiers unanimously said, "This time, the Communist artillery fire was too fierce and too accurate. As soon as a tree was shot down, the artillery fire would begin. First, they would fire on the entire area, creating disruptive fire, then they would fire on the front line, the first line, the second line... Finally, they would fire on specific points, hitting each point accurately!"

Someone from the military headquarters said, "At night, standing on high ground and observing, we estimated that the Communist forces had more than seventy or eighty large-caliber guns, plus mortars, totaling more than two hundred. Later, we learned that there were many Japanese technical personnel among them. At the same time, most importantly, Saito, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Siping during the former puppet Manchukuo regime, was serving as the artillery commander."

"They used new-style aiming guns. Wherever the gun pointed, the artillery would fire there. We captured a Korean who was waving the aiming gun, but we couldn't get a detailed interrogation." When that Korean was brought before the reporter, he was pale and reportedly very ill, so we couldn't learn the details. There was also a Communist soldier who claimed to be from Harbin, but was pointed out as a Korean. The Korean admitted it.

Thirty Thousand Casualties

The Nationalist army had six divisions. The 88th Division fought in Tiexi, led by Peng, using new recruits. Four and a half battalions of the 54th Division fought with the Communist forces in the southern Tiedong district. The 87th Division, led by Xiong Xinmin, defended the northeastern area, with intact positions. In particular, the defense of the Taipingling Heights in the northern suburbs was the most meritorious. According to statistics, the Communist forces suffered 30,000 casualties, and the Nationalist army also suffered extremely heavy losses. Until June 30th, the Nationalist forces in Siping joined forces.

When the reporter left Siping and was over the city, the smell of burning corpses was even stronger because Siping was in the process of cremating bodies. Looking down at Siping, it was shrouded in the smoke of burning soybeans.

Weekly Forum

### Deliberations on the Demarcation of the New Provincial Boundary of Hainan Island

— Chen Yada

Regarding the reorganization of China's provinces and regions, we believe that there is no need for large-scale or comprehensive changes, but rather advocate for making partial adjustments to some necessary areas. Recently, the government decided to establish an administrative region on Hainan Island and simultaneously began preparing for provincial affairs. This is a timely measure by the government regarding the reorganization of provinces and regions. If China's provinces and regions can be reorganized in this way according to actual needs, then the reorganization work will be much easier and simpler. The long-standing debate over the demarcation of provinces can also obtain a proper solution through this.

However, how should the territory and boundaries of the new province region on Hainan Island be divided and handled? This is worth discussing here while the province region has not yet been formally established. The government's designation of Hainan Island to establish administrative regions is a step that should be taken in the process of establishing a province. When the establishment of the province is implemented in the future, its scope may not be limited to this single island. Before implementing the new system, the government will surely conduct thorough consideration and rational demarcation of the new province's territory based on various objective conditions.

From a geographical point of view, we feel that Hainan Island and the mainland across from it, namely the Leizhou Peninsula (equivalent to the old Leizhou Prefecture) and southwestern Guangdong (roughly equivalent to Gaozhou Prefecture, Lianzhou Prefecture, and Qinzhou), are closely related and inseparable. However, this part is far away from the main part of Guangdong, forming an isolated and separated situation. Therefore, it seems very appropriate and convenient to include it in the new province region of Hainan Island in terms of administration.

The Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island are separated only by the Qiongzhou Strait, which is 18 kilometers wide (the distance between Paiwei Cape southeast of Haian and the beach northeast of Haikou). The terrain of the two sides is so closely connected that Hainan Island was quickly discovered by the people who first migrated to the Xuwen Peninsula (the southern end of Leizhou Peninsula) during the Qin and Han dynasties. Before that, the Li people of the Miao Yao ethnic group crossed the peninsula from the mainland, relying on the strait that could be navigated by a single reed to reach the island - these Li people are still the main indigenous residents of the island. From this, the closeness of the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island can be known, as well as their long-standing interdependent relationship.

Topographically, this strait has not formed a true barrier. Because the Leizhou Peninsula and northern Hainan Island belong to the same terrain, namely the so-called Leizhou-Hainan Plain. The Leizhou Peninsula is a gently undulating plain, almost directly connected to the northern plain of Hainan Island through narrow waterways. Since the terrain is so similar and unified (there are also many similarities in geology between the two sides, which will not be elaborated on here), it is naturally difficult to separate personnel and politics.

Through the Leizhou Peninsula, the territory of the new province region extends further into southwestern Guangdong, namely the regions of the old Gaozhou, Lianzhou, and Qinzhou. Only by connecting Hainan Island and southwestern Guangdong can the combined effect of the sea and land be achieved. The Leizhou Peninsula is the link between the two places, possessing the nature of a central land bridge.

Now, to encompass the old Leizhou Prefecture, which generally covers the Leizhou Peninsula, and the three regions of the old Gaozhou Prefecture, Lianzhou Prefecture, and Qinzhou in southwestern Guangdong, we collectively refer to them as the "Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area."

This area and Hainan Island should be united into one province region for the following reasons:

(1) The northern boundary of "Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian" is lined with a group of mountains that have been eroded for a long time, among which the more prominent are the Gou Lou Mountains (south of Luoding) and the Shiwan Mountains on the western border. Relying on these mountains, it is separated from the Xijiang Basin, forming another coastal slope outside the Xijiang River Basin. This is opposite to the northern slope of Hainan Island, with a tendency to echo and unite. The mountain watershed is roughly consistent with the northern boundary of Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian, and for the sake of convenient demarcation, the northern boundary of Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian (political boundary) can be regarded as the northern boundary of the new province region. (The northern boundary mentioned here refers to the land boundary starting from west of Lianjiang and ending at the junction of Fangcheng and Annam, actually including a very small part of the eastern and western boundaries.)

(2) Climatically, southwestern Guangdong is also different from other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi, being located in a purely tropical zone with a maritime character. This is the same type as Hainan Island.

(3) The coastal part of this area is a comprehensive body of land and sea composed of islands, peninsulas, capes, and inland seas. This is the same as Hainan Island, giving residents the convenience of maritime activities.

(4) The tropical nature of this area and Hainan Island is more pronounced than in other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi; therefore, the agricultural situation also shows differences. Moreover, due to the sparse population and the abundance of various mineral deposits, both regions are rich in development characteristics.

(5) Except for the coastal plain around the island and the relatively flat northern third, Hainan Island generally belongs to mountainous areas covered with bushes (the lack of alluvial lowlands is a characteristic of most islands). Therefore, it is necessary to add the adjustment of the mainland plains on the opposite shore to have sufficient hope for prosperity. In this way, Hainan Island relies on the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area, and at the same time, the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area also needs Hainan Island to show its effectiveness. In general, a coastal area needs to have more contact with the sea and arouse residents' interest in the sea, so the so-called "Off-Shore Island" is indispensable. In the past, this place hidden in the southwest corner, with such a large "Off-Shore Island" as Hainan Island, it is not difficult to enhance the importance of this area and the nearby coast.

The prominent human geographer Ellen, C. Semple, when discussing islands, pays special attention to the concept of "Political Detachability of Islands." The general idea is that islands are geographically isolated areas and are politically easy to separate. In order to avoid this defect, politically, it must be combined with the mainland so that it has a centripetal movement towards the mainland; according to this rule, Hainan Island and southwestern Guangdong can also be made into an administrative unit.

To constitute the new province region of Hainan Island, in addition to the above two parts, the Xisha and Nansha Islands in the South China Sea should also be included. Geographically, the two island groups are closer to this area than to Guangdong; this division is needed not only in terms of administrative rule, but also in terms of geography and geopolitics.

Accordingly, the new province region includes Hainan Island, the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area, and the Xisha and Nansha Islands. It has Qiongshan, Chengmai, Wenchang, Qiongdong, Lehui, Lingao, 定安, Ya, Ganen, Changjiang, Wanning, Lingshui, Baisha, Ledong, Baoting, and Ding'an (all on Hainan Island), Maoming, Xinyi, Huazhou, Lianjiang, Dianbai, Wuchuan (all in the old Gaozhou Prefecture), Suixi, Haikang, Xuwen (all in the old Leizhou Prefecture), Qin, Fangcheng (all in the old Qinzhou), Hepu, and Lingshan (all in the old Lianzhou Prefecture) counties and Guangzhou Bay administrative region. Its provincial capital can be set up in Qiongshan on Hainan Island, the main brain of the new province. (The Dongsha Islands still belong to Guangdong).

At the northern and southern ends of China's 4,000-mile arc-shaped coastline, there is a similar pattern of land-sea intersection (both ends have peninsulas, islands, straits, bays, capes, inland seas, etc.). However, the northern end has long been a stage in Chinese history that has played many moving dramas; while the southern end has been so deserted that it has almost been forgotten. In order to promote the country's attention to the southern border (according to today's Pacific geographical situation, the importance of the southern end is not less than that of the northern end). The establishment of this southernmost province region is a matter of profound significance.

Domestic commentators often believe that the Gao-Lei-Qin-Lian area is too far from the provincial capital, and it seems appropriate to change its affiliation to Guangxi to emphasize national defense, so that Guangxi can also have an outlet to the sea. The British geographer L.W. Lyde also believes that the eastern and western ends of Guangdong, namely the Han River basin and southwestern Guangdong (including Hainan Island), should belong to Fujian and Guangxi respectively. But in our view, it is better for southwestern Guangdong and Hainan Island to form a new province region. For the same reason, the Han River basin along with southwestern Fujian can be merged into the Taiwan province region. This division seems more suitable and appropriate.

In short, our view on the demarcation of provinces and regions is to agree with the partial reorganization of Hainan Island in this way. We do not advocate completely overturning or ignoring the inherent boundaries and reforming them. Recently, the authorities of the Ministry of Land Administration plan to follow the example of the American states and use latitude and longitude lines to divide the provincial boundaries (see Minister Li Jingzhai's talk in the Shanghai News on June 12 of this year). From various aspects, this design is really impossible to apply to China. Because in Eurasia, countries with a long-standing culture—especially China, which has a long history—its political boundaries are always curvilinear patterns formed by long-term vicissitudes (using latitude and longitude lines very rarely). As for latitude and longitude degrees and grid-shaped boundaries, they are often used in newly discovered and newly developed lands (such as the Americas, Australia, and the Philippines), which has almost become a very common rule on boundary demarcation. What's more, latitude and longitude lines are not an ideal boundary, and there are many shortcomings in themselves.

Telecommunications Special Issue Editor: Yu Bing First Issue Edited by the Business Department of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

### Inaugural Statement

— Yu Bingjian

Telecommunications is a state-run transportation enterprise and the main tool for public communication. After the restoration, the telecommunications industry is making efforts to build up its infrastructure. The Bureau recognizes the daily needs of telecommunications for the public and the development of the telecommunications industry also depends on the joint efforts and assistance of the people. Therefore, at the beginning of the construction, the Bureau aims to serve the public and wants to be one with the people.

The publication of this journal follows this principle, and its motivations can be summarized as follows:

(1) To make public telecommunications technology and business for public exploration.

(2) To report telecommunications common knowledge and introduce emerging businesses for adoption.

(3) To solicit suggestions and evaluations for the Bureau's future reform and innovation.

(4) To answer user queries.

This journal is an open forum. It is hoped that domestic talents and advanced telecommunications professionals will not hesitate to contribute valuable articles as a compass for the Bureau. In this way, the progress of the telecommunications business in the future will be attributed to the contributions of distinguished scholars. The publication of this journal today has profound significance.

### Before and After the Restoration of International Calls

— Wu Zhengda

When victory arrived, the highest telecommunications authorities immediately began planning for the restoration of international calls. Last year, they began recruiting and training international operators, and preparing international call regulations, business rules, operator terminology, and other preparatory work. However, due to environmental limitations and the lack of agreement between China and the United States, international telephone service was delayed until March of this year. The General Directorate reached an agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). At the same time, the General Directorate, together with the International Radio Station, began preparing to install a two-way single-sideband wireless telephone (2KW). In the original domestic long-distance station of the General Directorate, an international call exchange room was set up, equipped with switchboards and soundproofing equipment. In May of this year, the work was completed and trial calls began.

Initially, meeting times were set for 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM. After several trial calls, it was found that daytime communication was difficult due to strong interference, while nighttime communication was clear and good. Therefore, it was decided that from July 1st of this year, the service would be officially opened, with the time temporarily set from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM (Shanghai summer time). In China, the opening locations were temporarily set as Beijing and Shanghai, and the United States could reach all parts of the country.

The anticipated "July 1st" finally arrived. The staff of the General Directorate and the International Radio Station spent the day with excitement and anticipation. The opening ceremony planned by the Telecommunications General Directorate was to have Shanghai Mayor Wu first speak with the Mayor of San Francisco and the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun. Subsequently, Director Yu of the General Directorate and Chief Engineer Zong of the International Radio Station would speak with representatives of AT&T, mutually wishing success.

On the evening of July 1st, the organizers were busy and sweating profusely. From the Director down, everyone was working hard, arranging the auditorium, installing loudspeakers, and colleagues from the Central Film Studio came to the bureau to assist in filming news footage. Around 9:00 PM, the invited news reporters and guests arrived one after another, and the receptionists became active. Around 10:00 PM, Mayor Wu and his wife arrived and were led by the Director to the Director's office for a brief rest. Then, the ceremony began in a solemn atmosphere. In the center of the venue, the national flags of China and the United States were hung, and fragrant and beautiful flowers were displayed on the table, symbolizing the friendly relations and bright future between the two countries. The hostess, with a clear voice, opened the ceremony.

First, Director Yu gave a speech in Chinese and English to the Mayor and guests. At that moment, flashes of mercury lamps and the sound of "cameras" were incessant. Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech. The Mayor's elegant and democratic demeanor, smile, and conversation deeply comforted the people who had worked all day. At this time, the first international telephone call after restoration began to be transmitted from Shanghai to San Francisco across the Pacific Ocean. The loudspeakers transmitted the voices of both sides, and what was gratifying was that the voice was as clear as a local telephone call. When the Mayor spoke with Ambassador Gu, the Ambassador highly praised the communication of international calls. According to the scheduled program, after the call, a business film of the General Directorate was played, and refreshments were served. This historic ceremony was completed in a friendly and happy atmosphere. The restoration of international calls can increase the friendship between China and the United States, and at the same time, it proves the power of human science to overcome the natural environment. It can make people on both sides of the Pacific Ocean feel as if they are together, talking intimately. The progress of science has further reduced the scope of the universe.

In the blink of an eye, ten days have passed since the international calls were restored. Only one of the two circuits originally scheduled to open simultaneously could not be used due to interference from a radio station in San Francisco. Negotiations are currently underway with the other party to change the frequency. Recently, the demand for Sino-US telephone calls has been increasing daily, resulting in a large gap between supply and demand, and it has been necessary to temporarily stop registration in order to clear the registered calls. This is, of course, very regrettable. Regarding this point, we will strive to improve the equipment of the line in the future to achieve the purpose of smooth Sino-US telephone communication.

### General Overview of the Telecommunications Business of This Bureau

— Li Tong

Telecommunications and transportation are the lifeblood of the country, and their importance is self-evident. Shanghai is the center of commerce and economy in the country, so the position of this bureau is the hub of domestic and international telecommunications traffic. However, during the war, the enemy harmed us, causing outstanding talents to scatter in all directions, and good equipment to be destroyed. After the victory, the machines left by the Japanese side were mostly obsolete and simple. In addition, there was a lack of materials, difficulties in transportation, and skilled talents were not easy to obtain. After repeated planning and rectification, fortunately, it has been gradually restored and there has been significant progress, which can be considered gratifying to the people of the country. Now, the general overview of the bureau's business is described as follows:

A. Telegraph Section.

Wired Telegraph: There are currently 17 direct wired circuits. Those using high-speed machines are Nanjing, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Hankou, Yin County, Wu County, Zhenjiang, etc. Those using sound machines are Wuxi, Jiaxing, Kunshan, etc. Those using voice transmission are Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiading, Chuansha, Baoshan, Wusong, Nanxiang, etc. Nanjing is the capital city, and the telegraph business is busy. In addition to high-speed machines, there are also facsimile telegraph machines and teletypewriter equipment to increase efficiency. High-speed machines use keyboard punching machines to punch telegrams into perforated paper strips, and then use automatic machines to transmit them to the other party. When the other party receives them, the receiving machine records the paper strips with wave symbols, which are copied by typists with typewriters and sent out. The machine can simultaneously send and receive up to 200 words per minute (five letters per word). However, due to line relations, the average is 100 words per minute. Sound machines listen to and copy sounds, and can send 20 to 25 words per minute. Voice transmission circuits transmit telegrams by telephone, and can transmit about 20 words per minute. Teletypewriters are the latest equipment, which are similar to ordinary typewriters. When sending a telegram, you only need to press the letters, and the other party will see clear letters, which can avoid the trouble of re-copying. They can send and receive 60 words per minute. Facsimile telegraphs are written by the sender in his own handwriting on specially prepared telegraph paper, and the traces are transmitted to the other party on the machine using telecommunications equipment. After a little finishing, a clear original handwriting appears, so it is also called a true handwriting telegram.

Wireless Telegraph: There are currently 25 direct wireless circuits. Those using high-speed machines are Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Chongqing, Hankou, Taipei, Guangzhou, etc. Those using manual machines are Xiamen, Shantou, Fuzhou, Yongjia, Dinghai, Yin County, Chongming, Haimen, Nantong, Lianyungang, Shenyang, Qinhuangdao, Huludao, Nanchang, Changsha, Hengyang, Chengdu, Kunming, etc. Wireless high-speed machines are the same as wired high-speed machines in form and use, but the former uses radio waves to transmit through the air. When it is smooth, it can send 120 words per minute, but when radio waves interfere and the weather changes, the speed may be reduced to 30 to 40 words per minute. Manual machines use hand sending and ear listening, and the speed is about 20 to 25 words per minute. The communication situation is the same as wireless high-speed machines.

### Advantages of True Handwriting Telegrams

— Zhang Youjun

It is found that true handwriting telegrams are a kind of telecommunications image. Telecommunications images, originally Facsimile, were invented by the British physicist Alexander Bain in 1842 AD. After a long period of experimentation and research, they gradually appeared in commercial applications in 1915. In the past ten years, they have been widely set up in European and American countries. During the Anti-Japanese War, telecommunications image circuits were also set up between Chongqing and New York and London. After the war, our industry and commerce are waiting to be developed, and the adoption and expansion of true handwriting telegrams is an undertaking that cannot be ignored.

This telegram is written by the sender on the true handwriting telegraph paper of the size prescribed by the Telecommunications Bureau, with words, patterns, etc. The Telecommunications Bureau rolls the paper into a special transmitting tube and uses the photoelectric effect of the machine to transmit it through radio waves. In a moment, the other party can receive the sent telegram on the recording machine with a special receiving paper. The handwriting is the same as that drawn by the sender, without any damage, which can be said to be perfect, which cannot be achieved by other communication methods. The advantages are described as follows:

(1) Accuracy: The transmission of true handwriting telegrams relies entirely on the photoelectric effect of the machine. What is sent is the telegram written directly by the sender, and what the other party receives is its image. Therefore, there are no errors in the mutual translation of text codes and manual sending and receiving of ordinary telegrams, which can be called absolutely accurate.

(2) Speed: All the procedures required to handle ordinary telegrams can be saved. It only takes a few minutes from sending from Bureau A to Bureau B. The receiving party only needs to take the receiving paper from the receiving machine and send it by special messenger immediately, so it is extremely fast.

(3) Economical and practical: The sender can write as much as possible on the specified paper, so the number of words is irrelevant to the telegram fee. If a small telegraph paper contains two or three hundred words, it can be sent and received calmly. Compared with ordinary telegrams that charge per word, it is much more economical. This telegram can be used with brush, pen (limited to black ink), and typing. Even patterns, schedules, accounts, etc. (within the specified size) can be transmitted. Therefore, if you want to use this telegram to express your congratulations, you may as well add a drawing of the celebration to the paper. If you want to order a telegram, you can also draw the size and style of the goods, which can be transmitted in the same way without any errors.

(4) Increase the feelings between senders and receivers: Telegrams are like letters, used to communicate feelings. When relatives and close friends hold weddings, you can send social telegrams to the Telecommunications Bureau. However, if you use true handwriting telegrams and write in a flowery script on the paper, supplemented by congratulatory pictures, the other party will be infinitely happy to receive the telegram. In other cases, wandering sons, lovers, and good friends can also see the ink marks of the text, comfort the soul's dream, and tell the heart to thousands of relatives.

The above points are the most important ones. People from all walks of life may wish to try it.

Here are two suggestions for improvement for the reference of our telecommunications authorities.

(1) According to the staff of the news agency in this city, they have been thinking of using true handwriting telegrams to replace the ordinary news telegrams to send news manuscripts to various places, but they can only make full use of the places where the true handwriting telegrams can reach today. Because the news industry is the throat of the country, it should be closely linked with the telecommunications industry to ensure smooth communication. Therefore, expanding the line, gradually opening busy places such as Pingwei, Hanyu, and Chongqing, and extending the daily power-on time, the wide use of the news media can be predicted.

(2) According to the current statistics, the content of true handwriting telegrams is mostly for celebrations, condolences, and other social occasions. The receiving paper of this telegram is made of special paper, and the paper surface is dark and dull. If it is a happy celebration telegram, you can make a paper slightly larger than the receiving paper, and the color is pink. The four sides are painted with golden patterns. After the telegram is received from the machine, it is pasted on it, and the same color art envelope is added. In the festive hall, the colorful telegrams are thrown, which can add a lot of color.

### Please Make Full Use of New Telecommunications Methods

— Li Jiqing

The Telecommunications General Directorate of the Ministry of Communications has recently been actively improving telecommunications services and sparing no effort. In order to review the progress of work and plan future facilities, the directors of telecommunications bureaus in various regions and important cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Wuhan were convened in batches in May and June to hold telecommunications review meetings, and various issues were discussed in detail, so as to achieve the purpose of telecommunications serving the public. In addition, a "Public Service Group" was added to the bureau to handle matters related to telecommunications serving the public.

There are many new methods implemented in telecommunications recently. Here are some of the main points, and I hope that people from all walks of life will make full use of them, so that they can get various conveniences in daily life and when using telegrams and telephones.

(1) Service Desk: Each telecommunications bureau has a service desk dedicated to facilitating the public to answer inquiries about trains, airplanes, ship schedules, and local entertainment and broadcasting programs. (Telephone 115)

(2) Telephone Booth: Located in stations, docks, scenic spots, assembly halls, etc., with telephone equipment. In addition to handling public telephone and long-distance telephone services, it also accepts various telegrams and transmits them to the telecommunications bureau's newsroom for sending.

(3) Mobile Automobile Telecommunications Bureau: Major cities have opened mobile automobile telecommunications bureaus or business offices, which are either run by the telecommunications bureau itself or attached to the mobile post office. They travel daily on designated routes in various urban areas and stop to send and receive telegrams.

(4) Translation of Incoming Telegrams: Telecommunications bureaus in major cities have translated incoming telegrams. After receiving the telegram, the recipient can read and understand it. If the received telegram has not been translated, please report it to the Telecommunications Bureau (Telephone 11490).

(5) Telephone Notification to Collect Telegrams: If you have a telegram to send, please call 13059, and the Telecommunications Bureau will send a messenger to pick up the telegram and send it.

(6) Business Inspection: Telecommunications bureaus in major cities have business inspectors who regularly visit the outside world to investigate and negotiate telegraph and telephone matters. If you have any suggestions for improvement or dissatisfaction with telegraph and telephone services, please inform them in detail, and the authorities will handle it seriously.

(7) Test Letter: The Telecommunications General Directorate has printed telecommunications test letters and sent them directly to businesses and companies that send and receive telegrams and telephones. After receiving this test letter, people from all walks of life are welcome to fill it out in detail and express their dissatisfaction as much as possible so that the telecommunications bureau can understand the situation and find ways to improve.

(8) Telephone Transmission and Receipt of Telegrams: If you have a telegram to send, you can report it to the Telecommunications Bureau by telephone and have it copied and sent out. If you also want the incoming telegram to be transmitted by telephone, please inform the Telecommunications Bureau to do so. Please contact the Telecommunications Bureau in advance to use the telephone to transmit and receive telegrams smoothly.

(9) Social Telegrams: Social telegrams are specially prepared for use in weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. The methods are novel, the prices are cheap, and gift certificates can be attached.

(10) Nighttime Telegraph and Telephone Price Reduction: In order to reduce the burden on users, the Telecommunications General Directorate has opened nighttime letter telegrams from July 1, charging only 500 yuan per word. On the telephone side, nighttime reduced-price long-distance calls are open, calculated at 70% of the daytime normal calling price.

The above is a summary of the new telecommunications methods. Please use them as much as possible at any time. There are many other convenient methods. Please ask the local telecommunications bureau for inquiries and negotiations.

### Business Talks

— Ye Changwei

70 Fuzhou Road is the general business office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and also the model business office in Shanghai. Hua works at the Telecommunications Bureau. Yang and Li are his classmates. The conversation starts with the business office, and a brief introduction to the recent improvements in telecommunications is given.

Yang: Brother Hua! You work in the Telecommunications Bureau. Can you tell me why it is so crowded when sending telegrams?

Hua: Oh! This is a long story. The reason for the congestion lies in the sender himself.

Li: Excuse me for interrupting, the congestion of the business office is due to the small number of staff and the slow handling. Why do you say it is due to the sender?

Hua: Well, the small number of staff and the slow handling are also one of the reasons, but you may know that there is a long queue every day on Fourth Road, while other branch business offices like Yuyuan Road and Sinan Road are sparsely populated. Senders often have a preconceived notion, that is, "Send a telegram, go to Fourth Road." They send telegrams to Fourth Road without making good use of the branch business offices, thus causing congestion at the general business office.

Yang: Oh! Is that the reason? Are there any other reasons?

Hua: Yes, some people who do not send telegrams often lack knowledge of telecommunications. They have to write a telegraph paper several times and queue up several times. This not only wastes their own time but also delays the time of others, which is also one of the reasons for the congestion.

Li: I want to interrupt again. The lack of public telecommunications knowledge is indeed a fact, but it is the responsibility of your Telecommunications Bureau to impart telecommunications knowledge!

Hua: Yes, we have started to handle this matter. First, we have set up a service desk in the general business office, specializing in solving difficulties for senders. For example, writing telegraph papers and explaining various questions about telegrams. Second, we print small telegraph formats and senders' instructions to senders. Third, we publish a special telecommunications issue in Shen Xin and Xinmin News every month, specializing in telecommunications consultations and articles related to telecommunications. In this way, we can reduce unnecessary trouble, and at the same time, we can provide a lot of convenience to senders.

Yang: This is a very good measure. I want to ask again, if we have any questions or new suggestions from the outside world, are you welcome?

Hua: We are not grateful enough, how can we not welcome them? If you have any questions about telecommunications or other valuable suggestions, please mail them in writing to the Business Inspection Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, 70 Fuzhou Road. It may be disclosed in the "Telecommunications Q&A" in the social service column of Shen Bao every Saturday.

Yang: Okay.

Li: Okay, it's getting late, let's talk next time, goodbye.

Hua: Goodbye, please give us your advice often.

### Electric Sparks

After the news that state-owned enterprises would generally raise prices from July 1 was revealed in the newspapers in this city, the telegraph and long-distance telephone business was particularly crowded on June 30. The on-duty clerks, telegraphers, operators, and other relevant personnel were all doubly busy that day. They were really sweating profusely and extremely hard.

The motivation for the increase in telegraph and telephone prices this time is that the telecommunications finances have suffered too much loss and have to be compensated for this. Because the prices of telegrams and telephones were too low in the past, the increase of four times this time seems a bit abrupt, and some people even think it is too high. In fact, it is not enough to compensate for the cost.

After the price increase of telegraph and telephone services, it is still very crowded and does not decrease.

After the increase in telegraph and telephone fees, in order to reduce the burden on the public, the highest telecommunications authorities created two new businesses. One is called nighttime letter telegrams, which serves the public by using the nighttime news service, which is more convenient, charging only 500 yuan per word. The other is called nighttime reduced-price long-distance calls, which is designed for users who do not have time or do not have time to make long-distance calls during the day. The fee is calculated at 70% of the daytime normal calling price. The call time is from 11:00 pm every day to 7:00 am the next day. The above two are both emerging popular telecommunications businesses.

On July 1, this bureau held a Sino-US resumption of communication ceremony, attended by Mayor Wu, Mrs. Mayor, Director Yu, Deputy Chief Engineer Zong, Section Chief Zhang of the Municipal Government's Foreign Affairs Section, representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company, and more than 30 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers, with an unprecedented grand occasion. All the words of the call were recorded with the latest steel wire recorder to commemorate.

In order to increase the transmission rate, this bureau is adding teletypewriters between the general business office and the branch business offices. The North Station branch business office has been installed and applied first, with excellent results. The general business office of this bureau has added five new sofas for the rest of the senders, and a service desk is set up to answer telecommunications questions, which the senders call convenient.

The first mobile electric bureau of this bureau has been assembled and will soon run throughout the city.

On July 4, this bureau screened the film on business innovation and the film No. 1, inviting the bureau's colleagues and relatives and friends.

This magazine is published once a month on the 14th.

### Telegraphy Common Sense Talk (1)

— Zhang Jiayu

Preface　Before the war, institutions handling telecommunications were called "Telegraph Bureaus" and "Telephone Bureaus" depending on the nature of their business. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications, in order to centralize authority and save manpower and resources, has merged various telecommunication businesses under the management of the "Telecommunication Bureau." Telecommunications include wired telegraphy and telephony, wireless telegraphy and telephony, as well as telephotography, etc. Therefore, the meaning of the word "telecommunications" is very broad, while "telegraphy" is only one type of "telecommunications." Generally, senders of telegrams still habitually call the Telecommunication Bureau the Telegraph Bureau, which should be corrected.

This article will cover the various telecommunication businesses mentioned above, and will focus on the telecommunication common sense that general customers need to understand, especially how to use telecommunications with the least cost and achieve the greatest effect.

Part 1　Telegraphy　Lecture 1: What is a Telegram?

Before getting to the main topic, let me tell two very interesting stories: I remember when the Qi and Lu armies were fighting a civil war in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces before the Northern Expedition. At that time, I was still young and followed my parents to the countryside to take refuge. An old woman from a rural relative's family asked me to write a letter for her on a postcard. She called the postcard a "ginseng slice." She also told me that a "ginseng slice" only cost one and a half cents, which was half the price of sending a letter in an envelope, and you didn't have to spend extra money to buy envelopes and stationery. Based on her past experience, postcards weren't slower than letters, so she preferred to use postcards. Another story also happened in my childhood. At that time, I lived in a not-so-small city along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Once, a neighbor suddenly received a telegram from Tianjin—this was the first telegram he had ever seen in his life. At that time, the telegraph bureau did not translate Chinese telegrams into plain language, so as soon as he received the telegram, he became flustered and anxious. He was very worried because, according to the rumors he had heard, sending a telegram must be for events such as someone's death or someone being critically ill. Before he could decipher these convoluted foreign codes, he always thought that some ominous misfortune would befall his family. It wasn't until he found a newly compiled telegraph codebook in a bookstore and translated it word by word that he learned the good news that his son-in-law, who had been doing business far away and had lost contact for a long time, had returned to Tianjin from beyond the pass and had sent him a sum of money. From these two stories, it can be seen that knowledge of postal mail is already widely accepted by the public, but the public's understanding of telecommunications is very superficial.

So, what exactly is a telegram? In the most popular analogy, we can say that a telegram is a letter transmitted by electricity. Although the handwriting copied in the telegram is not entirely the letter writer's own, as in letters sent from the post office, this defect has now been remedied by "telephotography."

The biggest difference between postal mail and telegrams lies in the difference in transmission technology. The former uses transportation tools such as airplanes, vehicles, and ships, or manual carrying, etc., to transmit, while the latter uses wires (wired telegraphy) and radio waves (wireless telegraphy). Due to the differences mentioned above, postal charges are based on weight, while telegram charges are based on time. The time it takes to send a telegram is directly proportional to the length of the telegram, so the price of a telegram is calculated in units of words.

If we look at the structure of postal mail and telegrams, they are also very similar. A comparison is as follows:

(Structure of a Telegram)　(Structure of Postal Mail)

1.  Telegram Header　Equals　Postmark on the Envelope
2.  Payment Identification　Equals　Sticker on the Upper Right Corner of the Envelope
3.  Recipient's Name and Address　Equals　Recipient's Name and Address on the Letter
4.  Telegram Text　Equals　Text Written on the Letter
5.  Sender's Signature　Equals　Sender's Signature (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Forty-Nine Self-Description

— Wang Pingling

An American scholar of "gerontology," Dr. Benjamin, once proposed a novel idea about human lifespan: "Young people do not necessarily have young physiological structures, and old people do not necessarily decline. Like some ancient trees, the older they get, the stronger they become, with lush branches and leaves and solid roots. The increase in age rings does not limit the development of their vitality. Therefore, some people who are sixty-five years old are still energetic and full of life, like the rising sun. On the contrary, many young people seem prematurely senile, as if they have already reached the twilight years."

I am enlightened by his brilliant insights and can find my own joy in difficult times. I will never lose heart or be discouraged because of the steady increase in age. When I am lonely, I wander through landscapes in my mind; when I participate in lively occasions, although I also enjoy joining in the fun, I still maintain an objective attitude and silently appreciate the world's phenomena. I love to smoke but am not addicted, I love to drink but have no drinking problem; I love to look at women but have no ambition. If wealth and high status are attainable, I would even be a whip-holding groom; if they are not attainable, I will follow my own inclinations. Also, because "I have no illness," I am not greedy for money or sex, nor do I want to stir up trouble in the world, turning clouds and rain, treating all things as straw dogs to fulfill my ambitions; nor do I indulge in foolish thoughts, getting up at dawn to tirelessly pursue profit, exchanging legal tender for US dollars, and US dollars for gold, preparing to take them into the coffin to be buried with me when I stop breathing. Therefore, although my hobbies are complex, they are actually very simple. Specifically, I like to keep in mind, within the scope of my acquaintance, the people who I absolutely cannot find fault with; however, I do not hope that they often keep me in mind. I like to write down on paper the various things I think of and come into contact with, and send them to friends who can control a supplement or magazine. If they can be published, then publish them; if there is any inconvenience, please throw them into the wastepaper basket. As for whether they can resonate with readers after publication, whether they will offend a certain class, and cause unpleasant reactions; whether they can be considered "immortal" masterpieces; I cannot worry about so much. How dare a humble person like me consider writing articles as one of the "three immortalities?" To be honest, it is just occasionally venting for a while when miscellaneous external and internal disturbances cause dizziness, to reduce the burden on my soul! How dare I, who love to dabble in literature, compete with contemporary democrats, who, although they are out of office, have their hearts set on the imperial court, and often issue declarations, send telegrams, and discuss world affairs while picking lice! It is indeed true that it is like taking a laxative, clearing out the accumulated dregs, so that they do not cause trouble in the stomach and damage one's health. My friends are surprised that I am constantly at my desk, writing non-stop, and never get sick, and that my spirit is always so abundant. Nearing fifty, I cannot find a single white hair, and they wonder what techniques I use to achieve this. Little do they know that I can write whatever I think of. The set of square characters that I have used for more than thirty years is controlled at the tip of my pen, and I can arbitrarily enslave them. No tyrant or demon king's enslavement of their people is as satisfying and thorough as my enslavement of this set of square characters. My tireless enjoyment of this contains a way to maintain health!

People can live long lives if they do not create their own misfortune and can all indulge themselves and understand how to maintain health. At the same time, to hope that society progresses and the country has a future, I also hope that the moon is always full and people live long lives. Because long-lived people have deep experience and a peaceful mind, they are not prone to anger and fighting like young lads, doing more harm than good. As the saying goes: "A mouth without hair does not do things firmly," which is what it means. In modern, more advanced countries, all the professors in universities, the people in charge of various ministries, especially the "generals and ministers," are all elders with long beards, and their brains are filled with experience and knowledge. They themselves are rich histories. China is not like this. Even university professors look like young lads. Foreign white-bearded old professors must be surprised. But this is not surprising, as the average age of Chinese people is only thirty! Poor compatriots, having suffered hardships and tribulations, and not seeing through the mundane world, by the time their experience and knowledge are about to mature, although they are not old in years, they have already reached the twilight of their lives. Currently, Americans are very serious about the study of longevity, extending the retirement time of working elderly people and increasing service efficiency as much as possible, which is the most economical and effective method. It is a truly irreparable waste for Chinese people to age prematurely, burying their full bellies of learning in the grave along with their diseased bodies!

A year on Earth has only three hundred and sixty days, and a day and night is only twenty-four hours. If we calculate based on a day and night on the moon being equal to four weeks on Earth, I am still a child of four or five years old! And in this short period, after deducting sleep, socializing, meetings, signing in, signing out, training, lectures... and various non-urgent matters, the time spent buried in work is only a very short moment, so even if there is a little achievement, it is truly insignificant. Therefore, although I have started my forty-ninth year, because my work must start from scratch, and I must never be complacent about the past, my working age is still very young! I am grateful to my friends in Chongqing, who want to imitate the anecdotes of great writers from home and abroad and celebrate my birthday this year, without a moment's rest, having written more than ten million words of "anti-Japanese stereotyped essays!" This heartfelt sincerity moves me to tears of shame. These cherished "Liaodong pigs" have no artistic life and will perish along with the deaths of the enemy and puppet regimes. What value is there in rewarding them! I also sincerely declined the good intentions of my friends. But I would like to briefly express my thoughts under the title "Forty-Nine Self-Description." From now on, I will only use my remaining time to do the work that I want to do. Apart from the necessary sleep time, I do not plan to waste my precious time on meetings, socializing, and acting on stage! There is too much that I want to write down myself. Although there is still a long time ahead, it is finite after all. I feel that I have no achievements to speak of, so I must cherish it even more; for example, the absence of a supporting role like me at any kind of meeting does not hinder the liveliness of the meeting, but it actually benefits me immensely!

### Reading "The Dream of Linchuan"

— You Jin

Jiang Shiquan's "The Dream of Linchuan," written for Tang Xianzu, can be read as a biography of Tang Xianzu and is the best of the nine dramas. I remember a Western literary scholar saying: "The true writer himself is a good poem." Tang Linchuan's good poem was written by Jiang Shiquan truthfully and artistically. Never has a biography written for someone one admires been as unique and lovely as this biography of Linchuan. Liang Rengong often lamented that China does not have long biographies of thousands of words like foreign biographical literature. Little does he know that "The Dream of Linchuan" is the best representative of Chinese literati biographies. It is more brilliant and has more artistic interest than Boswell's "Life of Johnson," although it uses a rhythmic drama form and not prose. (I read the large-character engraving of the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, collected by Hongxuelou, in the Qingrong Waiji.)

Tang Linchuan, named Xianzu, courtesy name Yireng, also known as Ruoshi, was from Linchuan, Jiangxi. He was born in the twenty-ninth year of Jiajing of the Ming Dynasty (1550) and died in the forty-fifth year of Wanli of the Ming Dynasty (1617). He was naturally arrogant and did not admire the powerful and wealthy. In the fifth year of Wanli, when Zhang Juzheng was the powerful prime minister, Zhang wanted to promote his son to be the top scholar, and he was afraid that people would laugh at his son for not having real talent. So he forced Tang Xianzu and Shen Maoxue, the top scholars of the time, to be foils for his son, one as the second place and the other as the third place. As a result, Shen Maoxue went, but Tang Xianzu flatly refused, firmly unwilling to go, as he was ashamed to be a bridesmaid for others. It was not until the powerful Prime Minister Zhang Juzheng died that he came forward and became a Jinshi. While serving as a doctor at the Taichang Temple in Nanjing, he submitted a memorial criticizing the government for trusting private individuals and suppressing censors, a great article of thousands of words, very upright, so he was demoted to Dian Shi of Xuwen County. After taking office, he immediately established Guisheng Academy to lecture and change the customs of scholars, and later became the magistrate of Suichang.

Throughout his life, he hated the false celebrity Chen Jiru (Meigong) and criticized him fearlessly, eventually suffering harm in secret and being unable to be used by the world, spending his remaining years in poverty and writing books. His most famous "Four Dreams of the Jade Tea Hall"—The Peony Pavilion (The Return of the Soul), The Purple Hairpin, The Dream of Nanke, and The Dream of Handan—became immortal masterpieces.

### Ladies

— Xu Zhengbai

The original biography in the History of Ming says that he… "...His residence, the Jade Tea Hall, was littered with literary and historical works, chickens and pigs roamed freely in the courtyard. He leisurely sang and wrote, content with himself. The burdens in his heart were expressed in lyrics and dramas. His four dreams, although lingering in the memories of romance and moved by the states of things, were meant to cleanse the dust and return to nothingness, to achieve an open-minded view of emptiness, which is also sad..."

Based on this story, Jiang Shiquan created a twenty-act drama—The Dream of Linchuan—whose catalogue is: Rejecting the Spear, Hiding Treachery, Harmonious Dream, Imagining the Dream, Changing the Dream, Star Change, Resisting the Memorial, Bo Change, Sending the Captain, Dying for the Dream, Becoming an Official, Cripple, Continuing the Dream, Double Bite, Sending a Song, Visiting the Dream, Gathering the Dream, Flower Celebration, Speaking of Dreams, Ending the Dream, divided into two volumes.

The play depicts Yu Ergu, a woman from Loujiang, who became obsessed with reading "The Peony Pavilion" and even died for love. Her soul visits Linchuan, interspersed with current events at the time (such as Bo Chengen's rebellion and Mei Guozhen's suppression of bandits) and Linchuan's teaching achievements in Xuwen and his political achievements in Suichang. The final scene is a gathering of characters from The Return of the Soul, The Purple Hairpin, The Dream of Handan, and The Dream of Nanke in the Jade Tea Hall, each speaking of their dreams. The last two acts, Speaking of Dreams and Ending the Dream, vividly describe the essence of Linchuan's dramas.

The epilogue of the act Ending the Dream says: "The jade tea in front of the hall is now withered, putting all four dreams to rest from one dream. It is pitiful that this dream world is difficult to bear and difficult to end."

The ghost in "The Return of the Soul" (originally Du Liniang, but replaced by Yu Ergu), the knight in The Purple Hairpin (played by Princess Huo), the immortal in The Dream of Handan (played by Mr. Lu), and the Buddha in The Dream of Nanke (played by Chunyu Lang)—this is the meaning contained in the dream of returning. In the view of the general public, the judge (the true ghost in The Return of the Soul), the man in yellow (the true knight in The Purple Hairpin), Lu Weng (the true immortal in The Dream of Handan), and Qi Xuan (the true Buddha in The Dream of Nanke) should appear on stage. But the ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas are only the masters in the drama, not the masters in the author's mind. Du, Huo, Lu, and Chun are puppets on the stage, while the judge, the man in yellow, etc., are the puppeteers; the former four are people in the dream, and the latter four are people outside the dream. Since the meaning of the drama is based on ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas, then the subjective masters belong to the judge, the man in yellow, etc., while Du, Miss Huo, etc., are only the objective masters. Linchuan's genius and his thoughts can surpass the stereotypes of ordinary playwrights and must be sought in detail in such places.

Shiquan and Xianzu, although separated by generations, shared the same heart, precisely because their talents were the same, and their situations were not very different. Shi Xiangyun in "Dream of the Red Chamber" has a line about chrysanthemums: "Counting down, there is no one more proud than you, looking around, who has my soulmate." This can be used to describe Jiang Shiquan's gift to Tang Xianzu. Ancient literati, such as Feng Jing's "Self-Preface," followed by Liu Xiaobiao's "Self-Preface," followed by Wang Zhong's "Self-Preface," "What is the same in one, three different in four," has long been praised by literary researchers. Shiquan said in "The Dream of Linchuan," borrowing the words of Yu Sangu: "...It is only for thoroughly understanding the myriad feelings that I predict that few will understand the article here; therefore, I spend two cold windows and lamp oil, writing down the tears and laughter of your talented person!" Isn't this clearly declaring himself to be Linchuan's soulmate? Feng Xiaoqing read a poem about The Peony Pavilion: "The cold rain knocks on the window, unbearable to hear, I pick up the lamp and leisurely read The Peony Pavilion. There are also fools in the world like me, why is it only Xiaoqing who is sad!" This Xiaoqing and Yu Ergu of Loujiang may both be representatives of soulmates created by literati.

Shiquan's "Self-Preface" to "The Dream of Linchuan" says: "It is a pity that the woman from Loujiang died for the public, and her insight was far beyond that of the rulers at the time." It is not necessary to have this person, and it is not necessary to have this event. He originally spoke of dreams to satirize the world and expressed his feelings for a literary soulmate.

He also has a poem inscribed on "The Dream of Linchuan":

"Corrupt scholars talk about principles, difficult to cure the customs;

Lower scholars speak of emotions, the style is bitter and astringent;

Self-interest is devoid of righteousness, and seduction is rewarded;

The world is covered with coral nets, the creator pulls the puppet strings;

Beyond prosperity, decay, life, and death, the old man folds his hands and watches for a long time."

Reading this poem can further clarify the true purpose of Shiquan's creation of "The Dream of Linchuan," and Shiquan's views and thoughts on literary and artistic creation are also fully revealed.

Note: Jiang Shiquan, a native of Qianshan, courtesy name Xinyu, also known as Yuan Sheng, was born in the third year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty (1725) and died in the fifty-first year of Qianlong (1786). He wrote "Zhongya Tang Poetry Collection," which is known for its narration, with a beautiful, poignant, and moving style. His "Nine Dramas of the Red Snow House" are especially popular. Furthermore, according to Zheng Zhenduo's "Outline of Literature," Tang Xianzu died in 1622, which is the thirty-ninth year of Wanli of the Ming Dynasty. It is unknown which is correct. (Editor)

### Ladies

— Xu Zhengbai

The Ming History's Biography says he…“...lived in the Jade Tea Hall amidst a chaotic collection of literary and historical texts, chickens and pigs running around the courtyard, leisurely singing and writing. Burdens in his heart manifested as lyrics and plays. His four dreams, though nostalgic and moved by worldly affairs, ultimately sought to wash away worldly dust and return to nothingness, realizing the great view of emptiness, which is also lamentable…”

Jiang Shiquan, based on this account, composed a twenty-act play – “The Dream of Linchuan” – which includes: Rejecting the Dart, Concealing Treachery, Harmonious Dream, Imagining the Dream, Changing the Dream, Star Change, Resisting the Memorial, the Rebellion of Bo, Sending the Officer, Dying for the Dream, Achieving Office, Lame, Continuing the Dream, Double Bite, Sending a Song, Visiting the Dream, Gathering the Dream, Flower Celebration, Speaking of Dreams, and Completing the Dream, divided into two volumes.

The play depicts Yu Ergu, a woman from Loujiang, becoming obsessed with reading “The Peony Pavilion,” even dying for love and her spirit visiting Linchuan. Interspersed within are contemporary events (such as Bo Chengen’s rebellion and Mei Guozhen’s suppression of bandits), as well as Linchuan’s educational achievements in Xuwen and his political accomplishments in Suichang. The final scenes feature characters from “The Return of the Soul,” “The Purple Hairpin,” “The Dream of Handan,” and “The Dream of Nanke” gathering in the Jade Tea Hall, each sharing their dreams. The final two acts, “Speaking of Dreams” and “Completing the Dream,” exquisitely convey the essence of Linchuan’s plays.

The epilogue of the act “Completing the Dream” states: “The jade camellias before the hall are now withered, and all four dreams vanish into one dream. It is lamentable that this dream world is difficult to bear and difficult to complete.”

The ghost in “The Return of the Soul” (originally Du Liniang but replaced by Yu Ergu), the knight in “The Purple Hairpin” (played by Princess Huo), the immortal in “The Dream of Handan” (played by Mr. Lu), and the Buddha in “The Dream of Nanke” (played by Chunyu Lang) – these represent the meaning within the dream of return. In the view of ordinary people, the judge (the true ghost in “The Return of the Soul”), the man in yellow (the true knight in “The Purple Hairpin”), Lü Weng (the true immortal in “The Dream of Handan”), and Qi Xuan (the true Buddha in “The Dream of Nanke”) should appear on stage. However, the ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas are merely the masters within the play, not the masters in the author's intention. Du, Huo, Lu, and Chun are puppets on stage, while the judge, the man in yellow, etc., are the puppeteers pulling the strings. The former four are people within the dream, while the latter four are people outside the dream. Since the meaning of the play is based on ghosts, knights, immortals, and Buddhas, the subjective masters belong to the judge, the man in yellow, etc., while Miss Du, Princess Huo, etc., are only objective masters. Linchuan’s genius and his ideas surpass the ordinary playwrights' limitations, which can be understood through meticulous examination of such details.

Shiquan and Xianzu, though separated by generations, shared the same heart because their talents were alike and their circumstances not too different. Shi Xiangyun in “Dream of the Red Chamber” had a line about chrysanthemums: “Counting them all, there is no one more proud than you; looking around, who is my confidant?” This can be adapted for Jiang Shiquan to gift Tang Xianzu. Ancient literati, like Feng Jing’s “Self-Preface,” followed by Liu Xiaobiao’s “Self-Preface,” and then Wang Zhong’s “Self-Preface,” what constitutes “one same and three different,” has long been praised by literary researchers. Shiquan, in “The Dream of Linchuan,” borrows the words of Yu Sangu to say: “… It is only because you see through the myriad sentiments that I surmise few will understand the article here; therefore, spending two cold window nights and burning orchid oil, writing out the tears and laughter of a talented person!” Isn’t this clearly declaring himself to be Linchuan’s confidant? Feng Xiaoqing, upon reading a poem about The Peony Pavilion, wrote: “The cold rain knocks on the window, unbearable to hear, I pick up the lamp and leisurely read The Peony Pavilion. There are also fools in the world like me, why is it only Xiaoqing who is sad!” This Xiaoqing and Yu Ergu of Loujiang may both be representatives of soulmates created by literati.

Shiquan’s “Self-Preface” to “The Dream of Linchuan” states: “It is a pity that the woman from Loujiang died for the public, and her discernment far exceeded that of the rulers at the time.” It is not necessary to have this person, and it is not necessary to have this event. He originally spoke of dreams to satirize the world and expressed his feelings for a literary confidant.

He also wrote a poem inscribed on “The Dream of Linchuan”:

“Corrupt Confucians talk of principles, difficult to cure the common folk;

Lower scholars speak of emotions, the style is bitter and astringent;

Hypocrites lack righteous thoughts, they eagerly praise lewd verses;

The human world is covered with coral nets, the creator pulls the puppet strings;

Transcending prosperity, decay, life, and death, the old man folds his hands and watches for a long time.”

Reading this poem further clarifies the true purpose behind Shiquan’s creation of “The Dream of Linchuan,” and Shiquan’s views and thoughts on literary and artistic creation are also fully revealed.

Note: Jiang Shiquan, a native of Qianshan, courtesy name Xinyu, also known as Yuan Sheng, was born in the third year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty (1725) and died in the fifty-first year of Qianlong (1786).

### Preparatory Office of the Municipal Museum of Art: Preface to the Centennial Painting Exhibition

— With Explanatory Notes

Some might say: Scholars of painting boast of the Tang and Song dynasties, yet the Museum of Art uniquely champions the recent century. Does this mean their vision is regressive? I say, yes and no! Poetry, even reaching Du Fu, attained sainthood. Yet Du Fu said, "Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo were in the style of their time, not belittling today's people while loving the ancients." Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo were less than a century before Du Fu, yet the decline of their style was like a river breaking its banks and rushing downward daily. Du Fu lamented this and sought to revive it, boldly taking on the mission of promoting the way of poetry from Yu to the Rites. Yet he did not loudly praise the Han and Wei dynasties, but uniquely championed not belittling Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo. Why? It is to draw near, taking what everyone is accustomed to knowing and seeing as a benchmark for study and correction. It is like a long journey, where one must ascend from the lowest point to reach Mount Tai and view all under heaven. If one has not climbed Mount Juolai but first attempts to scale the summit of Mount Dai, lacking wings to rely on leaping to surpass the peak, I do not believe they will not break their arms and legs, falling into a ditch!

Is it not the same with painting? Today, people boast of Tang painting. Tang took Wang Wei as the Southern School. Since the Song dynasty, how many people can speak of Wang Wei's authentic works? Li Sixun was taken as the Northern School. Since the Song dynasty, how many people can speak of Li Sixun? Descending to the Five Dynasties, the traces of Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran should be visible. Yet the scarcity of Jing Hao and Guan Tong's authentic works is like Wang Wei and Li Sixun. Dong Yuan and Ju Ran are more numerous. Those that can be counted are fewer than ten in all the vastness of the world. The uncertainty of authenticity has been debated and recorded throughout history, much like debating the Rites. To boast of Tang and Song dynasties is like a blind man feeling an elephant, taking a part for the whole. How can one not be confused?

Song painting flourished after the Taiping Xingguo era, reaching a millennium now. The flourishing of painters doubled that of the Tang dynasty. Yet Mi Fu already made the "No Li" argument (Li Cheng of Yingqiu became a successful candidate, about one hundred and thirty years before Mi Fu.) Descending to Mi Fu and Su Shi, they are also difficult to find. Since the opening of the Qing Palace Museum, famous paintings from the Southern Song dynasty have begun to appear to the world. Yet without scholars of great insight and extensive reading, it is insufficient to examine their origins and determine their authenticity. Thus, to view the authentic works of the Tang and Song dynasties is like climbing the summit of Mount Tai. The Yuan dynasty is the Tianmen of Mount Tai. Its changing clouds, lush trees, and rugged rocks are easily seen even from Mount Juolai. From the early Ming dynasty to the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, four hundred years is like Mount Juolai of Mount Tai. Since the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods, the recent century is like Beiman Mountain, attached to Mount Tai but barren and vulgar, seemingly unapproachable. Yet the villagers and herdsmen of the nearby areas all know Beiman Mountain. They visit it in the evening and reside there in the morning. Every stream and every rock are well-known to them. Can those who admire Mount Tai leap over Beiman Mountain to reach the summit? The history of painting in the recent century awaits our generation to take this path to ascend to the Tang and Song dynasties. This is known without the need for wisdom!

Moreover, the Tang and Song dynasties each existed for several hundred years. The families famous for painting, those with dramatic traces that can be accounted for, number less than several dozen each. The Yuan dynasty existed for eighty years. The famous families with dramatic traces that can be accounted for number no more than several dozen. The Ming dynasty existed for two hundred years. Those that can be accounted for number no more than a hundred or so. The Qing dynasty existed for three hundred years. Those that can be accounted for number no more than two hundred. From the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods to the Republic of China, only a century has passed. Yet those whose names can be listed, whose works can be seen as attached to the ranks of famous families, number more than three hundred! Why were the famous families of the past few and refined, while those of today are numerous and mixed? It is simply that the recent era is easy to know, while the distant era is easy to fade.

Moreover, Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran are mentioned together, yet they are separated by nearly a century. The Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty are also separated by nearly a century. Descending to Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, and Qiu Ying, Qiu Ying and Shen Zhou are also separated by nearly a century. The Four Wangs, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping are mentioned together. Yun Shouping and Wang Shimin are also separated by several decades. During these periods, the multitude of painters flourished like spring grass, not just transmitted by Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Huang Quan, Wang Wei, Ni Zan, Wu Zhen, the Four Wangs, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping. This is the weeding out of the era. The era is like a sieve, and painters are like sand. After sifting the sand to find gold, only a few remain within a century. From the Xianfeng period to today, another century has passed. The flourishing of painters is like spring grass. After sifting the sand to find gold, how many can remain? How many can take the place of the Four Wangs, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping to serve as a stepping stone to the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties? This is what we do not know. To boast of the distant while ignoring the near, I do not know if it is possible. Thus, the Museum of Art initiated the Centennial Painting Exhibition and asked me to write a preface, along with the following explanatory notes:

1.  From the Xianfeng reign to the 36th year of the Republic of China, only ninety-seven years have passed. Liu Yanchong and Fei Xiaolou both died in the late Daoguang period. Thus, the chronology actually begins in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign. In terms of eras, it begins with the first year of the Xianfeng reign to clarify the details.

2.  Since the last century, famous families are like a vast sea. Like trawling the sea for coral, it is difficult to avoid missing some. How can there not be virtuous people in both bustling cities and remote villages? The knowledge of our colleagues is shallow, and what is missed is even more. Since this exhibition is initiated by the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Municipal Museum of Art, those famous figures who have lived in Shanghai are given priority, and other famous figures are briefly introduced.

3.  This exhibition is limited by the venue. The maximum number of exhibits is no more than three hundred. They are listed in the catalog in order of the number of strokes in their surnames, with brief biographies for easy reference.

4.  The purpose of this exhibition is for public study and criticism. Therefore, the exhibits are selected to ensure that each artist has representative works. For artists with abundant works and easily obtainable collections, such as Ren Bonian, Wu Changshuo, etc., the selection is simplified.

5.  In addition to the curators' dedicated collection efforts, we hope collectors will provide more exhibits, especially rare fine pieces from lesser-known artists. If you are willing to lend exhibits, please contact the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Municipal Museum of Art at 139 South Shaanxi Road to obtain the exhibit guidelines and forms.

6.  Exhibits should primarily be mounted scrolls. Due to display considerations, hand scrolls and album leaves will be minimized.

7.  This exhibition is named the "Centennial Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition." However, there are too many calligraphers in the past century. Therefore, this exhibition will focus on "calligraphers' paintings" and "painters' calligraphy." Other calligraphers will have to be omitted.

8.  This exhibition encourages audience criticism. If you would like to submit written comments, please send them to the Preparatory Office for selection and publication into a special collection.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 342

— Ye Jingfeng

Around dusk, the four people who went out to scout returned. Liu was the first to come back, followed by Du Er and Liu Wu half an hour later. They all looked tired but excited. Although the three people's reports had some differences, most of them were not important. Only two points were worth noting: (1) The Japanese army's general headquarters and the special operations unit (secret agents and plainclothes officers) command center were not located in Changping city. Although the exact location was not clear, it could be determined that it was in a small town at the intersection of the Shahe and western Changping lines. This was a military secret, so of course, it was impossible for the scouts to find out at once. (2) It was confirmed that the Japanese invaders had chosen the second dog day, which was August 8th, to launch the offensive on Kou.

I cannot explain how the local people were disturbed. In short, everything can be summarized by the words "suffering" and "pain." However, there was one special characteristic of the people's behavior: despite the low cultural level of this small place, almost below zero, the local workers dared to say that there was not a single traitor. On the contrary, all the people, regardless of gender or age, were truly able to act on the words "Resist Japan": those who could leave had already left, and those who could not leave absolutely refused to be tempted by foreign traitors or threatened by Japanese ruffians. The strong men who were forced into service would not move unless they were beaten, and even if they did move, they would not work hard. The women who were captured would always cry and resist. It was truly not easy for these untrained, unorganized civilians to passively resist under the threat of iron hooves and bayonets.

After the lights were lit, "Zero Four" was still nowhere to be seen. Although I knew he would not cause trouble, I was still worried about him because he had a bold way of doing things. After speaking with Mr. W again at ten o'clock, "Zero Four" was still nowhere to be found. It wasn't until midnight, when I was preparing the telecommunications equipment to connect with Panyang Tokyo, that I suddenly heard a low-pitched sound outside the window. I lowered my voice and exchanged code words with Liu Wu, who was on duty. Then, I saw a tall, staggering figure enter the house, followed by a smaller figure. There were no lights in the room, so it was darker than outside. From the inside room, it was even darker, so I could still see the movements outside.

"Secretary-General." Although his voice tried to sound calm and respectful, it could not hide the tone of joy.

"Come in." I greeted him, and at the same time, the coded call sign I sent out was waiting for a response. (342)

Idle Talk

### Drama and Reality

— Shilang

The film "The Fake Phoenix and the Empty Mandarin Duck" was temporarily suspended during the preview due to the involvement of barbers, who protested against it.

If we are not forgetful, this is not the first time that a movie theater in Shanghai has been attacked for the same reason.

Before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road was not only wrecked, but even the films were burned.

Originally, drama and film should not be separated from reality. What they reflect is a part of life and society, and the characters they portray are living archetypes in society. Gogol's "The Government Inspector" is still being performed in Meixian, Guangdong. The hospital director's embezzlement and bribery in "Transformation" can still be seen everywhere. Is the Hou Chaozong in "The Peach Blossom Fan" not still clearly visible today?

Therefore, those with calm minds should not be overly demanding of the reflection of reality in films and dramas, thinking that this has hurt someone or satirized someone!

The central issue is that if the content of the drama or film distorts the facts, deliberately fabricates rumors and slanders, then protests should be raised.

For example, in American films, there are often scenes that insult Chinese people and misunderstand Chinese customs. We should not only protest, but also clearly point out the errors.

Looking at films and dramas from this perspective may avoid many unnecessary disputes.

### The "Mystery" of Flying Saucers

— Yu Ying

Editor's note: This publication published the truth about "flying saucers" yesterday. Today, we are publishing Mr. Yu Ying's "Mystery" of flying saucers to help readers understand what the "flying saucers" that caused a stir in the United States are all about.

Americans are keen on exaggerating the power of the atomic bomb, as if they are all afflicted with atomic disease. On the one hand, this naturally shows the American's vigor, wealth, and willingness to research new things. On the other hand, because the Second World War had just ended, everyone was terrified by the cruelty of the war, so they had to use more cruel fantasies to numb themselves.

We can also view the recent busy work of the American government and public on the "flying saucer mystery" in the same way.

The so-called "flying saucer," after countless observations and the pursuit of many planes, was finally proven to be just one of the high-altitude weather measuring devices. The structure is fragile, almost like paper, and the raw material is obviously some kind of tin foil. According to Brigadier General Remer, commander of the Eighth Air Force in Texas, "It doesn't seem to have anything special."

Therefore, the previously widespread speculations, such as (1) a foreign-designed secret germ weapon, (2) a new type of army rocket, (3) a space ship, etc., have all become "self-deprecating" jokes.

A few tin foil "flying saucers" excited the American government and public for many days. Everyone was a little suspicious and panicked. Its power was too great. However, after being exposed, this is not the power of "flying saucers." It is precisely because the destructive power of war is too great, and the atomic bomb is still in the hands of Americans. Judging others by themselves, they cannot help but worry every day that other countries will invent some unorthodox tricks, which is why "flying saucers" appeared. In fact, this is just the beginning. Before "flying saucers," haven't there been rumors of "rockets" and the like along the American coast?

Therefore, to investigate the true mystery of "flying saucers," it is not enough to simply study its structure and analyze its inner workings. What is important is to clarify why most Americans are so enthusiastic about "flying saucers" today? All the embellishments, rumors, suspicions, exaggerations, and emphases actually stem from one reason: the disharmony between the allied countries after the war has led to this. And the true mystery of "flying saucers" lies here.

### Talking about the Three Elders of Drumming

— Drummer

Finally, let me talk about Liu Baoquan.

Baoquan's singing of Beijing-style drum music can be said to be universally praised. Baoquan came to Shanghai for the first time at the New World. After the Bingwu year, although I had heard him in Peiping, he had not yet enjoyed great fame. Between the Xinhai and Renzi years, in Tianjin, people greatly praised him. During my leisure time, I often went to the New World with my nephews and nieces. The first day at the New World, I went with my wife. He sang "Li Kui Seizes the Fish," which was Baoquan's forte. A certain great writer said it was "The Biography of Xiang Yu." "A scholar should be looked at with new eyes after three days," let alone after several years. I listened for fifteen days and believed that his singing style was truly different from others. Among them, the two episodes of "Battle of Changsha" and the two episodes of "Ningwuguan" were the most outstanding. Indeed, Quan's spear and sword stances originally had the loyalty and bravery of Guan Yu and Zhou Cang. Although both were heroic and majestic, Zhuang Mu's life always had some arrogance. Zhou's family was loyal and righteous, from the old mother to the loyal servant, each with their own spirit, each with their own thoughts, each with their own tone. Baoquan's singing style, the shortness of the hero's breath, and the length of the children's feelings, can be regarded as considerate and thorough, just like Shi Nai'an's writing of the Water Margin characters, with various different writing styles. In the Battle of Changsha, the Tao Yuanming brothers were energetic, and Guan Yu, although proud, righteously released Huang Zhong, with a heart of cherishing talent. Baoquan also sang it vividly.

Baoquan came to Shanghai three times. The second time, he sang "The Great Western Chamber." Others sang this, although the words and sentences were completely the same, they were far less good than Baoquan. First, he had a strong breath; second, he had enough mouth strength; third, his pronunciation was clear and bright; fourth, he depicted it vividly and accurately. The beginning was like painting a delicate girl, and then gradually the two girls answered each other, like good birds playing in the sunshine, the tone gradually changed from slow to fast, like a sudden rain hitting plantain leaves, the faster the clearer. It was like what Bai Juyi said in his poem, "Large pearls and small pearls fall on a jade plate," the plate is round and the pearls roll, done in one breath, without a single word lagging behind. Hongniang enters the Western Chamber, the pace is first urgent, then slow and humorous. Others hear it and think they can breathe a sigh of relief, but they don't know that it is precisely the critical moment, the more humorous the words, the more nervous the spirit, a small Hongniang, about to come out. Singing to this point, it is almost divine. However, the drum king's diction is not fluent, which is inversely proportional to Jianchen's deep knowledge of literature and art, which can be regarded as a minor flaw in perfection.

### Where's the Fire?

— Hesheng

A certain person had a wife who was very lazy. Every day before he went to work, she had to lie in bed. Therefore, he was thinking of an opportunity to correct her. One day, after he arrived at the office, he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to bring an important official document, so he hurried home. At that time, the sun was already high in the sky, but his wife was still sleeping soundly in bed. He shouted loudly downstairs: "Fire! Fire!" His wife woke up in a daze, hurriedly put on her clothes, and ran downstairs as if flying, asking her husband: "Where's the fire? Where's the fire?" Her husband replied leisurely: "Besides our house, everyone else has fire!"

### American Miscellany

Concentration Camps Become Safe Havens for Japanese

In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese Americans were still free to move about. However, a group of Japanese ate American food but spied for the Japanese, preparing a network of spies for the Japanese navy to land in the United States. There was no other way but to put them in concentration camps. This benefited the Chinese. The businesses run by Japanese Americans, such as restaurants and farms, were sold to the Chinese at low prices. The United States specially built new Japanese settlements for the Japanese. Not only was accommodation free, but even food was free. There was also a supply of milk to eat. In addition to eating and living for free, the U.S. government provided pocket money. The U.S. government did nothing less than become a dry father for the Japanese Americans. The Americans could be said to be recognizing a thief as a son.

Although the Japanese Americans were confined to concentration camps, they had considerable freedom of movement. It was stipulated that they could enter the city twice a week. They could ask for leave to go out at any time for special matters. There was a Japanese American concentration camp outside Chandler, Arizona. Every time I entered the city, there were always half a busload of Japanese girls. Although they were born in the United States, they still had Eastern charm. They talked and laughed loudly in the car. Japanese women have always been happy, so the life in the concentration camp must have been quite good, so they laughed so vigorously. When American children saw Japanese people, they pointed and shouted Japs, Japs. The Japanese did not admit that they were Japs, which is Japanese, just as China did not admit that it was Chink but rather Chinese. Because the Cantonese are particularly short, I mistakenly thought that my classmate Guan Jiezhen was Japanese.

The Japanese Americans were divided into two major factions: pro-American and pro-Japanese. The two factions often fought in concentration camps. The government allowed the pro-American faction to join the army, perform meritorious service, and atone for their sins. The Japanese Americans who fought in Italy performed immortal feats. The commander of the Japanese American troops, including the commander, was entirely Japanese. Before Japan surrendered, most Japanese Americans had regained their freedom and returned to their old jobs, engaged in farming. (18)

### The U.S. State Department - The Overall Hub for Implementing National Policy and Planning Diplomacy

— Baoqing

The new building on Virginia Avenue and 21st Street in Washington D.C. is the center of U.S. diplomacy - the location of the State Department. The State Department was established in 1789. The eight staff members at that time have expanded to nearly eight thousand internal staff members and more than eleven thousand stationed ambassadors, consuls, and staff abroad. The financial budget has also increased to 178 million U.S. dollars. Because it used to manage both internal and external administration, it is called the State Department. Although a separate Department of the Interior has now been established, it still handles matters related to the national seal, the promulgation of laws, and so on. It holds the leading position among all departments.

Marshal Marshall oversees diplomatic administration. Under him is Under Secretary of State Lovett, a banker who has served as Under Secretary of the Air Force for the Department of the Army. He is highly organized and is responsible for assisting the Secretary of State in handling matters related to the formulation of diplomatic policies, receiving foreign guests, and supervising the implementation of diplomatic policies. He can also act as the head of the department and often advances and retreats with the President and Secretary of State. There is also a dedicated consultant, currently held by Mr. Cohen.

There are six Assistant Secretaries of State: Major General Hildring is in charge of the Occupied Areas, but it is rumored that he will soon leave office; Clayton is in charge of International Economic Affairs; Banden is in charge of Public and Cultural Relations; Penlifu is in charge of Administrative Affairs; Amar is in charge of Latin American Affairs; Dunn is in charge of European, Asian, and African Affairs. Under these are six divisions, including Europe, the Far East, the Near East and Africa, the Americas, Political Affairs, and Intelligence, which govern 24 sections, including the British Empire, China, Japan, South Asia, the Near East, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and so on.

Marshall has also established a Diplomatic Policy Design Committee within the department, chaired by Mr. Gengnan, deputy director of the Diplomatic Group of the Army University, with five experts serving as committee members and professional diplomat Savage serving as executive secretary. Gengnan is an expert on Soviet issues, so it can be predicted where the focus of future U.S. diplomacy will be. The committee's job is to study and determine fundamental diplomatic policies and their implementation guidelines, and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. Like the general staff department of the General Staff Headquarters, the committee's work is directed by the Deputy Secretary of State. In the past, the State Department's task was only to be responsible for diplomatic administration, representing the government in implementing national policy in the international arena. Now it is planning diplomatic decisions. Moreover, Marshall is preparing to take over the control of the U.S. occupied areas of Germany and Japan from the military. This action changes the 158-year tradition of the State Department and directly intervenes in actual administration. He is currently planning and will implement aid to European countries!

It is worth noting that the U.S. President, based on national policy, can handle major diplomatic affairs and decide diplomatic policies. This was most evident in the power of the White House when President Roosevelt was in office. Other government departments, such as the Treasury Department, the Department of the Army and Navy, and the U.S. delegations in international organizations, can also perform diplomatic affairs as required by their duties, but this must be in contact with and under the guidance of the State Department.

In the State Department, the Far East Division has the greatest relationship with our country. The division was established in 1908. The Director-General manages the diplomatic affairs of Far Eastern countries such as China, Japan, and the border countries. The three deputy directors are responsible for the Far East, economic affairs, diplomacy, processing and investigating Chinese and Japanese diplomacy, and training Far Eastern diplomatic talents, protecting overseas Chinese, and so on. The current Director is Mr. Fan Xuande, who has reached the end of his service in the department this year and will be sent abroad. The United States values experts, so diplomatic personnel also pay attention to professionalization. Marshal Marshall is actively reorganizing diplomatic personnel.

New Type of Musical Instrument

Anyone who can now play an ordinary accordion can play a large organ, but at present it is not easy to use this new instrument in concerts. It weighs more than a ton and must be pulled by a truck. When used, the player presses the keys of an ordinary accordion, and the keys are connected to the reeds of a large organ, and the reeds are activated to make sound. Its inventor, a French youth, is holding concerts in Paris with this instrument.

Lake Water Boils

Recently, ten tons of surplus wartime metallic sodium were dumped into Lake Lenore, Washington, causing the lake water to boil and produce huge clouds of steam. The violent interaction of water and sodium added seventeen tons of lye to the lake, while decomposing nearly eight tons of water to release hydrogen and oxygen. The burning hydrogen and oxygen then combined in the air to produce a cone-shaped water vapor curtain weighing more than seven tons, hundreds of feet high and visible from miles away. This batch of sodium was dumped into the lake because it could not be transported to industrial users.

Scientific Essay

### The Epiphyllum (Middle)

— Jia Zuzhang

Now, let us use a more scientific method to describe the morphology of the Epiphyllum.

In the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, when I was in Yongjia, on November 3rd, Mr. Wang Mu, an agricultural expert, gifted me an Epiphyllum flower that had bloomed the previous night. This was the first time I saw a real Epiphyllum flower, and to this day, it remains the only time I have seen a real Epiphyllum flower. For future reference, I made the following record at the time:

"The flower, when unopened and closed, resembles a goose's head (a bloomed flower is closed). The tube is slender and long, resembling a flower stalk, curved in the center, with the throat facing upwards. The surface is herbaceous red, and the lower part of the ovary is slightly green. The outer side of the tube is sparsely covered with short, small scales, which become denser and longer towards the upper end. The outer side of the throat has two or three layers, totaling more than ten pieces, long, wide, and light in color, resembling sepals. Inside are the petals, white with a slight green tint, totaling about twenty pieces. The ones on the inner side are wider and thinner, obovate, with pointed tips and slight mucronate tips. The veins are faint, appearing like fine gauze.

"There are numerous stamens, arranged in two groups, upper and lower: the lower group is scattered from the curved part of the tube to the bottom of the throat; the upper group is arranged in parallel on all four walls from the bottom of the throat to the opening, where they become free; the shortest distance between the attachments of the upper and lower groups is three to five centimeters. The filaments are tender white and slender—the ones growing on the ventral side are shorter, and the upper group growing on the ventral side curves upwards. The anthers are pale yellow, straight, facing the ventral side, and the pollen is spherical.

"The ovary is inferior, with one chamber, parietal placentation, containing numerous inverted ovules, lenticular and thin, with slender funiculi. The style is slender, tender white, hollow; the apex is divided into fourteen segments, which are the stigmas, some of which are further divided into two at the tips; resembling sea anemones or the tentacles of octopuses, about one and a half centimeters long, tender yellow.

"The entire flower is thirty-one centimeters long, the petals are six to seven centimeters long, and three to three and a half centimeters wide..."

At that time, for ease of observation, I bisected the flower into two halves, and after observation, I pressed it into a herbarium specimen, which is still preserved to this day.

That afternoon, I went to Mr. Wang's residence again, and saw that the flower was a cactus of the Cereus type, but the stem was harder and did not hang upside down, with a height of more than two chi.

Plants of the cactus family are native to the tropics and subtropics of the Americas. In climates like Shanghai, they cannot grow in winter. The fact that they can bloom in Yongjia in November means that they must be protected in a greenhouse in Shanghai. The reason why Epiphyllums are not very common is because of this. Moreover, because they are not easy to grow here, each Epiphyllum branch cannot bloom every year, which is how the saying "blooms once every fifty years" originated.

We unfortunately do not know exactly where in the Americas the Epiphyllum originated, when it was introduced to the East, when it was introduced to our country, and where it was first cultivated.
