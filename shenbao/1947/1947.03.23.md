Editorial Perspective on the German Question

The main topic of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is to resolve the German question, draft a peace treaty with Germany, and then convene a peace conference with Germany to complete this major post-war world treaty and restore Europe to normalcy as soon as possible. However, the so-called German question encompasses many complex issues, which are difficult to resolve individually and even more difficult to resolve as a whole. In addition, each of the four foreign ministers has their own solution in their wallets, and if they are submitted to the meeting, they will all be different, because they are all formulated according to their own national interests. Therefore, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference began discussing the German question from the second day, and to this day, only waves have been seen on the meeting table, and the

### Domestic Quota Set at Ninety-Seven; Three Slots Reserved for Translators in the US; Translator Study Abroad Examination

Domestic Quota Set at Ninety-Seven; Three Slots Reserved for Translators in the US

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Ministry of Education has set the translator study abroad examination to be held simultaneously in seven districts starting on April 1st, as mentioned in yesterday's report. Regarding the quota of 100, there has been much speculation since a certain newspaper published a message that 80 of them had been internally decided by the Ministry of Education. Translators in Shanghai once sent a letter to the Ministry of Education to inquire. This reporter specifically interviewed the spokesperson of the capital of education for detailed inquiries. According to the person in charge's response, according to the previous statistics of the National Foreign Affairs Bureau, there were more than 3,300 translators in the National Foreign Affairs Bureau. It was originally planned to select 360 people based on the ratio of one-tenth of the candidates. Later, due to the government's foreign exchange situation, it first approved the selection of 100 people. At first, the qualification restrictions were stricter, but later, at the request of the translators, it was approved to be relaxed. All translators with Foreign Affairs Bureau translator service certificates can apply for the exam as long as they have not committed any faults. These 100 places are the ratio of the total number of more than 3,600 in the country to 100. Therefore, three places are reserved for the 100 translators of the Foreign Affairs Bureau who are currently in the United States but have not been able to return to the country (based on the ratio of 360 to 100, the 100 in the US can occupy three places), so that they can study and study abroad, and they will also be selected according to the application method and procedures. Therefore, the examination of 100 domestic translators will actually admit 97 people, and the remaining three will be selected from translators of the Foreign Affairs Bureau in the United States, and there is no internal decision of other places.

### Ministry of Education Entrusts Peking and Tsinghua Universities to Handle Publicly Funded Study Abroad Lectures on Behalf; Upon Completion of the Lectures, Overseas Procedures Can Be Arranged

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Because there are still more than 30 publicly funded students who passed this year's examination in Beiping, the Ministry of Education specially entrusted Peking and Tsinghua Universities to handle lectures on their behalf.

### Ministry of Education is Studying Detailed Rules for Printing Nationally Designated Textbooks

[Our Nanjing Airmail] The Ministry of Education has already decided to open up the publishing rights for nationally designated textbooks and announced the printing methods. Recently, due to soaring costs and low price limits, only three publishers have submitted applications to the Ministry of Education requesting to print, and none of them have attached sample books, and have not identified the printing area, subjects, and minimum printing quantity, so the Ministry of Education has no way to issue licenses. There are many problems of this kind that were not explicitly stipulated in the printing methods previously issued by the Ministry of Education. In order to be detailed, it has specially handed over to Liu Yingshi, Jiang Fuxing, Zhao Shiqing and the relevant department chiefs to jointly formulate implementation details, which are currently being studied in detail. It is reported that the writing, drawing and typesetting design of the old printed versions of the Seven United Offices were originally invested by the Seven United Offices. According to the law, they should be regarded as the property of the Seven United Offices. Other publishers cannot copy and reprint them in the same style, and must design and produce their own plates. The Ministry of Education has already paid attention to this issue, and hopes that publishers can each display their skills and compete with each other. It is also learned that the Seven United Offices has recently hired legal counsel to study in detail how to protect various legal rights in accordance with the Civil Code and the Copyright Law, so as to avoid being subjected to violence, illegal misinterpretation and infringement, and to initiate administrative or civil and criminal lawsuits to recover considerable losses when necessary.

### Representatives of Self-Funded Students in This City Return to Nanjing After Petitioning; Meeting Scheduled to Discuss Relief Issues for Fellow Students

Three representatives of the second term of self-funded students in this city, Ling Xiang, Zhao Yiwei, and Chen Guozhong, went to Nanjing for the third time on the 16th of this month to petition, requesting a fixed exchange rate for studying abroad, improved exchange procedures, and the resumption of issuing study abroad passports, etc., and returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 21st. It is said that this time the petition to Nanjing focused on the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. When the representatives went to petition, they were received by Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, who promised to submit the petition to the meeting for discussion and support, and immediately transferred it to the Executive Yuan for handling. Next, they went to the Supreme National Defense Conference, where Secretary-General Wang Chonghui represented them and said: The National Defense Conference expressed great sympathy for this case. Once the Legislative Yuan submits the case to the meeting, it will be immediately submitted for discussion. Secretary-General Wang also said: He also expressed deep sympathy and concern and will assist. Then, they went to the Legislative Yuan, where Secretary-General Wu Shangying received them and said that since the case had been passed by the Legislative Yuan, it would be sent to the National Defense Conference for review and then to the Executive Yuan for execution. The representatives then went to the Executive Yuan, where Secretary-General Jiang represented them and said that the matter was awaiting the submission of the bill from the Legislative Yuan for discussion, and would be executed after a decision was made. Finally, they went to the National Political Council, where the resident committee members promised to submit the proposal to the general meeting for discussion. On the afternoon of the 18th, the Nanjing Alumni Association in Nanjing hosted Chinese and foreign reporters and distributed them to two Central Committee members to ask for their assistance in urging the government to approve and implement various requests as soon as possible. Later, they went to the Ministry of Education to contact Zhou Hongjing, Director of the Higher Education Department, to discuss relief measures for students from other places stranded in Nanjing and Shanghai, but the Ministry of Education has not yet given a specific response to this point. The meeting is scheduled to be held on the evening of the 26th for further discussion.

### Tsinghua After the Rehabilitation (Part II) Mei Yiqi

After the restoration of our school, the departments and programs have been expanded. There are now five colleges and twenty-six departments: The College of Letters has five departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages, Philosophy, History, and Language Anthropology; the College of Science has seven departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Meteorology, and Psychology; the College of Law has four departments: Law, Politics, Economics, and Sociology; the College of Engineering has six departments: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Aeronautics, Chemical Engineering, and Architecture; and the College of Agriculture has four departments: Agronomy, Plant Pathology, Entomology, and Plant Physiology. In terms of administration, in accordance with the Ministry's orders, there are one hundred and eleven sections and offices, including the Academic Affairs Office, the Secretariat, and the Student Affairs Office. The Academic Affairs Office has a Registration Section and a Library. The Secretariat has a Documentation Section, a Cashier Section, a General Affairs Section, and a School Medical Office. There are also a President's Office and an Accounting Office. In addition, there are various committees to assist in the operation of the school. Those belonging to the administrative part include the Appointment Committee, the Engineering Committee, the Library Committee, the Equipment Committee, the Fuel Supply Heating Equipment Committee, the Power Supply Control Committee, the School Scenery Committee, the Publishing Committee, and the University Overview Committee. Those belonging to student life guidance include the Training Committee (divided into three groups to be responsible for: 1. Student food and lodging guidance, 2. Publicly funded and student relief, 3. Student extracurricular activity guidance, etc.) and the First-Year Course Guidance Committee, and the Scholarship Committee. Those belonging to the welfare of colleagues include the Housing and Dormitory Allocation Committee, the Faculty and Staff Mutual Benefit Cooperation Committee, and the Faculty and Staff Consumer Cooperative. With this collective effort, the restoration work of the school can proceed smoothly, which is very gratifying.

The situation of our school after the restoration is roughly as described above. Due to economic difficulties, we can only reach the stage where we can barely work. As for the supplementation and restoration, it is not easy to complete with the manpower and financial resources of several years. Our hope should not be satisfied with restoring the old appearance, but must make it more developed and brilliant, so as to shoulder the mission that Tsinghua should bear. This is why the faculty and staff of our school are still working diligently day and night even today when the school's restoration work is largely completed.

Tsinghua's current problems are the shortage of school buildings (classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, residences, etc.) in terms of material aspects, and the need for a large amount of supplementation of library equipment. In terms of policy, in addition to planning and training a large number of young people, we should also pay attention to the promotion of academic research. This was already implemented before the war and should be promoted further in the future. Because of the capacity of our school, the number of students must be limited in the end, so it is better to focus more on quality and less on quantity, and abandon its breadth and seek its depth. Recent additions to buildings are almost impossible, and housing allocation must be squeezed, but internal equipment must be strengthened, and teachers in various departments must be recruited in many ways, so that those who want to come to our school cannot be accommodated as much as possible, but those who leave our school must have their own expertise. And in terms of academic research, Tsinghua has already made some contributions before the war and during the war of resistance. Future achievements cannot be predicted, but just like planting trees, if you choose good seeds, plant them properly, cultivate and irrigate them, and do your best to maintain them, then spring flowers and autumn fruits will be natural harvests.

In addition, the selection of publicly funded students to study in the United States is a consistent policy of Tsinghua. Issues such as the connection and exchange with foreign academic institutions should also be noted. As for how to implement it, we will plan it in detail in the future and proceed according to the opportunity.

Recently, alumni from various places often have a need to inquire about school affairs and prepare to donate. The alumni's enthusiasm for protecting their alma mater is deeply gratifying. In today's school situation, from a school building to a few books, we welcome large donations. To be more specific, if it is a steel frame on one floor of the new library, or a wooden block floor in the new gymnasium, or an alumni building for alumni receptions, or a certain type of Chinese or Western books, or a certain batch of experimental equipment, if the alumni can donate collectively, donating any one item is enough to be a permanent memorial. The so-called timely righteous act is truly a blessing to infinity.

Furthermore, from the start of the restoration in May of last year to the start of school in mid-October, in these five months, a total of four or five thousand teachers, students, and their families, old and young, moved from Kunming on the southwest border to Beiping and Tianjin, traveling thousands of miles, by land, sea, and air. In terms of our school alone, there were about two thousand teachers and students. Along the way, we received enthusiastic help from alumni and people from all walks of life, so that all of them could arrive safely as scheduled. In addition to describing the restoration of our school, Qi hereby expresses his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of all colleagues.

### Rambling Notes on the Basketball Court

The championship final of the Basketball League Division A1 group last night was unprecedentedly grand in the municipal gymnasium. No less than five or six hundred people were rejected outside the door due to being full. The gymnasium was crowded with people, with almost no space to stand.

Cairo and Giant, two Encas soldiers fought, and both sides focused on defense in the first half, relying only on mid-range shooting to attack. In the second half, Encas controlled the offensive, and V. Kairoski and Ao Chailiao both had good shots close to the basket, and finally defeated Giant by three goals. The defeat of Giant should be attributed to Ye Long's poor performance, with countless shots wasted, and Tao Berlinji's mid-range shooting was also far below the usual standard.

Hualian fought with all its strength against the ever-victorious army of Youlu yesterday, and the situation was not tense.

Da Li went on the court and used all his energy to guard He Lide, and Lao Bao watched Chen Qingjiang, so Hualian occupied the advantage of the ball under the basket and reduced the Shantou team's scoring opportunities.

In the first half, Ren Xiangcheng could not defend Lin Weicong, so Kong Guangyi replaced him. As a result, all three forwards of the Shantou team were bound and no one was shooting. Lao Bao served as a forward and hit every shot, leading 26 to 11 in the first half.

Kong Guangyi's strength was not good in the second half, and Lin Weicong took the opportunity to be active, forcing the score from 33 to 19 to 35 to 26, which was the golden age of the Shantou team.

Wu Chengzhang was restrained by Cai Yanxiong and could not use his skills. Fortunately, Chen Xuechong was steady, so Hualian was not threatened in the second half.

The Shantou team lost to Hualian once, and became equal, waiting for another battle to determine the first seat, but Hualian has a stronger hope of winning the championship. (Changnian)

Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department, will be transferred to Director of the Secretariat of the Import Management Committee, but it is said that Lin's intention to resign is very firm.

### Sellers' Arrogance is Strong; Shanghai Stock Market Prices Decline

The Shanghai stock market saw even more fragile confidence yesterday. With the overall trend gone, sellers' arrogance was overwhelming. In the ten minutes before closing, short sellers were replenishing positions, which seemed firm. Unexpectedly, within five minutes, the price plummeted by 150 yuan and closed at a low price. Absurd rumors, such as the cancellation of spot delivery, were able to become tools for short sellers to cut prices, which shows that people are gradually losing faith in the stock market.

Morning Opening

The morning opening was based on the unreliability of statements such as the collection of cash guarantees and the success of loans. Spot deliveries appeared weak, and short positions in the spot market were replenished and remained stable. After the opening, numbers 198, 133, 102, 224, and 14 all rose, and Diyong Yarn rose to

Spring and Autumn American Modern Sculpture, written by Joseph Piyoan, translated and narrated by Tian: A Story of Human Excitement. In the United States, the construction of many new cities and parks requires sculptures and monumental memorials, so this school of thought is bound to develop. The earliest sculptural statues in Washington were established, such as Brown's "Washington" sculpted at Concord Square in New York, and Word's "Washington" sculpted at the United States Sub-Treasury in New York. Another reason for the progress of the American school is due to the many marble sculptors who returned from Italy, and they brought back many unfinished marble blocks from Carrora. After these superior marbles became American citizens, there was a period when American sculpture was simply Italianized. The greatest American sculptor of the nineteenth century was Augustus Saint Caudens (an American sculptor born in Ireland, 1848-1907). He was born in Dublin, Ireland, his father was French, and his mother was Irish. He went to the United States when he was a child. At the age of twenty, he went abroad to Paris and Italy to study sculpture. His most famous sculptures include "Lincoln" in Lincoln Park, Chicago, "The Puritan" in Springfield, Massachusetts, and "Amor Caritas" in the Luxembourg Gallery in Paris. There is not much imagination in the works of Saint-Gaudens and other contemporary sculptors, however, at the very least, their works have a noble style, so they were very prestigious at the time. Daniel Chester Fench (American sculptor, 1850-1931), George Grey Barnard, Lorado Taft (American sculptor, 1860), Anna V. Huntington represent the American Carpeacix, Rodin (French sculptor, 1840-1917), Meunier, and Barye (French sculptor, 1795-1875). Modern times are especially vernacular. Paul Manship, like Rockwell Kent's paintings, produces beautiful works even in cheap adventures. Here, sculptors residing in our country, such as William Zorack and Gaston Lorack, are contemporary representatives of American sculpture. Other future representatives include Jacob Epstein, Maurice Sterne, Rouben Nakian, Wheeler Williams, Paul Fiene, and many other sculptors living in London. Looking at the people who have worked hard in art in the United States for these two centuries, they have left formal studies and fallen into confusion. Therefore, "Beautiful America"—as we call her—although there have been some achievements, there is not much value. Even American paintings and sculptures have great performances in the catalog, but they are endless Montmartre landscapes, Italian boulevards, Greek, Italian, or Spanish scenery, but rarely "Eastern" or "Western" scenery, and pastoral or plant-related scenes are especially rare. It is unexpected that such a large piece of land has a foreignized spiritual representation. But let's pay attention to the future. Look at those large buildings, streamlined trains, cars, and movies. When modern houses have no big walls, insisting on painting for the walls is a suicidal policy, and repeating the forms of disappearing monuments is also wrong. We should study the United States from the perspective of Americans, then everything will be added to you. "Before I leave, I want to sing a song, praising America. I want to blow the trumpet and sing to all the resting people, For you—the future, I want to sow a seed for your endless national system..." Walt Whitman.

Spring in Caohejing, Wu Jiren: Spring has arrived, and the peaceful sunshine shines on everyone, feeling warm and getting an unspeakable joy. People's spirits will also be excited. People living in the city can take advantage of this bright spring to stroll in the suburbs, breathe some fresh air, and listen to the scenery of spring and the scenery of spring. The Longhua District in West Shanghai, with its ancient pagoda and flourishing incense, goes three miles west from Longhua, takes South Zhongshan Road, and turns to Hu Min Highway. There is Cao Garden, which is managed magnificently. The losses during the period of the fall are still small. The garden is arranged in a tortuous manner, with mountains and rivers, extremely secluded in the garden. Further west, along Cao Bao Road, Huang Garden is also there, covering an area of fifty or sixty acres, obtaining the prototype of West Lake, with a magnificent scale, with pavilions, terraces, buildings, and other scenic spots. Unfortunately, a part of it was destroyed by fire. After this catastrophe, the losses were extremely heavy. Although it is enough to spend money on sightseeing, a piece of desolation is only for mourning. I heard that the owner has plans to renovate it, but the big ones must be in the autumn. Opposite Huang Garden is Kangjian Garden, which is currently engaged in construction. It is said to be a large-scale swimming pool, operated by Mr. Bao Qin Xuan. Returning through Caohejing Street, passing Gongshui Bridge, walking on Guanshengyuan Road, and arriving at Guanshengyuan Farm, the farm is built on the eastern surplus land of the factory, covering an area of forty acres. The plum blossoms are currently in full bloom. There are buildings such as Wangmei Pavilion, Meizhulu, and Green Shade Cottage, all with rural flavors, as well as Cantonese dishes and factory-made cakes. Therefore, tourists gather here to rest.

Tang Dynasty Dance Costume, Mother of Mingyu Pictorial, Liang Desuo Lao Dan: When we talk about pictorials, especially Liangyou Pictorial, we must also talk about Liang Desuo; because he has done a lot of work in large-scale pictorials in the Chinese publishing industry. From "Liangyou", "Dazhong", to "Shidai", three pictorials, especially the period in "Liangyou" was the longest (about eight years). It can be said that it was during his efforts in "Liangyou" that he laid the foundation of Chinese pictorials. If you don't believe it, you can see that from the publication of "Liangyou" to its discontinuation, its sales exceeded other pictorials at the same time. Even the "Dazhong" and "Shidai" that he later edited could not compare with the number of publications of "Liangyou". Desuo's resume is very simple. In the "Contemporary Chinese Celebrities Record" published by Liangyou Company in June 1931, there is a passage that reads: "Liang Desuo, 26 years old, from Guangdong. Studied at Qilu University, currently editor of Liangyou Magazine at Liangyou Bookstore." Before going to Qilu University, he graduated from Guangzhou Peiying Middle School. Counting to 1938, he was only thirty-three years old, in his middle age, when he should be doing things, but he died of illness in his hometown of Lianxian, Guangdong, on August 8, 1938, during the arrival of the great era and the great national war of resistance against foreign aggression. Desuo's body was originally very weak. He had been working hard as an editor, writing, translating, and socializing for more than ten years, which had already made him very busy. In addition, he was eager to learn and think deeply. When he was free, he liked to turn his mind. He thought deeply about how to improve and enrich publications, how to improve readers' interests, how to help readers' new knowledge, how to promote them widely, how to recruit writers to write, and how to treat people. Many unrealized plans were closely organized and improved in his mind every day. Therefore, some people said that he was a fulfiller of ideals, and he also felt that the things he planned were very fulfilling and stood in an invincible position, which others could not imagine. Although there were failures sometimes, he did not admit that his plan had failed, but believed that the promotion or environment was not suitable. His illness was not a matter of one day or two. Of course, the source of the illness was very complicated, and being busy with work and not having time to rest and exercise was the main reason. However, several unrequited loves caused indelible wounds in his spirit and soul, which was the biggest blow. In addition, the plans he had cherished all his life were facing irreversible collapse, and his career failed. Therefore, external and internal injuries came one after another, and his spirit, soul, material things, and thoughts all suffered great losses and profound influences. How could a writer in his early thirties bear it? The illness, the chronic disease, needless to say Remember in 1932, when he was recuperating in the Hongqiao Therapy Institute in Shanghai, I went to visit him. He was lying in bed, still planning for the publication all the time, making arrangements for his own marriage, and adjusting for personnel matters. These were things he couldn't let go of. After the Dazhong Publishing House went bankrupt, he returned to his hometown to recuperate for a long time. Later, he returned to Shanghai, and his body was still as thin as before. Soon, he took on some work in the Guangxue Society, and soon after, he also worked for "Shidai". At that time, he first lived in the countryside of Jiangwan, and later moved to Delin Apartment, living his hard and peaceful life. Unexpectedly, an unexpected thunderbolt struck him, deeply engraving a sad event in his life. How could Liang Desuo, who was sick and whose life was "more medicine than food", support it? In addition, after some time, he encountered the Lugouqiao Incident and the August 13 Incident. National and personal affairs attacked at the same time. He had to take his sick body back to his hometown to recuperate, and then died of illness. In addition to his work on pictorials, Desuo also translated many books, using several pen names to translate world-famous songs. Xiang Liangyou Gongsi earned a lot of money. However, over the past ten years, the publishing houses he served, "Dazhong" went bankrupt first, "Shidai" also stopped due to the August 13 war, and "Liangyou" later published in Hong Kong for a few months, but soon announced liquidation and stopped due to company debt relations. Now "Liangyou", "Dazhong", and "Shidai" have all withered one after another, and Desuo has also passed away for many years. Looking back on the past, how can we not shed tears of sympathy! When we talk about "Liangyou", when we see other large-scale pictorials, we can't help but think of Liang Desuo. Liang Desuo will always be remembered by people in the Chinese publishing industry. Then, Liang Desuo is "Desuo", how can he be dead?

### Manjianghong, Collected Song Dynasty Ci Sentences, Title Autumn Night Grass Sparse Picture Scroll with Introduction, Wu Hufan: On October 10th, 1911, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. On the 12th, Cheng Dequan, the Jiangsu Governor, submitted a final loyal memorial to the Qing court, requesting Mr. Zhang Jian from Nantong to draft it. The people who helped draft it were Mr. Lei Jixing (Fen) from Huating and Mr. Yang Yizhi (Tingdong) from Wuxian. The memorial was not accepted, and Cheng announced the independence of Jiangsu. However, Suzhou did not move a single soldier or shed a drop of blood, and was able to secure peace, thanks to the assistance of Lei and Yang. The first section of the memorial was written by Zhang, the middle section by Lei, and the last section by Yang. It is still kept at Mr. Yang Yizhi's place. Twenty years later, I was asked to add a picture, which was mounted into a scroll. In August of 1945, I repainted one and inscribed this poem. The inscribers on the front and back of the scroll at that time were mostly related to the history of the founding of the Republic of China, such as Cheng Dequan, Zhang Jian, Zhang Yiyi, Luo Liangjian, Ying Dehong (the biological father of Zhu Yingpeng's brother), Shen Enfu, Huang Yanpei, Liang Qichao, Sun Baoqi, Chen Taoyi, Wu Huiyu, Shan Zhen, Xia Jingguan, Chen Chen, Xu Guoren, and Mr. Yang Yizhi Tingdong. The poem says: Old country full of affection (Qin Shaoyou), then boundless desolate travel (Xin Jiaxuan), who does not envy Fu Pu's loyal and outspoken, Yan Lun's words and writing (Mao Qiaoyin): Intending to save the affairs of the present world (Liu Houchun), Wuchang Yunpai connects to the sky red (Zhang Zihu)! Thinking that the elders in the Central Plains already know it in their hearts (Jiang Zhushan), southeast tear (Xin Jiaxuan). Heart loyal (Liu Houchun), lonely lamp tick (Jiang Zhushan); Heaven helps Han (Shi Meixi), into vain throw (Lu You). With old sorrow how much (Chen Xilu), drip voice silent (Ouyang Liuyi); Lingge fame outside things (Mao Qiaoyin), who knows today for a thousand years (Yuan Yishan)! Try to turn around and look back at Jinghua (Zhang Zihu): empty miss (Liu Gaizhi).

### Composed Long Poems for Buddhist Images, Zhu Yingpeng: Chinese art flourished in the Jin and Tang Dynasties. To trace the reason, we must attribute it to the eastward transmission of Buddhism. At that time, Buddhism passed through the Western Regions and became one with China. The integration of Eastern civilization reached its peak, not only in the communication of politics and economy. After this war, Indian culture has a subtle relationship with China and the world. The work of research should not be replaced.

(1) Image of Goddess of Auspiciousness: Saraswati River, incarnated as Goddess of Auspiciousness. Vishnu's concubine is the most auspicious fate, the jewel god jade face appears charming. The three honored ones are one in righteousness, birth, destruction, success, and failure are balanced. The protector is called Narayana, the merits of the goddess are comparable. Today the people are in dire straits, one drink and one peck are also fulfilling. When will the bad times turn into good? The only thing created by the heart is not accidental. I wish to see the blue lotus growing in the fire, let the past be like smoke, the Goddess of Auspiciousness comes dancing, thousands of blessings and hundreds of fortunes last for a long time. (Note) The Goddess of Auspiciousness is the concubine of Vishnu, in charge of human and heavenly auspiciousness. In the Vedic era of India, the river goddess Yingluobodi was the most revered among the gods of the earth. It can ward off misfortune and give people wealth and offspring. In the era of Brahma Sutras, it also served as the protector of eloquence and wisdom. Later, Vishnu's concubine, the Goddess of Auspiciousness, and Brahma's concubine, the Goddess of Eloquence, were both derived from this god. Brahma is in charge of creation, Vishnu is in charge of protection, and Shiva is in charge of destruction, achieving the Trinity. It is called the most victorious Trinity of the outer way. Vishnu is Narayana in Buddhism, and Shiva is the Great自在天, also known as Maheśvara. The so-called Eight Divisions of the Heavenly Dragon are all gods worshiped in India at that time. Buddhism has the spirit of integrating everything and harmonizing all things, which also represents the ultimate in Indian religious and philosophical thought. The establishment of Tibetan Tantric Buddhism is actually integrated with the inherent Bon religion. The so-called preaching by manifestation and the so-called local traces are all about this.

(2) Image of Skanda: The eighteenth generation is the body of a general, upholding the three treasures and the wish will not be extinguished, Ling Mountain accepts the memory and turns the wheel of the Dharma, the three continents respond as their kindness. Please present the five turbidities and bitter interests, the demons and their children are numerous. What is the cause of greed, anger, and ignorance, the water is deep and the fire is hot and there is no way to escape. I don't hesitate to bow down and kowtow frequently, incarnating billions, don't hesitate. Cut down the dust in response to the opportunity, the Vajra treasure pestle towns the waves. To make the sky return to Xichun, countless merits are written on the robes.

(3) Dragon Girl Offering Pearls: Zhiji asks with hands on his chest, Manjushri used to live in the Dragon King Palace. The dragon girl's face is as red as a flower, her sharp roots and wisdom are extraordinary. She attained perfection in an instant, and Bodhi does not retreat to match the Great Hero. Those who hear it suddenly arise in distinction, saying that illegal instruments hinder divine power. The woman immediately appears like a startled swan, and tells the Buddha to prove her enlightenment. The priceless treasure pearl shines brightly, I offer it to the Tathagata faster than the wind, becoming a Buddha is quick and not difficult to meet. Sitting on the lotus flower Ling Cangqiong, the auspicious appearance is incomparably prosperous, the heavenly clothes and necklaces shine brightly. In the praise of the Dharma assembly, bowing silently is not just a return to words, such wonderful truths are revered by the saints, hearing the ten lion roars will not be the same. (Note) The origin of the Dragon Girl is found in the twelfth chapter of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, Devadatta. From a literary point of view, it is the most beautiful allegory in the world. The poem narrates it.

### Continued Records of Famous Traces, Pan Boying: On a morning of rest, the wind and sun are clear and beautiful. I will go to Boju with Jingren to fulfill the promise of watching a painting. Just then, my friend Sun Jun came with his two sons, so we went together in the same car. Because there is a promise of chicken and millet at noon, only a few pieces were displayed at Boju's place, so I recorded it again to avoid forgetting.

1. Li Taibai's inscription on Yangtai is a treasured collection of the Qing Palace. There is a yellow silk red lining on the outside, which was added later. The original mounted scroll is decorated with Song Ke silk, with a deep blue background, with colorful clouds and peach blossom branches. Qing Gaozong's imperial title tag. It was remounted during the Qianlong period. In front, there are four large characters of Qing Gaozong's imperial book Qinglian Yiyun. The ink color is particularly good. This is a paper manuscript. The white silk partitions before and after the original paper are still from the Song Dynasty. There are seven characters of Song Huizong's imperial title "Tang Li Taibai Shang Yangtai" on it, and Huizong's imperial postscript behind it. The thin gold script is very artistic. Behind it is Qing Gaozong's small regular script explanation. I have not seen other manuscripts of Taibai, so it is difficult to identify them. However, its calligraphy is strange, bold, and profound, opening up a new school. The bearing and style cannot be achieved by the people of the Song Dynasty. It is like a pearl of Chishui, which is occasionally seen by Xiang Wang.
2. Cai Xiang's self-written poetry album, Song Cai Junmo's self-written poetry album, is written in black silk orchid with characters about half an inch in size. The true, running, and cursive scripts are not restricted by one style. Junmo wrote it with care. Junmo's calligraphy is the most standard among the four masters of the Song Dynasty. This calligraphy travels within the rules and regulations, and obtains the wonderfulness beyond the image. Its turning strokes and changing strokes all have furrows to follow. Its poetry is also lovely to recite. In one of the poems, there are words beside it: "This article is very ancient in style", which was written by Ouyang Wenzhong. With this line, its reputation is further enhanced. The famous traces of the ancients that have been left to this day are not only exquisite in pen and ink. It is necessary to imagine what kind of person he is when he is exhibiting it. It is like receiving his voice and coughing, and giving birth to the thought of admiration. The so-called lamenting the millennium and shedding tears is truly like hearing the ear and instructing the face. Alas, it is deeply moving! This album contains more than 800 words. There are many inscriptions by famous sages of the Song and Yuan Dynasties behind it. Yang Guishan's postscript is the most appropriate.
3. Yuan Yan Hui's Tea Cooking Picture Scroll. Yan Hui painted a small picture of Yu Chuanzi cooking tea. Yu Chuanzi, the long-bearded slave, and the barefoot old maid, their clothes, lines, faces, and eyes, all use Li Longmian's line drawing method. The layout (now called composition) is also the management and position of the Tang and Song people. Behind it, the cursive script of Han Tuizhi's poem to Yu Chuanzi is also Hui's pen. Hui's calligraphy is thin and vigorous with style, quite close to Kangli Zishan. It is more vigorous and simple than Zishan, but its exquisite proficiency is slightly inferior.
4. Ming Zhou Zhimian's ink painting of Hundred Flowers Picture Scroll. This scroll is very long, painting the flowers of the four seasons, with five colors added to the ink. Its kind of unrestrained and natural interest comes purely from exquisite proficiency. This idea is not achieved by Zhao Zhiqian, Wu Changshuo, and other gentlemen in recent decades. There are poems inscribed by the people of the Ming Dynasty, all beside the flowers. Qing Gaozong inscribed the most poems, almost one poem for one flower. There is a sentence in his inscription on wild chrysanthemums: "Even if it is wild, people are all chrysanthemums." As an emperor and official family, he uttered such sour words. If there are handsome companions in the Gui Lai Hall, exhibiting the scroll and betting on tea, wouldn't they spray it all over the table!
5. Wang Hui's imitation of Yan Wengui's Endless Rivers and Mountains Picture Scroll. This silk blue and green Endless Rivers and Mountains Picture is the true work of Wumu Shanren. It is inscribed: "In the summer of Guihai, avoiding the heat at Fufeng, imitating Yan Wengui's true copy." Behind it is Wang Yigong's seven-meeting long poem, which is extremely respectful. I don't have a book at hand to check. I don't know when Guihai was. I think Shigu was around sixty years old at this time. The brushwork is extremely exquisite and capable, and it has entered into vastness, but there is no disease of old age and withering. This painting by Shigu was made for the Zhang family. After it was lost, it was obtained by Zhang's grandchildren. Huang Xiaosong has a postscript recording its details. The title tag in front is also written by Xiaosong.
6. Album of Calligraphy and Painting by Famous Artists in the Early Qing Dynasty. Wang Shilu, Cha Shibiao, Luo Shou, Cheng Sui, and more than a dozen other people in the early Qing Dynasty, were made for the son of Sun Baozhan. Gong Banqian's inscription is prominently displayed at the top. This item later belonged to Li Baoxun. Baoxun, whose character is Wenshi, is a talented person who judges paintings and reads steles in the curtain during the Dragon Boat Festival. Wenshi himself recorded: During the chaos, the literary and playthings were almost lost, but this album still exists. His words are particularly sentimental. This album is the least valuable of all the items seen today. However, with the remaining life after ten years of hard war, it still wanders in the gaps of the great catastrophe. Reading Li Jun's sorrowful text, it is also sincere not to admire his caressing and cherishing intention! (Written under the lamp on the 17th day of the third month of Dinghai).

### Free Talk: Not Eating National Grain, Eating Prisoner Grain, Meng Long: Recently, I often read news like this, saying that a certain party is absorbing party members or league members in a certain place, or that a special envoy of a certain party is actively working in a certain place. Whoever is willing to join the party or the league, needless to say, "hits the mark" and is happy to be appointed. This really can't help but make people think of the scene of issuing a notice to recruit "talents" in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties: the so-called "recluses in the mountains and forests", all of a sudden, like tigers and wolves, hungry and thirsty, came out of the mountains one after another, as if they had to do a great career. Whether this great career is for the country and the people will be discussed after the facts are revealed, but it is inevitable to be for oneself. Anyone who has read the history of the Ming Dynasty will understand. A satirical poem has already illuminated the five internal organs and six fu organs! "The sage dynasty specially ordered to test the virtuous, a team of Yi Qi descended from Shouyang, arranged new sparrow hats at home, prepared old articles in their belly, deeply ashamed of Zhou millet in those years, today they think of eating national grain, it is not a sudden change, the bracken on Xishan is eaten up!" The most terrible thing is probably that after eating up the bracken on Xishan, they still want to drink coffee and go to the dance hall. Some time ago, Yang Xiaoquan (also known as Xiaocun), a member of the Central Executive Committee of a certain party and a special envoy of the party affairs stationed in Shanghai, who was expelled from the party, wasn't he a living example? In addition to wanting to eat national grain, he also stepped into Jinghua, Atlantic, and other major restaurants, and also entered Lido, Xianle, and other dance halls. Not only that, he also pretended to be an old friend of a certain director of the police branch, signed blank checks, and defrauded more than ten million yuan! This "special envoy" failed to achieve great things and eventually went to jail, eating prisoner grain. Naturally, from the point of view of eliminating harm for the people, it is really a blessing in disguise. However, in this chaotic world, slick youths and frustrated politicians who attempt to eat national grain and eventually eat prisoner grain are not limited to Yang Xiaoquan alone. How can we prevent it from happening?

### Reorganization of the Municipal Government Orchestra—Soon We Can Hear Them Play, Ni Qiuping: The Shanghai Municipal Government Orchestra has recently been taken over and presided over by Mr. Dai Cuilun. Mr. Dai is a violinist who has followed Huberman, the first-class violinist in Europe, for many years. He is now also the president of the Shanghai National Conservatory of Music, so Mr. Dai is the most ideal person to preside over this orchestra. After this reorganization of the Municipal Government Orchestra, Professor Fu Hua (Prof. A. Foa) served as the conductor. He is an outstanding graduate of the Milan Conservatory of Music. After graduating, he performed violin performances all over the European continent. He has been in Shanghai for more than 20 years. He was hired by the former Municipal Council Orchestra. At first, he served as the principal violinist, and later also served as the deputy conductor. His conducting skills are indeed superior to Maestro Mario Paci, although some people still think that he is not strong enough, but his conducting of complex and delicate music is also unmatched by others. The importance of the conductor is like the soul of a person, and now this orchestra has a new soul. In addition, there are three Chinese people in the orchestra who have joined as first violinists—Tan Shuzhen, Chen Youxin, and Mao Chuen. Mr. Tan was the first Chinese to join the Municipal Council Orchestra. Other Chinese people joined a long time after him. He is also proficient in violin making techniques. Mr. Chen co-founded the Shanghai Conservatory of Music with Ding Shande and has made many contributions to the music industry. This time they are already preparing, and soon we can hear the long-lost music again. Indeed, not long ago, the orchestra could not play the music that we could not hear because of the conductor. Now we can meet those music again, and I am afraid we will feel even more moving. Once, the Municipal Council Orchestra was one of the best orchestras in the Far East and the only one in China. It is a pity that there were few Chinese listeners. Since the victory and takeover, it has not been very smooth. I hope that this reorganization will lay the foundation for the future, hire famous foreign masters, and select domestic musicians. To develop music in China to a level above the standard line, the Shanghai Municipal Government Orchestra has a major mission. At the same time, everyone needs to appreciate it and cultivate this artistic flower.

### Terrible Numbers, Liu Meng: According to the statistics department of the Jianghai Customs Tax Department, the import surplus for the past year was 189.054.35 billion yuan. Everyone "knows" what the "import surplus" means; as for this number, no matter how low the current currency value is, it is not enough to describe it with words like "quite amazing" and "quite huge". This is simply a terrible number. There may be the value of cosmetics and luxury goods in this number. Of course, it is necessary to endure the pain to accept the "import surplus" that is really used to revitalize the country. It is really painful to accept the unnecessary "import surplus", so why bother? According to the report of Mr. Niu Ruowang, a representative of a newspaper from the delegation to Japan, there are not many foreign goods on the Japanese market, and few people ask about them. A defeated and controlled country has such a situation. Compared with our number of more than one trillion, what kind of feelings will we have? Is the purchasing power of Japanese people far inferior to ours? However, "what equipment" and "what equipment" have long been popular among us, so what else can be said? If the number of more than one trillion continues to increase, no matter how many foreign loans there are, our China will still be poor, and perhaps it will get worse.

### The Death of Cao Duanfang—Three of the Luxurious Officials in the Late Qing Dynasty, Aiju: Duan was transferred from Nanyang to Beiyang, and he was about to enter the central government, but he knew that the sun in the middle would decline, and the moon would be full and missing. Li Weihou's impeachment of less than 201 characters was based on disrespect, and the iceberg collapsed suddenly, and he resigned from office. Gai Liang Palace Shangbin, the coffin was parked on the main road, Duan dared to leave people living on the tree and photographed it. It can be said that the sky took away his soul and he was presumptuous. And the Nine Gates Admiral did not dare to stop it, his money was so strong. After being dismissed, he lived in Banmu Garden, the so-called Banmu Garden, which is the former residence of the owner of Hongxue Yinyuan. There is a small garden, and it is not impossible to live a leisurely old age. If Duan is enthusiastic and extravagant, he must go out again. He tried his best to dredge the current axis, and was able to re-enter the political arena due to the Sichuan Road unrest, and was killed by the mob. Even his brother Duan Liu died together. Alas, it is also miserable! Is it not the end of greed and extravagance—as for what he collected, in addition to the huge traces and famous products that people know, there are also many fakes. Li Huchen was the one who checked his books. He asked Li for all the Han steles such as the Huashan Ritual Vessels, and he was able to touch them on the desk. And Duan also boasted about his collection every night. After dinner, he arranged the ritual vessels and scrolls. The ones hung in the Yingtang Study Room were like the Four Wangs, then the walls were full of the Four Wangs, and so were the others. How could there not be a mixture of truth and falsehood. His human nature likes to abuse and joke, and he always makes people uncomfortable, but he has never played pranks on me and Tao Zhuocun. His extravagance in food and drink is not too much, but a donkey soup in winter is made by the kitchen himself, which is too cruel. Yu and Zhuocun can't bear to start it. Wei Hou's fold is also an imitation of He Ting's handwriting. One or two people have been abused and joked by Duan, and the resentment is very great! Mao Shang has two poems, which are also inscribed on the wall of Guangheju, which is a true poem history. Yu Ji's couplet says: "It should also be Zhu Chen through marriage, originally Yun Gui is a fellow villager." Zhu refers to the son of Zhu Jingsi, who is the godson of the important person, and Chen is a certain governor. The ending of another song is good, which is a parasitic grass to a parasitic flower. In recent times, there is a drama called Nepotism. All those who have nepotism are close to it, and they also have a little shame.

### Coal Mine Monster—Looking at the So-Called Will to Live, Liucheng: I saw a strange piece of news: In a certain coal mine in Sichuan, a coal miner dug up a monster in the mine. It was covered with very long hair, and only bones were left on its body. There was no meat at all, and it was making a whirring sound in its mouth. The miner was initially startled, and then gathered other workers to move the monster outside the mine. He discovered that the monster was originally a human. He speculated that he was also a miner, who was buried underground when a coal mine collapsed. But he did not die. He lived by eating coal. When he was moved outside the mine, he was no longer able to adapt to the new environment and died immediately. This story is sad enough. I thought of how strong human beings' will to survive is, and how persistent their attachment to life is! A country, a society, and a person are all fighting for survival.

### Literary and Art World: Zang Kejia's first collection of short stories, "Hanging Red", will be printed and published by Dushu Publishing House. It contains eleven short stories, totaling 120,000 words. It is said that it will be published in May. After "Green Northern Country", Fan Quan will have his first collection of essays published. The title of the book is "Noguchi Kisaburo". Most of the contents are sketches of Japanese military police and civilians during the fall. The materials and writing methods are very unique. The "Women's Heart" trilogy, which was previously translated by Shi Diancun, has recently been printed and published in a new edition by Shenzhou Guoguang Publishing House, with a total of 500 pages. However, when the new edition was printed, the publisher forgot the sub-titles of the trilogy, which can be said to be "a fly in the ointment". Tian Han is currently in Wuxi, living on Dahe Shang Street. He will return to Shanghai within the next two days to prepare to finish writing all the sequel to the script "Pipa Xing", which is serialized in "Literary Spring and Autumn". The Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily may open a purely literary and artistic supplement, which is said to be in active planning.

### You are You, Feng: Master Taixu took a photo after sitting in Guanyu at Putuo Xilin Temple in 1934, with long hair and a long beard. He titled it himself: "You, you, I know you, I know you, you are you." Bai Taixu wrote the title below, which is quite philosophical.

### "Happy Reward", Mao Jingchu: He was concentrating on an oil painting titled "Spring". All that could be seen was a graceful girl, covering only a few key points of her jade body with a few leaves. Suddenly, his wife shouted sharply: "Hey, what are you waiting for?—Waiting for autumn?"

### Chronicle of a City in Crisis, Qin Shouou: Lao Xu was really flustered. His wife was not at home; he brought a girl in, wasn't this a capital crime? And the most wronged thing was that Jin Aili, under the guidance of Lao Zhu, declared when she moved in that she must live in the same room with Mrs. Hu; and this Mrs. Hu was also really strange, as if she had colluded with Lao Zhu, and had been messing around inside, taking Jin Aili in and out, simply not letting Lao Xu have a chance to touch her. "Didn't you persuade her to stay in Liuzhou for a while?" Fatty Xu also knew the extent of Xiao Shen's familiarity with his wife, so he asked with a kind of hope. "She was originally going to come with me." Xiao Shen told him honestly: "Unfortunately, the driver's seat of the Jiaotong Bank car I took was already occupied by two people. She is not used to sitting in the back, so she temporarily changed her mind and planned to take the Yaxi Bank car tomorrow." "Are our six cars all in Liuzhou?" The most concerned about by Xie is his six trucks; on these six trucks, he pinned his hopes for a happy life in the second half of his life. He was prepared to throw away the small gauze hat. "They are all there. Two of them have already been unloaded, but," Xiao Shen gave him a gloating smile. "But two newspapers are scolding your China Tea Company, and they also said that someone is investigating you for losing tea leaves and not transporting them, but instead contracting commercial goods." "Let them say it, anyway, it is a fact that the car cannot be driven

(6) During the elections, mutual support should be given to other political parties to assist the people in participating in the elections and to establish a model of democratic politics.
