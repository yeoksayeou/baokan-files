### Foreign Minister Wang Visits Chairman at Kuling; Attends Lower House Meeting to Report Before Departure; President Chang Returns to Nanjing, to Visit Southern China Again

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Foreign Minister Wang had just returned to the capital when, at 9 a.m. on the 27th, he attended the Executive Yuan's regular meeting to report on his trip abroad and various related foreign affairs issues. The report lasted an hour and was divided into five points: the United Nations General Assembly, the Japanese Peace Treaty, the Korean Issue, the Palestine Question, and American Aid to China. Regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty, Wang stated that we must insist on two points: first, Japan must be disarmed to prevent renewed aggression, and second, we must maintain the use of veto power to protect our national interests. Wang stated: His remarks to reporters in Japan were given great importance and welcomed by both the Japanese government and the public. Regarding American aid to China, Wang stated: "From any perspective, this matter has improved." After Wang's report, several members of the Executive Yuan raised questions, which Wang answered, and discussions ensued. Wang left the meeting at 11 a.m. At 1:30 p.m., upon the summons of Chairman Chiang, he accompanied his eldest son aboard the "Tianxiong" aircraft, transiting to Kuling, to report in detail on his attendance at the Second United Nations General Assembly. He will return to Nanjing in two or three days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Premier Chang Chun has decided to inspect Southern China again in the short term, and after a brief rest upon his return, he will visit the Northwest. It is said that Chang plans to inspect all the important economic and political urban centers nationwide to serve as a reference for the policies of his responsible cabinet.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Premier Chang Chun returned to Nanjing at 4:50 p.m. on the 28th after a four-day inspection of Taiwan. In addition to attending the Taiwan Retrocession Commemoration Celebration, he also comforted compatriots, visited industrial ports, and inspected the economic situation. During the four days, Chang visited five factories: the camphor factory, tea factory, railway machine factory, fertilizer factory, and sugar factory; and two ports: Keelung Port and the Kaohsiung Port fortress. Chang was generally satisfied with the overall situation. The two points that deserve research and improvement are education and the economy. In terms of education, under the past Japanese enslavement education, the method used for Taiwanese compatriots' education was universal primary and secondary education, while opportunities for university education were rarely given to Taiwanese. According to the information obtained, in 1944, the situation of Taiwan University education was as follows: in the Department of Literature and Politics, there were 31 Japanese students and only 4 Taiwanese students; in the Department of Science, there were 40 Japanese students and only 1 Taiwanese student; in the Department of Engineering, there were 47 Japanese students and only 2 Taiwanese students; in the Department of Agriculture, there were 74 Japanese students and no Taiwanese students. The opposite was true for the Department of Medicine, with 87 Japanese students and 104 Taiwanese students. After retrocession, the Japanese withdrew, and the schools were almost without students. This phenomenon urgently needs to be improved and supplemented. In terms of the economy, Japan has always adopted a segmented approach to Taiwan's industry, such as not allowing Taiwan to produce finished products from raw materials produced in Taiwan. However, because Taiwan was a subsidiary of Japan, its industrial economy was able to maintain close connections and cooperation with Japan. Now that retrocession has occurred, efforts should be made to coordinate with the domestic economy. For example, Taiwan Sugar should not make the domestic market its primary focus in the future but should focus on opening up overseas markets, so that the economy of Taiwan Province can be stabilized. Chang praised the stable and orderly life in Taiwan. Although the "February 28th Incident" of earlier this year is still in the memory of the Taiwanese people, Chang answered twelve inquiries from them at a provincial council banquet, stating that this was an unfortunate incident and hoped that everyone could forget it. Chang believes that primary education in Taiwan is currently very widespread, almost 85 percent, far stronger than in the mainland. Pingtung has a population of only 40,000, but there are as many as eight middle schools. From 6 a.m., the streets of Pingtung City are filled with students, which Chang greatly appreciates. Chang believes that if education and the economy can be improved, stability can be easily achieved in Taiwan Province.

### US Relief Supplies to China to be Shipped Within the Year; Vice Minister Xu Claims Price Increases Will Gradually Disappear

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department stated that the agreement simultaneously announced in Nanjing and Washington once again demonstrates the strong feelings of friendship and sympathy between the peoples of the two countries. Under the U.S. Foreign Relief Act, totaling $350 million, China can receive approximately $30 million in relief. A spokesperson added that the exact amount of aid to China will be announced within days, at which time details of the first shipment of relief supplies will also be released. According to sources from responsible parties, the shipment of relief supplies to China can be completed within this year.

[Central News Agency, This City] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan stated: "The relationship between China and the United States has always been harmonious, built on traditional friendship and sincerity, and should be maintained unceasingly. The signing of the Sino-American Relief Agreement in Nanjing further demonstrates the overflowing friendship between the two countries." Xu continued: "Although the supplies provided under the agreement are limited to food, medicines, and clothing, it should be known that food is the paramount necessity of the people. As our country is currently in a state of suppression of rebellion, the food supply is often insufficient. This aid can directly regulate supply and demand and indirectly help stabilize food prices. Furthermore, the phenomenon of general price increases in the past, which were often based on fluctuations in food prices, can also be gradually eliminated."

### Negotiations for Sino-British Commercial Treaty; Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Inland River Navigation Rights are the Core Issues; London Denies Indefinite Postponement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Negotiations for the Sino-British Commercial Treaty, which began at the same time as the Sino-American Commercial Treaty last spring, have not achieved much in nearly two years. There has been sudden talk in the capital that the agreement is shelved, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is silent on the matter. The British side claims that the delay is due to technical issues. However, according to what our reporter has learned from sources with relevant power, each side has its own positions. Our country believes that the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue is the only remaining vestige of unequal treaties and should be completely resolved during the signing of the commercial treaty to enhance Sino-British friendship and complete the effort to abolish unequal treaties. However, the British side believes otherwise and insists on retaining this jewel in the crown as a stepping stone for developing trade with the Far East, especially China. It firmly refuses to consider the return of Hong Kong and Kowloon and even plans for long-term construction and permanent jurisdiction. What the British side insists on is to regain inland river navigation rights in China. Since the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty, Britain has abandoned this privilege. Since China reopened its ports after victory two years ago, the losses suffered by British merchants in China due to their own incompetence and poor management have made them feel regret. Therefore, they want to stage a comeback. However, our diplomatic authorities believe that the abolition of unequal treaties has been achieved after great difficulty, and we cannot make similar concessions again, which would lead to the loss of national rights and popular support. The British Parliamentary Delegation to China made exploratory talks on this demand, which has already drawn condemnation and protests from Chinese officials and public opinion. Therefore, this matter is also absolutely impossible. Due to these events and circumstances, the progress of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty negotiations has been extremely slow recently. The counter-proposals proposed by our country are still at the center of the British side's research. Progress can only be expected after their research results are returned to our country.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The Sunday Observer reported that London has decided to postpone the negotiations for the Sino-British Commercial Treaty indefinitely. A spokesman for the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied this today, saying that it was inconsistent with the facts. The delay in the treaty negotiations is mainly due to: 1. The majority of British associations and small commercial groups have vested interests in this treaty and must be consulted. 2. British trade experts are currently in Geneva participating in the charter of the International Trade Organization and other matters. The spokesman also said that the Observer's claim that the resumption of treaty negotiations depends on a change in the Chinese government's attitude is absolutely untrue.

### United Nations Discusses the Korean Problem: US Representative States Position, Advocates Universal Suffrage Before the End of March Next Spring, US-Soviet Troops May Withdraw Only After the Establishment of a Provisional Government

(Our report) New York, 28th broadcast: Lake Success dispatch, today US representative Dulles proposed a resolution in the UN Political Committee, advocating that the United Nations should find ways to hold universal elections in Korea no later than March 31st next spring, and establish a United Nations commission to supervise the elections. Once the Korean government establishes a security force, US and Soviet troops may withdraw, and this withdrawal should also be carried out under the supervision of the United Nations Commission. Mr. She believes that the US proposal, if thoroughly implemented, would benefit the thirty million people of Korea. He opposed the Soviet Union's previous proposal, which was to withdraw US and Soviet troops directly without waiting for the establishment of a Korean government, calling it impractical and ultimately unable to achieve Korean unification.

(United Press Lake Success, 28th) US representative Dulles is preparing to submit a detailed plan to the UN Political Committee for holding elections in Korea within five months to establish a provisional government. The main points are: The United Nations requests the US and Soviet occupation zones to hold elections separately by March 31 to establish a provisional national government. A United Nations commission will be established to monitor the voting; after Korea establishes a national defense force, the occupying forces will withdraw completely as soon as possible; if necessary, the United Nations will assist in the withdrawal of troops and the organization of discussions on Korean legislation. Mr. She also advocated that South Korea abandon universal elections and that North and South Korea vote separately. His explanation was that because the two regions have different election procedures, separate voting can be faster and more effective, and a central constitutional assembly can be established based on the election results. On this point, Mr. Dulles will state that the election methods in the two regions "cannot be completely satisfactory from the perspective of American ideals."

Ms. Eun Looyi, a representative of Korean political leader Syngman Rhee, calling herself the "Korean Representative to the United Nations," Ms. Eun supported the US proposal for Korea, but hoped that the United Nations would establish a monitoring mechanism with broader powers than those advocated by the United States. Ms. Gu proposed a three-point procedure: Within ninety days after the United Nations passes a resolution on Korea, a general election should be held to establish a national assembly. Fifteen days after the general election, representatives should gather in Seoul to elect a provisional government, president, cabinet, and necessary institutions. In the following ninety days, US and Soviet occupying forces should gradually withdraw. At the same time, US officials reiterated that Ms. Eun "has no legal status to serve as a representative of Korea, she represents Syngman Rhee."

### Three Government Parties Cooperate Closely: Cabinet Status Strengthened, Ramadier Urges National Unity to Overcome Difficulties

(Reuters Paris, 28th) The latest development in French politics is the joint statement issued by the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement, stating that they will seek closer cooperation with the left wing of the Radical Party to oppose the De Gaulle faction and the Communist Party. This declaration was issued after a meeting of representatives of the three parties today.

(Our report) London, 28th broadcast: Paris dispatch, the French National Assembly convened today, with emotions as tense as rarely seen in French history. Prime Minister Ramadier delivered a moving speech defending the current cabinet, rumored not to end the life of the coalition government due to the rise of the De Gaulle faction and the strike actions of the Communist Party. He believes that suppressing prices must be thoroughly implemented, so he opposes the continuous increase in wages. France is currently going through an extremely difficult period, and all parties must cooperate sincerely to overcome the difficulties. He asked the parliament to vote on the current government's vote of confidence. There was a commotion in the hall at that time, with Communist Party members and members sympathetic to the De Gaulle movement shouting loudly. Mr. Lai criticized both the Communist Party and the De Gaulle faction, but his criticisms of the Communist Party were particularly harsh.

(Reuters Paris, 28th) Ramadier's new cabinet attended the National Assembly for the first time today. This cabinet, composed of the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Movement, and the Radical Party, met this morning to prepare for the debate in parliament. Prime Minister Ramadier's status has been strengthened after the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement jointly stated that they would not cooperate with the Communist Party and De Gaulle. Political figures believe that if Ramadier asks the parliament for a vote of confidence, he can expect to receive majority support. People here believe that the joint declaration of the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement is intended to prevent a cabinet crisis and give De Gaulle the opportunity to take power. It is said that the Socialist Party has asked the People's Republican Movement to help it stop the trend of "Caesarism."

Majority Support Can Be Obtained for a Vote of Confidence Tomorrow

(Reuters Paris, 28th) The French National Assembly, which reconvened today, is not expected to approve De Gaulle's request yesterday to dissolve the parliament and hold new elections. The parliament is scheduled to vote on the Ramadier government's vote of confidence on Thursday. The People's Republican Movement, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the municipal elections, is expected to follow the Socialist Party in casting a vote of confidence. At most, the Communist Party will abstain, and will never cast a negative vote, so Ramadier's vote of confidence is almost without question.

### Possibility of a Resurgence of Strikes in France

(Reuters Paris, 27th) Political figures in Paris expect that De Gaulle's request for the immediate dissolution of the National Assembly and the holding of new elections will prompt the Communist Party to launch an offensive in the industrial sector.

As a result, it was rejected by 252 votes to 111. Earlier, Mr. Thomas told the House of Commons that due to the government's decision to reduce naval personnel from 860,000 during the war to 147,000, the country's fleet strength would be severely affected.

### US Government Convenes Leaders from All Walks of Life to Exchange Views on the Aid to Europe Plan: Part of the Aid Will Be Given as Grants

(United Press Washington, 27th) Secretary of State Marshall and other senior government officials convened leaders from the business community, labor community, and press community on the night of the 27th to hold a "study meeting" to discuss opinions on the foreign aid plan. Marshall, Secretary of Commerce Harriman, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, and World Bank President McCloy delivered speeches at the meeting. It is reported that the meeting revealed that the executive authorities are considering requesting Congress to grant legislative power to restore the allocation of important materials such as steel.

(United Press Washington, 27th) It is reported that of the six billion yuan needed for the first year of the Marshall Plan, it is estimated that more than one-third cannot be regarded as loans and can only be used as pure grants. However, the government authorities are planning how to obtain some indirect compensation for this grant, such as making more constructive reconstruction plans to reduce the need for the United States. According to estimates by the sixteen European countries participating in the Paris Economic Conference, they will need to obtain 20.4 billion US dollars from the United States in the next four years, but the current concern of the government is the 6 billion yuan for next year. There is currently no decision on how to pay for the funds needed for the Marshall Plan, and there is even no decision on how to submit it to Congress. However, the government and most members of Congress believe that the source of funds should be: Loans from government, private, or international banks to purchase vehicles and industrial equipment; raw materials and machinery (such as agricultural machinery) should also be purchased with loans, and the Export-Import Bank will be authorized to lend; food and fuel are the most basic and most difficult items for recovery, and currently no government or intergovernmental loan organization can support them. There is no other way than for the US Congress to approve the grant.

However, to date, the committee cannot determine the scope and amount of the four-year plan."

It also stated that the bill is largely based on the Socialist Party's proposals, and the Yoshida Cabinet should bear considerable responsibility, and that the stability of the economy will depend on the government's political strength.

### Bevin Discusses Policy Toward Germany, Resolves Not to Let Germany Threaten World Security: Central Institutions Not Established, France Should Be Responsible

(Reuters, London, 27th) Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons debate on the German question that the British government is determined to continue to prevent Germany from adopting secret policies that would allow it to establish a dictatorship that threatens world security. Regardless of the success or failure of the next Foreign Ministers' Conference, the British government's guiding principle for its policy toward Germany remains to establish constitutional institutions in Germany, continue to promote a sound system, and establish economic conditions that enable the German people to have a reasonable standard of living.

When referring to the difficulty of applying the principle of German economic unity, Bevin said: "We cannot entirely blame the Soviet Union either. France has expressed deep concern about the railway and other central institutions due to the influence of French law. France did not participate in the Potsdam Conference, and France's reservations have prevented the establishment of central institutions to this day. Today, Germany's economic unification has not yet been established, and the resources of the Soviet zone are still being taken as reparations, and factories are also being moved. In July of this year, we discovered in Paris that it was still difficult for the major powers to agree, and in view of the tragedy facing Germany and the occupation zones in Germany, I had to take any step to make the British occupation zone self-sufficient. Therefore, when the United States proposed merging with its occupation zone, the British government accepted it. Unexpectedly, after the merger agreement was established, the price of American wheat rose sharply, from $1.75 per bushel to $3, and the original basis of calculation was completely lost, and we could not obtain adequate food to maintain the rationing quantity. We have stated in Moscow that we cannot allow the standard of German industry to remain without an agreement for long. If other countries cannot agree, Britain and the United States will set their own standards. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is about to convene, and if the conference fails because of our insistence on this principle, it will not be our fault."

### British and American Governments Approve Ruhr Mine Plan

[Reuters, London, 27th] The British Foreign Office announced tonight that the British and American governments have approved the recommendation made by experts from both countries in Washington last month to transfer the Ruhr coal mines to German management, with a control committee jointly formed by Britain and the United States to supervise them. According to authoritative sources, the British, French, and American governments have also approved the communiqué issued by the British, American, and French representatives after coal production negotiations in Berlin. According to a statement from the British Foreign Office: "Britain and the United States are eager for the proposals regarding the production and operation of the Ruhr coal mines to be implemented after exchanging views with France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg."

### Soviet-Iranian Relations Worsen: Iran Attempts to Restore Sovereignty Over Bahrain Island

(Reuters, Tehran, 27th) It is reported that Iranian members of parliament held a secret meeting yesterday to draft a bill, preparing to submit it to parliament, instructing the Iranian government to send troops and civil officials to Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf to restore Iranian sovereignty there. (Bahrain Island is an oil-producing area, originally an independent land under Turkish control, and has a treaty relationship with Britain. Iran has repeatedly declared that the island belongs to it, but Britain has never recognized it.) Iranian newspapers report that Iranian parliamentarians also discussed reports that Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Shakirkov, is about to leave Iran during the secret meeting. Iranian newspapers also report that the Soviet Embassy has requested a copy from the Iranian Foreign Ministry of Prime Minister Sultanah's report to parliament last week on the Soviet-Iranian negotiations. It is also learned that although 25 members of the Soviet Embassy were invited to attend the celebration of the Iranian King's birthday today, only five people attended, and Shakirkov and others were not present, leading Iranians to speculate more about the next actions to be taken by the Soviet Union.

### Small Assembly Case: China and France Oppose Expanding Power, Small Committee Finally Passes US Proposal

(Central News Agency, Lake Success, 27th) The drafting committee of the UN Political Committee decided today that the "Large Assembly" should handle cases that both countries encountered failure, representing a victory for the United States. The United States strongly opposed China and France's efforts to restrict the power of the Small Assembly. According to Gu Weijun, China's position is that including "disputes" within the scope of the Small Assembly's power would give the impression that it would conflict with the Security Council's power to handle disputes. Gu stated that if the Small Assembly is dealing with disputes that the Security Council has already handled but cannot resolve, that would be another matter.

### UN Condemns "War Propagandists" Case: Soviet Union Gains Moral Victory, Original Proposal Rejected, Compromise Suggestion Adopted

[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] The United Nations Political Committee gave the Soviet Union a major moral victory on the 27th, passing a compromise proposal with 56 votes against zero, "Any country that engages in or encourages acts of threatening peace, disrupting peace, or aggression should be condemned, and each member state is requested to take appropriate steps to promote friendly relations among countries within the framework of the Charter." After a three-and-a-half-hour meeting and thirteen votes, the United States realized that if it continued to oppose the compromise proposal, it would suffer a disastrous defeat, so it reluctantly took the same position as other countries, voting in favor of the final recommendation, and the stalemate was broken. This is the first time that small countries intending to reconcile have cooperated to pull back the United States and the Soviet Union, which tend to be extreme, and achieve success in adopting a middle ground plan. During the voting, the attitudes of the two major powers began to waver. The Soviet Union first canceled the clause condemning the United States, Greece, and Turkey for selling war, and the Political Committee continued to reject the remaining parts of the team proposal and moved to accept the compromise proposal of France, Australia, and Canada.

### UN Mediation Committee to Fly to Indonesian Capital Today

Consuls of various countries stationed in Los Angeles are all members of the committee. According to the American prediction, a well-known illustrator and member of the committee, Vargas, declared that "the alliance of beauties promotes friendship between countries and is more powerful than any peace treaty."

### Juvenile Police Squad Dispatched: Begins Inspecting Restaurants Today: Four Steps for Dealing With Violators of Thrift: Temporarily Not Involving Family Banquets

The thrift measures for banquets in this city officially began on the 20th. In order to thoroughly investigate whether various Chinese and Western restaurants are earnestly complying, the municipal authorities have assigned 30 female police officers from the police bureau and selected 50 children from the Orphanage and Education Center to form a juvenile police squad to set off in groups to inspect. It is learned that the inspection work is officially scheduled to begin today. The police and social bureaus will supervise the juvenile police squad members to go to various restaurants in batches to begin the inspection. If it is found that there is a violation of the menu prices set by the thrift conference, it will be dealt with in the following steps: 1. Admonition, 2. Warning, 3. Fine, 4. Revocation of business license. The inspection team members will temporarily not interfere with family banquets. At the same time, the municipal government has ordered the finance and police bureaus to dispatch plainclothes personnel at any time to secretly inspect various restaurants. [Another report] The price limit for set meals stipulated in the thrift measures for banquets is 25,000 yuan per person. However, the highest price for set meals sold in restaurants throughout the city is only 20,000 yuan, and the lowest is 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the thrift price limit has the suspicion of raising prices. According to the person in charge of the municipal government, the price limit for set meals of 25,000 yuan is the highest price stipulated, in order to limit the price of set meals in the future, all must not exceed this number.

### Secretary-General Shen Answers Various Current Questions: Confiscated Goods Should Be Unsealed and Returned If There Is No Suspicion of Hoarding: Hopes to Extend the Implementation Time of the Dance Ban

[Report from this newspaper] Municipal Secretary-General Shen Zonglian met with reporters yesterday and answered various questions, which are recorded as follows:

Food Issues: The city does not lack rice reserves. I believe that the rumor of implementing food rations per capita may be difficult to implement because Chinese people have different eating habits for rice and wheat. It is not a must-do at present.

Economic Inspection: Recently, the general public may have misunderstandings about economic inspections, thinking that legitimate merchants' inventories are being sealed, affecting business, and that the handling is excessive. In fact, the police bureau's implementation of inspection work is entirely based on confidential reports, and inspections are only conducted if there is suspicion of hoarding. According to the law, non-industry merchants who have concrete evidence of hoarding will be confiscated and severely punished. For industry merchants, their accounts will be checked to see if there is suspicion of hoarding, and then a decision will be made on how to deal with it. This is the principle of economic inspection to crack down on hoarding and speculation. It does not mean that after the sealing, business is not allowed or that it will be confiscated. If the incoming and outgoing goods are indeed legitimate business and there is no suspicion of hoarding, they will of course be unsealed and returned.

Important Statement·Dance Ban Issue The Dance Ban Issue: The Central Thrift Supervision Committee will convene a meeting in Beijing on the 29th to discuss the dance ban in Shanghai. Social Bureau Director Wu Kaixian will go to Beijing on the evening of the 28th to participate in the report. What I must solemnly state is that the municipal government does not disapprove of the dance ban, nor does it fail to implement the central government's orders. However, considering the livelihood of the employees of the dance halls, I hope that the implementation period will be slightly extended so that they have ample opportunity to change careers.

200,000 Refugees·Urgently Need Relief Winter Relief Issue: This year, at least 200,000 refugees have come to Shanghai due to disasters in various places. Among these 200,000 refugees, at least 100,000 are in urgent need of relief. Local government agencies have limited manpower and financial resources. I hope that all sectors and charitable organizations will cooperate and promote charitable deeds together.

Car Issues·The Rumor Is Untrue Restriction on the Use of Cars: Our city has temporarily suspended the transfer of car ownership and the issuance of new licenses in accordance with the central government's intention, and has asked the Executive Yuan to approve detailed measures. It is rumored that some vehicles in this city are registered in Nanjing and have returned to Shanghai to operate. According to regulations, foreign vehicles are only allowed to operate in this city for one month. After the deadline, fuel purchase certificates will not be issued, and the central government's regulations on who can use cars and who cannot use cars are universal and not different due to local differences, so this statement is actually wrong.

### It Is Very Difficult to Explain Whether the Dance Ban Is Frugal: Director Wu Hopes That Local Governments Can Handle It At Their Discretion

[Report from this newspaper] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Bureau went to Beijing by night train yesterday to represent the municipal government at the thrift talks to discuss the dance ban. Before the trip, Director Wu told reporters: "It is very difficult to explain whether the dance ban is frugal. If the dance halls in this city have all made firm guarantees to strictly implement frugality, and even the clothing of the dancers is stipulated to use domestic products in order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, then the purpose of the central government's determination to ban dancing and suppress dance girls seems to be to maintain good customs." He also said: "We extremely hope that the central government can understand the difficulties of the local government and hand over this issue to the local governments to handle it themselves in light of the actual situation."

### Various Receipts Issued on Both Routes Will Be Changed to Filling in the Date of the Day Next Month

[Report from this newspaper] The date of stamping and filling in the passenger tickets and baggage and parcel transportation receipts issued by the stations of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway District has always been based on the date when the passenger train arrives at the terminal station. For example, the passenger train that departs from Shanghai to Beijing at 9:50 PM today will arrive in Nanjing after 0:00 AM the next day. The date of stamping and filling in various receipts will be based on the time of the second day. This regulation was originally an accounting procedure to facilitate the stations' remittance of funds. However, the general public and merchants are unaware of the intention and are easily suspicious, and often ask questions. The bureau has recently decided to revise it from the first of next month. All kinds of passenger tickets, baggage tickets, and various passenger miscellaneous transportation receipts will be stamped or filled in with the date of the day. Trains departing after 0:00 AM will be stamped or filled in with the date of the next day. Coal Prices Soar Continuously, Discussing Ways to Suppress Prices

Due to the municipal government's financial constraints, the principle of self-sufficiency has always been the principle of maintaining operations. Recently, the central government decided to adjust the salaries of public school staff by 125% starting in October, and the salaries of all employees must also be adjusted in accordance with regulations, but the medical fees collected by the hospital are limited and cannot maintain expenditures. The municipal government has agreed to allocate the increased living allowance for employees in October. How to deal with the situation after October remains to be discussed. From next year, it is rumored that the salaries of public school staff will be calculated according to the index, but the medical fees of public hospitals cannot be calculated according to the index, so the Health Bureau is looking for remedial measures.

### Hongkou Eighteenth District Chief Accused of Assault, Trial Concluded

[Report from this Newspaper] Shen Pumin, a resident of the Eighteenth District of Hongkou and a man of conscription age, sought to postpone his military service. On September 23 of this year, he entrusted his friend Gao Weimin to discuss the matter with Pan Chenghu, the district chief. Pan refused, stating that the application deadline had already passed. The two argued for a long time without resolution, leading to deepening misunderstandings and a verbal altercation. Pan, being overweight with high blood pressure and prone to anger, shouted loudly in the office. Gao also became infuriated, and the two came to blows. Gao sustained injuries to his left ribs, right neck, and left back. The police brought both Gao and Pan to the station. Gao was fined one thousand yuan for obstructing official duties. Gao then sued Pan for assault, and the District Prosecutor's Office filed charges. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Zhefu of the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court conducted the trial.

### Trackless Route 17 Tram to Restore Pre-War Route

The British-owned Shanghai Route 17 trackless tram used to run from the Great World to Yuezhou Road in Hongkou before the war. However, during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, all overhead power lines in the Hongkou area were dismantled by the enemy and puppet regime. Therefore, after the victory, the tram route only operated from Sichuan Road Bridge to the Great World. It is now learned that the route will soon resume full operation, with Yuezhou Road becoming the terminal for the Route 17 trackless tram, which currently runs to Sichuan Road Bridge. The construction of overhead power lines and other facilities is currently underway.

### All Prisoners Seek to Reform, Submit Joint Petition in Fine Calligraphy to the City Council

The Ministry of Judicial Administration will convene a National Judicial Conference in Beijing on November 5, where amnesty regulations after the implementation of the constitution will also be discussed. Upon hearing this news, all prisoners in Shanghai Prison yesterday jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai City Council, requesting the authorities to pay attention to the principle of "leniency and broad pardon" and grant prisoners nationwide the opportunity to "reform and start anew." The original letter, approximately three thousand characters in length, was written in fine calligraphy on yellow maobian paper. Excerpts of the three appeals presented in the original letter are as follows:

Amnesty and Grace Have Not Been Widely Bestowed

The motives behind our crimes are indeed pitiful. However, the amnesty order issued by the National Government on New Year's Day in the 36th year of the Republic, as anyone slightly familiar with the law can point out, is merely a timely embellishment of official documents that outwardly displays benevolence but does not truly extend grace. If we open the Chinese Criminal Code and read it, we find that, except for the sections on public morals and pickpocketing, the rest have been repealed and replaced by four special criminal regulations: "Punishing Traitors," "Punishing Embezzlers," "Punishing Bandits," and "Punishing Opium Traffickers." Among these four special regulations, only the "Punishing Bandits" regulation, due to the limitation of the most severe principal penalty, allows for reduced sentences. The remaining three are not included in the amnesty order's provisions for pardon. Therefore, those who can truly benefit from the amnesty are only those convicted of pickpocketing and offenses against public morals, who can be released in a short period of time even without an amnesty order. Why is it that the government, while showing compassion to the innocent and granting amnesty, is unwilling to give those who have stumbled the opportunity to repent and correct their past mistakes? If the government believes that we are all heinous and extremely wicked criminals, then it should be noted that many of us were deemed by judges at the time of sentencing to meet the pardonable circumstances under Article 59 of the Criminal Code and had our sentences reduced accordingly. This proves that we are all individuals who accidentally fell into the legal net or were forced by circumstances to err. We are not habitual offenders who make crime a profession. However, in the government's amnesty order, which proclaims that grace should be widely bestowed upon the world, we do not benefit from the government's grace because of our pardonable circumstances.

The Elderly, Weak, Women, and Children are Crying Out for Food. Of course, there is a need for the government's legislation and authority to be adapted to the times, and the people have no right to criticize other than to obey. We do not seek to conceal our crimes; we have already reaped the consequences and been punished by the law. However, under the government's measure of "patting flies but not hitting tigers," how much practical effect has the so-called "strict law" adapted to the times achieved? The facts tell us that, to date (since New Year's Day of the 36th year of the Republic), the number of prisoners in custody nationwide has reached over 1.5 million, which exceeds the record of any previous year. If we assume that each prisoner has an average of five family members, then there are over six million elderly, weak, women, and children in society who are suffering, innocent people whose crying out for food and living in starvation deserves the government's relief and compassion.

Hope to Promulgate Labor Service Regulations. Our pain can only be known by those who have experienced it firsthand. Although our situation is our own fault, every drowning person wants to be rescued and reach the other shore. Although we have experienced deep pain and fallen into the dark abyss, for the sake of our pitiful families, as long as we can breathe and survive, we certainly hope for freedom and the coming of light. The government's pardon is certainly what we pray for, but we also hope that the judicial authorities can promulgate a labor service regulation like the military law authorities, and we pray that the restrictions and standards of the regulation be as lenient as possible, and the procedures be simplified as much as possible, to make up for our deficiencies. For those who commit crimes for the first time by mistake, grace should be given to treat them leniently or to change the sentence to probation so that we can have more opportunities to reform and start anew.

### Qian Zelin and Zhu Qiyi Sentenced Separately for Fraud

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhu Qiyi and his friend Qian Zelin were accused of defrauding Qian Peizhen, Qian Zelin's cousin, of the land registration receipt for nine houses located on a five-qiu, eight-hao plot of land at 10 Nian Road, Lu Tusefuwei, Ren Shou Li, Ninghai Road, Huangpu District. They were accused of privately mortgaging the property and squandering the money. After several hearings by Judge Wu Shaochang of the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court, the verdict was announced yesterday: "Qian Zelin is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for continuous fraud; Zhu Qiyi is sentenced to six months of imprisonment for continuous fraud; Qian Zelin shall immediately return the land registration certificate and seal issued by the Land Administration Bureau to the plaintiff."

### Abandoned by Cotton Mill Accountant, Shao Woman Sheds Tears Recounting

[Report from this Newspaper] He Shuqiong, a young woman from Guangdong, accused Liu Yuhe, an accountant at the Wing On Cotton Mill, of abandonment and defamation. The case was heard in court at the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, and He recounted the abandonment she had experienced, shedding tears as she spoke. According to He's accusation, she and Liu participated in the 13th group wedding organized by the Shanghai Municipal Government on April 7, 1937, and have been married for eleven years, with a son named Qiming, who is now nine years old. He's father, Bo Xuan, had given He 1,000 yuan in Wing On Cotton Mill shares as inheritance, which Liu had allegedly swindled away. In 1942, Liu lost his job and faced financial difficulties. He worked as a laborer, using the earnings from washing clothes to support her mother and son. After the victory against Japan, Liu found employment at the Wing On Cotton Mill with a substantial income. He became involved with a wealthy woman and, showing preference for the new, repeatedly coerced He into divorce without success. Eventually, he abandoned He completely, leaving her with no choice but to work as a laborer in the home of the Guo family at 58 Yongle Fang, Hengbang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, visiting Qiming several times a month. Because he was unable to force the divorce, Liu harbored deep resentment and even published advertisements falsely claiming that he and He were living together and that He had abandoned her family in 1943, disappearing without a trace and finding someone else. After He hired a lawyer to publish a rebuttal, she sued Liu for repeated abandonment and defamation, requesting that the court order him to provide alimony for her support and submitting their wedding photos as evidence. The prosecutor had summoned Liu Yuhe and his son Qiming, but they were unable to be served, and they did not appear in court yesterday. The hearing was rescheduled for another date.

### Demolish Shrines to Rebuild Martyrs' Shrine, Expected to be Completed by Next Summer or Autumn [Report from this Newspaper]

[Report from this Newspaper] At around 11:30 PM last night, a drunken foreigner suddenly appeared at Youth High School, located at 553 Lin Sen Middle Road, went straight to the third floor, acted erratically, and arbitrarily destroyed tables and chairs. The faculty and staff were perplexed, mistaking him for a robber, and called the Lujiiawan Police Station to report the robbery. Duty officer Ni Jiafeng led dozens of police officers in police vehicles to the scene. The drunken man was extremely violent, throwing wooden chairs and other objects. The station was contacted again to send a large contingent of security police to surround and apprehend him. At the same time, the General Bureau was also notified, and Criminal Section Chief Hou Junhou personally led officers to assist in the capture. The man was taken back to the General Bureau for strict interrogation. He confessed that he was a French national named Permon, 39 years old, a coppersmith, currently unemployed and reduced to a thief. He admitted that he intended to break into the school to steal, and that he had committed this disgraceful act due to excessive drinking, hoping for leniency.

### Dismembered Statue of the Goddess of Peace Needs 300 Million in Medical Expenses, Repairs to Begin Once City Council Approves Funding

[Report from this Newspaper] Shanghai boasts a considerable number of bronze and stone statues and monuments, many of which are unfamiliar to most people. However, anyone who lived in Shanghai before the war will remember the enormous bronze statue of the "Goddess of Peace" that once stood on the Bund outside the Yangjingbang. The goddess's head was bowed, her arms outstretched, and a bronze monument was erected below, commemorating the Allied soldiers who died in the First World War. Unfortunately, the power of the Goddess of Peace could not withstand the evil forces of warmongers, and another major war broke out not long after. The Japanese knew nothing of peace and only knew how to manufacture poison gas. When their "Imperial Army's" guns and cannons ran out of ammunition, they set their sights on the large amount of copper and iron in the Goddess of Peace. Therefore, they spared no expense and disregarded everything, dismantling and removing the complete goddess and the two angels accompanying her. Fortunately, the warmongers soon surrendered unconditionally, and the Goddess of Peace finally returned wounded to the British Consulate, spared from destruction. However, her body, wings, and companions were all in pieces. Because the British Consulate was unable to store such a large bronze statue (because even the upper half of the goddess's body could not be lifted by a crane), they had no choice but to pile her in an open space, exposed to the elements, surrounded by rusty barbed wire.

Recently, the British United Services Association, on the one hand, could not bear to throw the goddess into the fire pit, and on the other hand, felt that the world really needed some peace to serve as a warning. Therefore, they proposed that the Municipal Government repair it. Mayor Wu also shared this sentiment and submitted a request to the City Council to discuss and make a decision on the matter. After discussions by the City Council's Public Works Subcommittee, they prepared to submit a resolution at the upcoming fourth general meeting.

However, the cost of repairing the Goddess of Peace is considerable. According to current estimates, the entire project (including the burial mound, etc.) to restore it to its original state would cost approximately 300 million yuan. The extent of the damage is as follows: the three bronze statues, large and small, have been broken into six pieces. The Goddess's right shoulder is sunken, her head is tilted to the right, the back of her head is dented, both wings are broken, with the tip of the left wing missing approximately five feet in length and two feet in width. A section of the front panel is missing, approximately four and a half feet long, two feet wide, and one foot high. At the same time, all three bas-reliefs below the tower are missing. The Municipal Government plans to repair the statue, reinforce the tower base and burial mound, and also build up the bank along the Huangpu River to prevent collapse. After the restoration, the bas-reliefs below the statue will be replaced with a victory commemoration of the Second World War, with revised inscriptions and commemorative bas-reliefs to reflect the current situation.

As for how to raise these funds, the plan is to organize a committee to jointly solicit donations from various expatriate communities in Shanghai, with the Municipal Treasury bearing a portion of the cost to demonstrate its leadership. This proposal is just waiting for the upcoming City Council meeting to make a decision. If it is approved, the Goddess of Peace will soon stand tall on the riverbank once again, reuniting with us.

### Female Young Women’s Christian Association Representatives, Pei Qin, and Others Discuss Sweden and New Zealand in Hangzhou

[Report from Our Hangzhou Correspondent on the 25th] Taking advantage of the World YWCA conference in Hangzhou, our reporter took the opportunity to interview representatives from various national organizations, broadly exchanging opinions on post-war life, national economies, educational systems, and the status of women. However, once the conversation began, everyone was filled with complaints. Regarding the current situation, most people were dissatisfied with reality. It was as if we were raising our heads full of hope to look at the sun, but the sky was always covered with heavy clouds of sorrow. Fortunately, these clouds of sorrow were dispelled by the representatives from Sweden and New Zealand.

Two Ladies Make Proud Statements

Miss Kajsa Barck Lagergern and Miss Jean Begg, representatives of the YWCA from Sweden and New Zealand, told me in proud tones, "Everyone in our country has food to eat, everyone has work to do, and everyone has books to read."

Miss Kajsa Barck Lagergern said, "In Sweden, all children between the ages of eight and thirteen are required to attend school, and children under the age of fourteen are absolutely prohibited from working in factories."

Forty Hours Per Week

Miss Jean Begg said, "New Zealand can proudly boast to the world about implementing a forty-hour work week. In our country, no boss has the right to ask employees to work more than forty hours a week. Workers work less than seven hours a day, and everyone has time off on Saturday afternoons and Sundays."

Free Education for Students of All Levels

They seemed exceedingly proud as they highlighted the strengths of their respective countries. In fact, from individual interviews conducted by our reporter, it was discovered that Sweden and New Zealand do indeed have many identical advantages that can serve as models for other countries. In terms of education, schools are run by the government, and from kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, to university, education is completely free. In Sweden, there is a minimal tuition fee for attending advanced vocational schools, but those from impoverished families can apply for exemptions. Ordinary middle schools are co-educational, while advanced colleges are mostly segregated by gender. Boys have more physical training courses, while girls have subjects such as cooking and sewing. Because education is free, everyone has the opportunity to receive education, and gender equality in education is naturally absolute.

In terms of employment, everyone in the country has a job. New Zealand strictly implements the forty-hour work week, and although Sweden does not have such a system, everyone has reasonable working hours and can receive the compensation they deserve, enough to maintain a life above the standard. Therefore, in those countries, it is often impossible to find a place to eat dinner after 6:30 PM because everyone goes home to enjoy family time.

Whether in Sweden or New Zealand, all citizens, regardless of gender, receive a considerable retirement pension at the age of seventy-five. At the same time, the government runs nursing homes where elderly people can spend their golden years in comfort by paying minimal fees. Therefore, the elderly do not have to worry about their declining years.

Hospitals Run by the Government

In terms of medical care, all hospitals are run by the government, and citizens can receive free diagnosis and treatment and receive all medications free of charge. During periods of illness, employees continue to receive their salaries in full upon providing a certificate from a doctor. Therefore, no one has to worry about illness or living while sick.

A Gigantic Snake Scares Away Voters, Election Site in Pixian, Western Sichuan, Plunged into Chaos Due to Stunt

[Report from Our Chengdu Correspondent on the 25th] In Pixian, Western Sichuan, during the re-election of the village chief, one candidate, known for his snake-handling skills, fearing defeat in the election, wrapped a gigantic snake around his waist, wore an overcoat, and entered the polling place. When he saw that the situation was turning against him, he angrily removed his overcoat and brandished the snake, scattering voters and plunging the entire venue into chaos. The election was indefinitely postponed, making it the greatest stunt in the election.

Gender Equality in Society

Regarding women, nearly ninety percent of women hold jobs outside the home. Marriage is absolutely free, and in politics, society, and treatment, women are completely equal to men. (Miss Barck Lagergren told the reporter that in Sweden, there are still very few instances of unequal pay between men and women. The National Association of Working Women is currently uniting to fight for change and believes that it will be improved soon.) To accommodate women's work, childcare centers are widespread throughout the country. Mothers drop off their children at the childcare center before going to work and pick them up after work. The fees are extremely low, and the facilities are extremely well-equipped. National laws explicitly stipulate that women be granted appropriate leave before and after childbirth. Swedish labor laws also stipulate that mothers can return home to breastfeed every few hours. Therefore, in those countries, children and family do not affect women's careers, and women can pursue their careers like men.

There are no domestic servants in Sweden and New Zealand, and everything is done by themselves. Miss Begg said, "We don't need them. Cooking is done with gas, washing is done with machines, working hours are short, and everyone has plenty of time to manage household chores."

Abolish the Death Penalty, Broadly Implement Rehabilitation

The reporter also remembers Miss Barck Lagergren specifically telling me that there is no death penalty in Sweden and that criminals are given rehabilitation education. She said, "Most people in our country are Christians, and everyone believes that everyone in the world can be reborn."

At the time, I nodded involuntarily, and I felt warmth all over my body. It was as if I saw the dark clouds disperse and the golden light shine brightly. The current state of Sweden and New Zealand is not comparable to the "Great Harmony" world advocated by Confucius. Looking at others and thinking about ourselves, naturally the distance is a bit far, but it is realistic. As long as we have this belief and are determined to pay any price. (Special correspondent Hong Xucai)

### 熱河魚鱗石

(Central News Agency, Rehe, 28th) There are two locations where the Rehe fish-scale stones are produced: one is in the Xinhuangdi area of Chaoyang County, and the other is in Wangjiadian, north of Lingyuan County. The Xinhuangdi products are mostly clustered, resembling many fish gathered together. Unfortunately, the stone is not very strong and can be peeled off layer by layer. The Lingyuan County products are individual in shape. A reporter once saw one in a local stall, resembling a live fish. Locals say there is another type of fish-scale stone, with the fish inside the stone, and the stone is transparent, looking like swimming in water, which is very vivid.

After the "September 18th Incident," the Japanese invaded Rehe and extensively excavated in Lingyuan and Chaoyang. They dispatched many geological history and archaeological experts to conduct on-site investigations, transporting the excavated fish-scale stones to their country, claiming them as relics from 3 million years ago. The fish-scale stones discovered in Rehe today are undoubtedly ancient fish that were submerged and transformed over many years.

The audience seats were full. Shen strongly argued and quibbled about extorting filial offerings from various branches. The income of each branch was as high as over 217 million yuan, but only over 5 million yuan was paid to the landlords by the Yin Guo branch, and no payments were made by any other branches. This is an unprecedented major case of encroaching on the interests of landlords and tenants. The accounts of each branch were all falsified, and many items of expenditure were fabricated. The court hearing started at 9:00 AM and lasted until 1:00 PM. Because further investigation is needed, Shen was remanded, and the rest were released on bail.

### 優遊的剎那　世界女靑年代表大會閉幕聲中　在杭州西泠飯店內外自由活動

(This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 28th) The sun rises over the city, and West Lake is still shrouded in mist. The Xiling Hotel has begun to stir. Representatives from twenty-three countries around the world are busy combing their hair, washing, and bathing... At exactly eight o'clock, the bell rings, and a sumptuous breakfast is ready. Everyone gathers in the dining hall, and after eating, they have to rush to the Foreign Guests Reception Center for a meeting. Time is really tight, and everyone is in such a hurry.

The meeting starts at nine o'clock and lasts until twelve o'clock, with only a fifteen-minute break, just enough to drink a cup of tea. The younger representatives look at the autumn scenery outside the meeting place, shining in the sun, and are clearly a little restless. Finally, the bell rings again, and the meeting is adjourned. Unfortunately, their stomachs are already rumbling. So, a bus takes them back to Xiling again. Mealtime is always the best opportunity for administrative reports, such as where the afternoon meeting will be held, which countries' representatives the chairman wants to talk to after the meal, etc. But today, the chairman suddenly became merciful and announced: "Free activities this afternoon." Oh! Ha! The whole place is filled with cheers.

After the meal, the representatives split into several groups for sightseeing. Those who like to go into the lake went boating. Another team set off for Hupao Spring, Liuhe Pagoda, Jiuxi Eighteen Streams, and Zhijiang University. The Finnish representative loves to ask questions: "What does Liuhe mean?" "Liuhe means east, west, north, south, heaven, and earth." "Why is it called 'he'?" ... No one can answer.

Upon arriving at a temple, the Indian representative is the best guide. She will tell you what the name of this Buddha is, how it is designed in India, and what the differences are between the composition and color of Indian temples and Chinese temples.

Whenever hiking, the German representative feels the most difficulty because she is short of breath and coughs a lot, often falling behind. The Swedish representative takes care of her everywhere, and the two are very close.

The Korean representatives are the most popular. Zhijiang University and Hongdao Girls' High School have both invited them. They said, "We would rather sacrifice sightseeing time and are willing to have more contact with Chinese students." So, one gives a speech, one translates, and another performs songs.

As the sun sets on North Peak, everyone gathers again in the Xiling dining room. During the meal, they exchange the experiences of their half-day tour, with joy and enthusiasm. But after dinner, everyone still has to go to the meeting with their tired bodies.

At ten o'clock at night, everyone returns from the meeting place and goes to their rooms to rest. This is when they sort out trivial matters. The German representative is thinking of friends who are starving, the chairman is arranging the agenda for tomorrow's meeting, the Chinese representatives are planning the reception, and the Mexican girl is reading a love letter under the moonlight, saying: Hangzhou is really the most ideal place to spend a honeymoon, and she will write to her lover to suggest it!

For fourteen days, these representatives have lived in the Xiling Hotel in Hangzhou, and everyone feels relaxed and beautiful. Now the World YWCA Conference is over, and everyone is about to leave. Many people want to go to Nanjing because they say, "It is rare to have the opportunity to come to China, and we must see the capital." There are also many people planning to go to Beiping because its magnificence is known worldwide. There are even more people who must return to their countries. However, no matter where they go in the world, they will never forget to pray for the unity and peace of the world. (Special Correspondent Hong Xucai)

### 教部重視東北教育長白師範不遷遼陽

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th) Regarding the education issues in the Northeast provinces, the Ministry of Education pays great attention to them. Although Changchun was in a dangerous city a few years ago, the Ministry actively established Changchun University, the scale of which is the largest in the country. However, due to the instability of the military, the school affairs have been greatly affected. Since the victory, Changbai Normal College has also been established in Yongji. It is rumored that it will be moved to Liaoyang, but this is not the case. However, because some faculty and students of the college took refuge in Liaoyang when the Communist bandits attacked last time, and the railway has not been restored, some faculty and students have requested to stay in Liaoyang for the time being. These are all temporary measures. Now, the National Zhongshan Middle School in Shenyang has long been approved to be established in Changchun. As soon as the situation stabilizes, it will be moved north. The Ministry of Education has also planned to establish a science museum and a library in Changchun. In the Ministry's plan, Changchun's educational status is more important than Shenyang. Therefore, the development of cultural undertakings will be focused on advancing north.

### The Past and Present of the Malayan Chinese Football Team - Once a Formidable Force

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Malayan Chinese Football Team is scheduled to come to Shanghai in the middle of next month, and the grand occasion of "Star East's" visit to Shanghai last year will be seen again. Here, let's briefly describe the historical facts of Malayan football.

Inter-City Competition

Originally, Malaya was divided into Singapore, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Malacca, Selangor, Penang, Perak, Kedah, and other cities. As early as 1912 - the tenth year of the Republic of China, when Malayan football was gradually developing, the British warship "Malaya" happened to arrive and, seeing this situation, specially donated a large silver cup to organize the Malayan Inter-City Football Competition. First, the North and South parts competed separately, and then the champions of the two parts decided the championship.

Since its inception, the winner of the South has almost always been the Singapore team, while the North has been contested by Selangor, Perak, Penang, and other teams for the final. This annual inter-city competition has never been interrupted until the declaration of war between Britain and Japan, when it was stopped. During this period, most of the British troops stationed there also joined the competition. The level of Malayan football has been improved invisibly, and it should be attributed to the efforts to promote it in the past twenty years.

Participating in the National Games

Shanghai football fans may feel unfamiliar with the words "Malayan Chinese," because the Malayan Overseas Chinese Association formed a team to return to China to participate in the Sixth National Games held in October of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The participating items included track and field and football, with the football team's record being the most brilliant.

At that time, the football competition adopted an elimination system. In the preliminary round, the Malayan Chinese team defeated Liaoning with a score of 9-2. In the second round, they won against Zhejiang with a score of 12-0. In the semi-finals, they defeated the strong Hebei team with a score of 5-0, entering the top four.

That year, the football championship was won by the Hong Kong team, but the strength of the Malayan Chinese team and the Hong Kong team was almost equal. They competed for the final, and the Malayan Chinese team was still leading 2-1 in the first half. As a result, it was 2-2, and the Hong Kong team only won by one goal. The Malayan Chinese team then defeated the Shanghai team with a score of 3-1, and because the Guangdong team abstained, they were ranked as the runner-up. The lineup at that time was:

Champion: Hong Kong Team Bao Jiaping, Yu Qingyuan, Liang Xianzhan, Li Guowei, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Li Shuoyou, Li Zhaorong, Cao Guicheng

Runner-up: Malayan Chinese Team

Huang Jinbai, Cai Wenli, Zhen An, Lin Zhiquan, Jian Dehui, Lin Xifu, Du Yachi, Guan Xinde, Diao Qingfu, Yao Shenglian, Yin Jinzhen

Strength of the Malayan Chinese Team

Once the strength of the Malayan Chinese team was revealed, Malaya became the focus of attention in the football world. The "South China" and "Eastern" teams repeatedly went to Malaya, but no matter how well-equipped they were, they still could not achieve a complete victory. Taking the "South China's" second expedition to Malaya in mid-May of the 30th year of the Republic of China as an example, although they had Li Huitang, Xu Yijingcheng, Zhong Yongshen, Liu Songsheng, Li Shuoyou, Zou Wenzhi, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, etc., in all seventeen games, they won twelve games, lost two games, and drew three games, which was considered the most satisfactory result of all expeditions. This year, the "Star Island" team went to England. At the beginning of leaving Hong Kong, they won repeatedly and were very ambitious. Unexpectedly, they encountered the Malayan Chinese team in Singapore and were defeated with a score of 1-3. The "South China" team and the Shanghai Eastern Youth League team also lost to the Malayan Chinese team one after another after going abroad (won against the Eastern Youth League 1-0, won against South China 2-0).

From the historical facts near and far, under the above-mentioned environment, the strength of Malayan football, regardless of metabolism, has always been maintained at a very high level. This time, they gathered the essence of Chinese football players from all cities in Malaya to form a strong team to challenge Shanghai. It is said that their offensive and defensive capabilities are very strong. The Chen Jiashou and Jiawan brothers in the two backs defend like iron walls, and the forwards Zhuo Zhenyu and Xie Wenliang are representatives of Singapore. If it is not affected by the weather (Malayan Chinese players are afraid of the cold), it is not impossible to create a battle record that exceeds last year's "Star East." The Malayan Chinese team lineup is attached as follows:

Zhu Zhicheng, Chen Jiawan, Chen Jiashou, Shi Jinhai, Li Yuyou, Yang Jiazong, Qi Qingrong, Xie Wenliang, Mei Yuanhua, Zhuo Zhenyu, Huang Jihan

### Preliminary Consultation on Taking Over the Municipal Stadium Yesterday - The Gymnasium and Swimming Pool Will Be Taken Over First

The personnel in charge of taking over the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium, after the Education Bureau appointed Director Jiang Zhouqing, and the Public Works Bureau appointed Director Wang Dingzeng, went to Jiangwan together with Engineer Xu Li, head of the section, at 3 pm yesterday for the initial takeover. As a result, it was not as difficult as imagined. The Municipal Gymnasium, the Municipal Swimming Pool, and the Great Auditorium can be taken over first, and the Municipal Stadium can also be taken over gradually. Once the Municipal Government replies to the Hong Kong Headquarters, the handover procedures can be formally carried out. The stadium staff will also be stationed in the stadium to work at the same time. The repair project will be fully handled by the Public Works Bureau. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has sent personnel to Beijing to receive the repair materials compensated by the Ministry of National Defense the day before yesterday. If the number is insufficient, the Municipal Government will be requested to find other ways. Director Wang and Director Jiang both expressed considerable optimism about the takeover work after returning from Jiangwan yesterday. However, they hope that the Municipal Physical Education College can move in immediately during the formal handover, which will be of great benefit to storage and repair.

### Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan Talks - There is Absolutely No Such Thing as a 50,000 Yuan Bill - It is Not Yet the Time to Change the Monetary System - Financial Institutions Must Be Gradually Simplified

[Report from This Newspaper] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and met with reporters at the Central Bank yesterday, describing in detail the various issues after the promulgation of the New Banking Law. According to him, there are three issues that should be paid attention to after the promulgation of the New Banking Law: First, the related laws and regulations that are not suitable before the promulgation of the New Banking Law should be announced and abolished separately after being reviewed one after another. Second, according to the provisions of the New Banking Law, the inspection matters of financial institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, and other parts of the country should be studied on how to continue to handle them. Third, according to the provisions of the New Banking Law, the conditions for new banks in the future and how to strengthen and improve the existing banks need to be studied. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying the above three points in detail in order to formulate appropriate and thorough measures. However, according to Xu Baiyuan's personal observations of international and domestic economic and political trends, financial institutions will gradually tend to be simplified in the future. In recent years, banks in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and Australia have gradually become nationalized and institutionalized. Therefore, it is believed that China will be quite strict in restricting the establishment of new banks in the future. Regarding the countermeasures for the establishment of provincial, municipal, and county local banks, they will generally be handled in accordance with the economic reform plan. Regarding the rumors that China will promote silver coins, he also expressed his personal opinion that this is still an economic way to reform the monetary system. However, this matter does not seem appropriate until the domestic economic situation is stable and the financial revenue and expenditure are balanced. Regarding the widespread rumors that 50,000 yuan bills are circulating in various agricultural areas, Xu Baiyuan categorically denied it, saying that 50,000 yuan bills have never been printed. Regarding the income and expenditure of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee since its establishment, he believes that it is very ideal. As for the current lending principles of the Four Joint Offices, they are still based on the three aspects related to the national economy, people's livelihood, and export. The total amount of loans approved by the office has reached more than 28 trillion yuan.

### Hua Stocks Fluctuate Uncertainly, Mostly Closing Transactions

The bearish atmosphere of Hua stocks was even heavier yesterday, and the trading volume was pitifully small. The market was in a state of closing transactions, and it was difficult to make any progress. However, due to the actual needs, the urgent need to reduce the securities margin is said to be very likely. Major players in the lower-level industry have more buying interest, and it is easy to turn back after being tired. Therefore, the market price is in an uncertain state, and there are often small rebounds.

Morning Opening

Without escaping the tired situation, Yongsha was quoted at 288 yuan for immediate delivery and 292 yuan for deferred delivery. Shortly after opening, it fell back to a low of 286 yuan for immediate delivery and 288 yuan for deferred delivery. At 10:30, the interest rate rose to 1.8 jiao and 2.25 jiao, and the situation turned into a struggle, and then fell again to 286 yuan and 288 yuan.

In addition, according to the rice industry, the rice market has plummeted in recent days, and the grain situation in this city seems to be improving, but the value of the rural areas' plowing and sales has depreciated, and they are exchanging for daily necessities. Because the demand for daily necessities is low, the income and expenditure are compared with each other, which actually makes the rural economy more and more impoverished. If this trend continues, it will form a hanging upside down, and it will be difficult for merchants to operate, and it is inevitable that the source will be blocked.

### Import of Raw Materials for Straw Hats Can Apply for Foreign Exchange

In order to encourage exports and earn foreign exchange, the Import and Export Management Committee has revised the "Measures for the Import of Raw Materials for Export Goods Manufacturing," submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review, and implemented the new measures in advance in order to seize the seasonal nature of exports and take care of the livelihoods of handicraftsmen. The case was officially passed at the general meeting held by the committee last Saturday. It is learned that the association has now started a pilot program with the Handcraft Straw Hat Export Industry Guild, registering the factories of various members. To date, about 40 manufacturers have applied to the Export Promotion Office. The raw materials are two types of hemp grass and gold silk grass. The foreign exchange earned by this handicraft often exceeds the cost a lot. If the raw materials are totaled at 300,000 US dollars, the price of the finished product can be worth more than 1 million US dollars. Furthermore, the profit of gold silk grass is three times, and the profit of hemp grass is six times. In order to prevent merchants from taking advantage of the opportunity, the association requires that all applicants for foreign exchange must provide a bank guarantee, that is, the raw materials obtained from the foreign exchange must be delivered in proportion to the finished products, and all foreign exchange must be handed over to the national treasury after the finished products are exported. It is learned that the association has expressed objections to the guarantee clause. The association has sent personnel to contact on the 28th, but the association has not accepted this requirement. It is also learned that the regulation was originally attached to List Three (A) and belonged to the non-quota import review department, with limited foreign exchange value, and the relevant authorities have first allocated it for抵充.

Based on the number of looms, if there are 6,800 looms in Shanghai and the allocation quota is assumed to be 7,000 boxes per month, then Shanghai can allocate 4,550 boxes.

### Preventing Elevator Accidents

To the Editor: Recent reports have detailed two elevator accidents resulting in injuries. These misfortunes are due to illegal usage. By design, each elevator door has a locking mechanism. When the door is opened, the power is cut off, and the elevator cannot operate. However, due to the high frequency of opening and closing each day, these mechanisms are easily damaged, often leading to shutdowns and disputes. As a result, drivers or repairmen sometimes simply bypass the door locks to achieve a quick fix, unaware that they are setting the stage for tragedy! I know this to be the case and cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to request that you expose this issue. Please urge all homeowners to conduct thorough inspections. If the elevator can still move while the door is open, there is a danger. With best regards, respectfully submitted by Bai Chongguang, formerly of the Watts Studio.

### Free Talk: Two Kinds of Literati - A Tentative Discussion of Jin Shengtan and Zhou Zuoren

— Ying Yu

There are two kinds of people who look down on literati, are unwilling to be literati, but in the end, still become literati. One is of the Jin Shengtan type, and the other is of the Zhou Zuoren type. In terms of character, the former is far superior to the latter; in terms of demeanor, the former is even beyond the reach of the latter. But strangely, both deeply regret being literati.

Although both express "regret," there is a significant difference in their essence.

Indeed, Jin Shengtan was a literatus, and he also ridiculed and despised literati who specialized in helping or flattering others. "The more a person reads, the more they hate readers," (Annotation of Water Margin, Chapter 32). He only hated a portion of the literati because he himself was most sincere. Therefore, he was dissatisfied with the confused and ignorant people who submitted to the Manchus at the time. His contempt for the flattering literati of the time was by no means the inherent "literati belittling each other" mentality. Instead, it was a realization of the adulatory and ingratiating postures of literati in that era and environment, which made him feel a bit nauseated. His high praise and annotations of Water Margin, calling it the "Sixth Genius Book," must be understood from this state of mind—"If the rites are lost, seek them in the wilderness." Yes, Jin Shengtan eventually had to don the guise of "feigned madness" and engage in the work of annotating genius books not tolerated by the patriarchal society of the time. In reality, Jin Shengtan's contempt for literati stemmed precisely from his profound understanding of the weaknesses of intellectuals, which led him to make excessive demands of literati. He hated the yes-men-type of servants but hoped to see a few rebellious and unfilial subjects in the feudal dynasty. In the end, he was disappointed.

So, what is Zhou Zuoren's "regret for being a literatus" all about?

Not long ago, a reporter from a Nanjing newspaper visited the prison near Tiger Bridge and wrote an article titled "A Record of Visiting Traitors in Prison," in which he reported the following about Zhou Zuoren:

"Zhou Zuoren came from the Bitter Rain Studio. His life has never been particularly prosperous, except for a fondness for a cup of bitter tea. In the early days of his imprisonment, he wrote couplets and fan paintings for others to express his resentment. In the past month, his temperament has changed. He often complains that knowing a few more characters has made his life miserable. If he had not gained literary fame, no one would have dragged him into this mess. Being an unreasonable puppet educational superintendent brought him no enjoyment, and now he is only suffering more."

Zhou Zuoren's deep regret for knowing a few characters was not a "philosophy" he realized after entering prison. More than ten years ago, he had similar views. The reason is that he regarded himself as a typical figure among literati. Although he advocated leisure, spirituality, and detachment, he still had some self-awareness and knew that he was not qualified to be a standard servant. Because after knowing a few characters, many things could not be done too blatantly. Historical schemers like Liu Jin and Wei Zhongxian were not born as literati. Cui Chengxiu, who was born as a literatus, was only a second-rate servant. He was not particularly regretful that he had become a puppet educational superintendent. What made him most uncomfortable was that he "did not enjoy anything" when he was "in office." If the position had been more lucrative and profitable, then he should have considered his "knowing a few more characters" as a great fortune, right?

They are both literati. There are Wen Tianxiang and Qin Hui; there are Shi Kefa and Ruan Dacheng. Knowing a few more characters certainly gives one the qualification to be dragged into trouble, but it also depends on whether you have your own convictions. Zhou Zuoren's talent is not comparable to Ruan Dacheng, and his influence is also not as great. It seems that he is only of the Xiang Shuixin type from the late Ming Dynasty, and he is even more different from Jin Shengtan. Jin Shengtan fell into the Qing court's clutches because he led an anti-corruption movement. In Zhou Zuoren's eyes, it was the behavior of a fool. Although his own greed for small gains and great losses was even less intelligent.

### Unmarriageable Daughters

— Zhixin

A few days ago, I met many classmates who graduated in the same year a few years ago at a gathering, and we couldn't help but feel emotional when we talked to each other. Recalling the happiness of student days, everyone is now running around for life, and the demeanor of the past has quietly passed away. What is especially emotional is that after asking each other, eight or nine out of ten, including myself, are still unmarried, and those who are married were married as early as school. Now we are all young people nearing thirty years old, and it is reasonable to get married, especially a few female classmates who are approaching the end of their prime. I didn't dare to ask directly, but after inquiring, they are all still single. We couldn't help but feel sad when we looked at each other. According to our research, the seriousness of unmarriageable daughters is actually greater than ours. Because we can wait a few more years to get married in our thirties, and it is not too late, but it is difficult for young ladies to avoid the feeling of being "past their prime" when they get married for the first time in their thirties. However, after careful study, the main reason for this phenomenon is themselves. Let me tell you:

At present, after leaving school, those who have a way to find a job usually have decent families. However, now that individual income can only barely support one person's life, it seems not worthwhile for such people to painstakingly manage a marriage. Even if they marry a daughter from a well-to-do family, they will not be able to afford it. So many people simply don't get married, enjoy a few years of single bliss, and talk about it when they have a way in the future. As a result, there are fewer people getting married.

There is also a group of people who are very interested in getting married because the family needs a helpmate. It doesn't matter if it's a bit hasty, and the partner is not a problem, but unfortunately, there is no fixed income. Because the family environment is poor, they did not finish their studies, and they have neither diplomas nor formal letters of introduction. It is really not easy to find a job. However, for the same woman, who is familiar with writing, it is much easier to find a job. Just look at any agency, company, or bank today, female employees often account for half of the total. In this case, many men with poorer qualifications will inevitably be unemployed, and at the same time, they will be deprived of the qualification to marry. The number of unmarriageable daughters is increasing year by year.

Today's so-called women of the times are very self-important. If they can get a job, they will sing high praises of independence and self-sufficiency, losing the virtue of being a female helpmate and not realizing that money does not come easily, creating wasteful habits. They don't even bother to look at men with slightly lower incomes. As a result, those who consider themselves to be as ugly as Ruan Ji's aunts don't have the courage to ask. This has delayed the youth of many young ladies!

The author's thinking is not stubborn at all, and there is no gender prejudice. Looking at the above, which is more important, marriage or career? May I ask you all, would you rather be unemployed or unmarriageable? If you still think that marriage is more reliable than a career, then you should resign from your job and go home to prepare to be a bride.

### Courtship in the Animal Kingdom

— Linlin

Those who study natural science will definitely feel very interested in the courtship of animals. Yes, the various forms of animal courtship are really too human-like. The animal courtship scenes written here are only a part of the animal kingdom, but they are enough to make us feel very interesting.

The humanization of courtship in the animal kingdom can be represented by several types of birds. For example, the ruff is a polygamous bird; the pigeon adopts monogamy; the sparrow is a philandering playboy; the egret is a hardcore hero; the male grouse is willing to humble himself to court; the male turkey is not particular about appearance; the oriole uses its singing voice to please the opposite sex; the peacock pursues its lover by flaunting its beauty... There are endless ways to fall in love.

When a little sparrow proposes, it opens its tail, droops its wings, and jumps from left to right, from front to back; at the same time, it opens its throat and sings a marriage proposal. It fully expresses its diligence, patience, and flattery.

What is the exact opposite of the little sparrow is the egret, because it has too much integrity; it only paces back and forth in front of the female bird, without ever looking back. Its reserved and proud attitude indicates that it is definitely not trying to entice its lover with beauty, charm, or magnificence.

The male peacock's tail is the most beautiful, and it relies on its beautiful tail to court. The peacock's wings and feathers are dull in color and not very attractive, so when it courts, it spreads its tail to cover its ugly wings. There is another type of bird called the green luan, which also uses its beautiful tail to court.

The male turkey is exactly the opposite of the peacock and the green luan, and it does not please the opposite sex with beauty. Because when it courts, its wattle becomes particularly swollen and bright red. From an aesthetic point of view, it is certainly not beautiful.

The most unbearable is the male grouse. The male grouse relies on its natural good looks and usually puts on an arrogant and arrogant attitude, but when it comes to courtship, it not only puts on a great show in front of the female bird, but then reveals the ugly state of wagging its tail and begging for pity, because its whole body is prostrate, and its head and neck touch the ground, as if kneeling down.

The ruff is a believer in heroism because it uses duels to win the favor of beauties.

When a male hummingbird courts the opposite sex, it is almost a purely poetic action. At first, it surrounds her, swinging like a pendulum, making a semi-arc-shaped flight. Then, with special affection, it raises the two ends of the arc; however, suddenly, it rushes straight up, about sixty feet; finally, it suddenly falls down, stops in the air, and appears in front of her like a shining diamond.

There is a type of bird in Australia called the gardener bird, and its courtship capital is building a beautiful nest. This nest is made of stones and grass stems and decorated with feathers of various colors. When courting, it stands at the door with a beautiful stone in its mouth to lure the female bird.

### Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

The Literary and Artistic Cultivation of Miss America

Americans are inherently a nation that loves literature and art. China was originally the oldest country of culture and education in the world, but now the customs have changed. China is in a time of war, with killings filling the fields and blood floating pestles, while Americans are instead laying down their arms and promoting culture, especially women, who all have cultivation in literature and art. This is of course largely due to the promotion of education, but it is also because the country is prosperous and the people are wealthy that they have the leisure to devote themselves to poetry, literature, music, and books. American women spend several hours a day working to make a living, and the rest of their time is almost entirely spent on literature and art. They have various poetry societies, author associations, music concerts, drama associations, and art exhibitions. Their literary and artistic cultivation is multifaceted, not just proficient in one field. Those who join the author association are also members of other groups. They engage in writing in their spare time from work and housework, and most of them write romance novels, which are first published in local newspapers, then reprinted in magazines, and then published as separate books by publishing houses. One manuscript is sold three times, and the income is quite substantial. Many of them have become famous, and their works have been adopted by Hollywood as film scripts, such as Amber Forever. The film rights alone are $500,000. If it is staged in the theater, there are separate royalties each time. Publishing a book will solve the problem of life, and $500,000 is more than enough to spend for a lifetime. Most American women can paint oil paintings, and it is not just for the sake of affectation. They do have a good command of it. Art museums in various places display the works of families. The wind of selling books is not as commercialized as in China. The scope of occupations in the United States is very wide, and it is not necessary to rely on selling to make a living. Therefore, Americans do not completely regard works of art as commodities. In fact, almost all Americans can paint a few strokes. They have the interest of appreciation, but not the appetite for buying. Moreover, buying and selling were formerly the style of painters and calligraphers, but now it is the habit of the nouveau riche. There are very few nouveau riche in the United States, so the sales of paintings are quite narrow. They also often hold exhibitions, and the purpose is not to promote works, but to appreciate and compare their own works with those of others. You can see middle-aged and elderly women in the venue, standing in front of each painting, holding a magnifying glass in one hand and admiring the famous paintings in front of their eyes, while the authors also treat them cordially and do not promote their own works, or tempt people to buy their works with flowery words. The association provides coffee and refreshments free of charge, but you have to pay to buy a catalog when you enter, from two and a half to one dollar, which is enough to cover the expenses and have a surplus. In addition to poetry, painting, and calligraphy, the piano is something that any woman can play. After tea and wine, playing a song on the piano is such a pleasant family environment and a good remedy for musical temperament. Many Shanghai women entrust their entire lives to waltzes and luminous cups. They not only need to read, paint, and learn poetry, but also know how to paint and understand music, and being a modern woman is not just about lipstick and stockings.

### Ji Xiaolan

— Ji Ming - Biography of Qing People, No. 2

In the 37th year of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries was opened, and books from all over the world were sought. It took more than ten years to complete, with a total of more than 36,000 volumes. The Wenyuan, Wenchao, Wenjin, Wenyuan (these are the four inner court pavilions), Wenhui, Wenzong, and Wenlan seven pavilions were built to store them. It is truly a great crystallization of the academic community in our country. The person in charge of this was Ji Wenda.

His name was Yun, his courtesy name was Xiaolan, and his other courtesy name was Chunfan. He was from Hejian and was precocious. When reading, he could read several lines at a glance. When sitting in a dark room at night, his eyes flickered like electricity, and he could see things without a candle. When his knowledge greatly expanded, his light also converged. In the Qianlong reign, he was nominated as a Jinshi. He served as Governor-General five times and Minister of Rites three times. In the tenth year of Jiaqing, he was appointed Associate Grand Secretary and granted the title of Junior Tutor to the Heir Apparent. He died in February of that year at the age of eighty-two.

He was proficient in everything and was especially good at the Han version of the Book of Changes. All his life's energy was devoted to the abstracts and catalog of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, and he no longer wrote his own works. However, he occasionally wrote novels and unofficial histories, such as Notes from the Thatched Abode of Close Observations. He was fond of humor and was like the Eastern Manqing. Once, he was on duty at the Hanlin Academy when it was suddenly reported that the Emperor had arrived in disguise. All the officials sat upright with solemn expressions. He dared not see the Emperor because he was bare-chested, so he hid under the bed. After a while, the room was silent. He then poked his head out to look, and he saw a person sitting with his back to the window, reading documents. He thought it was a colleague and immediately asked, "Has the old man left?" The person was furious and ordered him to come out, and it turned out to be the Emperor himself. He was very flustered and kowtowed, begging for death. The Emperor rebuked him, saying, "A Hanlin official who is bare-chested has already violated the court's orders. How much more guilty is he for calling the Emperor 'old man' behind his back?" He kowtowed and said, "The old man is the great elder of the world. The head is the origin of the human body, and 'zi' is a beautiful name for a man. Putting them together are all terms of praise. I know my crime, and I beg for death." The Emperor then ordered him to write a composition on the spot. When it was finished, the Emperor was pleased and pardoned him. His life was full of similar incidents. Talented literati often have unrestrained behavior. Isn't he one of those?

### The First Traitor

In history, the first traitor should be Cao Wushang, who was the Left Sima of Duke Pei. When Duke Pei was in Ba Shang, Cao sent someone to inform King Xiang, saying, "Duke Pei wants to be King of Guanzhong and make Ziying the prime minister. All the treasures are in his possession." Therefore, Duke Pei and King Xiang had the scene of the Hongmen Banquet.

However, the ancestor of this traitor was not as lucky as the traitors of today. Duke Pei learned of this matter from King Xiang and killed him immediately upon returning to the army. - Li Renzhong

### The Language of Drinking

— Sigou

At a banquet once, I said that I couldn't drink alcohol, and I could only drink half a cup. Who knew that my words were interpreted by the host as me being able to drink a lot, even if I didn't have a large capacity. That night, I got drunk because of the host's strong persuasion. This is not surprising, what I find surprising is how my words caused the host to misunderstand me.

After that drunken experience, I became cautious. Whenever I attend a banquet, I tell the host that I have a stomach problem and cannot drink alcohol, as instructed by the doctor. Moreover, in order to make the host believe me, I told him that even if I drank a drop, my stomach would hurt. This is a lie, and according to the citizen's textbook, it shouldn't be said, but these words sound like my true situation to the host. "This guy eats half a cup, it doesn't matter, let's not force him." So, I finished the matter with half a cup while answering politely and expressing respect. Sometimes I hate others for lying when I go out to work, because of this incident, I am afraid of wrongly accusing people; maybe liars also have their own compelling reasons.

After attending more banquets, I slowly discovered that the language of drinking is a branch of the national language, and it makes a lot of sense. The host saying that there are no dishes is not the truth; he may be hinting that there are two specially made dishes that no other restaurant in the city has, but after you praise them for a while (maybe it's true, maybe it's not), he firmly says that the dishes are not well made. The guest with a large capacity for alcohol who cannot drink freely says, "Today, I am borrowing flowers to offer to the Buddha and clearing the customs for the host." In this way, if he loses, he can get his wish. Drinking is also the most snobbish. Today, if you are an important guest, your capacity will be good, and people will respect you and persuade you. If you are a casual guest or your status is not obvious, you can't drink much alcohol even if you have a large capacity, unless a big shot asks you to be a "food storage," then you will have the opportunity to pour cup after cup into your mouth like a clown, and you may even be praised.

There is a type of person who comes from a business background, with little alcohol and a lot of talk. He can talk and laugh, his voice is loud, and he is unreasonable or only talks about brute force. If he doesn't drink, he simply has no right to speak and sits coldly on the side, but those who can talk don't need to drink much at all. He can call you brother and put on the identity of a brother, coaxing and scaring you to drink. There is no distinction between high and low at the banquet, and people can be informal, or he can call you uncle and "kneel" the wine glass (that is, put it upside down) in front of you. He can make a pitiful appearance and ask others to help him "step down." If you insist on not drinking, and the host respects you, he can say that you are not giving face to the host. Sometimes he quotes classics and sometimes he uses both literary and military tactics, and as a result, you have to drink. In this kind of occasion, it is best to admit defeat and remain silent. They argue that you ate less than him and refuse to let go, making people doubt whether drinking is pleasure or pain. If it is said to be pleasure, why use so much tongue; if it is said to be pain, what is the purpose of the host inviting guests? I think the occurrence of this phenomenon is entirely because there are few opportunities for public speaking in China, so those with good eloquence have nowhere to show their skills. They can only seek it at banquets.
