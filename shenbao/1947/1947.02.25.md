Powerful troops continued south from Beiping yesterday. The siege and defense war in Mancheng west of Baoding continues. The Communist forces' fortifications in that area are strong, and the tunnels are connected in all directions.

### New Property Tax; Under Consideration by the Government

Individual Assessment of Business Income Tax

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The government is considering the new property tax. At the direct taxation review meeting, preliminary discussions were held from a technical and theoretical point of view.

This method will be implemented in major cities. In remote areas, the simplified tax collection procedures will still be followed. The Ministry of Finance is now recruiting special tax revenue personnel, establishing account checking training classes, and training existing personnel for distribution to various places. Due to the large number of industrial and commercial institutions in the Shanghai area, there are not enough personnel to be allocated, so it is necessary to borrow technical personnel from the Central Bank to work.

For this reason, they held an emergency meeting to exchange views and decided to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Bureau of Social Affairs in the morning of the 25th. In addition, according to the person in charge of the gold shop industry, the total amount of gold stored in the city's gold shops is 8,000 taels.

### Representatives of Fuzhou Gold Jewelry Merchants Will Also Petition in Beijing

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 24th] After the promulgation of the emergency plan, hundreds of gold jewelry stores here were ordered to stop business yesterday. All gold shops believed that the requirement for jewelry makers to issue powers of attorney in accordance with the gold jewelry processing measures would cause customers to worry. In fact, it is almost equivalent to a complete shutdown. More than 2,000 gold industry employees in the city are about to fall into a tragic situation of unemployment. It is heard that the guild will send representatives to Beijing to petition, requesting appropriate relief.

Therefore, the previous statement appears to lack basis.

### Foreign Minister Wang Arrives in Shenyang for Inspection, Proceeding to Changchun Before Returning to Beijing on the 27th; Sino-Soviet Conference Unlikely to Involve the Northeast

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, accompanied by his wife, flew to Shenyang this morning. It is claimed that he will stay in the Northeast for three days and plans to return south on the 27th, making a brief stopover in Beiping without entering the city. If time permits, he also intends to visit Qingdao. During his three days in Beiping, Wang made great efforts to search for antiques and calligraphy, and a large number of antique dealers visited yesterday afternoon, but most transactions failed due to high prices. Wang only brought a batch of fresh fruit with him to Shenyang today. Wang's mission in Beiping remains a mystery.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang, accompanied by his wife, secretary Wang Dezhi, code clerk, etc., departed from Beiping at 8:40 AM on the 24th and arrived in Shenyang at 11:00 AM, staying at Zhang Jia'ao's private residence.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang stated: The initial decision to come to the Northeast was due to the importance of the Northeast to national defense and economic construction, so he came specifically for inspection. He plans to visit Changchun before returning to Beijing at the latest on the 27th.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang will arrive in Changchun from Shenyang. Wan Yi, Director of the Chinese Changchun Railway here, has gone to Jilin to prepare for the reception.

The information will include the number of pieces of equipment taken away by the Soviet army from the Northeast, the issue of the Chinese Changchun Railway, and the attitude of the Soviet army towards the National Army.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang stated: "The Four Foreign Ministers Conference may not involve the Northeast issue. Moreover, my visit here is unrelated to the Dalian/Lüshun situation." Foreign Minister Wang also said: "We have no reason to be anxious about the Northeast issue." A certain official stated that the Dalian/Lüshun issue was to avoid Wang having to say too much, and asked the reporters for forgiveness.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to reports, the Soviet army in Dalian will completely withdraw before March 12. Relevant parties have neither confirmed nor denied this and are unwilling to comment.

(2) The U.S. is assisting in the mediation between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists and has no intention of interfering in Chinese politics, but both sides must be sincere in order to succeed. If one side lacks sincerity, it is not possible. Although mediation has failed, if both sides propose peace talks again, the U.S. will still be willing to serve as mediator. In his personal observation, both the Nationalists and the Communists still seem to have some hope for peace talks. (3) The recent Moscow Conference is aimed at discussing European peace issues, and others may not be involved. (4) General Marshall is a friend of China, and after he becomes Secretary of State, he will definitely increase the friendship between China and the United States. He is currently considering assisting China with various technical issues.

### Sheng Shicai and the Soviet Union; Rumors of a Secret Treaty

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] A senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of Xinjiang Province, may have signed a secret treaty with the Soviet Union stipulating joint development of Xinjiang's mineral resources and cooperation in developing import and export trade. According to the current Chairman of the province, Zhang Zhizhong, the former Chairman of the province may have entered into such agreements, but he does not wish to comment on their nature at this time; he will formally announce and clarify this matter later.

### Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group; Report Released Publicly; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is Studying Implementation Plans

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group completed its various tasks in November of last year, and the Chinese and American members of the group jointly compiled a report. The report describes China's agricultural situation in detail and proposes many suggestions for China's future agricultural construction, rural revival, and agricultural administration. It is an important document for future Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation. The report was submitted to the governments of both countries by Chinese and American members for review. Due to its broad content and many relationships, it has not been publicly released for national reference until now. It is now known that the governments of China and the United States have agreed to release the report publicly on the 24th of this month. As for the preliminary implementation plan based on various suggestions, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is studying it in coordination with relevant agencies. The summary of the group's report is as follows:

China's agricultural construction plan is deeply related to the prosperity of the entire country, and it must be appropriately coordinated and continuously improved to be effective. The clothing, food, housing, and transportation needs of the Chinese people largely depend on agricultural products. Therefore, anything that affects agriculture will affect the lives of more than 75% of the farmers, and also the happiness of every person in the country. The group firmly believes that a perfect agricultural plan will bring about tangible improvements in the material and spiritual life of farmers, and will also greatly help in the fundamental resolution of China's domestic problems.

Agriculture and industry are as dependent on each other as rotating wheels. If they are not planned and purchased together and advance equally, neither can develop to a high degree. The largest consumers of Chinese industrial products are farmers, and the size of farmers' consumption depends entirely on the strength of their purchasing power, that is, whether their economy is affluent. Therefore, the improvement of agriculture must go hand in hand with the development of industry, so that industrial products can have a broad market. Moreover, the development of industry requires the import of some machinery from foreign countries, which requires foreign exchange. Before the war, China's agricultural product exports accounted for 70% of the total exports. Therefore, agricultural products are the main source of foreign exchange. Therefore, anything that can promote the production, processing, and transportation of agricultural products for export will help the construction of industry and increase the welfare of the people of the whole country.

The group firmly believes that the above-mentioned improvements can be seen in reality. According to field observations, if China can apply the latest scientific methods, such as improving crops, soil, livestock, and agricultural tools, it can greatly increase agricultural production. Improvements in agricultural loans, transportation, and marketing can increase farmers' income, and the poverty of rural society can be reduced.

Content of the Suggestions

The group deeply feels the difficulties of the current environment for farmers. To solve this problem, there must be a perfect plan, coupled with a reasonable and sound organization, to make the following suggestions:

(1) Special attention should be paid to the construction of chemical fertilizer factories, the development of farmland water conservancy, the improvement of crop and livestock varieties and the prevention and control of their diseases and insect pests, the construction and increased production of fuelwood forests, and the production of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. (2) Emergency measures should be taken to adjust foreign exchange rates, reduce agricultural loan interest rates and transportation costs, encourage the production and export of agricultural products such as tung oil, silk, tea, and wool, and resume the operation of relevant industrial stoppages. (3) Efforts should be made to supply low-interest agricultural goods in large quantities, improve the tenant system in certain areas, implement land surveying, registration, and valuation, and enforce the land tax issues and land laws promulgated by the central government in 1946. (4) Standards, grading, inspection, quarantine, and market control of agricultural products for export and domestic sale should be implemented. (5) National education related to agriculture and forestry welfare, including public health, protection, transportation, dredging rivers, and flood prevention, should be actively promoted. (6) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education should cooperate closely and strive to realize the connection between agricultural colleges and agricultural experiment fields in each district. The existing Agricultural Extension Committee should be reorganized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry into the Central Agricultural Extension Bureau, and extension agencies should be established in provinces, counties, and districts. (7) Nine districts should be set up across the country. Each district should select a central location and establish an agricultural college, an agricultural experiment field, an agricultural extension office, and an agricultural library to be responsible for coordinating the agricultural education, research, and extension work of each province in the district. The proposed district center locations are Nanjing, Beiping, Changchun, Lanzhou, Wugong, Chengdu, Wuchang, Guangzhou, and Taipei. (8) The Central Agricultural Control Bureau should be established within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and sixteen branch bureaus should be established throughout the country. (9) The existing Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Bank should be merged to form a National Agricultural Bank to supply various agricultural financial needs. (10) The Ministry of Social Affairs should discuss appropriate measures to prevent rapid population growth with government force.

The completion of the above suggestions cannot be achieved overnight. The group believes that the development of various agencies must be determined by the urgency based on whether suitable talents can be recruited. In order to cultivate such talents, it is proposed to send promising staff members abroad for advanced studies.

In order to implement the above suggestions, agricultural construction funds must be greatly increased. Considering the close relationship between Chinese agriculture and the welfare of the people of the whole country, the group firmly believes that the increase in such large amounts of funds is not excessive.

The group hopes that some of the undertakings in the above suggestions can be the beginning of future Sino-American agricultural cooperation.

### People's Organizations to Implement a Slow and Steady Approach; The Ministry of Social Affairs Plans to Submit for Approval by the Highest Authority; The Content is Divided into Two Parts; Professional Organizations Adopt a Licensing System

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Ministry of Social Affairs has recently drafted the organizational principles of people's organizations and submitted them for approval by the highest authority. The content is divided into two parts. A registration and licensing method is adopted for professional organizations because professional organizations participate in elections and may be transformed into candidates for public office, so they must still be subject to control. Non-professional organizations adopt a filing system and are not subject to any restrictions. Organizations that are established submit a filing request. After this principle is decided, the Ministry will proceed with drafting the People's Organizations Law. Other laws and regulations that violate the above spirit will also be revised or repealed. As for the distribution ratio of representatives of professional organizations in agriculture, industry, and commerce, a conclusion has been reached after multiple discussions. The ratio of each province and city will be decided according to the population size, and the provinces and cities will then distribute it to agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations according to the population ratio of agriculture, industry, and commerce in the province and city. In addition, representatives of free professional organizations will be produced by the central government. In order to encourage experts and scholars to participate in politics, the distribution ratio between them and agriculture, industry, and commerce will be increased.

Editorial

### Re-Implementation of Price Deliberation

The "Implementation Measures for Price Deliberation," formulated according to the four principles of stabilizing prices in the "Economic Emergency Measures Program," has been passed by the Supreme National Defense Council and sent to the government for implementation. This method is the procedural law for the government to stabilize prices, and the method of stabilizing prices is to adopt a deliberation policy, which is analyzed as a policy of "assessing" and "negotiating prices." This policy was used during the Anti-Japanese War, but it failed due to the lack of scientific technology in theory. The "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Extraordinary Times," promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on February 20, 1939, also represent the full picture of the wartime price deliberation policy. The content and spirit of the "Implementation Measures for Price Deliberation" proposed by the Executive Yuan this time are somewhat the same as the wartime measures; however, they are not completely the same, and there are many things to be discussed about their implementation in today's situation. Therefore, based on what we have seen, we offer the following criticisms:

(1) Deliberation Organization: According to the provisions of the implementation measures, a price deliberation committee shall be organized in places where it is necessary to deliberate prices. It shall be organized by the director of the competent bureau (referring to the Social Bureau), as well as representatives from the Senate, the Chamber of Commerce, the Labor Union, the Industry and Commerce Association, and the Public Security Bureau, forming a committee of seven to eleven people. Their main responsibility is to set the selling prices of essential daily necessities for the people and assist in reporting behaviors that violate the negotiated prices. This constitutes the highest authority for controlling prices at the local level. However, the spirit of the price negotiation policy should be fairness and impartiality; this should be the case for producers, and even more so for consumers. The Chamber of Commerce and the Industry and Commerce Association represent the producers, while the government and the Public Security Bureau represent the authorities; only the Labor Union represents the consumers, the hardworking masses. If the price negotiation is to be fair and impartial, it should be based on taking into account the interests of both producers and consumers. The original "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Extraordinary Times" paid considerable attention to this, so the future price evaluation committee should add more representatives from people's organizations to represent the majority of consumers, the hardworking masses, to speak on their behalf, so that fairness can be achieved.

(2) Evaluation Standards: According to the provisions of the implementation measures, the items subject to price negotiation shall be based on essential daily necessities for the people, excluding table salt, and the profit margin shall be added to the cost of the goods, according to the usual practices of various industries in the local area. The prices are subject to re-negotiation when the cost of goods changes drastically. There are several points to note about this price negotiation standard: (1) The prices to be assessed and negotiated are limited to essential daily necessities for the people. How are the prices of other goods to be controlled and stabilized? It seems like freezing the prices of essential daily necessities without freezing others; (2) The assessment method is based on cost, not on market prices. In theory, it is a cost evaluation. However, cost lacks a uniform law. The production cost of the same commodity varies depending on the production relationship; producers have different interest rates, freight charges, management fees, and depreciation depending on the organization and operation; among these subtle and complex factors, how will the price evaluation committee find a solution? If the price of a certain item is assessed based on the item with a high cost, the result protects small businesses but also benefits large businesses. If the standard is based on the item with a low cost, the result is that it protects large businesses while harming small businesses. There are also many accounting problems; how can we bear to recall the painful experiences of price deliberation in the rear during the past? (3) According to the "Economic Emergency Measures Program," the price index should be frozen at the level of January of this year. Undoubtedly, this should be used as the standard during deliberation, but the implementation measures also acknowledge that re-negotiation is possible when the cost changes drastically, as if acknowledging that there are factors that cause prices to rise. If this is the case, the price deliberation committee still cannot freeze prices; it must keep an eye on this unbridled wild horse at all times.

(3) Penalties: According to the provisions of the implementation measures, those who violate the approved negotiated prices may be punished in accordance with the "Regulations for Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices." According to this regulation, it was promulgated and implemented by the National Government on February 15, 1945, and its legislative basis is the provisions of Article 8 of the "National General Mobilization Law," so it can also be said to be a subsidiary law of the General Mobilization Law. As is well known, the "National General Mobilization Law" is an emergency law, a mandatory law, during wartime, which greatly restricts the rights and freedoms of the people. Now that the war against Japan has been won and the situation has changed, among the forty-eight laws and regulations that the Supreme National Defense Council passed to amend and abolish last year, the "National General Mobilization Law" and the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Obstruction of National General Mobilization" were also repealed; in legal terms, when the mother law is repealed, the subsidiary law should also lose its effectiveness. This time, the "Implementation Measures for Price Deliberation" again authorize local governments to revive the "Regulations for Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices." This is a flaw in legislative technique, and it is also a pity that the implementation measures contain excessive urgency and were not submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure. Regarding this point, if the administrative authorities do not provide relief and amend the "Regulations for Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices," or resubmit them for legislative approval, there may be suspicions of arbitrary action. If this step is lacking, those who are punished in the future can file an appeal according to law.

The above is only a criticism of a few important items in the implementation measures. There are still many technical problems that may occur during the implementation of the evaluation; how to use them reasonably depends on the administrative capacity of the local government. Otherwise, the so-called stabilizing prices and deliberating prices, when implemented by incompetent administrators, will inevitably lead to the failed path of "stopping boiling water with soup, and saving a fire with firewood."

### After Kawashima Yoshiko was Escorted to Nanjing: Detained in a War Criminal Detention Center; Will Be Returned to Beiping after Testifying

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The news that the female spy Kawashima Yoshiko (Jin Bihui) was escorted to Nanjing from Beiping has aroused great interest in all circles, but the authorities have always kept it secret. Kawashima was flown directly to the capital from Beiping on the morning of the 22nd. After arriving in Nanjing, she was escorted to the Ministry of National Defense, and at 2:00 PM on the same day, she was transferred to the Xiaoying War Criminal Detention Center, where she was detained in cell number 8. Reporters visited the center on the 24th, but were politely refused by the person in charge. They could only look at Kawashima's appearance from a distance through the window bars. At that time, Jin Bihui was sunbathing in the square with other war criminals. She was wearing a blue cloth cheongsam, had short hair, and wore cloth shoes. Her complexion was ruddy and her attitude was relaxed. At times, the sunlight filled the ground, and the outdoor temperature was quite high. After being exposed to the sun for a long time, she retreated to the shelter under the eaves, seemingly unwilling to be tanned. It is said that her treatment in prison is the same as other war criminals. One female war criminal, a Taiwanese named Chen, lives next to her. Jin Bihui once asked the detention center to allow the two of them to share a room, but this was not approved. She speaks fluent Beiping dialect when talking to the management staff of the detention center, and speaks fluent Japanese when talking to other war criminals. It is said that she is 33 years old this year and is still complacent about what she has done in the past, and has no intention of repenting. As for Jin Bihui's escort to Nanjing, she was summoned to the war crimes military tribunal to testify for Lieutenant General Takahashi, the former chief of staff of the Japanese North China Garrison Army. After Takahashi's trial is over, she will be returned to Beiping, where she has already been sentenced to life imprisonment for treason.

### Wuxi Bans Welcoming Gods and Temple Fairs

[Our Wuxi Correspondent] County Magistrate Xu Chaoruo, in view of the vulgar customs of the people in this county, holds welcoming gods and temple fairs every spring, which not only wastes manpower and money, but also easily allows local ruffians and hooligans to mingle among them, extorting and blackmailing in the name of temple fairs to enrich their own pockets, affecting local security, should be strictly eliminated.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 24th] The Xujiapeng Wharf workers'械门case, which has repeatedly turned into a full-scale brawl, has not been fully resolved despite repeated mediation by various agencies and unified organization. Yesterday morning, the workers under Huang Quanlin insisted on not being controlled by the Railway Bureau and privately negotiated freight transportation with various transfer companies, forcibly carrying out loading and unloading. They also hired more than 200 shrews, each carrying filthy objects, shouting and scolding along the wharf, while refusing workers from Wang and Wang to work at the station, causing temporary chaos. The military police felt unable to manage the situation, and it was not until 3:00 PM that they were dispersed under suppression. The competent authorities are now consulting on a thorough solution.

### Prisoners Escape from Quzhou Prison: Twelve Escapees

[Our Quzhou Correspondent] Inmates at the Quzhou County Local Court detention center, since the promulgation of the amnesty decree, those with relatively minor crimes who met the amnesty conditions have been released successively. Those who have not been released are mostly thieves and serious criminals. Because the amnesty decree and sentence reduction methods have been delayed, they have long been uneasy. After dinner on the morning of the 16th, they were released into the cage for recreation as usual. The prisoners took the opportunity to rush to the factory and the kitchen, grabbing knives, wooden sticks, and clubs to carry out a riot. At that time, Director Zhang led the guards to suppress them, but because the defense force was weak, they were beaten and injured. Then they broke through the back door and fled in droves.

The prison has reported to the Pacification Headquarters and police and military agencies for assistance in the arrest.

### Four-Power Military Government Formulates Laws: Dissolves the Prussian Federation: To Prevent the Revival of Nazi Militarism: Submits Report to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference Next Month

[United Press Berlin 23rd] The four Allied military commanders in Germany today drafted a law formally dissolving the Prussian Federation, the historical birthplace of German militarism. This law will not need to be submitted to the Allied Control Council of the four-power German occupying military government for final approval. The four-power military commanders proceeded with their meeting as usual on the 23rd of this month and reached an agreement that the four-power report on the elimination of Nazism and militarism, which had been in dispute for a long time, would be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The content of the report has not yet been revealed, but it is understood that the four powers may express satisfaction with it. Previously, the Soviet Union refused to hand over any information on living Nazis, leading to a week-long stalemate. The Soviet Union also objected to the "dissolution of the Prussian Federation" not being decided by the Control Council, but allowed it to be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference for handling.

Economic Cooperation Between the British and American Zones: Supported by the Four German States

[United Press Berlin 23rd] Lieutenant General Clay, the new military governor of the US military in Germany, said today that the economic merger of the British and American zones has been guaranteed by the four German states in the US occupation zone, expressing full support and cooperation. Clay's statement was made after the administrative chiefs of Bavaria, Hesse, and Württemberg-Baden, and the mayor of Bremen, held consultations. Clay and officials from his military government discussed the relationship between the governments of the various states and the economic institutions of the two newly merged zones. It is said that "this discussion was extremely satisfactory because it has clarified the relationship between the two parties. As a result, we have obtained guarantees from the four states within the US occupation zone that they will unanimously support the economic integrity and cooperation that we advocate."

### French Deputy Prime Minister Clarifies: Outline of the Plan for Germany: The Ruhr Industrial Zone Under International Management: The Saar Implements Economic Merger with France

[Agence France-Presse Toulon, 23rd] French Deputy Prime Minister and Communist leader Thorez gave a speech to the crowd in Freedom Square in the city center today, criticizing the Allied countries for reducing the amount of coal sent from the Ruhr area to France, disregarding France's needs, and prioritizing the revival of Germany. Thorez also elaborated on a plan for solving the German problem, which will be submitted by France to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, with the following five key points: (1) Immediately and completely eliminate Nazism in Germany and elsewhere; (2) Immediately disarm Germany; (3) Destroy Germany's war industry and strictly control its heavy industry; (4) Internationalize the Ruhr area; (5) The Saar area to implement economic merger with France. Thorez said, "The entire future of France has been invaded by Germany three times in 75 years. We French people, as well as people of shame all over the world, must understand that we should take measures to protect our country against aggression is absolutely necessary. Regarding the internationalization of the Ruhr area, the area has been a pan-Germanist war arsenal, so it should be managed by international institutions and work exclusively for the reconstruction of countries that have been invaded by Germany. Our right to security and our claim for reparations are one and the same. Of course, we do not admit that we want to revive Germany and not our own country. The internationalization of the Ruhr area can enable France to obtain a supply of coal. As for the Saar area, France has always demanded economic merger with the area, but we do not want to violate the will of the people of the Saar area and annex the area. What we are asking for is justice. We have never mistaken the entire German people for Hitler, but the German people must acknowledge their responsibility for causing losses to other countries."

Reasons for the Delay in the Anglo-French Alliance

### Turkey Attaches Importance: To the Moscow Conference

The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Has Achieved Success

[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 23rd] The Turkish Broadcasting Station recently issued a message stating that Turkey is eagerly awaiting the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Allied countries still have many major issues to resolve, because not only the fate of Europe, but also the fate of the entire world, depends on the decisions to be taken by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[Reuters London, 23rd] Preparations for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference are progressing smoothly. The four foreign ministers' representatives on German and Austrian issues will formally adopt the reports to be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on Monday and Tuesday. There are still two main issues regarding the Austrian issue that have not been agreed upon, namely the definition of borders and Austrian capital. The four powers also have differing opinions regarding the preparation process of the German peace treaty and the extent to which small countries participate. According to general indications, although the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference is limited to discussing German and Austrian issues, diplomatic activities to amend and subscribe to alliance agreements may also be inevitable, such as the signing of the Anglo-French alliance, the Franco-Czech, and Franco-Polish alliances, and the revision of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, which will become activity goals outside the formal agenda of the Moscow Conference.

### Jinnah Insists on the Partition of India and Pakistan

The Muslims of Bihar Province have made many sacrifices, which I am proud of. The sacrifices of these people are by no means in vain, they bring the goal of partition closer and closer, and they are ready to continue to sacrifice to reach this goal." At the same time, Masriqi, the leader of the Muslim Independence Party in New Delhi, said: "The withdrawal date set by the British army is the beginning of a massacre of Muslims. The British statement is a disguised prank."

### Security Council Agenda

[Associated Press Lake Success, 23rd] Representatives of the United Nations Security Council are optimistic today that they can end the current stage of discussions on the atomic control issue this week, while resolving the dispute between Britain and Albania. The focus of the Security Council's work this week is as follows:

(1) The Albanian incident may end with the poetry collection on the 24th, or at another meeting at the weekend. (2) After discussions on the atomic control incident on the 25th, it will be returned to the Atomic Energy Commission, ordering it to continue its efforts to reconcile the views of the United States and the Soviet Union, so as to avoid a showdown between the two countries in the Security Council on the initial recommendations of the Atomic Energy Commission. (3) The United States' request that the former Japanese mandated territories in the Pacific be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations may be submitted for discussion on the 26th. It is reported that the US representative Youssef is prepared to request that this case be included in the agenda of that day's meeting, but those in charge said that Otto, in view of the opposition from Britain and the Soviet Union, does not intend to request immediate acceptance of the case.

### Marshall Supports Acheson; May Not Reply to Soviet Note; No Question of Acheson Resigning

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Official sources here predicted tonight that Secretary of State Marshall would firmly support Deputy Secretary of State Acheson's remarks that "the Soviet Union is adopting an aggressive and expansionist foreign policy." These sources also stated that Marshall had already made his position clear on Acheson's remarks before the Senate Atomic Energy Committee on the 10th of this month, and therefore firmly believes that Marshall will adhere to his position to the end. Government officials stated that the United States has not yet received the new note from Molotov to Marshall, as broadcast by Moscow Radio. Moscow Radio stated that Molotov's new note clarifies that the Soviet Union cannot accept Marshall's defense of Acheson's remarks. Diplomatic circles believe that if Marshall prepares to reply to this new note, he will merely reiterate his previous statements. However, it remains questionable whether Marshall will reply.

Some officials initially expressed their opinions on the potential impact of this heated exchange on the upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, suggesting that Marshall and Molotov might have a rocky start at the Moscow Conference. Others believe that Marshall and Molotov are merely trying to gain the upper hand before the Moscow Conference, and that this dispute will not be of great significance.

According to informed sources, they believe that Molotov's note is a test by the Kremlin of Marshall after he became Secretary of State. They also stated that Marshall's response to Acheson's alleged gaffe has made Moscow realize what they were trying to discover, that Marshall is not someone who can be easily intimidated by Moscow's tough tactics. They also pointed out that Marshall has always been a soldier, and his emergence as a politician is a product of circumstance, so he will definitely fight to the very end. Other sources believe that the Soviet Union is using pressure to force Acheson to resign, but Marshall immediately publicly defended Acheson, indicating that he will consistently support Acheson, and there is absolutely no question of Acheson resigning.

### Border Area Martial Law; Free Passage Prohibited

### Shocking Nazi Plot: Threatening the British with Disease-Causing Bacteria; Attempting to Force Britain to Join an Anti-Soviet War

[Our Report] London, 24th Broadcast: This time, the underground secret scheme to restore Germany is very large in scale. Today, British authorities continued to arrest many Nazis in their occupied zone in Germany and discovered their great secrets. According to the evidence obtained by Rosenberg, the British Nazi bacteriology expert, Germany prepared to propose to Britain the organization of a "Western Line Group" to wage war against the Soviet Union with bacteria, otherwise Nazi party members would destroy London with disease-causing bacteria. The expert, Rosenberg, wrote to the British authorities, requesting the restoration of German military strength, otherwise it would be secretly sold to the Soviet Union. Rosenberg claimed that 12 Germans could wipe out London, and 60 could wipe out the entire United Kingdom.

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] U.S. and British occupation forces today uncovered a large-scale Nazi underground movement, whose personnel plotted to massacre the occupation forces with secret bacterial weapons. Several hundred people have been arrested, including a former German army colonel who participated in military affairs during the last war. This is the largest conspiracy case uncovered since the war, covering a wide range of the two occupied zones.

[United Press, Berlin, 24th] U.S. and British occupation authorities continued to arrest Germans last night to crush the underground Nazi conspiracy. It is rumored that this conspiracy extends throughout Germany and aims to revive German forces to "lead European countries against the Soviet Union." Arrested Nazis include several fugitive stormtrooper officers who claim to have secret bacterial weapons. Intelligence officers are rigorously interrogating the hundreds of arrested persons in order to gather clues and capture the secondary conspiracies of the underground group. U.S. military officials said that the headquarters of the underground group is apparently in the British defense zone.

### Far East Military Tribunal Reconvenes; Japanese Lawyers Still Quibbling; Fabricating Lies to Conceal the Truth from the World

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th] The Far East International Military Tribunal reconvened today, entering the defense phase. Japanese defense lawyer Kiyose first presented a comprehensive defense statement, which had been carefully revised by all the Japanese and American defense lawyers. The main points are as follows: (1) Individuals have no responsibility for actions based on national sovereignty; (2) Pre-war education and operational plans were not preparations for aggression, but were due to general ethical and economic conditions; (3) The so-called co-prosperity sphere, etc., were not aggressive in nature, and the special feelings of the Japanese people have been misunderstood; (4) The concept of conspiracy is only found in Anglo-American law and does not exist in international law; (5) It is inappropriate to add crimes related to peace and humanity to the concept of war crimes; (6) Homicide based on war is inappropriate; (7) The Northeast Incident and the Sino-Japanese Incident were acts of self-defense against provocation; (8) The Tripartite Pact and preparations against the Soviet Union were purely defensive in nature; (9) The Pacific War was the inevitable result of the relationship between Japan and the United States at the time and was purely a war of self-defense; (10) The United States was fully aware of the Pearl Harbor incident in advance by listening to the radio. The notification contained the content of a declaration of war. The fact that the notification was given after the start of the war was not the intention of the Japanese government, but was due to force majeure; (11) It is inappropriate to say that the Pearl Harbor incident was a surprise attack.

### Contents of the Defense Statement

The defense statement claimed that Japan sympathized with China's self-existence and development, and had invited a large number of Chinese students since the mid-Meiji era, including President Chiang Kai-shek. Since the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the Japanese government and the public have expressed great goodwill towards Dr. Sun Yat-sen's cause. As the prosecutor pointed out, the General Staff Headquarters did draft operational plans every year, but China never established such comprehensive, hypothetical operational plans. The Northeast Incident, the Sino-Japanese Incident, and the Pacific War were all separate events with different specific causes, and there was no consistent plan between them. Japan never expected to engage in a full-scale war with China, so there was no overall plan. The statement also argued that Japan had to obtain special interests in Northeast China due to its large population, small land area, and restrictions on immigration by the United States. At that time, the Northeast government cooperated closely with Japan to maintain its power. Later, as the movement to restore national rights in China rose, the situation in the Northeast also changed. As the Kuomintang established branches in the Northeast, disputes between China and Japan gradually increased. The prosecutor believes that the railway bombing incident on the night of September 18, 1931, was planned by the Japanese side, but this is not the case. The emergence of "Manchukuo" was a spontaneous movement of the people in the Northeast. The responsibility for the Lugouqiao Incident does not lie with the Japanese side. If the incident could have been resolved locally at the time, it would not have escalated. At that time, Japan insisted on a non-expansion policy, and only demanded the clarification of North China and the abandonment of anti-Japanese policies in other places. In 1932, the Chinese side disregarded the Shanghai Truce Agreement and built fortifications in the demilitarized zone, concentrating more than 50,000 troops in Shanghai. At that time, the Japanese naval landing force stationed in Shanghai was less than 4,000 people, and the war in Central China occurred in this way. Japan had no economic aggression against China. At the same time, economic aggression itself is not a crime. The cruel acts committed by some Japanese troops in China are regrettable, but the facts have been excessively exaggerated, and some have been fabricated.

### Fierce Verbal Battle in Court

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] When the International Military Tribunal convened today, there was a fierce verbal battle between Judge Webb and the defendants, all due to the defendants' lawyers re-fighting the court's rules, jurisdiction, and interpretations of international law. The intensity of the argument was unprecedented since the Japanese war criminals were charged last April. Webb directly ordered Takayanagi, the lawyer of the defendant Suzuki, the former president of the Planning Board, to remove legal or border-related issues from his defense, and the verbal battle stopped. Webb stated that the court's rules restrict the defendant to presenting evidence only at this stage. Former Prime Minister Hiranuma, eighty years old, the oldest of the defendants, was unable to stand up when the judges entered the courtroom at the afternoon session and was taken out for examination. The doctor said that Hiranuma's condition was not serious.

### Shigemitsu, Doihara, and Others Oppose Kiyose's Defense Statement

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th] The defendants Shigemitsu, Hirota, Hiranuma, Doihara, Suzuki, and others stated today that they completely disagree with the defense statement presented by defense lawyer Kiyose, and declared that they reserve the right to make their own individual statements in the future.

It is expected to be resolved this week. McNutt denied yesterday the rumors from Shanghai that he would be transferred to be the ambassador to China.

### Famous German Scientist Talks About Atomic Secrets

The atomic bomb weighs twenty pounds and is the size of a volleyball. It is divided into two halves, each of which is absolutely safe, but if combined, the world will be turned upside down in an instant.

[United Press, Gottingen, Germany, 23rd] Heisenberg, Germany's top atomic scientist and winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics, announced today that the Soviet Union had invited German atomic scientists to conduct research for them for 6,000 rubles a month. Three people have now accepted the offer, and the monthly salary, calculated at the diplomatic exchange rate, is approximately US$500. Heisenberg also stated that the manufacture of atomic bombs is now an engineering problem in any country, and no longer a scientific problem. Germany had uranium piles hidden at the end of the war, which were later stolen by American spies. This uranium pile was originally intended to be used to generate atomic energy to supply power to machines, rather than to manufacture atomic bombs. At that time, there were two tons of uranium, two tons of heavy water, and ten tons of black ore hidden in Heigerloch, forty miles south of Stuttgart. Now, the entire world knows that the explosive material is produced from uranium piles. Heigerloch was occupied by French troops in 1945, but the French troops found nothing. All the uranium piles were transported away by American scientific intelligence personnel before the French troops knew about it. When they found out, the French troops were quite displeased.

Heisenberg and six assistants who jointly studied uranium with the Nazi government are now studying cosmic rays here under British military management. British officials have recently advised him not to accept the invitation of the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina to go and lecture, saying that this matter will definitely not be approved, for obvious reasons.

Heisenberg also stated that three German scientists working somewhere in the Soviet Union include Professor Hertz, who had manufactured atomic fission devices in Germany to break atoms, and who is an authoritative scientist in separating the isotope uranium-235 from uranium. There are also two others, one is the Leipzig physicist Dopel, and the other is Dr. Bewilogua, his wartime assistant. Last September, a German in the Soviet-occupied zone invited him to go to the Soviet Union to work on behalf of the Soviet government. In addition to a monthly salary of 6,000 rubles, he would also receive a special monthly allocation of 50 pounds of fresh meat, 3,500 calories of food per day for each of his six children, as well as a comfortable house, all free of charge. He very much wanted to stay in the country, so he politely declined at the time. He also does not want to research and manufacture atomic bombs for anyone. If he wants to go abroad, he would only take a short trip and give a few lectures, and would never engage in murderous weapons.

Three of his colleagues went to the Soviet Union not long after the end of the war. Among them, Dr. Bewilogua once worked in Crimea, but was suddenly transferred elsewhere. He cannot determine where he is now, but it is probably near the Ural Mountains. Italian scientist Fermi, who became an American citizen, also invited him to join the "Chicago Group," but he did not succeed. His only wish now is to lecture in the United States for some time, as he did before the war. As for the matter of building bombs, he absolutely does not want to hear about it.

He has read the "Smyth Report" published by the United States on the manufacturing process of atomic bombs. He generally understands how to manufacture atomic bombs, except for some technical details. The American military is quite dissatisfied that the "Smyth Report" was made public under pressure from scientists, resulting in the leakage of secrets. According to the "Smyth Report," he knows that the atomic bomb weighs twenty pounds and is the size of a volleyball. It is divided into two halves, each of which is absolutely safe, even if placed in a stove. But if the two halves are combined, an explosion will occur in an instant, creating a world-shattering situation.

Heisenberg was the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics. During the war, all atomic research in Germany was led by him. It is said that Germany's research achievements were on par with the United States, until the situation began to change in June 1942. On June 6 of that year, we reported to Armaments Minister Speer at a decisive meeting that atoms could be made to explode in two ways, one is to separate the isotope uranium-235 from uranium, and the other is to create uranium piles. However, Hitler was impatient and asked us when we could succeed. We replied two years or more. However, Hitler was unwilling to consider any military plan that exceeded six months. At that time, Hitler was thinking of seizing the Caucasus oil fields and the Suez Canal. In short, the manufacture of atomic bombs requires extremely large-scale industrial equipment, which Germany lacked, which was its fatal blow.

[United Press, New York, 23rd] The announcement by German scientist Heisenberg that the Soviet Union had invited German atomic scientists is not enough to produce atomic bombs. Soviet scientists probably know no less than German scientists about the principles of atomic bombs. Heisenberg said that the key to manufacturing atomic bombs is mostly in engineering. This statement is not very thorough. One problem is more related to science than engineering, that is, how to combine uranium or plutonium fragments at high speed for it to explode.

### Purchases of Gold Reach Over Two Thousand Bars; Investigation Confirms Speculation by Xinda Yarn Company; Sun Zixin, One of the Shanxi Gang's Tycoons, Flees in Fear of Punishment; One Official Among the First Batch of Blacklisted Individuals

[Our Report] Among the major speculators in gold during the "gold rush" period, the Xinda Yarn Company has been confirmed by the Economic Supervisory Group to have factual evidence against it. The company purchased a total of 2,219 gold bars between January 22 and February 15. Its manager, Sun Zixin, is from Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, and is one of the tycoons of the so-called "Shanxi Gang" among the gold brokers in this city. It is understood that after purchasing the gold, he transported it to other cities by plane for profit. After several investigations by the Supervisory Group, the facts were confirmed, but Sun Zixin had already fled in fear of punishment. Chief Xuan ordered his arrest yesterday, and the case was handed over to the French Concession authorities for severe punishment. It is also learned that among the first batch of blacklisted individuals secretly submitted by the Supervisory Group to Chairman Chiang, there is a current official who used public funds for gold speculation, and the amount of gold he traded also reached several thousand bars. It is reported that the Chairman was extremely angry after receiving the report and has instructed that he be arrested and severely punished immediately. However, the person in charge of the Supervisory Group refused to reveal the name and identity of this "tiger" yesterday, or whether he had been arrested. It is also learned that the official's gold trading activities were very large, and the agency he served was located in another city, while he himself was active in Shanghai. It is expected that after the Supervisory Group arrests him, he will be handed over to a military tribunal for trial.

[Another News] Xu Youzu, the director of the Gold and Currency Group, continued to summon the managers of several companies, including Taikang Runjin Company, yesterday, who were involved in selling gold from the Central Bank. The monitoring of the cotton cloth market by the Cotton Cloth Group is very strict, and the price of cotton cloth has begun to fall again. After being ordered to expand its organization and scope of business, the detailed expansion plan was carefully drafted yesterday by Li Zhun, the chief secretary of the Supervisory Group, and will be submitted for discussion at the Group's second group affairs meeting held today.

### "Fly" Cases Generally Transferred to Courts for Trial; Zhengtai and Other Three Factories Purchasing Gold; Not Constituting Speculation or Manipulation

[Our Report] Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Da Zhonghua Paper Factory, Shenghua Pharmaceutical Factory, etc., used production loans to purchase gold. After being investigated by the Four Joint Offices, the military law office of the Garrison Headquarters conducted preliminary summons. Because the total amount of gold purchased by the three companies was only over 140 bars, which was not enough to constitute the crime of speculation and manipulation, and the purchase date was before the Lunar New Year, which was not directly related to the gold rush after February 1, but because they obtained loans for non-production purposes and purchased gold, which was illegal, the Garrison Headquarters decided to transfer the case to the court for handling. The procedures were completed yesterday and will be transferred today. It is also learned that Commander Xuan has ordered that all cases of a "fly" nature be sent to the courts, and major cases will be tried by military law.

### Support and Loans Still Provided for Hardworking Manufacturers; Remarks by Person in Charge of Four Joint Offices

An important person in charge of the Four Joint Offices stated to reporters yesterday: The purpose of the Four Joint Offices handling production loans is to support production businesses and encourage increased production. At that time, in order to prevent loans from flowing into improper uses, the fourth committee meeting stipulated that a roving audit team should be organized to check the accounts of borrowing factories at any time to verify the facts. The roving audit was jointly organized by two representatives from each of the four banks and one bureau, three representatives from commercial firms and industry and commerce guidance offices, and began work on February 1. Judging from the factories that have been inspected so far, the situation is generally good. Most factories have been able to increase production due to the production loans they have received. However, a very small number of factories have indeed used loans to purchase gold and U.S. dollars. In addition to setting a deadline for recovering the loans and transferring them to the competent authorities for punishment according to law, the office will continue to support the majority of hardworking manufacturers in accordance with the purpose of rewarding production businesses, and hopes that the persons in charge of each factory will stand on their own and work hard.

### Gold Mortgage Also Illegal; Ministry of Finance Investigates the Business of Chinese and Foreign Firms

Since the highest authority issued a ban on gold trading, all gold exchanges have been handled by the Central Bank. It is understood that recently, some foreign firms have been secretly engaged in gold mortgages. When reporters inquired about this matter to Xu Baiyuan, the director of the Ministry of Finance, he replied: Gold trading is prohibited, and mortgages are also prohibited. The Ministry of Finance is now sending personnel to investigate the business of Chinese and foreign firms. If such a situation is discovered, it will be severely punished as illegal.

### Major Robbery Case on the Beijing-Shanghai Train Solved in 44 Hours - Lone Bandit Leaps Out of the Train - Carries Loot and Flees, Captured in Hospital

At 6 p.m. on the 21st of this month, the 15th express train was driving from Beijing to Shanghai. When passing between Xixiang and Lujiabang, a passenger named Lu Qinan and Liu Jingcheng, who had a leather suitcase of cash worth 15 million yuan, was suddenly robbed by a bandit wearing a uniform and a symbol in the same car. After the robbery, he jumped out of the train regardless of his body and disappeared. After the train arrived at Shanghai North Station, the victims immediately reported to the police station. Chief Wang Zhaohuai was furious upon hearing the report, as there had never been a robbery case on the train in broad daylight in the history of the two routes, so he immediately ordered Section Chief Zhang Hanying and Inspector Min Jianchu to be responsible for the arrest. After Zhang received the order, he immediately sent Inspector Shuai Ying to lead more than 20 officers to investigate and arrest. They found clues at the home of Wang Zixin in Shatuo Gexiang Ditoupu, 48 miles from the railway line.

It turned out that after the bandit jumped down with the stolen money, he was seriously injured. At that time, knowing that police officers were hunting him, he reluctantly escaped with the money, and that night he escaped to Wang Zixin's home in Shage Village, where he borrowed for one night with 30,000 yuan of legal tender. He then purchased a woolen cloth coat for 150,000 yuan, replaced the original military uniform, and threw the weapon into the manure tank. The next day, he hired a small boat to Xiajiaqiao, and then took a train from Lujiabang to Shanghai. After the police officers obtained this important clue, they transported it back to Shanghai overnight. Based on their experience in handling cases, they knew that the bandit was seriously injured and would definitely seek medical treatment, so they secretly investigated in various hospitals.

Inspector Min then learned from a rickshaw driver that the bandit had taken a ride to Jimin Hospital after getting off the train. So he met with the North Station Police Station and went to Jimin Hospital. Min disguised himself as a doctor and arrested the bandit on the spot in a flash, seizing the original stolen goods. The bandit confessed that he had served as a student soldier, named Li Jiayao, and was scheduled to be transferred to the court for strict handling today. It was found that it only took 44 hours from the occurrence of the case to the investigation and detection. (The picture above shows the captured bandit Li Jiayao and part of the seized original stolen goods. Photo by China News Agency)

State-Owned Enterprises Request Price Increases - Social Bureau Believes the Timing is Inappropriate

[This newspaper reports] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, said yesterday that the government's announced economic emergency measures will freeze the January cost of living index and provide daily necessities at parity prices as compensation. As for the quantity of various items, Mayor Wu believes that the quantity at the time of the previous compilation of the cost of living index should be the standard. He has now submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, and it will be announced after approval. In order to save the current economic crisis, he hopes that everyone will think of the country and the nation and be able to sacrifice their own interests. The Social Bureau still has methods to rectify labor discipline, but it is very disappointed that some capitalists, such as the hotel industry, do not comply with government laws. In the future, the Social Bureau will take the initiative in controlling negotiated prices. Furthermore, due to the chaotic execution of cracking down on violating price agreements in the past, the Social Bureau will unite with the Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters to uniformly implement it in the near future. Regarding the recent request for price increases by state-owned enterprises, Wu believes that although losses are a fact, it does not seem appropriate to raise prices during this period.

Party, Government, Military, and Police Agencies Hold Expanded Memorial Week

All circles in Shanghai held an expanded Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday morning. More than a thousand representatives from party, government, military, police, and group agencies attended. Director Fang, Chairman of the Municipal Party Department, presided over the meeting and led the ceremony. Fang then made a few points, which are recorded as follows:

First, I want to tell the responsible comrades of the party branches in various districts of this city that the division and adjustment of the party branches in various districts are always being actively carried out, so that every comrade is assigned to a district branch, and every party branch effectively allocates its affiliated district branches, so as to formally elect representatives and hold the city's party member representative meeting to elect the executive and supervisory committees of the municipal party department. In the future, how to strengthen the organization of district branches so that party work can be carried out smoothly is something that our comrades should pay close attention to.

Second, yesterday's newspaper reported that the Municipal Council, local associations, municipal chamber of commerce, educational association, general labor union, women's association, agricultural association, and other seven groups jointly telegraphed their respects to the soldiers at the front. There were many heavy sentences that made us feel infinite emotion after reading them. The soldiers at the front are suppressing the chaos for peace and sacrificing for unity, which is exactly the ancient people's "using war to stop war". I believe that the soldiers at the front will have infinite feelings after reading this tribute telegram. Everyone here today must be extra vigilant and do their best.

Third, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the government recently promulgated the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan." This is a method of competing for the people. Although this plan can save the current economic crisis, it must remove the currency along with the advantages, so it cannot be fully satisfactory. Selfish elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors and maliciously slander. It must be known that today's government is the people's government, and always cares about the suffering of the vast majority of the people, and is always working for the benefit of the people. Even if there are things that need to be added to the promulgated plan, I think the government will definitely respect public opinion and consider it. This point, I hope all comrades will pay attention to.

After the speech, the whole audience was led to read the party member's code of conduct, and the meeting was adjourned at around 10 o'clock.

### Military Radio Stations - Eight Shut Down

The Garrison Headquarters cracked down on military radio stations that did not meet the regulations, and began to implement it with the military police yesterday morning. They successively sealed up eight military radio stations, including Far East, Tiansheng, Xinsu, Victory, Junyou, Tiefeng, Junmin, and Qingguang (run by the Youth Party).

### Swire Wharf Suffers Further Disturbances - Loading and Unloading Work Halted

[This newspaper reports] The dispute over the work of the foremen of the warehouses at Swire Company's Puxi Wharf, Chen Shanyu and Zhou Ruisun, has lasted for nearly half a year. Yesterday morning, workers holding wooden sticks and bamboo poles suddenly appeared from Xinkaihe Minguo Road to Swire Wharf. At that time, the workers on Chen's side were afraid of a conflict when the Shenjing ship docked at the wharf, so they did not dare to work and sent personnel to the Huangpu Branch to request police protection. The branch sent police to the wharf, and Section Chief Ling personally went to the wharf at 11 o'clock to advise them, but it was reported that the workers had no foreman to preside over, so it was impossible to persuade them to disperse. It was also learned that the foreman was Hu Changzhi, from Hubei, but he was not present at the time, so it was impossible to contact him. Now the loading and unloading work at the Swire Wharf machine room has stopped again, and there is no good solution for the time being.

### Infant Dies Suddenly - Nanny Suspected

[This newspaper reports] Xie Gengnian, a resident of No. 13, Lane 288, Baker Road, from Anhui, was introduced by Li Lishi, a fellow villager, to Li Hushi to Xie's house as a maid at the end of last year. This year, Xie's wife gave birth to a son. Because she lacked breast milk, the maid, who had also given birth to a daughter who died young, was changed to be a nanny. Li Tingliang, her husband, suddenly came to Shanghai from his hometown the day before yesterday and insisted on asking the owner to advance some salary, but Xie refused because he had borrowed two months' salary a few days ago. Li then planned to take Li back to his hometown as a threat to change jobs. On the morning of the 23rd, Xie Qin found that the nanny's suitcase, etc., had disappeared, and the baby on the bed had also died.

### Five Measures Set by Land Bureau to Apply for Land Value Tax Exemption for the Principal

[This newspaper reports] The Land Administration Bureau has recently received many submissions requesting exemption from land value tax. The applicants include trade associations, private schools, private charities, land owners whose land has been taken over by government agencies or occupied by refugees to build sheds, etc. It is now known that the bureau's handling methods are as follows:

(1) Trade associations are not organizations that run public welfare causes, so they cannot be exempted. (2) Private schools that have been registered and have achieved good results can be exempted from the land value tax on the land directly used by the school, and other school properties must be paid as required. (3) Private charities that have been running relief undertakings for more than five years and have achieved results, and whose land is not for profit purposes, can apply for tax exemption with documents, and others must pay as required. (4) Land requisitioned and enclosed by the enemy and puppets, and taken over by government agencies after victory, cannot be exempted according to law. Now, in consideration of the owners' situation, they are allowed to postpone payment. However, a certification letter must be issued by the current user agency, proving that it is used free of charge. If it is decided to return it in the future, the owner shall make up the payment. If it is decided to be requisitioned by the government, the current user agency shall make up the land value tax. (5) Refugees occupying other people's land to build sheds is illegal, but in this period of serious housing shortage, if they are determined to demolish the houses and evict them, it is also difficult in fact. Under these circumstances, if the owner is required to bear the land value tax again, it is legally compliant, but may be lacking in affection. How should this matter be handled? The municipal government has now been consulted.

### Seymour Road Fire Case - Shen Qiulin Prosecuted - Cable is Damp and Inattentive - Party Discernment is No Crime but Guilty

[This newspaper reports] The couple Shen Qiulin, who caused the fire on Seymour Road, were transferred by the police station to the local prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution on the charge of public danger. Now, after the prosecutor Shen Zushou concluded the investigation, he believed that Shen Shen's crime was insufficient and decided not to prosecute, while Shen Qiulin was prosecuted according to Article 173, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. His indictment stated: "Shen Qiulin rented a house at No. 425 Gordon Road Wuding Road to open a coppersmith shop. In October last year, because the cable was too old, he replaced it himself. However, this is not his forte, and the installation technology is inevitably clumsy, and the house is dilapidated. When it rains, the roof leaks, and the cable is damp. On January 22 this year, it rained again. At 9:30 p.m., the cable was soaked in water and short-circuited, causing the wooden boards on the roof to catch fire. After investigation by the police station, it was believed that there was suspicion of fire, and it was transferred to the investigation office. The defendant Shen Qiulin has admitted that he replaced the cable himself in October last year, and that it was soaked in water whenever it rained. It is a very common sense that the cable is easy to short-circuit when it is damp. Since the cable installed in the house is soaked in rain every day, it should be repaired early to prevent it before it happens. However, he was inattentive. Moreover, the defendant had no special research on installing cables, and his poor technology is conceivable. If the cable was installed properly at that time, or there would not have been a disaster. The defendant should have paid attention to this common sense, but he did not, and he actually committed the crime of Article 173, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Since he is entitled to be exempted from punishment, he is prosecuted according to Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Prosecutor Shen Zushou."

### Reader Consultation: Legal Pen Questions - Injustice Difficult to Rectify

Xu Weigang asks: My relative was murdered, and the case was brought to court. However, due to the court's careless handling and the defendant's cunning deception, his son has repeatedly been unable to obtain justice and suffers from unresolved grievances. I have specific doubts and humbly request detailed answers: (1) During the investigation and trial, the complainant was not summoned to participate. Is this legal? Does it conflict with the first half of Article 63 of the Criminal Procedure Law? (2) The defendant and witnesses were not questioned separately as required by Article 97 and Article 171 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Despite repeated requests from the complainant, the defendant and witnesses were able to make eye contact and collude tacitly. What methods can be used to prevent this? (3) The indictment did not follow Article 242, applying Article 234, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and item 11 of the Points for Attention in Handling Criminal Procedure Cases, to be served on the complainant, leaving the complainant completely unaware of the indictment's intent. Furthermore, there was no way to supplement or challenge the identified criminal facts and evidence, leading to an erroneous first-instance judgment. Is the prosecutor responsible for this? (4) When a murderer is identified and accused, regardless of whether the accusation is true, they should be detained and investigated. The accuser bears the responsibility for false accusations. However, the prosecutor did not directly arrest the accused but used a summons, allowing the accused to escape leisurely. Can I request the Ministry of Judicial Administration or the Supreme Court to replace the prosecutor or directly accuse the prosecutor of dereliction of duty? (5) Given the situation in point three, if the judge bases the sentence on the prosecutor's erroneous findings and gives the defendant a lenient sentence, can the complainant appeal? (6) Is it necessary to serve the judgment on the complainant? If the complainant wants to appeal or request a retrial, can they request its service? (7) Is the right to request a retrial exclusive to the prosecutor? Can the complainant request it? And is it necessary to declare disagreement in advance within the appeal period? (8) Requesting a retrial is not limited to the appeal period, and there is no explicit provision in the Criminal Procedure Law for declaring disagreement in advance. However, item 100 of the Points for Attention in Handling Criminal Procedure Cases discusses it. Why is this?

[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] (1) It is not without conflict. (2) You can apply to the prosecutor for recusal according to Article 18, paragraph 2, and Article 26 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (3) It is punishable. (4) According to Article 76 of the Criminal Procedure Law, summoning or detaining is the court's authority. If it deems detention unnecessary, summoning first is also permissible. (5) The complainant is not a party and cannot appeal but can request the prosecutor to appeal. (6) Yes. (7) The private prosecutor can file a retrial lawsuit. The complainant is not a party and cannot file it. (8) The "Points for Attention" are guidance methods from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to the court and are only for reference. Therefore, it is not necessary to declare disagreement in advance.

A Sympathetic Helping Hand

Mrs. Wang's Letter Responds to Donation

This column yesterday received a letter from a reader stating: "Dear Editor, I was deeply moved by reading about your newspaper's promotion of free midwifery services. It truly embodies what your newspaper calls 'our infinite sympathy for these unfortunate people.' However, my abilities are weak, and I am not sufficient to advocate for such a cause among gentlemen. Therefore, I enclose a postdated check for 20,000 yuan to contribute my meager strength. Please put it to good use to create a protective garment (for those in need). I am exceedingly hopeful. Sincerely, Wang Maihuicong. February 22nd, Year 30."

### The Ministry of Education is Actively Supplementing Library Books and Equipment for Universities; Middle Schools Plan to Manufacture Their Own Instruments and Specimens

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 23rd] Because the equipment of various schools suffered excessive damage during the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education allocated one million U.S. dollars during the war to purchase books and equipment. At that time, due to the blockade of seaports, foreign goods were transported internally through Yangon. When the Pacific War broke out and Yangon fell, over 170 crates of books and equipment were lost. 115 crates were rescued and transported to Chongqing. Later, over 700 crates were airlifted from Kolkata to Kunming and then distributed to various schools. After the victory, 335 crates of books and equipment and 799 crates of magazines that were still abroad were transported to Shanghai and are being processed separately. The Ministry of Education has been actively seeking to replenish the equipment of various schools this year and is actively proceeding with the following outline: (1) The American Library Association is helping to raise 100,000 books, and six crates have already arrived. Additionally, the Greater Boston Book Donation Committee in the United States has also donated 72 crates. The American Library Association has also donated books to several universities and research institutions in China. (2) The British Council is collecting 19 kinds of famous English books in Sweden, with over 4,000 copies of each. Seven crates, totaling over 16,000 copies, have arrived, and 30 sets of British wartime books have been purchased, with over 100 crates already arrived. (3) The losses to Chinese education and culture during the war were enormous. An application was made to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for assistance, and US$4 million was approved to supplement the equipment of colleges of arts, science, engineering, agriculture and medicine in the recovered areas. The Ministry of Education has sent personnel to contact and proceed with this matter. (4) In order to meet the needs of schools relocated to the rear, the Ministry of Education purchased seven sets of machinery for mechanical engineering and experimental factories when the Production Bureau was closed and distributed them to various schools. (5) The Ministry of Education allocated the remaining US$200,000+ from the construction fund to schools in the rear and National Normal College to enhance their equipment. The above concerns colleges and universities. As for secondary schools, the Ministry of Education intends to manufacture instruments and specimens domestically and has relocated the Science Instrument Creation Institute and the Museum Specimen Manufacturing Institute from Sichuan to the Beijing-Shanghai area, increasing funding, purchasing equipment, and expanding the scale, aiming to create a large-scale factory in China as a model for manufacturing factories in various provinces and cities. Therefore, all scientific instruments and specimens are planned to be manufactured domestically. To meet current urgent needs, the Ministry of Education recently distributed 1,048 sets of scientific instruments previously manufactured by the Academia Sinica to national secondary schools and education bureaus in various provinces and cities for use by provincial and municipal secondary schools.

In this week's soccer matches, the Mayor's Cup match between Qingbai and Railway will be held at 3:00 PM on Saturday at the Yiyuan Stadium. Qingbai's key players Wu Qiwei and Song Jing have remained in Hong Kong and have not returned, undoubtedly reducing their strength. Railway is a new force in the soccer scene, with famous players such as Wu Jiabang, Lu Qingxiang, Wu Ziwu and Wu Binghao, all veterans of the field. A tense performance is expected.

The First Division League match between Donghua and Youyou is a makeup game from the first round. Donghua has won all seven of its games and is in high spirits. The latter is also one of the strongest Chinese teams in this year's First Division, with excellent results in the league. However, after Italian players Villa, Borrini, and Latti returned to their country, although three more Italian players have come, their strength is no longer what it was. They may not be a match for Donghua. The schedule is as follows:

In addition, there will be one Mayor's Cup match between the Soviet Union and Lianxing and one final of the fourth division of the Third Division.

March 1st (Saturday)

Qingbai vs. Railway (Mayor's Cup) 3:00 PM Yiyuan

(2) Players registered in the Second and Third Divisions who have not submitted their photos will be treated as unregistered. If it is confirmed during the photo verification that a player participating in the match does not have a photo, the team to which the player without a photo belongs will be deemed to have forfeited the match. Team leaders should pay attention to this.

### Schedule for the Finals of the Second and Third Divisions

(3) The schedule for the finals of the Second and Third Divisions is as follows:

Second Division: Qingbai vs. Shanyun. The winner will play against Railway in the final. Third Division: Customs vs. Dongchang. The winner will play against the champion of the fourth division of the Third Division in the semi-finals. The other semi-final group is Kang Le vs. Bairilemen. (4) The fourth division of the Third Division, Hengyi Sheng, Jingwu, and Railway, are tied in points. The schedule for determining the winner is as follows:

Railway vs. Jingwu. The winner will play against Hengyi Sheng in the final.

### Soccer Friendly: Railway vs. Soviet Union

Thursday at the Nanshi Stadium

The Shanghai Municipal Stadium previously invited the Qingbai and Italian teams to play friendly matches at the Nanshi branch stadium during the Lunar New Year. The audience was enthusiastic, making it the first grand soccer game after the stadium's reopening. It is now learned that the stadium has specially invited the strong teams of Railway and the Soviet Union to play a friendly exhibition match at the Nanshi branch stadium at 4:00 PM on Thursday (the 27th). This matter has been agreed upon with the Soviet team captain Karol Leqiqu at the Railway Workers' Sports Association yesterday afternoon with Association President Wang Zhaohuai, Vice President Mei Fuqiang, and Association Secretary General Guo Qida.

The Railway team has now secured the right to participate in the finals of both the League Second Division and Youth Cup, making it a rising force in Shanghai soccer. In this exhibition match, famous players from Donghua, Han Longhai, Zhang Lingen, and Li Yao, as well as Fei Chunhua and Gao Baozheng from Qingbai, will participate, further strengthening the team's strength. The Soviet Union is currently the strongest foreign team. The match will surely be a wonderful performance.

### Tonight's Basketball League: Black Meets Encas

Chenyou vs. Indian; Green Forest vs. Railway Shanghai

[Our Report] There will be three Basketball League games tonight, starting at 5:30 PM, continuing the competition at the Municipal Gymnasium. The first match is between Chenyou and Indian in the first division. Chenyou has won all five of its games since defeating Green Forest and is close to securing the championship. Indian, after losing to Beer, seems destined to be at the bottom of the league. Tonight's match can be called a battle between the "champion" and "last place" teams.

The second match in the same group is between Green Forest and Railway Shanghai. This match is not important. If Green Forest wins, with two losses in seven games, it can get the runner-up in the second division.

The main event is between All Black and Encas. Encas is a strong Western team. All Black is a mixed group, and it is likely to lose to the foreign army. Under the strong defense of foreign generals Changren Ge Pengqikefu and Baolai, Lu Dazhen of All Black will find it difficult to find opportunities, and Zhang Shaoxiang's "solo run" will also be blocked. All three matches tonight are likely to be one-sided. The schedules for each match are as follows:

Chenyou - Indian (Second Division) 5:30 PM

Green Forest - Railway (Second Division) 6:30 PM Referee: Chen Baolin

All Black - Encas (First Division) 7:30 PM Referee: Xuan He

After several rallies, the Chinese team broke through. Di Shannu's serves were often unsuccessful, while the captain's serves were like shooting stars. They took the lead by one point (8-7). The situation changed, and the competition was at its fiercest. The two foreign players were in full swing, leading by three points at 12-9. They used all their strength to win back the game 15-11. Both teams were covered in sweat. With a best-of-three system, they began the third game. At the beginning, both sides were tied at 2-2. The Chinese team launched an attack, suddenly increasing to 7-2. Hong and Ni led 8-7, taking the lead. After switching sides, they sometimes used clever tricks, continuing to 13-8. The two foreign players repeatedly used skillful tactics, chasing up to 12 points. Unfortunately, several heavy hits went beyond the baseline.

### Mayor Summoned Rice Merchants This Morning: Instructed on Methods to Suppress Rice Prices

[Report from our Newspaper] In order to effectively suppress rice prices in the city, Mayor Wu has scheduled a meeting with rice merchants Gu Yisheng, Zhu Yongming, Qu Zhenhua, Yang Runyu, and Cha Baosan at 10:00 AM today to listen to their opinions and instruct them on methods to suppress rice prices.

Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the north and south markets was over 17,700 shi (unit of dry measure). The market situation remained stable. High-quality japonica rice was similar, while medium and lower grades slightly softened. Indica rice was scarce and firm, and white yuan was also less volatile, while yinyuan increased its assassination rate.

Oil prices rose inland, and store sentiment turned stronger. Soybean oil continued to rise by more than 10,000 (currency unit), while vegetable oil also increased by 10,000 (currency unit), and sesame oil followed suit with an increase of 3,000 to 5,000 (currency unit). Soybean cake shipments to other ports weakened, with an initial firmness followed by a decline, resulting in a steady market trend. Flour digestion was still acceptable, rising by 1,000 (currency unit). Market conditions rose and fell suddenly, tending towards a rotational situation. Bran experienced a real consumption turnaround in rural villages, advancing by 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit).

The same was true for yellow soybeans. The opening of Hankou soybeans and Doudou beans all saw a consistent increase of 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit), but there were no transactions at the close, and the situation turned weak. Northeastern soybeans had no significant changes.

The arrival of red sorghum gradually increased, but there were few buyers, and it fell by 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit). Corn from Qingdao was actively handled, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit). Green beans were absorbed by Southeast Asia, and the market was lively. Red beans saw brisk sales to Hong Kong, rising again by 3,000 to 4,000 (currency unit). Sesame also increased by 5,000 to 6,000 (currency unit). Raw kernels were firm and stable, with no temporary changes.

### Market Prices Higher Than Purchase Prices: Autumn Silk Purchases Not Enthusiastic

After China Trust (Zhongxin) began purchasing autumn silk, initially, due to market prices being lower than purchase prices, the quantity of autumn silk and zero-dried spring silk delivered by various factories was quite large. From January to mid-February, the China Silk Company received approximately 1,300 dan (unit of weight). Subsequently, due to market prices being higher than purchase prices, factories rushed to sell in the market, and since mid-February, the delivery work has stalled again.

### Bread and Biscuit Industry: Requesting Increased Flour Allocation

[Report from our Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Flour Trade Association: The association recently received a request from the bread and biscuit industry, stating that the industry needs 2,000 bags of flour per day, while the actual allocation is only 905 bags. At the same time, the people's livelihood canteens bake inexpensive bread, needing 50 bags of flour per day, while the actual allocation is only 12 bags. However, the noodle-cutting industry receives 4,500 bags of flour per day, with each shop receiving a maximum of 20 bags and a minimum of one bag. In reality, there is a surplus of more than 1,000 bags per day. Therefore, they are currently considering how to transfer this surplus allocation to compensate for the shortage of flour for the bread, biscuit, and people's livelihood canteens.

### Market Liquidity Gradually Easing: Hot Money Turning to Real Estate

[Report from our Newspaper] A senior financial figure said: The city's liquidity has eased, and in addition to the stock market as a target, hot money is trending toward real estate activities. From the government's standpoint, it is most desirable for hot money to be deposited in banks. If this is not possible, it is hoped that it will not be directed toward paths harmful to people's livelihood. Therefore, if hot money goes into real estate activities, it is undoubtedly good news. In terms of listed interest rates, some people in the city advocate for an increase, but from the government's standpoint, this is too closely related to industry and commerce and is inconvenient to increase. When asked by reporters if interest rates could fall, the answer was: This depends on changes in prices. If prices are stable, interest rates are also stable. Interest rates can only fall if prices fall. Regarding the business of general banks in the city, the person believes that most are stable, and very few are engaged in gold speculation. Currently, the Ministry of Finance is actively investigating, and the outside world should not speculate too much to avoid "a lot of noise, but little rain." As for the future inspection of banks, the procedures will be simplified as much as possible to increase efficiency.

### Before New Measures Are Announced: Individuals Applying for Foreign Exchange, Designated Banks Are Not Allowed to Accept

[Report from our Newspaper] The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 84 yesterday to various designated banks, stating: In order to comply with government regulations, before the amended measures are announced, banks should not accept applications for foreign exchange required by individuals thereafter.

### Remittances from Overseas Have Improved

[Report from our Newspaper] It is reported that since the foreign exchange adjustment, the situation of remittances from overseas has improved slightly. For example, in the past, there were no remittances from the Philippines, but recently, more than 100,000 US dollars have been remitted to Longjian. New York has always been a major source of overseas remittances for our country. Although there are no detailed statistics recently, it is certainly known that there has been an increase.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Shares Continue to Fall

The volume of government bond transactions yesterday was limited, no more than 2 million (currency unit). The opening price for Tongbing (government bond) was 8,000 (currency unit), sold at 360 Binlong Lianhe, falling to 6,000 (currency unit). 552 Chen De slightly increased, and finally hovered around 6,300 (currency unit), resulting in a drop of 1,300 (currency unit) compared to the previous closing price. Jiayi and Yiyi (government bonds) fell by 500 (currency unit), and Dingwu (government bond) fell by 700 (currency unit).

Foreign shares continued to decline yesterday, with decreasing volume. Jardine Spinning declined gradually from 18,300 (currency unit) and closed at a low price. Steel and shipping each fell by half, Hong Kong & Shanghai Hotels and Kwangtung Paper each fell by 10%, and Jardine Spinning, British American Tobacco and Jardine Brewery each fell by slightly more than 5% compared to last Saturday.

### Foreign Cotton Import Quota Period: Extended to June, Lianzong Will Ship 200,000 Bales of Cotton to China

[Report from our Newspaper] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Quota Allocation Office of the Import and Export Control Commission held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday and adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM. Several agenda items were discussed. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The allocation of quotas to each factory is based on: (A) the number of spindles actually reported by each factory, (B) the amount of cotton in stock in each factory's warehouse, and (C) according to the rules for purchasing foreign cotton, factories with cotton stocks sufficient for four months and orders sufficient for three months. Based on the above figures, the amount of cotton required by each factory in the first quarter of this year is calculated to be 368,000 bales. However, the foreign cotton import quota announced by the Quota Allocation Office for February to April of this year is US$40 million. According to the current exchange rate, only 230,000 bales of cotton can be purchased, which is still short of the actual demand. In the future, it can only be allocated to each factory proportionally. At yesterday's meeting, the proportional quota figures for each factory were handed over to the factories to take back for review and will be discussed at the next meeting. (2) Of the six factories that previously urgently applied for foreign cotton, four factories have now been approved and issued licenses separately. The remaining two factories are awaiting review and approval. (3) It is reported that Lianzong (UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) may ship 200,000 bales of cotton to China. If each factory obtains this cotton, the allocation of foreign cotton will be proportionally reduced because each factory's equipment has a fixed amount of cotton consumption. (4) The foreign cotton import quota of US$40.3 million for February to April of this year has now been decided to be extended to the end of June.

### Silver Industry Announces to the Press: Asking for Sympathy and Assistance from All Parties, Planning to Make Three Demands Together with the Government

[Report from our Newspaper] The silver industry hosted the city's press at the Atlantic Hotel yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM. During the event, Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, and other members of the Silver Industry Salvation and Survival Committee read out an emergency announcement from silver industry colleagues in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to colleagues across the country, appealing to people across the country to grant sympathy and assistance.

The general idea is that the measures for handling gold ornaments promulgated by the Ministry of Finance will make it impossible for the livelihoods of millions of employees in the silver industry across the country to be maintained. The buying and selling of gold ornaments was originally a disguised form of savings for the people. Prohibiting the buying and selling of gold ornaments will inevitably cause the surplus funds of the general middle and lower classes to turn to hoarding goods, leading to rising prices. This time, the government's crackdown on speculation in gold and banknotes has caused the honest and law-abiding silver industry to suffer the hardship of destruction and unemployment, punishing the innocent. This is inappropriate point one. The government allocated gold at a high price of 7.7 million (currency unit) and ordered the silver industry to return it at a price of 4.8 million (currency unit). The Central Bank is gaining inappropriate profits. This is inappropriate point two. The holding of gold is not prohibited, but gold ornaments are uniquely required to be recalled within a limited time, which is unreasonable. This is inappropriate point three. After Yao finished reading, Zhang Jisheng, the representative of the silver industry workers, spoke. He asked the media to give assistance.

Tomorrow, they will petition in Beijing

It is heard that industry representatives will petition the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Government at approximately 10:00 AM tomorrow and will unite with representatives from various places on the 26th to petition the central government. Currently, there are Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hankou, Yichang, Chengdu, Nanjing, Xi'an, Jinan, Nanchang, Shantou, Kunming, Chongqing, Liuzhou, and other silver industries that support the Shanghai silver industry's claims and express their determination to act in unison with Shanghai.

In addition, it is reported that the Silver Industry Association has agreed on three principles: (1) Cancel the provisions for limited-time registration, limited-time sales, and mandatory exchange for national currency. Allow industry colleagues to engage in the collection, processing, and sale of gold ornaments. (2) Allow industry colleagues to apply to the Central Bank for the allocation and sale of original gold to meet the needs of the people. (3) Unite representatives from various places on the 26th to petition the central government.

### Silver Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee: Suspending Public Treasury Lending

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Silver Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee recently announced that after the government promulgated the new economic emergency measures, the 5 billion (currency unit) of working capital previously allocated to the committee by the Central Bank would no longer be allocated. Therefore, the committee's public treasury lending business has also been temporarily suspended. However, the committee's organizational structure will continue to exist in anticipation of future needs. As for the reserve assets deposited by each bank, it will be decided whether to return them based on the needs of each bank.

### Tung Oil Transactions Occur: Domestic Purchasing Power Sharply Reduced

[Report from our Newspaper] Since the foreign exchange restrictions, the Tung Oil Association agreed to a price of 460,000 (currency unit), and transactions occurred in the market yesterday. However, according to merchants, although Tung oil prices have reached a peak, the current price in Hankou is 400,000 (currency unit) per dan, freight costs 30,000 (currency unit), and the time taken is at least seven days, plus three days for unloading, for a total interest cost of 27,000 (currency unit). Therefore, the price of arriving goods is almost the same as the current selling price in Shanghai. It is difficult to break the deadlock in the transportation and export of Tung oil for a while. For domestic sales of Tung oil, as the price has become divorced from purchasing power, actual sales have dropped sharply.

### Chinese Shares Opened High and then Fell Low: Opportunities to Buy on the Dip, Turning Bullish Near Closing

Although the sentiment outside the market was good yesterday, Chinese shares were suppressed by large yarn and cotton companies, opening high and then falling low. Although the decline continued in the afternoon, many people bought on the dip, so the chips were scattered. The final market was still relatively bullish.

The spot delivery opened slightly lower, while the deferred delivery of Yongsheng yarn was slightly higher. Nos. 145, 65, 76 and 85 all advanced.

No. 220 and 31 took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and the price slightly pulled back after being high. Nos. 218, 13, 117, 152 and 145 were sold, gradually falling back and struggling. Finally, it broke into 2,400 (currency unit). Nos. 133, 152, 105, 76, 137 and 218 continuously supplied goods, and finally fell back to 223 (currency unit). Nos. 198, 13 and 215 came in on the dip, rising to 2,290 (currency unit). Nos. 137, 85 and 145 still sold. The afternoon closing was still weak. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsheng yarn, Xinnuo and Xinguang were slightly lower, Huafeng fell by 5%, and Qinxing, Jingfu and Meiya fell by 10%. The deferred delivery of Yongsheng yarn, Xinnuo, Huafeng and Xinguang fell by about 5%, Meiya fell by 10%. Cold shares such as Commerce, Match, Yonggong, Jinglun, Lilian, Cement and Xinya fell by 5% to 10%. The rest of the rises and falls were minor.

In the afternoon, the volume of transactions was very small. Nos. 180, 14, 186, 76 and 219 had gains. The deferred delivery of Yongsheng yarn rose to 2,350 (currency unit). No. 13 was sold, falling back to 2,290 (currency unit). No. 198 and retail investors all came in and struggled. Although Nos. 13, 22, 145 and 76 and 224 sold off Nos. 85, 61 and 197, they fell to 2,140 (currency unit). Meiya near delivery was sold from 203 (currency unit) to the limit down. Nos. 14 and 177 came in, rising to 2,200 (currency unit). The spot Meiya was sold from 160 (currency unit) to the limit down. Nos. 224 and 85 sold off and re-entered the market. Nos. 145, 198 and 152 all came in. Nos. 224 and 12 also bought. The final attack turned bullish. Datong was raised from 220 (currency unit) to the limit up. After the close, it was once shouted up to 2,300 (currency unit), and finally was around 2,260 (currency unit), because there was a short covering situation outside the market. The spot Yongsheng yarn is higher than the deferred delivery. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yongsheng yarn slightly fell, Xinnuo, Huafeng, Jingfu and Qinxing each fell by about 10%, Xinguang fell by 5%, Meiya fell by 15%. The deferred delivery of Yongsheng yarn slightly fell, Huafeng, Xinguang and Jingfu each fell by about 10%, Meiya fell by more than 10%.

### Saving Chinese Tea Exports: Urgent Need to Seek Self-Improvement

[Report from our Newspaper] According to a tea industry magnate: China's major export, tea, has ultimately not improved due to domestic production costs being higher than overseas selling prices. Our government authorities are concerned about Chinese tea and have implemented various favorable policies such as loans, and have adjusted the exchange rate against the US dollar from 2,020 (currency unit) to 12,000 (currency unit). Although domestic tea prices have followed other commodities and risen sharply, if the tea price is close to overseas price currently, the sellers are still reluctant to sell at bargain and unwilling to give up. Recently, the United Kingdom has seen that Chinese tea production methods are conservative, the products are inconsistent, and the selling prices are surprisingly high. In order to remedy the urgent need, they have turned to other countries. Looking at this situation, if Chinese tea merchants do not seek a way to save themselves, exports may be on the verge of extinction.

### Qihong Sellers Hoarding

The Zhengmen black tea, which has been stalled for many days, still did not show any progress in the market yesterday. Although British export firms are still negotiating with sellers, the sellers are not willing to relax their prices. Chenzhong Qimen is firmly selling at 500,000 (currency unit) per dan, while buyers are offering around 440,000 to 450,000 (currency unit). Therefore, whether or not a transaction will occur is still brewing. Other varieties, such as green tea such as Chouzhen and Zhenjie, which are sold to Africa, are still active and thriving, and the market is quite stable. It is said that local stores in various styles of domestic tea and the Suzhou gangs are frequently paying attention, but the supply and demand are imbalanced, so there is a quiet situation.

### Sugimoto Market Sentiment Firming

Although foreign pine wood has arrived, the actual lock is limited and has not completely broken free from the weakness.

### Imported Goods Prices: Recent Consistent Return to Equilibrium, Woolen Fabrics Rise by 30% to 40% Due to Shortages

[Report from our Newspaper] Since the new foreign exchange rate was announced on the 16th of this month, the prices of China's export goods have fluctuated. The prices of imported goods have returned to equilibrium compared to the peak period. The price fluctuations of paper, dyes, rubber, western medicine, woolen fabrics, etc., are recorded separately below:

Paper: Prices have risen sharply due to the difficulty of importing foreign goods, the lack of domestic raw materials, the high price of gold, and the relationship between supply and demand. On the 6th of this month, Canadian newsprint was 65,000 (currency unit) per ream. When the price of gold reached its peak, the price of paper also rose to 150,000 (currency unit) per ream. After the new foreign exchange rate was announced, it gradually returned to equilibrium. The price the day before yesterday was 110,000 (currency unit) per ream. 38-pound Daolin paper was 240,000 (currency unit) per ream at the highest price of gold, and it returned to 230,000 (currency unit) the day before yesterday.

Dyes: Prices have also risen sharply in the past. From the 10th to the 16th of this month, they hovered at the highest peak. After the foreign exchange rate was announced, there was a slight decline. The price of 693 Chemical Yuan was 8.8 million (currency unit) on the 16th of this month, and the price yesterday was 8.25 million (currency unit). The price of Five Horses Zhu (vermilion) was 500,000 (currency unit) per 10 jin (unit of weight) on the 16th of this month, and the price yesterday was 350,000 (currency unit). The price of Samsung Gray was 580,000 (currency unit) per 10 jin (unit of weight) on the 16th of this month, and the price yesterday was 400,000 (currency unit). All prices fell back.

Rubber: The price was only 900 (currency unit) per pound in November last year and rose to more than 2,000 (currency unit) in January this year. At the peak of the gold rush, it rose to 14,500 (currency unit) per pound. After the new foreign exchange was announced, it gradually fell back, and the price yesterday was 6,000 (currency unit) per pound, more than halved compared to the highest peak.

Western medicine: Prices are most clearly affected by the US dollar. The peak of the US dollar was also the peak of western medicine. On the 16th of this month, American goods Xiafadeya (a medicine, phonetic translation) was sold to 250,000 (currency unit) per 1,000 tablets, and yesterday it had returned to 185,000 (currency unit). Pai Le Tuo (a medicine, phonetic translation) was sold to 100,000 (currency unit) per box at the highest, and yesterday it was 80,000 (currency unit) per box. Ke Ning (a medicine, phonetic translation) powder was 30,000 (currency unit) per tin at the highest, and yesterday it was 25,000 (currency unit). Other such as sugar, quinine, Dong Shi Wei Xiong (a medicine, phonetic translation), etc., have all accumulated declines. On average, the price of general western medicine is 20% lower than before the announcement of the new foreign exchange rate.

Woolen fabrics: Prices are not much higher for wholesale due to actual sales and other factors. Comparing the prices on the 16th of this month with yesterday, the price of Ni Ao (a type of woolen fabric, phonetic translation) rose by 15%, but the retail prices of woolen fabrics with better quality have risen by 30% to 40% due to shortages.

This time, the foreign exchange was the highest, but the prices of imported goods have fallen back, the reason is that the prices of general goods have followed the US dollar and risen to the highest peak, and the regulations for the imported goods to increase the tax were calculated according to the black market price, so the prices have risen sharply. After the new foreign exchange rate was announced, the tax measures were canceled, the black market disappeared, and the prices returned to equilibrium.

### Yarn Market Depressed

Spinning and Construction Sales of More Than 1,000 Pieces

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market was depressed and could not be revived. Customers were waiting because the price was low inland, and cloth factories were not interested in buying because the sales of woven products were sluggish. Therefore, the yarn market continued to soften, and sentiment was not encouraging. Since the bottom price was already low, the decline was still small, only slightly declining by 131 (currency unit).

China Spinning and Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Spinning Management Committee yesterday as usual, selling a total of 1,030 pieces, including 626 pieces for domestic manufacturers and 404 pieces for yarn numbers. The total number of applicants was 292, including 176 domestic manufacturers and 116 yarn numbers.

### Foreign Banks: Not Allowed to Buy or Sell Gold or Banknotes

According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, on the 24th, speaking to reporters: (1) Foreign banks are not allowed to accept gold deposits, (2) Foreign banks are not allowed to buy or sell gold or US dollars. The above are based on the provisions of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, (3) Large households hoarding gold affects social interests and is also a violation of criminal law.

[In addition] The investigation work of the gold and banknotes team of the Supervisory Group is proceeding smoothly and is still continuing to be investigated. Foreign banks and companies are all under investigation.

### Cotton Cloth Association Investigates Inventory

[Our Report] The Cotton Cloth Business Association of this city convened a meeting of directors and supervisors at its premises at 3:00 PM yesterday. All directors and supervisors of the association, as well as district chiefs from various districts, attended, with Dong Jiufeng serving as chairman. Following discussions, it was decided that all member cloth shops should submit a list to the association detailing their cotton cloth inventory as of the end of February.

Furthermore, the future market for cotton cloth weakened yesterday. Upon hearing of the need for registration, there was public anxiety, and market prices continued to fall.

### Wool Import Quota Too Small - Wool Industry Requests Relaxation

[Our Report] The Woolen Textile Industry Association of this city recently stated that the Management Committee has allocated a quota for wool, wool tops, and woolen yarns for February to April of this year totaling only US$1.4 million. At most, this would only allow for the import of 1.2 million pounds of raw wool, or 900,000 pounds of wool tops, which is less than 20% of the industry's needs. Therefore, the industry is feeling panicked about a potential shortage of raw materials. It is reported that the industry (excluding state-owned and foreign-owned wool textile mills) uses over 700,000 pounds of wool tops per month and over 530,000 pounds of raw wool per year. If the limited quota is allocated for imported raw materials, each factory will only be able to operate for an average of five days per month, resulting in unacceptable losses. Moreover, current stocks can only meet the industry’s needs for half a month. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation Control Board last Saturday, urging them to relax the quota.

### The Starving World - Prospects for International Grain Coordination

—Special Translation from Our Editorial Department

Although the world supply of major grains for 1946 is greater than in the previous year, many parts of Europe and Asia will inevitably suffer a hungry winter and an even hungrier spring.

With the relaxation of international grain controls and the stagnation of world relief agencies, competition among countries for grain will intensify. In this situation, grain is bound to flow to places with the strongest purchasing power. The United States is currently a major producer and may soon become a major customer for imported grain.

What the United Nations authorities are concerned about is that the United States may dismantle the international grain control pillars managed by the International Emergency Food Committee. The United States' refusal to extend the life of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) clearly indicates its preference for individual national actions over international action for relief work. Therefore, the UNRRA's European operations ended at the end of last December, and its operations in China will end at the end of March this year. Since the United States is not participating in international grain controls, the International Emergency Food Committee will also have to close its doors.

The future course of the United States depends on changes in current import controls. The Export Control Act will be abolished at the end of June this year. With the expiration of the Second War Powers Act, the import licensing system will automatically end at the end of March this year. Mr. Fee, Secretary-General of the International Emergency Food Committee, argues that the United States' import and export controls should be extended. However, it is feared that neither of these controls will continue, and the import control law may be abolished even before the end of March. As a result, American importers will be allowed to scavenge for fats, oils, and other foods that are in short supply. At the same time, because the United States has stronger purchasing power, it will certainly defeat other countries that are in greater need in competitive bidding. On the other hand, the end of export controls will cause fierce competition between American consumers and countries with US dollars for American goods. In short, the end of the United States' import and export controls will completely overturn the international distribution plan for scarce food. (To be continued)

### Communist Troops in Shandong - Airmail News from Jinan on the 21st

— Special Correspondent Li Tian of this newspaper

From March 1939 to July 1942, the Chinese Communist military in Shandong was under the unified command of Xu Xiangqian. In August 1942, the Chinese Communist Party formally established the Shandong Military Region, with Luo Ronghuan as the commander. It included five military districts: Bohai, Binhai, Jiaodong, Luzhong, and Lunan. The area west of the Jinpu Railway was incorporated into the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region under the jurisdiction of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region. At this time, the Shandong Communists still followed the basic policy of "70% development, 20% coping, and 10% resisting Japan," attacking National Revolutionary Army troops and expanding their forces everywhere. By the eve of victory, they had expanded to 250,000 troops. After the Japanese surrendered, in order to seize the surrender and expand the liberated areas, the Communist Party transferred cadres and local troops from various detachments and local teams in Shandong to gradually expand and reorganize them into regular troops such as the Liberation Division, the New Division, the Garrison Brigade, and the Independent Brigade. The Shandong Military Region was also renamed the Frontline Army, still under the command of Luo Ronghuan, and divided into five routes to harass the entire province of Shandong. In November 1945, the Frontline Army was renamed the Field Army. At the same time, all seven divisions of the New Fourth Army south of the Longhai Railway, except for the Fifth Division, were transferred north to Shandong. For the sake of unified command, Chen Yi, commander of the New Fourth Army, was also appointed commander of the Shandong Field Army, and Luo Ronghuan's and Xu Xiangqian's 115th Division, as well as Yang Guofu's troops from the Bohai Military Region, were transferred to the Northeast. (more than 100,000 troops). According to investigations at the end of January this year, the number of Communist troops in Shandong is as follows:

Investigation of Troop Numbers

(1) Regular Divisions: (New Fourth Army, three brigades, nine regiments system)

First Division Commander: Ye Fei

Second Division Commander: Dang Guoqing

Third Division Commander: Huang Kecheng

Fourth Division Commander: Zhang Aiping

(Among them, the Fifth Division Commander Li Xiannian's troops, except for the 14th Brigade, which had fled from southern Henan to western Anhui, the remaining 13th and 15th Brigades had fled west to the Shaanxi-Hubei area.)

(2) Liberation Divisions: (three regiments system)

First Division Commander: He Zhibin

Second Division Commander: Luo Rongsheng

Third Division Commander: Zeng Guohua

Fourth Division Commander: Sun Jixian

Eighth Division Commander: He Yixiang

Ninth Division Commander: Qian Gou

Tenth Division Commander: He Jian

Eleventh Division Commander: [not recorded]

In addition to the above, there are also:

(3) New Divisions (three brigades, nine regiments system): eight

(4) Garrison Brigades (three regiments system): ten

(5) Independent Brigades (three regiments system): four

(6) Columns (three brigades, nine regiments system): seven

(7) Militia Units (unit: regiment): 113 (approximately 1.2 million people)

Six Military Regions

The above troops, excluding the militia, total 429,400 people and are distributed in the following six military regions:

(1) Under the command of Chen Yi, Commander of the Shandong Field Army Region:

1. Jiaodong Military Region (Commander: Xu Shiyou, with four sub-military regions, stationed with 50,000 regular troops)

2. Bohai Military Region (Commander: Yuan Ye Lie, with six sub-military regions, stationed with 39,400 regular troops)

3. Binhai Military Region (Commander: Chi Yaodong, with three sub-military regions, stationed with 70,000 regular troops)

4. Lunan Military Region (Commander: Zhang Guangzhong, with four sub-military regions, stationed with 100,000 regular troops)

5. Luzhong Military Region (Commander: Wang Jian'an, with four sub-military regions, stationed with 110,000 regular troops)

(2) Under the command of Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army Region:

6. Lu-Yu Military Region (mainly in the western part of Shandong west of the Jinpu Line, Commander: Zhu Renqiong, with eight sub-military regions, stationed with 60,000 regular troops) (The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army Region also has jurisdiction over the Taihang Military Region, Jinan Military Region, etc., which are not included in this article.)

Casualty Estimates

Of the Communist regular troops listed above, excluding the 89,400 troops in the Jiaodong and Bohai military regions, the remaining 340,000 troops have been engaged in fierce battles for more than a month. According to reliable estimates, casualties should be at least one-third or more. Judging by the fact that the Communist army's attempt to attack Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu failed, forcing them to abandon their largest base in East China, Linyi, for nearly a week, and that there has been no other significant activity, it is not difficult to imagine the extent of the damage they have suffered and the urgent need for a considerable amount of time to reorganize and redeploy in order to attempt a comeback. The frequent sailing between Lushun, Dalian and Yantai, as well as the discovery of 20,000 to 30,000 troops transferred from the Jin-Ji-Cha border area in the Tai'an area, indicate that another major battle that can truly determine the overall situation in Shandong is brewing rapidly and will soon accelerate.

### After the Domestic Financial Tsunami, Hong Kong Floating Capital is Eager to Try

— Hong Kong, 21st (Airmail) Special Correspondent Zi Jian of this newspaper

After the financial crisis in the mainland, Hong Kong, standing outside the national border, has shifted from "outward tension and inward relaxation" to "outward relaxation and inward tension" in recent days. In other words, when the value of the legal tender plummeted, the Hong Kong dollar remained unchanged. Although the residents of Hong Kong and China could not help but be "shocked" by the turmoil in the mainland, people in the financial sector, because they could not grasp the next move of our government, had to stand by and watch. When our highest authorities promulgated the new economic plan, the situation in Hong Kong and China changed from stillness to movement. The most important phenomenon is the "eagerness to try" of a large amount of floating capital from the mainland in Hong Kong.

### The Stock Market Lacks Sustained Momentum - Absorbing Foreign Exchange Lacks Real Industry

The flight of domestic floating capital to Hong Kong has long been rumored, but after that floating capital arrived in Hong Kong, in addition to generating more than 30 new Chinese-funded banks, there has been no major activity. The stock market once prospered, but then lacked sustained momentum. Domestic floating capital is cautious and dare not try lightly. The greatest ambition of the banks is to rely on the convenience of a dozen aspects in the mainland (such as the postal savings bureau and the export of mineral products by the Economic Resources Committee) to absorb a portion of foreign exchange in preparation for future development of domestic industries. Their work at this stage is to maintain credit as a matter of urgency, so everyone dares not rashly speculate for profit, which is completely different from the policies adopted by domestic banks.

### Absorbing Mexican Gold - Forming a Gold Transshipment Station

Part of the domestic floating capital was used to purchase Mexican gold, which was transshipped to the mainland via Hong Kong for profit. As a result of their activities, Hong Kong has become an invisible gold transshipment station. In January alone, the import value was HK$29,364,297 and the export value was HK$22,857,758. Most of the exported gold was smuggled to the mainland via Macau. According to sources: two or three weeks ago, 40 billion yuan of floating capital from Central China arrived in Guangzhou to purchase gold. If our government can effectively prohibit the sale of gold, the role of domestic floating capital in Hong Kong's gold business will disappear (the price of gold in Hong Kong has fallen from HK$305 per tael to HK$289), and vice versa. If the ban is ineffective, the effectiveness of Hong Kong as a gold transshipment station will become more and more pronounced, and the smuggling of gold to the mainland via Hong Kong will inevitably increase. (The price of gold once fell to HK$272 and then rebounded).

### Value of Legal Tender Abnormally Increased

Due to the large-scale purchase of gold by Guangzhou capital during the major fluctuations, and the government's order to ban the sale of gold, in recent days, some "gold owners" in Guangzhou have had to "carry" gold or foreign currency to Hong Kong to exchange for legal tender in order to cope with the shortage of chips. The value of the legal tender in Hong Kong has abnormally increased, with every 10,000 yuan exchangeable for HK$5.20. According to the Central Bank's quoted price, every 10,000 yuan should only be worth about HK$3.30. As a result, foreign goods exported from Hong Kong to Guangzhou and the mainland are more crowded than before, and the crisis of our country's import surplus is becoming more and more serious.

### Smuggled Goods Imported to Guangzhou - Silver in Guangdong Province Searched Out

Foreign goods imported from Hong Kong to Guangzhou are now almost entirely handled by smugglers. Hong Kong is therefore also known as the smuggling center of South China. Smugglers are divided into large and small shareholders, and have established a complete transportation network. They import foreign goods and gold, and export some minerals (with tungsten accounting for the largest proportion) and silver. This is a big loophole, and some precious foreign exchange has escaped through this loophole. In the silver item alone, according to the statistics of the Hong Kong Import and Export Department, the exports through Hong Kong last year (mostly to the United Kingdom and India) included: silver bars worth 20,541,652 yuan, silver dollars worth 1,981,554 yuan, and silver auxiliary coins worth 8,446,513 yuan, totaling more than 30 million yuan (HKD). It is said that every 100 yuan of silver transported to Hong Kong can earn a profit of 18 yuan. After a large number of purchases by smugglers, there are probably very few remaining of civilian silver in Guangdong!

Another foreign exchange loophole is overseas remittances. At the end of last year, Rogers, the British advisor to Pei Tsu-I's Ministry of Finance, came to Hong Kong to spend Christmas, and it is said that he was discussing the issue of controlling overseas remittances with the Hong Kong government. After overseas remittances arrived in Hong Kong, they were transferred back to the United States, because merchants purchased them as payment for US goods. The more overseas remittances come to Hong Kong, the more US goods are shipped to Hong Kong (merchants who have overseas remittances can get rid of the restrictions on applying for US dollars from the Hong Kong government), which is not of any benefit to the UK. However, Pei Tsu-I returned after ten days in Hong Kong without success. In December last year, the total amount of overseas remittances handled by the Bank of China was 3,678,487,442 yuan in legal tender, a decrease of 1,024,622,573 yuan compared with November, nearly one-third. The figures for January this year have not yet been announced, but judging from the situation of overseas remittances fleeing to Hong Kong, the figures of the Bank of China are believed to be even smaller.

### Property Transactions Suddenly Booming

The development of smuggling and overseas remittances has increased the floating capital in Hong Kong, but it is not the target of floating capital activities. Now that floating capital is increasing and urgently seeking activity targets, the real estate and housing business in Hong Kong has recently become a new target. Especially the wealthy people who came south from Shanghai, they would rather pay a large amount of "shoe money" to find a house than simply buy one or two. In the past month, housing transactions have suddenly become booming. Seeing this, Hong Kong plans to auction off some public land, among which the triangular area on the side of HSBC Bank and the intersection of Des Voeux Road and Queen's Road is the most interesting. The triangular area is about 10,000 square feet. It is said that the Hong Kong government quoted a price of HK$200 per square foot. Now someone is willing to pay HK$300. When it is publicly bid in the future, the value may be even greater.

### Part of the Floating Capital Turns to Hoarding Goods

The concentration of a large amount of floating capital in Hong Kong is not only harmful to the mainland, but also to Hong Kong. Now it seems that part of the floating capital is turning to hoarding goods, and its signs have been seen in printing paper and rice. The price of rice in Hong Kong has soared for months, from 80 cents per catty to HK$1.20 per catty. Some salaried people are complaining endlessly. The labor unrest that has subsided for half a year is rising again!

### Ancient Capital Chang'an - Old Dreams Difficult to Find - Antique Industry Falls into Decline

— Xi'an, 18th (Airmail) Special Correspondent Zhang Zhou of this newspaper

Xi'an is a city full of historical flavor. From the bell tower in the center of the city, the majestic city gates, the ancient Wild Goose Pagoda Temple, the Stele Forest…… you can't help but produce "the melancholy of remembering the past" and "the search for an old dream". But now, the reality of difficult life has shattered the glorious dream.

Apart from a few large buildings, the antique shops around Nan Yuan Men can be said to show ancient style. In one or two shops, paintings, stationery, ancient tripods, stone carvings, Qin bricks, Han tiles…… are displayed. No matter what their actual quality is, the owners will always tell a lot of history, and cite classics to prove that what they say is very true. In their language, they repeatedly say "Afang, Weiyang, Sui Dynasty, Tang Dynasty"…… and other ancient luxurious records to increase the value of antiques.

The types of antiques are very complicated, with many dazzling items. The usual ones are ceramics, calligraphy and painting, clothing, carved furniture, bamboo carvings, stone carvings, stone sculptures, clay sculptures, rubbings of famous steles, old books, ancient mirrors, ancient coins, military weapons…… and ancient utensils. The sources of these things are about three types: (1) Those unearthed in Shaanxi and Gansu are indeed antiques, but this now probably only accounts for one or two tenths, because if they are famous objects, they have already been sold. Except for the aristocratic families in Xi'an, or some who have preserved them, they are almost invisible on the market. (2) They are counterfeits. For example, things from the Ming and Qing dynasties are used as relics of the Han and Tang dynasties, and so on. Especially stone carvings, pottery and clay sculptures, the original pieces do not have the year or author written on them, so they can be mixed up. It is not easy to identify them unless you are experienced in this business. (3) They are fake. Today's antiques in Xi'an have fakes of all kinds. Some of them are made very lifelike, and some are crude. However, these manufacturers write the names of Shen Zhou, Yun Nantian, Banqiao, Qiu Ying…… on their masterpieces. From this, you can see that the nature of merchants has already invaded the elegant forest.

The people of "Old Chang'an" say that famous items here are mostly stored in the homes of aristocratic families. In the antique exhibition three or four years ago, there were many treasures, such as Zhao Ziang's "Peach Blossom Spring" and "Junma", Xia Gui's horizontal scroll reached several feet, and Li Longmian's line drawing of Buddhist temples, Qiu Ying's figures, Ni Zan's landscapes, and the characters of Yue Fei, Wen Tianxiang, Yang Jisheng, and Dong Qichang were also not a few, but those before the Sui and Tang dynasties were still extremely rare. According to people, there are not many great collectors in Xi'an. Generally speaking, the collections of the Liang Wuqiao and Yan Ganyuan families should be quite impressive. But for the most part, they are still scattered everywhere.

The golden age of the antique market in recent decades was in the early years of the Republic of China, when large quantities went to Shanghai and other places in the southeast. Until about the 20s of the Republic of China, it was still considered not to be declining. After the "January 28th Incident," it was slightly worse than before, and after the "July 7th Incident," the coastal areas fell one after another. The new era needed new things, so it was not as good as before in the midst of constant war. In 1945, after the American soldiers came to Xi'an, the market became active again. Those foreigners felt novel about everything in the ancient city of Chang'an, and bought a lot of these antiques. The neglected market became active again. It was as green as the "ancient clothing" industry, but after the Allies left, it also became deserted.

Under the raging inflation, merchants have mostly felt that it is not easy to maintain. The price of grain in Xi'an is still a headache. Within two months, it has tripled. As of now, although gold has no market (private) due to the prohibition of trading, flour has risen from 47,000 to 58,000 yuan (per bag). And department stores have also increased by more than 80% within half a month. As a result, anyone from civil servants to businessmen felt very panic about their livelihood. Antique dealers in the present day, needless to say, also felt more "different than before".

The Bizarre Drama of Depriving the Freedom to Read Newspapers

Editor: Please note that elements threatened by certain disruptive forces have invaded our school to interfere with our freedom to read newspapers. They believe that any newspaper that stands for national construction and order is not to their liking. They lavishly scold and obstruct people who read newspapers, and even interfere with them. They simply deprive people of the freedom to read newspapers. In our school, a certain society was attacked for posting a certain newspaper, and the student union was asked to interfere, prevent posting, and say that if they wanted to post a newspaper, they were limited to posting a certain newspaper or a certain newspaper, otherwise, the student union would announce the names of the people posting the newspaper.

In the past, they also shouted slogans of "democracy" and "freedom," but they did not give others "freedom." They tried to erase the public opinion of the masses with the absurd views of a few people. This matter is similar to the freedom and democracy in the so-called "liberated areas." I hate such "freedom" and "democracy" and understand the true meaning of their advocacy for parties to withdraw from schools. Now our school is busy with this kind of activity, which has created a very chaotic situation. They advocate that students should not focus on studying and make political sacrifices in vain. Please pay attention to cleaning up the Education Bureau! (Li Yichu)

How to Refund Life Insurance Premiums

Editor: In May 1941, I was introduced by a friend to a life insurance company and purchased life insurance of 5,000 yuan in legal tender, payable in five years, with an annual payment of 211.60 yuan. I paid legal tender for two years and counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes for one year, calculated at a rate of two for one. Because Shanghai was not safe, I returned to my hometown and interrupted the payment. After the victory, I came to Shanghai and worked. I went to the company to inquire about how to handle this insurance. The company replied that it should still be paid according to the original amount. I replied that the current value of the currency is too low and I am unwilling to pay 211.60 yuan for savings. He said that the industry association has not yet had a specific plan and is waiting for government orders. There has been no reply so far. I think the value of the 600 yuan of legal tender I paid at that time was enough to sell a dan of white rice for only 20 or 30 yuan in legal tender. Please ask the company to decide on a proper method of refunding the principal as soon as possible to avoid policyholders suffering too much! (Ding Wencai)

Handle Dangerous Buildings as Soon as Possible

Editor: Yesterday, I happened to see many buildings on Yangshupu Road, numbers 1411 to 1449 and 1667 to 1673, in the Eighth Route Army newspaper. They are all dilapidated buildings that have been tilted and are extremely dangerous. Residents may not be aware of it yet. If an accident occurs, the lives and property of residents and passers-by will be damaged beyond imagination. The reader cannot remain silent in the face of danger, so I specially wrote a letter to warn them and urge homeowners and residents to pay close attention and deal with it as soon as possible to avoid disaster.

### Mountain Depths, Waterfall Valleys, Spraying Foam: Prospects for Fujian Hydropower

— Dispatch from Fuzhou on the 15th, Special Correspondent Chen Zheng Yu of This Newspaper

Lacking Production, Lacking Misery

Production and construction require substantial capital, cutting-edge technology, abundant resources, inexpensive labor, and convenient transportation. Fujian's economic construction has traditionally been hindered by the province's financial difficulties, transportation obstacles, and a lack of industrial raw materials, preventing significant achievements. In terms of production technology, it remains stuck in a medieval production stage, adhering rigidly to outdated methods. For example, Fujian's tea, sugar, and paper manufacturing industries once flourished in Southeast Asia and Europe before the war. It is a pity that improvements in production technology have not been possible, otherwise they could have gained an advantage in the international marketplace. The weakness of Fujian's economic productivity also stems from a fundamental reason: Fujian is a province lacking coal. Without a power source for industry, how can motors be started? Fujian's local economy has been stifled by a lack of electricity, and the more than thirteen million people in Fujian Province are impoverished due to the lack of power-driven industries.

Taking Fuzhou as an example: the entire Fuzhou power plant generates only 3,500 kilowatts, and its fuel is wood, which is uneconomical. Furthermore, this 3,500 kilowatts of power is not only insufficient to meet the needs of some light industries in Fuzhou, but also the power for residential lighting throughout Fuzhou can only be maintained by not supplying electricity during the day. Outside of Fuzhou, only the counties and cities of Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Nanping, Jian'ou, Gutian, Yong'an, and Shaxian in Fujian Province have small power plants to supply citizens with meager electricity. How eagerly the people of Fujian long for the day when the entire region achieves electrification, using cheap electricity as the power source for various productions to improve their standard of living.

Generating Hydropower with Waterfalls

Utilizing nature is where human intelligence lies. Since Fujian lacks coal, then utilizing the steep, cascading water flow to generate electricity is the most economical method. According to investigations by the Fujian Provincial Construction Committee: the Jinjiang River basin in Anxi County can generate 100,000 horsepower; the Jiulongjiang River basin in Hua'an County can generate significant hydropower, but detailed surveys are still underway; the Gutian Creek hydropower, primarily using the Longting Waterfall in Gutian County, can yield 80,000 horsepower; and Jiulihu Lake in Xianyou County can generate 10,000 horsepower. Overall, these four locations can provide more than 300,000 horsepower. If fully developed to meet the needs of civil electricity in all counties throughout the province, and to supply the province's future economic development and the use of southeastern provinces, it would be more than sufficient.

The electricity generated by Jiulihu Lake in Xianyou can be used for salt electrolysis plants, ice factories, sugar factories, canning factories, fresh fruit and vegetable refrigeration plants, and water plants in the coastal counties of southern Fujian. In addition to supplying pulp mills and sawmills near Gutian, the electricity generated by Longting can also transmit a large amount of power to the urban area of Fuzhou and its vicinity to supply electricity to various factories near Fuzhou. It is estimated that after the power of the factories is increased, the productivity can be doubled.

The hydropower development of Gutian Creek is most valuable, which is described in detail below:

Building Dams on Gutian Creek

Gutian Creek possesses tremendous potential hydropower. Its upstream east and west tributaries originate in Pingnan County, winding for more than fifty miles before converging east of Gutian County. The water flow gradually increases, and the Gutian Electric Power Company diversion dam at Guisei, two kilometers south of the county seat, intercepts the river basin. Therefore, the water flow is smooth. Below Guisei, beaches are lined up in the valleys, and rocks are fully exposed. Flowing eleven kilometers to Caoyang Village, it joins the Caoyang West Creek. At this point, the riverbed becomes slightly flatter, and the mountains on both banks are steep. Flowing three kilometers south is the famous Longting Waterfall, cascading down a cliff thirteen meters high, with spraying foam, forming a spectacle. Below the waterfall, the riverbed becomes narrower, and the water and rocks collide, rushing down. Flowing ten kilometers to Lijiaqi, the remaining force is exhausted. After another eight kilometers, at Boping, the water flow becomes stable, and after five kilometers, it merges into the Min River at Shuikou. The entire creek's shoals and waterfalls are concentrated in the section from Guisei to Lijiaqi, a creek length of twenty-four kilometers with a drop of more than 230 meters, making it an excellent location for hydropower development on Gutian Creek.

Gutian Creek is close to Fuzhou, accessible via the Baifu Gutian Highway, which is 135 kilometers long. Water transportation on the Min River to Gukou and Shuikou can also connect with Gutian, making transportation conditions very favorable.

The Entire Project is Divided into Three Stages

After the Provincial Construction Committee and the Water Resources Committee of the Resources Commission dispatched engineers Xu and Lin to conduct on-site surveys, it was determined that, given the current conditions and the power demand in eastern Fujian, the hydropower development of Gutian Creek could be developed in phases. The entire project is divided into three stages:

Stage 1: Utilize the drop in the curved riverbed between Guichao and Bankengting, building a dam one kilometer below the original power plant site at Guisei. The mountains on both banks are steep at this location, and the riverbed is narrow, with rocks fully exposed, making it a good dam site. However, the dam body needs to be relatively high (fifteen meters). There may be potential dam sites within this one kilometer, but the left bank consists of alluvial farmland, and the riverbed is filled with loose rocks, making it difficult to find a solid dam site. On the right bank of the river, a tunnel could be built through Tasha Mountain to the valley of Fengpei Pavilion, 1.5 kilometers long, using the valley to build a dam as a forebay and establish a plant at the exit of the valley, or drawing water through an open channel across this valley to establish a plant 200 meters below Bankengting, achieving a water head of 100 meters. The selection of either of these will be determined after topographic surveys.

Stage 2: Utilize the 50-meter drop between Longting and Anlin Village. The mountains on both banks from below Caoyang Village to Longting are steep, and the riverbanks are narrow, all being excellent dam sites. It is planned to build an increased dam above Longting Waterfall, which can shorten the water diversion channel, opening a channel along the mountain for more than two kilometers to establish a plant in Anlin Village. The terrain there is flat, suitable for plant construction. In addition, utilize the approximately 200 square kilometers of the Caoyang two-creek watershed, which merges into Gutian Creek one kilometer below Bankengting. One section of the valley at its outlet is deep, with several waterfalls. At Tingquan Pavilion, the waterfall has a drop of fifteen meters. If a dam is built above it and water is diverted to the creek mouth for power generation, a water head of 80 meters can be obtained. The upstream has a wide plain of about eight square kilometers, which can be used for salary water to increase the flow in the second and third stages.

Stage 3: Utilize the 80-meter drop in the riverbed bends from Yantou Ting to Lijiaqi. Build a dam at Yantou Ting, tunnel through the mountain ridge, and then open a channel along the mountain for 1.5 kilometers to establish a plant at Lijiaqi for power generation.

The above three stages of the project are very simple, and more than 80,000 horsepower of power can be obtained. It is easy to develop them in phases.

Five Organizations Cooperate

After the Provincial Construction Committee and the Resources Committee dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys of various hydropower locations, they will first develop the Gutian Creek area. However, the hydrological data of the creek is still lacking accurate and detailed records. A permanent hydrological station should be established in Gutian County to continue recording water levels and measuring flow rates. Other factors such as rainfall and evaporation should also be systematically observed in advance for future corrections and as a basis for future construction. As for the implementation of this project plan, it will be jointly undertaken by five organizations: the Fujian Provincial Government, the Resources Committee, Taiwan Power Company, Overseas Chinese Business Company, and Fujian Economic Construction Company. The Fujian Power Company Preparatory Committee will be organized to be responsible for the progress of the project. Taiwan Power Company will invest in the Fujian Power Company at a discounted price with its hydropower generators and their generating accessories from power plants that were discontinued due to surplus power on the east coast of Taiwan Province. The other civil engineering equipment will be jointly shared by the Overseas Chinese Enterprise Company, Fujian Economic Construction Company, and the Fujian Provincial Government. The Resources Committee will be responsible for the technical design work.

This hydropower project, with the cooperation of the Resources Committee on the technical aspects, Taiwan Power Company on the mechanical equipment aspects, and the Overseas Chinese Company on the financial aspects, will be completed in phases soon.

What Fujian lacks most is railway transportation and power-driven industries. With railways, Fujian's special products can be sold throughout the country, preventing the existing industries from being stifled. With power-driven industries, the revitalization of new industries in Fujian can be stimulated. Both have a decisive impact on the development of Fujian's local economy. The Min-Gan Railway has been initiated by Fujianese Chen Ti Rong and others in Shanghai, who have organized the "Fujian Railway Company" and are negotiating with several Canadian manufacturers for large loans guaranteed by the Executive Yuan. It is expected that once the Canadian equipment arrives, construction will be decisively undertaken. The Fujian Electric Power Co., Ltd. hopes to complete a section of the water measurement project as soon as possible to inspire the people of Fujian. The folk customs of Fujian are simple and hardworking, and the general people's lives are very frugal. How should the provincial government strive to paint a magnificent vision to comfort the people who toil year-round!

### On the Jiaoji Railway, Homecomings are Busy

— Dispatch from Qingdao on the 20th, Hou Shi

The Jiaoji Railway, the major artery of Shandong, after being hastily repaired by road workers, has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist army shortly after being connected. The incident occurred between Nanquan and Lancun, and another at a location near Jiaodong Station, where more than twenty sections of track and six holes of the iron bridge were damaged, causing the train service to be stranded again. The railway bureau is currently dispatching vehicles to repair the damage.

Before six o'clock in the morning, the station was already crowded with passengers, all of whom had left their homes and been refugees in Qingdao for a long time. Once they heard that the Jiaoji Railway was open, they all wanted to return home as soon as possible. The waiting room was noisy and crowded, with almost no room to stand.

In order to entertain the visiting delegation of reporters, the railway bureau specially attached a public affairs car. In front of the locomotive, the Party and national flags were crossed, fluttering in the wind, symbolizing the joyful mood of the people in the carriages. At 7:40, the car slowly started and headed west. When the car arrived at the first major station, Dagang, because there were too many passengers without tickets, the order was disrupted, and it had to return to Qingdao. Military police and railway police boarded the car and re-checked the tickets once, persuading the passengers without tickets and asking them to get off. As a result, the order in the car was better, but the departure time was delayed by more than an hour.

The car traveled very fast, passed Jiaoxian without stopping, and drove straight to Gaomi. Gaomi is an important location in eastern Shandong, connecting southern and northern Shandong. The station was originally a magnificent building, but now it has been destroyed, and only the remains of the water tower are left. Looking around, there are only broken walls and ruins, a very desolate scene. When the car passed Taibaozhuang, which was the location where the connection ceremony was held a few days ago, the speed became very slow, and the carriages shook violently. This location, because it is a curved area of the entire Jiaoji line with prominent terrain, the track has been most severely damaged, and the repair is also very difficult.

By the time we arrived at Fangzi, it was late, and the car stopped here overnight. The situation in Fangzi is very good because the Communist army has never come. The next morning, the car continued to drive to Weixian. Weixian is a large station on the Jiaoji line, second only to Qingdao and Jinan, with a population of 120,000. Most of the pig bristles and hair nets exported from Shandong Province are shipped from Weixian. Because of the inconvenience of road transportation, the commerce in Weixian is also depressed, and the people's lives are poor. People with a little property have gone to Qingdao or other ports. Now that the railway is open, there will definitely be more people returning home one after another.

The restoration of transportation not only facilitates freight transport but also has an impact on thinning out the population and alleviating the housing shortage. For example, the population of Qingdao, according to figures released by the police bureau, the total number of Chinese and foreign households in November was 152,777, with a population of 752,258, including 1,753 foreigners. Recently, due to the convenience of transportation compared to before, the number of people returning home has been increasing, resulting in a decrease of 111 households and 3,830 people compared to last month, and a decrease of 23 foreigners. Now that the Jiaoji Railway is open, the number of people returning home will gradually increase, so the population of Qingdao may continue to decrease. Naturally, this still depends on how the current situation develops.

### Insurance

— By French writer B. Gervaise, translated by Li Qingai

As La Fleuve walked out of the prison gates, he could not help being startled, because his former boss, Luc Jerville, was standing right across from him. This Luc Jerville was the one who had previously put him in prison for eighteen months.

"Good morning, La Fleuve," the man said crisply. "You probably weren't waiting here, were you? ... I knew they were releasing you this morning, I had already received a report."

"What do you want from me?" La Fleuve asked unhappily.

"I've come to propose something to you," Luc Jerville said, "Would you be willing to return to my store?"

The released man shrugged his shoulders.

"Go back to a crook's store!" he said.

"Yes, you made some mistakes before, did some... abnormal things, but any sin can be forgiven! ... And I hope that what happened to you will teach you a lesson in the future, so now we don't need to talk about it anymore. If you are willing to return to the store and do the same work as before with the same treatment, then just come to the store at the usual time next Monday, and I will wait for you."

La Fleuve thought for a while, then made up his mind:

"Agreed!" he said, "See you Monday!"

There is certainly much to be said about the mental effects of prison, but no one can deny that some people have gained a certain sense of dignity in there. So La Fleuve could not help but feel that he was demeaning himself when he showed even the slightest hint of gratitude to this ruthless boss, who, for some unfortunate minor mistakes, had ignored all his pleadings and tears and sent him to court. So accepting his request now was already a matter of consideration.

"I had no choice," he said to himself in a self-pitying tone. "Because with the references I can provide now, it won't be that easy to find a position as an accountant and cashier."

Moreover, he decided not to forgive any hurtful allusions, any allusive words, whether these things came from Luc Jerville in the future, or from old colleagues he would meet again in the future. But all of this made him more resourceful and careful. They all greeted him with sympathy, without showing the slightest surprise, as if La Fleuve's return to the store was the most natural thing in the world. As for the boss, his taste was also high, and he did not reveal the kind of embarrassing arrogance that belonged to a meritorious benefactor.

"Good morning, La Fleuve," he said simply, "You know what you should do, I don't need to tell you, do I? If you need any explanation about everything that happened during your absence, then please feel free to ask me."

La Fleuve thanked him in a worldly manner and then started working. He concentrated on his work because the format of all the books was very neglected.

"Three accountants have been hired to replace you, but none of them could handle it," the old worker who served in the office, Walker Duff, told him. "They used to say that there was too much work for one person to do, so they asked for an assistant, but the boss never agreed to them, you can understand! ... 'Your predecessor used to handle it all very well,' the boss replied to them."

Later, he added this disloyal sentence:

"No doubt that's why he hired you again!"

Needless to say! Yes, La Fleuve handled it all very well, but for doing so, he had his own supreme reason: when others carefully forged the entrusted bookkeeping, then rather than bearing a colleague who was sensitive to discovering secrets, it was better to do it strictly and uprightly. Therefore, a disloyal accountant is often willing to work harder than an upright and selfless employee. Similarly, he usually pays more attention to the boss's interests. His business prosperity is important to him because one can only move money around at will in a very full treasury. These are all things that should be clearly reported when a cheater hands over the books before the court! Then there is only to explain this to the judges!

Now, seeing all this work weighing on his shoulders, La Fleuve did not complain at all. Because he had rediscovered all his habits, his desk, his chair, his various books, and all the scattered appendages in the office that had been with him for so long: such as ink bottles, blotting paper pads, date stamps, finger-moistening sponges, and perennially dry glue bottles, he felt happy!

But the thing he considered to be the happiest was the tranquility he enjoyed in this store. Originally, when he first sat down in his old seat, he had feared that his life would fall into an embarrassing atmosphere of suspicion, under the incessant scrutiny of a boss who had become distrustful because of past memories. Being regarded as a suspicious person, La Fleuve could not long bear such a grievance. But nothing of this kind happened. Luc Jerville treated him as an employee correctly and as before. He never audited his accounts, never revealed a hint of suspicion in his words. As before, he handed him the key to the safe and allowed him to handle deposits of considerable amounts. So much trust finally touched La Fleuve's heart.

"He really is a beautiful character, I never thought he had such strength!" he muttered to himself when his boss was away.

He therefore used double the fairness and diligence to show his gratitude, desperately making up for the delays caused by the colleagues who had taken over his duties. Sometimes, he found himself obstructed by some unexpected difficulties. In that general ledger, many new accounts had been opened when he left, resulting in many small riddles that made La Fleuve want to figure it out on his own without asking anyone.

One of these new tricks especially puzzled him. This expense was listed in the general expenses, the amount was three thousand francs, and the account was called this strange name: "Compensation Society". What could this Compensation Society be? What had this strange-named expert sold to Luc Jerville's store for a price of three thousand francs? ... Of course, there was a very simple way to find out the bottom line: to ask Mr. Luc Jerville himself, but La Fleuve's self-esteem came into play. He considered this topic a personal matter, so he thought that asking someone to help him was to admit his own incompetence. So he decided to find the answer on the condition that he would not be assisted by anyone. He spent more than ten efforts in succession to review various delivery orders, various pickup orders, various receipts, and all suspicious documents that led him on the path. However, in vain! Even though he had exhausted all his inquiries, the mystery of the Compensation Society still had not revealed a single point.

At this time, Luc Jerville seemed to be concentrating on making La Fleuve's good reviews obtained from him step by step. Never had a boss been so generous in trusting the honesty of his accountant and cashier. La Fleuve was therefore greatly moved.

"How could I have thought of imposing theft on such a person!" he thought in his heart.

But he had not yet reached the end of his tearful gratitude.

"I have to go away for a few days," Luc Jerville said to him one morning, "Here are a few blank checks. You can fill in the amount and take the money to the bank as needed."

Faced with this new evidence of credit, La Fleuve already felt his tears welling up in his eyes. At this time, the boss went on to say:

"You should pay the fee for the Compensation Society, the receipt should be sent over in these few days."

La Fleuve seized the opportunity and asked, "I was just wondering, what exactly is this Compensation Society?"

"What! You don't know!" Luc Jerville exclaimed. "It's an insurance company."

"Then, you are not insured with the Mutual Aid Society?" the surprised accountant said.

Then Luc Jerville simply said, "Who said I'm not, but the Mutual Aid Society only 'does' fire insurance, which is not enough ... you can understand, I also insured against theft, now."

Shocked and embarrassed, La Fleuve left this store that evening, a store where someone had used good feelings to deceive him. This was still one of the many things that a person trained under the harsh training of prison could not tolerate.

Qing Ai notes: B. Gervaise is a modern French writer whose life story is yet to be investigated. In addition to this piece, I have recently seen a short story called "Floating Mask", whose language is as clear and beautiful as this piece, whose psychological analysis is as rich as this piece, and whose attention to structure and revelation of "unknown points" at the end of the piece to arouse the reader's interest is also the same as this piece. It can be said that his style is very similar to that of Vercors, the author of "The Silence of the Sea". Perhaps this is a new trend in French novels and short stories after this World War. The original text of this piece appeared in the French "Chinese Post Weekly" on February 9 of this year and was probably reprinted from a publication in Paris. Finished translating and recording at the North Pole Pavilion on February 15.

### Commentary on Paintings and Calligraphy from the Lingxi Garden

— Orchard

Among paintings and calligraphy, figures and fish are both favored by the world, but it is not easy to reach the extreme. The Lingxi Garden has figure paintings by Xue Ji, "Three Yuan Circles" by Li Boshi, and paintings by Qiu Shizhou and Tang Liuru, all of which are elegant and luxurious, beyond the dreams of modern painters. As for the item of ten thousand fish, such as Gu Hutou's Yi Ge, and Song Huizong's White-Haired Belonging, are all excellent works. Taking the item of fish as an example, the fish of Wang Guang, the fish of Yan Yanzhi, and the fish of Li Boshi all show novelty and do not fall into common clichés. Careful examination reveals that they are all spirited and precious. I would like to share them with insightful people!

### Portrait

— Van Gogh

Exhibited by the Shanghai University Student Aid Society World Painting Exhibition

### World Famous Paintings Exhibition

— Yu Jianhua

Since Matteo Ricci brought Western paintings to China during the Ming Dynasty, there has been a lot of friction with Chinese painting. However, at that time, it was entirely for the purpose of demonstration, and painting was merely an appendage of religion. Therefore, the Chinese art world at that time was only slightly influenced in portrait painting, and other painting methods were not affected. It was not until the Italian painter Giuseppe Castiglione came to China in the early Qing Dynasty that the Chinese art world began to experience greater waves. Ultimately, Western painting methods and Chinese painting methods were found to be incompatible in many ways. Although Castiglione spared no effort to sacrifice pure Western methods and catered to Chinese methods, creating an eclectic school of painting, it was ultimately too meticulous and complex, not in line with the elegant and unrestrained Chinese taste, and therefore did not spread widely.

At the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, restrictions were greatly lifted, and Western paintings also crossed the sea to the East. As a result, Western painting styles surged and flourished, showing a tendency to overshadow the host and replace Chinese painting. However, due to national customs, habits, and various environmental and material conditions, Western painting, which was initially invincible, has made snail-like progress in the past twenty years. Today, with the rising cost of living and the difficulty in purchasing Western painting materials, Western painting is facing a rather serious crisis. How to break through this difficult situation and prevent Western painting in China from withering due to malnutrition is a matter of great deliberation.

Due to the lack of museums and art galleries in our country, the Chinese people do not have the opportunity to appreciate and observe Western paintings. Furthermore, due to crude printing and lack of publications, there are very few works introducing Western paintings in the country, leaving those who aspire to study without a starting point. Moreover, most of the painters who have studied in Europe and the United States have changed careers due to environmental and living conditions, further dimming the Western art world.

Now, the Shanghai Art College is holding a world-famous painting exhibition at the YMCA for the sake of student aid. The four paintings on display are all original-color prints from abroad, only second to genuine works. Moreover, according to the order of art history, from primitive cave paintings to the current Fauvism and Futurism, each era and each major artist has one or more representative masterpieces. This allows viewers to not only see the full picture of authentic Western paintings but also to read it as a history of painting. The evolution of Western painting can be said to be clear at a glance, making viewers feel as if they are in the great art galleries of Rome, Florence, and the Louvre, which is truly a great event!

At the same time, in addition to Western paintings, there are also Chinese paintings arranged according to the era, from the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties to the present day, with masterpieces by each major artist on display. This time, because Western painting is the main focus and Chinese painting is the secondary focus, the Chinese painting aspect is inevitably inferior.

As far as I know, such an exhibition is unprecedented in our country. Therefore, not only those who like Western paintings should go and see it, but also those who do not paint Chinese paintings or Western paintings should go and see it in order to broaden their horizons and understand the solemnity and greatness of the painting world, so as not to be frogs in a well or arrogant ignoramuses.

### A Hundred Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains, an Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 183

— Ye Jingfeng

The third step is to implement the mind probing technique. This step, although a helpless measure, is an adventure worth taking because the secret of "Eight" seems to be of great importance. To make the effect more certain, Liang Qun and W Qun also automatically joined. The method used was incremental hypnosis. This is slightly different from the original plan; its use still utilized Tsurumi as a medium, with Yao Qun as the first convener, W Jun as the second convener, and I was responsible for the aftermath. Tsurumi had two exchanges of minds with Pingzi, so in principle, these two experiments should not have any unexpected dangers.

After the above three steps were completed, there was still half a step left. This half-step was initiated by Xu Qun to explore the East Jiaomin Lane. I originally advocated postponing this step until the next day or evening, but Zong Qun, this Northeast young lady, had a rather impetuous temperament. Once she spoke of something, she had to do it in one step. Moreover, there was also that little tiger next to her, who had never been timid. We thought this move was quite risky, but she treated it like a game. After our repeated persuasion, she agreed to only scout around and not engage in combat; therefore, it only counts as half a step.

——The steps were planned properly, and it was already past seven o'clock. After a hasty dinner, everyone went their separate ways to prepare and arrange what was necessary. Just as Tsurumi and I had drafted and sent a few secret telegrams, "04" had rushed back. His report disappointed us greatly.

It turned out that when he left the city, the war in the suburbs had already come to an end; Commander Song's main force, although it preserved fifty to sixty percent of its strength, retreated to the Liangxiang and Zhuozhou areas in the south; however, the news of the deaths of two generals, Yuan Dengyu and Tong Linge, had been confirmed. The troops of both generals, and a part of General Zhang Zizhong's troops, were gradually consumed by the Japanese army's pincer formation, leaving very little. The Chinese garrison trapped in Beiping City rushed out of the small city, but were driven back; fortunately, the remnants of the army outside the city desperately built one or two lines of defense, echoing from inside and outside, and only then rescued most of the troops inside the city and fled westward in disarray.

"04" searched for Wu Dingyuan's whereabouts, but according to the enemy troops along the way, they had not seen a single civilian other than Chinese soldiers. Of course, Wu Dingyuan could not have flown to Changxindian, so in theory, "04" did not need to make this trip. But an order is an order, and it cannot be violated in the slightest. Moreover, the war was over, and the sound of gunfire along the way was sparse, so he arrived at Changxindian a little after five o'clock. There, he ran into mostly Japanese soldiers and some unsavory ruffians. A little after six o'clock, he returned to the city.

Seeing that it was still early, he happened to hear that the Japanese army had detained many Chinese people, kept separately in three or four locations. He immediately asked the several Japanese agents who went with him to search these confined places; as a result, he never found Engineer Wu's shadow. What he heard were two unfortunate bad news; one, Japanese planes were heavily bombing the suburbs of Tianjin, with Nankai University as the biggest target of the bombing. It was said that the school had been razed to the ground. Two, although General Li Wentian led his troops in Tianjin, vowing to resist the enemy to the death, the fate of Tianjin City was already in imminent danger. Furthermore, according to a secret message from Songbe Miyaka, a large fleet of Japanese warships, loaded with several regiments of marines, had sailed towards my Tianjin Dagukou, and would be able to land at Dagu from 12:00 p.m. onwards.

After listening to "04"'s reports, Tsurumi felt that the situation in Tianjin and Beiping was changing so rapidly that it was beyond expectations. Fearing that our planned assault would be hindered, he immediately ordered the car to be prepared, and told me to relay this news to W Jun. Before leaving, he kept nagging me like an old woman, repeatedly urging me to tell everyone that no matter how late it was, even if it affected our plan, they must wait for him to return before launching any expected actions. At this time, his composure was somewhat flustered.

Free Talk

### A Special Account of Washington's Birthday Ball

— Feng Rui

The evening of February 22nd.

On Albert Road, Lafayette Road, the stars twinkled, and the evening wind was strong.

It was obviously somewhat different from the usual scene. The road, which was usually deserted, was particularly lively that day. Here, to quote a line from Li Houzhu's poem, "Carriages flow like water, horses roar like dragons," it can truly be said to be worthy of the description.

Eight hundred noble and elegantly dressed Chinese and American ladies and gentlemen were gradually swallowed up inside.

In terms of Chinese-American friendship, this was an extraordinary day. That day was Washington's birthday, and the Shanghai Returned Students Association from the United States and other four Chinese and American groups held a grand banquet ball for this occasion.

Ambassador Stuart delivered a fifteen-minute speech at the banquet ball. His calm and pertinent tone aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience. When he pointed out that China's only enemies were poverty, illiteracy, disease, and the abuse of public office for private gain, the whole audience held their breath, and it seemed that the sound of low sighs could be heard from everyone's heart.

Here, everyone seemed to be decades younger. They cheered to their heart's content and danced to their heart's content. Youth and joy occupied everyone's heart.

The ladies and gentlemen had all removed their light furs and put on the most fashionable new clothes: long skirts trailing on the ground, shimmering dance dresses, and bare chests and arms enjoying the gentleness. Music and spring. Although at this time, it was still the season of chilling spring weather outdoors, and heavy furs were not enough to withstand the cold; but in this garden, it was full of spring, and the dancing was in full swing. It had already crossed into another world, dancing carefree and carefree, in another paradise.

Of course, the situation that day was different from an ordinary gathering. The music was also frantically upbeat and unusually intense. The musicians, blowing and playing, were all flushed, playing all kinds of passionate notes that made people forget time and forget the world.

Mayor Wu has always been a dance enthusiast, but that night, because he was accompanying Ambassador Stuart, he did not go down to the floor at all. He only nodded and smiled to some familiar guests in the crowded dancing crowd. Perhaps it was because he had been sitting for too long that he began to yawn. Someone said, "The Mayor's dance addiction has flared up." The Mayor's wife seemed to be a little fatter than before, sitting between Ambassador Stuart and American Consul General Davis, further complementing a typical Oriental beauty.

Dr. Mei Lanfang also attended the grand event that night in his capacity as a "returned student from the United States." Wearing a gray suit, he had a friendly two-minute conversation with Ambassador Stuart in Beijing dialect.

If we didn't know that Mei Lanfang was a famous actor, who would believe that this nearly sixty-year-old man could still specialize in playing the delicate and charming appearance of a young girl on stage?

Mei Lanfang is good at using dignified gestures and delicate and thoughtful movements to greet every female partner, which seems to easily remind people: Is this still somewhat carrying the colors of the stage?

During the dance, in that huge dance floor, it eventually became too crowded because it could not accommodate the constant one or two hundred pairs of dance partners. Each pair of dance partners felt that it was difficult to move even an inch. On top of the dance floor, three large clusters of balloons hung high, becoming the focal point of everyone's attention.

When the balloons began to float down, the entire dance floor was in an uproar: everyone hoped to grab a few balloons, the ladies laughed softly, shouted softly, and stretched out their hands nimbly to tease them, and their dance partners shouted out encouraging cheers for them. That moment of chaos, laughter, mixed with the popping sound of balloons, formed a picture of "ladies playing with balls." The black man on the music stage smiled, only revealing two rows of snow-white teeth, flashing under the neon lights.

Finally, everyone raised their glasses again, said good night to each other, and stepped back onto the cold streets of Shanghai on a spring night. A series of cars gradually carried their masters back to the sweet dreams of spring.

At that time, it was already past twelve o'clock. On Albert Road, the stars filled the sky, still shining brightly. A gust of cool wind made people feel as cool as water.

### The Nosy Person

— Qi Lou Zhuren

Being nosy is a virtue because it is a manifestation of curiosity. However, when this virtue develops towards people and is very proactive, it will be "unbearable." I am a person who is greatly troubled by nosiness. Because I am not good at eloquence and cannot avoid nosiness, and I especially do not like to be nosy about other people's affairs, so I have no power to counterattack at all. Therefore, when I encounter a nosy person, I can only be the one who is nosy about.

The nosy person wants to be nosy about you anytime and anywhere. There is no need to care about things that are inquired about behind your back. Let me just say that as soon as he meets you, he can use skills to ask you how much money you earn in a month, how you are supporting your family, etc. If you have a leather bag, he can say "Is it okay to take a look?" while opening it to look. If you take out a book, he wants to take it and see what book it is. If you have a piece of paper clipped in the book, then it is definitely a must-see. If there is a letter in the book, he must know who wrote it, or who it is sent to. If something is showing in your shirt pocket, he will reach out and pull it out to see it clearly.

During small talk, he wants to inquire about your experience. If you cannot close the door to nosiness, his nose will keep stabbing into the depths of your past; whether you are a party member, whether you have been in prison, whether you are a traitor, etc. Of course, your family background cannot escape his questioning either. What did your ancestors do, is it a good family? Is your mother a concubine, are you an illegitimate child, and then investigate your wife.

If he comes to your office or your house, even a private detective would not rummage around like him. In short, if you have any secrets, you can be sure that in the end, he will completely have them in his grasp. Only then will he be satisfied and leave you.

### My Humble Opinion on Newspaper Size Reduction

— Xiao Lin

Last month, the Central Propaganda Department limited the size of newspapers in various places to meters. Major newspapers in this city have successively reduced their size. Those originally published with three large sheets have been changed to three large sheets, those with three large sheets have been changed to two and a half sheets, and those with two and a half sheets have been similarly changed to two large sheets. Naturally, the original intention of the central government was to reduce paper imports and save foreign exchange. On the newspaper side, due to the soaring cost of raw materials, it was happy to comply. However, this has caused adverse consequences.

The first to be affected is the sales of newspapers. As far as I know, many newspapers have reduced their sales recently (perhaps some newspapers can maintain their original state). Of course, the price increase of newspapers this month is one of the reasons, but the biggest reason is still that the general readers feel dissatisfied with the content. Because the newspapers that have reduced their size have not been able to reduce advertising as initially intended (?), but what has been cut off are the supplements and special columns required by the intellectual class. Therefore, imperceptibly, the readers' interest in the newspapers is inevitably reduced by seventy or eighty percent.

Secondly, authors who make a living by selling articles have also been considerably hit. Due to the sluggishness of the publishing industry, the places where they can publish articles are already pitifully small. Their only market for selling manuscripts can be said to be the supplements and special columns of a few newspapers. Now that this type of space has been cut, it is tantamount to taking away their livelihoods; although, these are not related to the newspapers themselves; however, the suffering of the literati is also the sorrow of the future of Chinese culture.

Furthermore, due to the impact of internal strife, cultural undertakings in the one or two years since victory have been facing a crisis just like other industries and businesses. The publishing industry is declining, and bookstores and newspaper offices are closing down; similarly, periodical magazines are shrinking, and the prices of single-volume books are soaring. Nowhere does not reveal the miserable state of the cultural world. In these two years of great famine for spiritual food, newspapers have formed the most desirable and most essential reading material for the people. If the size of newspapers is further reduced and the content of newspapers is further impoverished, then it will be a prelude to a more bleak cultural disaster.

Looking at the sales figures of The New York Times is really alarming. Then, why is it able to sell more than three million copies every day? The main reason is not due to its size and content! (The New York Times publishes 59 large sheets daily, including 10 magazine insertions, 3 commentary sheets, and 9 other forums.) Of course, with our financial resources, material resources, transportation and public standards, it is absolutely difficult to reach its level; however, this may serve as our reference: in order to increase the newspapers' own business, in order to rescue cultural workers, in order to shoulder the correct task of the newspapers, if the newspapers in this city cannot reduce the advertising area, it is still advisable to restore the original size (within three large sheets). To add one more sentence, if "cost is concerned" and "power is not sufficient", it is best not to reduce the size of the supplements and various special columns.

### Waterskiing

— Xie Jun

"Waterskiing" is a newly emerging sport in Europe and America, with a very short history. Only fifteen years ago, a few French skiers suddenly thought of wearing wooden snow bridge-shaped skis to slide on the water surface to test their novel idea. The result was the creation of this alarming, exciting, and swift-as-wind sport. This sport requires courage, skill in swimming, and a strong physique: imagine being dragged by a speedboat hurtling at 68 miles per hour, stepping on skis, breaking through the waves on the water surface, with waves splashing like snow on both sides. Without the above-mentioned qualities, would you dare to try? But this sport can produce high stimulation. In the thrilling flying slide, you feel a sense of ethereal pleasure, like a seagull skimming across the water surface.

This sport has not been widely developed because it is limited by the economic conditions of acquiring expensive equipment. A "waterskiing" enthusiast must have a pair of skis that are 18 centimeters wide and 2 meters long (priced at more than 30 US dollars), a 20-meter long tow rope, and a fast speedboat with a speed of at least 32 miles per hour. Therefore, even in the United States, only about 10,000 people can enjoy this noble sport.

### A Tree Grows in Brooklyn

— Sun Peihua

This is a good play adapted from Betty Smith's novel. The original is one of the bestsellers in the United States. In terms of the overall performance, "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" on the screen is not necessarily better than the original, but it is definitely not inferior to Miss Betty's novel, that is certain.

From the perspective of general Hollywood films, "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" deserves a higher evaluation, not only for its achievements in performance technology, but we should say: it more or less suggests; in this unreasonable society, spiritual or rather spiritual wealth is more valuable than anything else.

We come into contact with too many women like Katie. It should be said that she is also kind by nature, but the tragic life has tortured her physically and mentally so terribly, but this is not what she wants. However, she finally realized: how precious the warmth between people should be!

The whole film from beginning to end is full of this kind of sentimentalist atmosphere. Here, Katie's coldness and willfulness and her daughter's thoughtfulness and enthusiasm are a very obvious contrast. The playwright (adapter) puts these two completely opposite forces like electricity, connecting them to the common object, Jonah, and from Jonah's induction, causing all kinds of emotional sparks. This is an extremely sensitive and successful approach.

Director Elia Kazan is worthy of praise, because he handled the atmosphere of the whole play so well, to the point of simple technique and remaining events, (such as using only two or three shots to introduce the slum, etc.). In terms of actors, Peggy Ann Garner, the little girl who played Florence, is a remarkable child star. Although the role itself is easy to please, her deep psychological performance is really too rare. Other actors such as James Dunn and Dorothy McGuire, who played the Nolan couple, are also above standard.

If it is said that "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" also has shortcomings, then it is that it overemphasizes the so-called "sentimentalism", and has not deeply revealed the truth of social reality behind sentimentalism, so that all the misery and pain of real life are all covered up in "warm feelings", still dragging a vague tail, saying: Although the school tree has been sawed off, it will still grow new green shoots. This new green shoot is also new hope.
