### Foreign Minister Wang Discusses the Peace Treaty with Japan, Reaffirms China's Stance, Control Issues Discussed with MacArthur

(Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th) Before his departure on the afternoon of the 26th, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie told Allied reporters that China still expects the United States and the Soviet Union to respond to the "compromise plan" regarding the peace treaty with Japan. He stated that according to his "compromise plan," China would insist on retaining the veto power of the four major powers. China fought Japan for the longest time and suffered the most. It hopes that peace will have some guarantee. He does not believe that any of the four major powers will abuse the veto power in the peace conference with Japan. China has also tried to limit the veto power in the United Nations. Wang denied that his compromise plan would delay the convening date of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference. He stated that the compromise suggestion is intended to ensure that all countries participating in the Far East war are able to participate, and to make the future "peace treaty a true and lasting peace treaty." The United States' proposal to completely abolish the veto power and the Soviet Union's proposal that the foreign ministers of the four powers draft the peace treaty are both unacceptable to China. His compromise plan advocates for a majority vote of the eleven countries, which must include the four major powers. Wang, as the chief representative of China at the United Nations, discussed the difficulties of the United Nations, saying that unless the two major peace treaties with Germany and Japan are concluded, the tension within the United Nations cannot be reduced, nor can the member states be expected to restore their spirit of cooperation. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, he stated that China's policy is generally no different from that of the United States or other allied countries in basic aspects. We all believe that Japan should be economically self-sufficient. We all believe that non-military factories, and other industries that can be converted to military use, should be dismantled or strictly restricted. Furthermore, any differences of opinion regarding Japanese reparations can be resolved after thorough discussion at the peace conference. Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, Wang stated that China is currently unable to export or import large quantities, which is a major difficulty in promoting international trade. In addition, since the last war, China's international trade has been mostly handled by government agencies. The late arrival of Chinese trade representatives in Japan is not purely due to opposition from the general public to the restoration of trade relations between the two countries. Wang does not believe that the issue of Japanese immigration to China is economically serious. He pointed out that the number of Japanese immigrants to Northeast China is extremely small, which proves that the Japanese are unwilling to move far from their islands. The Chinese government does not intend to formulate immigration laws solely for economic reasons. Wang did not comment on how Japan would be controlled and supervised after the signing of the peace treaty, or for how long. However, he said that he had discussed this issue with MacArthur for an hour.

### Foreign Minister Wang Leaves Japan Today, Passes Through Shanghai in the Afternoon and Returns to Beijing

### Prosperity of Sino-Japanese Trade Awaits the Completion of Two Conditions, Japanese Reporters Praise Foreign Minister Wang's "Enlightenment"

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie took a car to Hakone, a famous scenic spot 60 miles southwest of Tokyo, on the morning of the 26th. Accompanying him were General Shang Zhen, Shen Jinding, and others. Wang held a press conference at the official residence of the Chinese mission here in the afternoon. Wang declined to comment on the DeMeyer mission report currently in the State Department's files, as he had not yet learned of its contents. At the same time, he remained silent about an article written by Bullitt advocating for a $1.3 billion loan.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie said at a reception for Japanese reporters on the evening of the 26th that Sino-Japanese trade can only prosper after Japan has been thoroughly democratized and China's production capacity has increased. After these two conditions are met, trade between the two countries will be the largest. Regarding the peace treaty and the international situation, Wang had already elaborated on his views at the reception for Allied reporters. At the reception for Japanese reporters, he reiterated his views, but also specifically stated that China still doubts whether Japan has truly gotten rid of the past warlords and aggressors in the short period after its surrender. However, whether China's doubts are correct is another question. Wang explained that after Japan's surrender, all demobilized officers and soldiers, regardless of the atrocities they committed during the long period of suffering in China, have safely returned home. China has no intention of retaliating for Japan's past actions, but is extremely concerned about Japan's future potential. China is concerned about whether Japan's militarism and aggressive nationalism have been eliminated, and the future relationship between the two countries will depend on this. Japanese reporters said that Wang's views explained some issues that the Japanese people had not previously understood. The reporters also praised Wang's "enlightening" meeting, believing that Wang's remarks could encourage the Japanese to strive for self-improvement, move towards democracy, and warn the Japanese that there is still much work to be done.

The abolition of the crime of disrespecting the Emperor is based on the democratic nature of the Japanese Constitution and abolishes special crimes. As for protecting speech and publication, this does not mean that bad publications are permitted. The abolition of the crime of adultery does not mean that it is recognized as legal. Adultery is morally improper, so it is recognized as a reason for divorce under civil law.

### List of Candidates for National Assembly from the Three Parties; Can be Submitted to the Election Headquarters by Month's End; Changes to the Overseas Chinese Election Method Resolved

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the candidates for the National Assembly submitted to the government by the Democratic and Youth Parties, those with dual-party membership (i.e., former Kuomintang members) have been permitted by both parties to have their candidate qualifications revoked and be replaced through supplementary elections. However, both parties stated that those who were so-called dual-party members before the National Assembly last year should not be investigated, while those who engaged in dual-party behavior after the National Assembly will have their candidate qualifications revoked. Consequently, the original deadline of the 26th of this month for submitting the list of party candidates to the National Election Headquarters cannot be met, and will inevitably be postponed. The date on which the Democratic and Youth Parties will submit their revised lists is currently unknown, but the Kuomintang hopes to submit their list within three days, so that a joint list from the three parties can be submitted to the election authorities before the end of the month.

[Further Telegram] The issue of overseas Chinese participation in elections has not yet yielded concrete results. The Overseas Chinese Election Office has reported to the General Election Headquarters the practical difficulties in conducting elections in various overseas Chinese communities, which has been forwarded to the National Government for instructions on how to proceed. The central government is still considering what method should be used for overseas Chinese to participate in the election. In order to uphold the principle of direct universal suffrage, voting by mail seems inappropriate, and exercising citizenship rights within the territory of other countries is also unfeasible. The central government may temporarily change the procedures for overseas Chinese elections, with the principle of not delaying the convening of the National Assembly on December 25th.

Editorial

### President Truman's Appeal

President Truman, in view of Europe's urgent need for aid and the alarming domestic inflation, decided to convene a special session of Congress on November 17th to jointly discuss the implementation of an emergency aid plan and curb rising domestic prices. Simultaneously, on the night of the 24th, he delivered a speech to the American people, clearly outlining the current domestic and international situation. On the one hand, he pointed out that the high cost of living in the United States was threatening domestic prosperity; on the other hand, he declared that the United States must provide assistance to alleviate the hunger and suffering of people overseas. Finally, he urged the entire nation to voluntarily conserve food to help those in need overseas.

The US government is so concerned about the hunger of the European people and will take immediate action to reduce the suffering of the European people. From a humanitarian standpoint, listening to President Truman's speech, one cannot help but think that this is good news for the European people. During the last war, European countries suffered greatly from the ravages of Nazi Germany, and were devastated by artillery fire. The material losses suffered cannot be estimated. France and Italy are especially impoverished, and their national economies and the people's livelihoods have reached the end of their rope. The lack of US dollars prevents them from importing domestic goods to maintain their minimum needs. The poverty of European countries after the war should have allowed them to concentrate on economic recovery, and avoid being caught up in the vortex of international disputes; but due to the evolution of the international situation after the war, it is impossible to seek the stability of the past. Therefore, some impoverished countries in Europe are still struggling in international disputes, which is truly a great tragedy for humanity.

It was generally expected that countries would suffer from hunger and cold after the war. Therefore, during the war, there was an initiative to organize the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA). After the war, UNRRA did play a role in relieving war-stricken countries, but it ultimately failed to save humanity from the sea of ​​suffering. UNRRA has long ended in Europe, and the hunger and cold of the European people remain the same. Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for Europe should logically be welcomed and applauded by the people of European countries, but it has encountered great obstacles due to international disputes, and has not yet been implemented, awaiting discussion by the US Congress. Now the US authorities are loudly calling for emergency aid to Europe. Considering the actual situation in Europe, it seems that there will be no further resistance. However, international disputes are still enough to create obstacles to President Truman's implementation of emergency aid to Europe. According to a United Press report from New York on the 26th, the Soviet Union will launch a full-scale diplomatic offensive against the United States, with the urgent goal of defeating Marshall's economic plan for Europe. Putting everything aside, let's just talk about the impoverished situation of European countries, which urgently need foreign aid. Now there is a wealthy country that is willing to provide assistance with a compassionate heart. If another country not only stands idly by, but also attempts to undermine it, no matter from which perspective, one feels that this behavior is immoral.

The crux of the European problem today can be summed up in one sentence: it is the struggle for leadership between the United States and the Soviet Union. This has created an incompatible situation. The United States and the Soviet Union hold opposing attitudes on any issue in Europe. Not to mention that the problems that have occurred in Europe after the war cannot be reasonably resolved; even the German peace treaty, which is of vital interest to all countries in the world, is still in a stalemate and cannot be broken. Moreover, the Soviet Union has already erected an iron curtain in Europe, not only preventing people outside the iron curtain from entering, but also preventing any activities within the iron curtain from being detected. After the war, the world hoped for the realization of "one world," especially for Europe; but due to the existence of the iron curtain, the confrontation between the two camps is even more obvious. Judging from the declaration issued by the new Communist International in Warsaw, the common goal of the communist parties of the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia is to oppose the US aid plan for Europe.

After Marshall's aid plan for Europe was announced, we had already seen the opposition in Soviet newspapers and magazines. In the eyes of the Soviet Union, American aid to Europe is tantamount to enslaving Europe. Whoever is willing to accept American aid is willing to be a slave of the United States. This argument was able to resonate with the communist parties of eight European countries, and under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the new Communist International was established, targeting the US financial offensive and launching a counterattack. Some countries within the iron curtain, controlled by the Soviet Union, have long been involuntary. It is not surprising that they participated in the new Communist International. However, the communist parties of France and Italy, ignoring the suffering of the people and the interests of France and Italy, also joined the new Communist International. No wonder they are being spurned by the people. The misguidedness of the communist parties of France and Italy is sufficient to prove that Europe is still at a crossroads today. What will happen in the future? Can't make a decisive decision yet? The hesitating attitude of some people in Europe does increase the concerns of the American people about the issue of aiding Europe.

However, we also want the United States, both government and people, to reflect on themselves. The poverty of European countries has reached its extreme. As the saying goes, "a hungry person easily becomes food, and a thirsty person easily becomes drink." Why do some European countries still hold a hesitant attitude towards American aid? Putting aside the factors of international disputes, the United States cannot but bear considerable responsibility. First of all, we want the American people to understand that the diplomatic style of the era of power politics should no longer exist after the end of World War II. In the minds of Americans, the outdated concept of "dollar diplomacy" should not exist, that is, "if I help you financially, you have to listen to me politically"; otherwise, European countries would rather starve to death than accept American aid. We firmly believe that American aid to Europe is purely out of human compassion, and does not contain any intention. However, in terms of diplomatic style, we still have to ask the US authorities to pay special attention. Taking the issue of American aid to China as an example, we also deeply feel the same pain.

In short, the winter in Europe is coming soon, and the tragic scene of hunger and cold will appear before humanity again. President Truman's call is indeed good news for the European people. But how can Marshall's aid plan for Europe be fully implemented? We only hope that the US Congress can immediately find a satisfactory solution.

### Kaohsiung Port: History and Current Status

Kaohsiung Port is the only excellent seaport in Taiwan and South China. When Director Zhang visited Kaohsiung Port 29 years ago, it was still called "Takow" and was under construction. Tracing back to the late Ming Dynasty, the Dutch occupied Beigang. After the Treaty of Tianjin in 1860, the British entered Kaohsiung via Xiamen, and established a customs office. The Germans also built a lighthouse on Shaochuantou Mountain. During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, they used high-pressure tactics to seize land and spent 40 years developing this only gateway in the south, ushering in the era of the sea and the Pacific era.

The area around the port of Kaohsiung is mostly plains, with a mild climate, mostly sunny and with little rain. Most of the heavy industry factories are located here. To the south of the port is a sandbar, 12 kilometers long and 200 meters wide, which is separated from the outer harbor, forming a natural breakwater. The area inside the port is 66,000 square meters. The port entrance is narrow, at 106 meters. During the war, the Japanese used it as a base for southward advancement, so it was 90% destroyed. After the restoration, the Port Authority salvaged 170 sunken ships, and cleared the port inside and out. Signals, buoys, floating barrels, docks, warehouses, cranes, port railways, and bridges have been mostly repaired and completed. Currently, it can simultaneously moor 29 ships under 10,000 tons. The warehouse can accommodate 124,000 tons of goods. From January to August of this year, 511 ships entered and exited, totaling 916,175 tons. Currently, port engineering is being actively strengthened. By the end of this year, ships under 10,000 tons are expected to be able to enter and exit freely, and the installation of night navigation equipment is underway. The port not only has to handle the import and export of local aluminum, alkalis, fertilizers, alkali manufacturing, shipbuilding, cement, kerosene, etc., but also the rich rice and fruits of southern Taiwan. In addition to supplying Taiwan's own use, it can also be exported in large quantities, especially sugar, which is the only export port for sugar, benefiting from the favorable weather conditions. In July of this year, the National Maritime Affairs Conference decided to make Kaohsiung an international trading port, handling domestic and foreign materials. Therefore, the Port Authority has now formulated a three-phase expansion plan to build a sound international trading port within two years. However, the port was severely damaged. After an inspection by an American expert, it was believed that even with the strong strength of the United States, its restoration would take more than three years. Therefore, it is necessary to change the fragmented view of the harbor and obtain the most generous economic assistance.

### Current Situation of Keelung Fertilizer Plant

First Factory: The most important manufacturing plant of Taiwan Fertilizer Company, located in Waiheshan, Keelung City, covering an area of 165.29 square meters. Important equipment includes two 6,000 KW generators, each with a daily output of 40 tons of calcium carbide, one air liquefaction machine, which can produce 1,000 cubic meters of hydrogen and 250 cubic meters of oxygen per hour, twelve chemical kilns, each with a daily output of 3.5 tons, and one lime kiln, with a daily output of 70 tons of lime. It was heavily bombed during the war, but has now been repaired. From next year, it is expected to produce 35,000 tons of calcium hydride annually, an increase of one-half compared to the Japanese occupation period.

Second Factory: Before the war, it produced sulfuric acid, potassium superphosphate, and other various compound fertilizers, with an annual output of 800 tons of concentrated sulfuric acid, 16,000 tons of calcium superphosphate, and 20,000 tons of various compound fertilizers. It was bombed during the war, and now only three pyrite piles remain, each burning 7,500 kilograms of pyrite ore per day. The equipment for manufacturing calcium phosphate has completely disappeared. After the takeover, repairs began in February last year, and sulfuric acid phosphate fertilizer was produced in August, with an annual output of 15,000 tons.

### Director Zhang's Speech in Keelung

[Continued from Page 1] When I came to Taiwan 29 years ago, I also stayed in Keelung for one night. The official residence I lived in at the time has now been destroyed by bombing. Today, recalling the past, I have many feelings. In the past half-century, Taiwanese compatriots have suffered from the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and Keelung City has been destroyed by war. Fortunately, Taiwan has now been restored, and you are now Chinese citizens who enjoy freedom and equality. Keelung is an important seaport in the Far East. Whether in peacetime in terms of economics, or in wartime in terms of military affairs, it has great value. Keelung suffered particularly great losses in this war, and that is the reason. In the future, we must rebuild Keelung City and make it an important naval port for our country."

### The Production Situation in Taiwan Described by Wei Daoming in a Radio Address

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming listed various important production figures in his radio broadcast yesterday afternoon, explaining the progress made in Taiwan Province in the two years since its restoration. According to Wei, although the sugar production in Taiwan reached a maximum of over one million tons during the Japanese occupation, production had completely fallen into dependence when we took over. This year, the production is expected to recover to over 300,000 tons. Tea production was only 1.43 million kilograms per year at the time of takeover. Electricity could only generate 43,000 kilowatts at the time of takeover, but this year it has increased to 210,000 kilowatts. Coal production was only 14,000 tons per month at the time of takeover, but this year it has increased to 110,000 tons per month, with an annual output of over 1.3 million tons. Cement production was only 60,000 tons per year at the time of takeover, but it has now increased to 160,000 tons per year. Pineapple production was only 26,800 tons at the time of takeover, but this year it is expected to reach over 42,600 tons. The above are all more important production industries. Other aspects, such as transportation and roads, have also made significant progress.

### Xia Wei Talks About the Battle Situation in Anhui

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 26th] Our reporter recently interviewed Commander Xia Wei in Hefei and asked about the recent situation in the central and western Anhui war zones. According to him: (1) In the past ten days, only Qianshan and Taihu counties in central and western Anhui are still in the hands of the bandits, and the rest have been recovered. About a thousand bandits once reached the vicinity of Wangjiang, but only a very few smuggled across the river due to the river blockade. (2) Chen Yi's bandit troops returned from eastern Anhui to the south bank of the Yellow River to receive winter clothing from the bandits on the north bank and will continue to be stationed south of the Yellow River. (3) Although Liu's bandits are temporarily using the Dabie Mountains as a respite, the conditions for staying there for a long time are insufficient. Therefore, they often take advantage of opportunities to harass. At present, the pacification area's military force is very familiar with the geography around the Dabie Mountains. Fighting with them can suppress their arrogance.

### Bai Chongxi Broadcasts: The Meaning of Islamic Loyalty and Filial Piety

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Bai Chongxi, Chairman of the National Islamic Association, broadcast the meaning and hope of the "Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival" to Muslims nationwide from the Central Broadcasting Station at 8 p.m. on the 25th, which was the World Islamic "Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival." He briefly stated, "The 'Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival' can also be translated as the 'Sacrifice Festival' or the 'Festival of Sacrifice.' The Sacrifice Festival is for Muslims worldwide to commemorate the great acts of loyalty and filial piety of the Prophet Ibrahim, who obeyed the Lord's command, and Isma'il, who obeyed his father. According to the factual meaning, interpreted using Chinese ethical concepts and terms, it is a grand event of loyalty and filial piety within the family of the Holy Ancestor Ibrahim, who 'regarded command as life,' and Isma'il, who 'regarded death as returning home.' Therefore, the Chinese Islamic Association translated it as the Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival to make the meaning clearer. The meaning of loyalty is very broad, such as loyalty to the Lord, loyalty to the leader, loyalty to the country, loyalty to one's duties, loyalty to the people, loyalty to friends, and so on. We need to be loyal at all times and in all places in our dealings with people and in our lives, so 'loyalty' is the foundation of our lives. Secondly, those who can be filial to their parents can be friendly to their siblings, and then they can develop the great call to 'respect the elderly as we respect our own, and cherish the young as we cherish our own,' and the great beginning of human compassion, peace, sincere unity, and treating everyone equally. Therefore, 'filial piety' is the foundation of managing the family. Only by cultivating oneself and managing the family can one talk about governing the country and bringing peace to the world. Moreover, only those who can fulfill filial piety can fulfill loyalty. In ancient China, loyal ministers were always selected from the families of filial sons, which has a very profound meaning. Therefore, the meaning of filial piety is expanded, and it is still loyalty. The two words loyalty and filial piety are inseparable. Therefore, the Quran instructs 'filial piety to parents' as second only to 'serving the Lord.' Loyalty and filial piety should be the common ethical principles of mankind. I can say that if mankind does not practice the teachings of loyalty and filial piety, there will be no world, let alone a nation. Now, there is a group of armed rebellious bandits who disobey the orders of the supreme leader, destroy national unity, disturb local security, and put our compatriots throughout the country in dire straits. This is unfilial to the nation, and we should eliminate them. I hope that all Muslims across the country, based on the teachings of loyalty and filial piety, will bear the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country with a spirit of sacrifice."

### Post-War Germany: Visiting the German Delegate to the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference

— Our Reporter Hong Xucai

In the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference held in Hangzhou, there was a German delegate, Ms. Cai Nake. She was the only representative from a defeated country because Japan, although also invited to the conference, was unable to attend due to opposition from the Eastern Control Commission. Undoubtedly, Ms. Cai will become the center of the news, but she is the most silent and lonely representative in the entire venue. A Mexican delegate told the reporter: "Her eyes are big and round, her pupils are dull, and her voice is low and hoarse. German women are really pitiful!"

On the night of the 21st of this month, after discovering her residence, I quietly ran to the Xileng Hotel to visit her. This was the smallest room in the hotel. Besides a bed and a table and chairs, there was no space left. Under the dim light, I saw Ms. Cai's gray hair and dry, wrinkled forehead. I estimated that she was an old woman over fifty years old.

After I explained my purpose, she immediately received me very politely and invited me to sit on the edge of the bed. She began to tell me why Germans were spending their bleak years in hardship. She said: "We are poor! We are hungry! After we eat breakfast every day, we will never have lunch and dinner again. It is a miracle for Germans today if they are not hungry for a day." Her tone was unusually hoarse and anxious, and she was interrupted from time to time by severe coughing, but she always tried to suppress it and described:

Germany is under the rule of the Soviet, U.S., French, and British four countries, and the entire territory has been divided into four parts. People cannot move freely. There is a housing shortage, coal shortage, and food shortage everywhere in Germany. Therefore, no part is allowed to move people in, resulting in wives and children being separated, and many families cannot reunite. After the great bombing of Germany, there are very few complete houses left. Some people are temporarily sheltering with relatives, but now they cannot go back. Ms. Cai came from Berlin. Berlin is now the location of the Allied headquarters, so the housing shortage is even more serious. People mostly use broken walls to shelter from the wind and rain. In addition, the climate is extremely cold. In the office during the day, the ink freezes for up to six hours. Because there was no coal last winter, those who were frozen to death alive, in Berlin alone, reached more than 1,500 people. She said: "I will never forget that one late night last winter, I vaguely heard trembling cries for help nearby. The next morning, two women were frozen to death."

The reporter really didn't want to hear more of these tragic stories. I interrupted her and asked her to talk about the living conditions of women during the war. She said angrily: Hitler's contempt for women was obvious. Before the war, he regarded women as tools for reproduction and stipulated that each family should have no fewer than four children. The father's salary must be based on the number of children, forcing women to return to the kitchen. When the war started, he conscripted all men over seventeen to fight, and women had to do all the hard work.

Ms. Cai is the chairman of the German Young Women's Christian Association, so the reporter asked if the Young Women's Christian Association had also been destroyed under Hitler's rule. Her answer was: "Only the freedom to read the Bible and pray." Thirty-five percent of the German people are Christians, but they are not allowed to have any organizations, and they do not even have the freedom for three people to walk on the road together. Ms. Cai was arrested several times and interrogated for several days and nights. One female youth association executive was sentenced to prison for talking about her dislike of war on the road.

At this time, her emotions gradually became agitated, and her voice became even more hoarse. She said word by word: "The suffering and torment that the German people endured under Nazi rule is beyond your imagination. When Berlin was heavily bombed, we did not sleep for forty days and nights. The scene was like a hurricane, like a volcanic eruption, like the sky was about to collapse. I simply cannot describe how terrifying it was..."

The reporter asked: "Do you believe that Hitler is really dead?"

She answered affirmatively: "One hundred percent, I am absolutely sure. This kind of person cannot live in this world now."

The reporter asked again: "Winter is approaching, will the situation in Berlin this winter improve?"

She shrugged her shoulders and shook her head, answering: "I don't know, but we pray day and night and believe that God will allow us to live."

She suddenly looked up at the sky. The waning moon was hanging high, and the cold air was coming from outside the window. It was late, and I said "good night" to this old woman, and returned with a heavy heart, stepping on the withered yellow leaves.

### The Soviet Union Resists Important International Activities: No Underlying Concerns in the United Nations; The Soviet Union Will Not Withdraw From the Alliance in the Short Term; However, Eastern European Countries May Withdraw From the United Nations Sooner or Later

(United Press International, New York, 26th) Some representatives of the United Nations and diplomatic observers who have been paying attention to the United Nations since the beginning of the San Francisco Conference have recently reached the same point of view, that is, the Soviet Union is in fact "gradually withdrawing from the United Nations." However, in the foreseeable future, it will not formally abandon its membership. The Soviet Union will remain in the United Nations for as long as possible in order to use this international organization as a tool to explore ideas. At the same time, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries are gradually refusing to participate in the special activities of the United Nations. This policy can be called "technical resistance." As a result, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries refuse to participate in the four major plans of the United Nations and resist several important subsidiary activities. The Soviet Union has refused to participate in the Trusteeship Council for a year, on the grounds that the draft trusteeship agreement was not consulted with the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union does not agree to participate in the implementation of the draft. The Soviet Union also stated that the trusteeship agreement does not give non-independent people the opportunity to reach the stage of autonomy. Secondly, the Soviet Union and Poland bluntly refused to participate in the Balkan investigation team passed by the Economic and Political Committee and approved by the General Assembly. The investigation team is still waiting for these two countries, but they will never participate. The two countries and other Eastern European countries will never cooperate with the investigation team. Thirdly, the Soviet Union also has a seat on the small committee drafting the charter of the "Small General Assembly" that meets throughout the year to discuss peace and security issues, but the Soviet Union also refuses to participate and insists that the plan for the Small General Assembly is "illegal and contrary to the United Nations Charter." The Soviet Union and its satellite countries refused to have any connection with it. Fourthly, the Soviet Union has stated that it will resist the Korean Committee, whose task is to monitor the elections in South Korea and the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops. Under the current situation, the General Assembly will pass this U.S. proposal. If so, another institution that the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate with will be added. It is reported that the United States will eventually establish a government in South Korea and equip it with troops to defend against pro-Soviet groups in the Soviet-controlled area of North Korea. Although no one (including Americans) hopes to split Korea, it is generally recognized that under the current situation, this will be a logical result. In addition to resisting important institutions of the United Nations, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries also refuse to participate in several subsidiary organizations. The Soviet Union has long refused to participate in the Geneva International Trade Bureau Conference and announced last Saturday that it would refuse to participate in the Havana Trade Conference convened by the Trade Bureau at the end of the year. The Soviet Union resists the League of Nations Refugee Bureau and refuses to cooperate with other United Nations-related groups. However, most representatives believe that the Soviet Union will never abandon its United Nations membership unless the East and West groups are completely split and forced to do so. The reason why the Soviet Union does not withdraw from the alliance is that, in addition to intending to use the United Nations as a forum to express its views, there is also a major consideration, that is, no one dares to be the culprit for shattering the world's dreams. Although it is generally believed that the Soviet Union has become an opposing force to most countries in the United Nations, one day the Soviet Union, either voluntarily or passively, will break away from the world organization and stand on its own.

### The United Nations General Assembly Becomes a Battlefield: The Soviet Union Launches an Offensive Against the United States; Pan Youxin Is Instructed to Coordinate With the New Strategy

(United Press International, New York, October 26) The Soviet Union has now launched a full-scale diplomatic offensive against the United States on a global scale. The debates in the current General Assembly are becoming increasingly intense, and Soviet propaganda in Europe has also been widely launched. The initial goals of the Soviet diplomatic offensive have been frankly clarified by Politburo member Zhdanov. He seems to be the spokesman for the Soviet ideological circles after the war and represented the Soviet Union at the Warsaw Conference of Communist Parties of Nine European Countries. He said: The urgent goal of Soviet foreign policy is to defeat the Marshall Plan for European economic assistance. Soviet diplomatic representatives are now fully active. The main speaker of Soviet propaganda is Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly. His main assistants, Gromyko, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky (Manuilsky was once one of the persons in charge of the Communist International, which was dissolved in 1943), and other figures have all given endless speeches. Moscow's decision to send Pan Youxin as the ambassador to the United States is also related to this full-scale offensive. Pan Youxin is a newcomer in the Soviet diplomatic circles. He has only been in the diplomatic circles for six or seven years. From 1939 to 1944, he served as the ambassador to China. Later, he returned to his country due to illness. After recovering from his illness, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Judging from Zhdanov's statement in Poland and Vyshinsky's speech in Success Lake, it is clear that the Soviet Union is impatient to adopt a diplomatic defensive position in the "Cold War."

(United Press, Beiping, 26th) Foreigners familiar with Pan Youxin here unanimously welcomed the appointment of Pan Youxin, the former Soviet ambassador to China, as the ambassador to the United States, but were also surprised. These people believe that Pan is not a stern person, and has a humble personality, and does not have the special characteristics of a diplomat, and has the demeanor of a university professor. He is serious on the surface, but never arrogant.

### China Proposes Suggestions for the Establishment of a Small General Assembly: Limited to Dealing With Situational Issues

[Central News Agency, New York, October 25] China and France jointly suggested in the United Nations that the "Small General Assembly" should not consider all "dispute" issues, because "situations" are not as urgent as "disputes." Gu Weijun, the acting chief representative of China, told the drafting committee today that "if the proposed Small General Assembly is granted the power to consider issues related to 'disputes,' it may arouse doubts about the real purpose of establishing the Small General Assembly. Ambassador Gu also asked, "If the Small General Assembly considers issues related to disputes, will it be possible to lower the moral status of the General Assembly. Gu said that the Small General Assembly he envisioned is mainly an institution for implementing the resolutions of the entire General Assembly. Although its responsibilities will include issues related to disputes, it shall not accept such issues until after the General Assembly has discussed them.

### The United Nations Committee of Three Arrives in Batavia From Australia: Indonesia Refuses Dutch Planes to Land in Yogyakarta

(United Press International, Batavia, 26th) Nine members of the United Nations Tripartite Committee mediating between Indonesia and the Netherlands flew to Batavia from Sydney this afternoon. Representatives from the Dutch and Indonesian governments and the government of East Indonesia welcomed them. No representatives from the government of the Republic of Indonesia were at the airport to welcome them.

(United Press International, Batavia, 26th) Aneta News Agency reported that the Dutch and Indonesian governments broadcast yesterday that 17 military liaison officers on the Indonesian side were detained by the Dutch side when the war broke out. Therefore, they requested that the Indonesian Republican government allow a Dutch plane to land in Yogyakarta and return the 17 officers. The Indonesian government has instructed Prime Minister Gani in Batavia on the 26th to inform the Dutch side that it is in fact rejecting the Dutch proposal and stating that the International Red Cross can handle the matter.

### The Soviet Union May Propose That Allied Forces Withdraw From Germany

(United Press International, London, 26th) According to British authoritative sources, the Soviet Union may propose the withdrawal of Allied troops from Germany at the November foreign ministers' conference. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw troops is an attempt to win world public opinion's sympathy for Soviet policy. It is said that the Soviet Union's recent proposal that Allied forces withdraw from Korea has already gained goodwill. The British side said that whether in Korea or Germany, after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, there will be strong pro-Soviet political organizations active in these areas.

### Bavaria Passes Anti-War Law

(United Press International, Munich, 25th) The Bavarian parliament today unanimously passed a law allowing people to refuse to participate in combat, either actively or passively.

### Anti-Communist Forces Still Exist in the Soviet-Occupied Zone of Germany

### The British Representative Frankly Advises the Soviet Union: Should Abandon Narrow-Minded Ideas; The War Criminals Case Will Be Put to a Vote Today

(United Press International, Success Lake, 25th) The United Nations Political Committee held its first test vote on the Soviet Union's proposal against war criminals today. As a result, 29 votes against 12 votes rejected the submission of the case to the drafting committee. The four Latin American countries, India, and Abyssinia joined the Soviet Union as a minority group. The case will be formally voted on Monday, and representatives expect that there is no hope for it to pass.

(United Press International, Success Lake, 25th) Britain today accused the Soviet Union of "poisoning" the atmosphere of the United Nations and demanded a clear answer. Is the Soviet Union still unable to satisfy its sense of security after controlling the area from the Elbe River to Vladivostok in Europe and Asia? British representative McNeil asked Soviet leaders to abandon their "policy of hatred" at the General Assembly.

He said that if the Soviet Union needs peace, it should believe that non-communists are not equal to fascists, and monopoly capitalists are not equal to guerrillas. McNeil made this statement in the final stage of the Western countries' fight against the Soviet Union's proposal to condemn war criminals. McNeil asked Vyshinsky to withdraw his proposal. This young diplomat is the second most important person in the British Foreign Office. He believes that if the Soviet people have the opportunity to express their views through freedom of the press, the chances of a new war will be greatly reduced. In general discussions, the United States strongly opposed the General Assembly passing any mild resolution, because the United States believes that any resolution will make the Soviet Union think that it has won another victory, and any resolution will be equal to admitting that the Western powers do have the suspicion of spreading war propaganda. Zhinsky is now preparing to make a final attack.

### "Truth News" Has No News, "News News" Has No Truth

(Reuters, Success Lake, 25th) The Political Committee of the General Assembly continued to debate the Soviet Union's proposed "war criminals" resolution. The British and South African representatives both strongly criticized the Soviet Union's propaganda methods. British representative McNeil said that he strongly opposed Vyshinsky's use of the "scissors and paste" method to distort the meaning of newspaper texts out of context. But if the Soviet Union likes to use such methods, then he will retaliate with the same methods. So McNeil cited the remarks of the Soviet newspapers to prove that the Soviet newspapers did their best to distort the remarks of British representative Crow and other representatives in the United Nations institutions. He also said, "I, representing the British journalists, solemnly deny the claim that British journalists are engaged in false reporting. Vyshinsky is very good at using Russian idioms. I know a Russian idiom, which is 'Truth News' has no news, 'News News' has no truth."

### The Definition of War Criminal Changes With the Seasons

McNeil also defended Turkey and felt deeply disgusted by Vyshinsky's disrespect for etiquette in attacking Turkish representative Saber. Strong countries should never use such methods to attack smaller countries, thus increasing the already existing misunderstandings. Everyone knows that Turkey, while actively developing a democratic system, is also resisting the Soviet Union, which has launched large-scale economic operations, with remarkable courage. When talking about the issue of war propaganda, McNeil also asked for a clear definition of war criminals. McNeil pointed out here that Molotov delivered a speech after the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty in 1939, accusing the Allied countries of launching an imperialist war against Germany. He also pointed out that just when Britain and France were fighting a desperate battle with Germany, Molotov also accused the leaders of the British and French socialist parties, such as Roy and Blum, of being war promoters. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's definition of war criminals changes with the seasons.

### The United States Celebrates Navy Day: Weapons and Tactics Will Be Completely Innovated

(United Press International, Washington, 27th) Today is U.S. Navy Day. The Navy authorities are now planning to implement a fundamental revolution in the Navy's 172-year history, designing new warships, weapons, and tactics. There are three main points: studying the method of submarine diving for battleships, equipping rockets with atomic bombs, supersonic aircraft, and clearing the sky when necessary. The problem of supersonic tactics is particularly important. The Department of the Navy has invented a digital automatic algorithm to solve this problem, but because it is strictly confidential, the details are unknown.

### French Municipal Elections See Second Round of Voting: De Gaulle Still Holds Advantage; Herriot Re-elected Mayor of Lyon Again

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 26th Broadcast: Paris dispatch: The municipal elections in approximately nine thousand French towns and villages are expected to conclude today. De Gaulle's "People's Rally" still holds a dominant position, overshadowing the Communist Party. According to recent statistics, they have obtained approximately 40% of the total votes. The French Railway Workers' Association will convene on Monday, determined to achieve an 11% wage increase. The Central Association of Civil Servants will propose a general strike. The aforementioned organizations are all affiliated with the Labor Confederation led by the Communist Party. The workers' obstinate attitude seems to have a negative impact on the Communist Party's election campaign.

(United Press Paris, 26th) Municipal elections are being held on the 26th in 14,000 small towns in France with populations under 9,000. French law stipulates that an absolute majority is required to win in small towns. The election on the 26th is a choice by the townspeople from the candidates who received the most votes in the preliminary election last Sunday. In the brisk autumn breeze, the French people are in high spirits, participating in the political battle. The Communist Party and the De Gaulle faction are fighting to the death, while the Socialist Party is trying its best to improve its position between the two parties. Political observers predict that of the 1,700 mayors who were Communists in the previous municipal elections, the Communist Party, despite extensive publicity in the countryside this time, fears losing half of its mayoral seats due to the traditional conservatism of French farmers. National Assembly President Herriot was re-elected as Mayor of Lyon on the 26th, a position he has held for over 20 years.

### Ramadier Government Facing Serious Crisis; Parliament to Reconvene Tomorrow to Decide Its Fate

[Reuters Paris, 25th] The French National Assembly has been summoned to discuss the threats to French institutions and internal peace, as claimed by Prime Minister Ramadier. It will reconvene on Tuesday, 16 days earlier than scheduled. Prime Minister Ramadier has already reorganized his cabinet to more firmly resist pressure for wage increases and implement austerity measures. The situation the National Assembly will face is increasingly urgent due to the following two major developments: the establishment of the Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade, the French Communist Party's intensified opposition to the government, and the widespread demands for wage increases by the General Confederation of Labor controlled by the Communist Party; the increasingly acute dollar crisis; and the emergence of the People's Unity Movement led by De Gaulle. However, this complex and delicate political situation cannot be prolonged. From the government's point of view, if it wants to clarify the situation, it must take affirmative and resolute measures.

### British Admiralty Publishes Hitler's Secret Plan: Planned to Deal with the United States and the Soviet Union Separately

(Associated Press London, 25th) The British Admiralty today released a report stating that Hitler personally ordered the German Navy in 1941 to avoid all incidents with the American fleet, intending to avoid war with the United States until after defeating the Soviet Union. Hitler even wanted to postpone operations in the Atlantic after President Roosevelt expanded American naval activity to Iceland. Even after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hitler still intended to avoid open conflict. The materials for the Admiralty report were obtained from German archives captured during the war. It revealed that Hitler was extremely confident in conquering the Soviet Union, believing that the Soviet Union could be defeated by the end of September 1941. After the end of the Eastern Front battle, he could seize the opportunity to take severe action against the United States.

### Bulgarian Fatherland Front Issues a Declaration Criticizing Britain and the United States

(Associated Press, Bulgarian Capital, 25th) The Fatherland Front Committee recently issued a declaration stating: The countries of the world have formed two major camps, one being the imperialist camp and the other the anti-imperialist or democratic camp. The former is led by the United States, aiming to economically and politically subdue countries devastated and impoverished by war, stifle their democracy, and rebuild the rule of reactionary and fascist forces. Bulgaria is bound by Greece and Turkey, and those countries have been transformed into bases for British imperialists, posing a constant threat to the independence and security of our country and other democratic countries in the Balkans.

Who is a friend and who is an enemy, every honest citizen can clearly understand today. The people remember the unfair interference of British and American imperialists in the Bulgarian parliamentary elections in 1945. At the Paris Peace Conference, they repeatedly adopted a hostile attitude towards Bulgaria. Their behavior in the Greek international investigation team and their rude intervention in the case of the Bulgarian national traitor, Petkov, have all revealed their true colors. In view of the above-mentioned international situation, the Fatherland Front Committee and all parties within the Front unanimously declare that Bulgaria's major interests are fully aligned with the anti-imperialist camp led by the great Soviet Union.

### Suspected Embezzlement in Auction of Enemy Property; District Attorney's Office Indicts Four Customs Officials

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The warehouse of Ruichang Hardware Store at No. 340 Dengtu Road was originally a secret warehouse of the Japanese, containing a large amount of materials. After the victory, it was taken over by the Third Front Army and handed over to the Bureau for Handling Puppet Properties, which then transferred it to the Customs for auction. It was discovered that a large amount of materials were missing. After three people, including Sun Zhuting, filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office, the suspects, including Lu Shishang, were repeatedly summoned by the District Attorney's Office. The investigation was concluded the day before yesterday, and four people were indicted: Qian Zongqi, Deputy Commissioner of Customs; Huang Guojie, a detained Customs official; Lin Xuequ; and He Hengshan, who has repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned. According to the prosecutor's investigation, the Customs auction of materials on Dengtu Road advertised over 2,000 tons of pig iron, but only over 900 tons were sold, with over 1,000 tons missing. Huang Guojie and others involved are suspected of embezzlement. They are prosecuted under Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs; Liu Gongyun, former Director of the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties; Chen Shouzhi, Chief of the Audit and Award Section; and Wu Rencang, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, are not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of crime. Lu Shishang, former head of the Materials Group of the Third Front Army, and Xie Meng, who was responsible for handing over the materials on Dengtu Road, are highly suspected, but because they have military status, they should be investigated by military authorities in accordance with the law. The District Attorney's Office will report this to the Capital Judicial Administration Department and forward a letter to the National Defense Department for interrogation.

Shortly after, officers from the Fuyou Road Police Station, under the Yimiao Police Precinct, arrived upon receiving the report. They urgently summoned a vehicle to transport the injured man to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. He only managed to say: "My name is Shen Xingbin, in my thirties, from Huzhou. The perpetrators are Xu Xinglin, Zhang Asan, and Shen A'er, all three working as cooks at the Hero Harmonica Factory on Qiaojia Road in the city," and so on. He eventually succumbed to his severe injuries around 11:00 AM yesterday. Upon receiving the report, Deputy Precinct Chiefs Shen and Chen of the Yimiao Police Precinct immediately ordered Criminal Division Chief Zhou Nan to investigate. Investigator Jia Wenlin, Sergeant Bai Qingxiang, and officers Hong Yucheng, Zhang Minghui, Li Xuehuai, and Liu Zhicheng went to the scene of the crime, where they found:

A Finger

and a wire mesh bag left behind by the deceased, containing soap and other items, which they took to the precinct as evidence. They then went to the accounting office of the Shanghai Harmonica Factory at No. 110 Qiaojia Road to check the employee roster, which confirmed the existence of Xu Xinglin, who had been introduced to the factory as a food service worker by Wei Chensan. They summoned Wei for questioning, who stated: Xu accompanied his fellow villager Shen Xingbin to the North Railway Station before dawn and had not yet returned. Xu had a friend working at the Huacheng Can Factory at No. 61, Lane 68, Chengdu Road. The officers accompanied Wei to the factory to investigate, but

To No Avail

They then went with Wei to the residence of Xu's friend, Shen Hongren, at No. 4, Garden Village, Luban Road, and from Shen's place, they called Wei's cousin, Ms. Yang, who worked as a maid at No. 3, Lane 61, Fuxing Middle Road, to ask if Xu had been there. She replied that he was. The officers immediately drove over and apprehended Xu Xinglin, Zhang Asan, and Shen A'er all together, bringing them to the precinct for interrogation. Xu confessed to the murder of Shen Xingbin, stating: "Shen Xingbin and I are both from Daozhen, Huzhou. During the first month, we played pai gow for money, and my nephew, Asan, and I lost, so I borrowed 30,000 yuan from Shen.

Never Returning Home

Unexpectedly, Shen came to Shanghai from our hometown on the 23rd and demanded 15,000 yuan from me at the harmonica factory, insisting on calculating it based on the price of rice, requiring no less than one dan. I negotiated with him to return home on the 11th to settle the matter, but Xu refused, saying that if I didn't pay, he would burn down my house. After he said that, he left. The next day, Zhang Asan, Shen A'er, and I discussed that he had also taken advantage of them, so we decided that we should strike first. If we didn't kill him,

We Would Be Harmed By Him

On the afternoon of the 25th, Shen came to the factory again, saying he was taking the early train home tomorrow and asking if I had the money. I told him I was sure to pay him in November, but he said he wouldn't agree to November. I held back my anger at the time, being very polite and accommodating, and let him stay at my place. At around 4:00 AM yesterday, he got up to go to the station to catch the train. Zhang, Shen, and I pretended to escort him to the station, with Zhang Asan taking a cleaver and hiding it on his person. On the way, Zhang handed the knife to me. When we reached the entrance of No. 64 Anren Street, I aimed at Xu's head, intending to

Raise the Knife and Strike Down

Unexpectedly, he turned around and snatched the knife away, slashing at Zhang Asan, causing a slight cut on Zhang's right thumb. Then, I struggled to regain the knife, and with the assistance of Zhang and Shen, we held his hands and repeatedly slashed at his head, face, limbs, and other areas more than ten times, until he collapsed to the ground, barely alive. We hurriedly fled towards Yangjiashan Alley, not daring to return to the factory. In the afternoon, we went together to Zhang Yang's place, intending to borrow money to sneak back to our hometown in Huzhou, but unexpectedly, we were apprehended," and so on. The entire case, from its occurrence to the arrest of all the perpetrators, took only ten hours, which can be considered swift.

### Police Officers Abuse Power, Destroy Local Autonomy, and Lead a Crowd to Demolish the Bao Office

The joint office building of the 40th and other five Bao (neighborhood units) in the Xincheng District was previously demolished by police officer Song Shaomei of the Laozha Police Bureau, who abused his power and led a crowd. This has aroused anger among residents throughout the district. The district's residents' representative council has resolved to request that the city councilors from the district, Yu Chuanding, Zhu Yakui, Chen Gongda, and Tang Shichang, submit a request to the Municipal Council to forward it to the Municipal Government and the Police Bureau for investigation and to severely punish the illegal acts in court.

### Cotton Field Area in Pudong Expands; Cotton Ginning and Spinning Factories Improve

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the drizzling rain, accompanied by Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, and Hu Jingliang, Director of the Cotton Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, we set off for Pudong to tour the cotton fields, cotton ginning factories, and spinning mills in the area for an entire day. From 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM, for ten hours, bouncing around in a jeep, we only managed to visit Yangsi, Zhoupu, Nanhui, and Xinchang, seeing one spinning mill, four cotton ginning factories, and some scattered cotton fields.

When the jeep crossed the Tangqiao ferry, the first destination was the Hengda Spinning Mill in Yangsi District. This factory has a history of 27 years. The factory buildings are still new, and the machines are Lowell models from 1919. It currently has 21,600 spindles, with 18,000 spindles in operation, producing an average of 0.8 pounds of yarn every ten hours. It is currently planning to completely retrofit with Chinese standard large drafting equipment by the end of the year. The retrofitting cost is 400,000 Legal Tender (fabi) per spindle. The factory expects to install 10,000 new spindles of the 1947 English Smelly brand before the autumn of next year. Currently, its cotton yarn products are mainly six-count, sixteen-count, and twenty-count yarns under the Red Airplane and Color Airplane brands. At the beginning of this year, it added 400 new weaving machines, with 60 currently in trial operation, producing 12-pound fine cloth. It is expected to have all machines in operation by the end of next year.

The four cotton ginning factories we visited were the Hengyuan Cotton Ginning Factory in Yangsi District, the Zhengchang Cotton Ginning Factory in Zhoupu, the Shenjiu Cotton Ginning Factory in Nanhui, and the Rongchang Cotton Ginning Factory in Xinchang. The Shenjiu Cotton Ginning Factory is worth mentioning. In addition to its existing old factory, it has built a new factory and purchased a complete set of the latest American-style airflow saw ginning machines. Each of these American 32-inch diameter ginning machines has a capacity equivalent to 40 of our domestic roller ginning machines with the same diameter. Its characteristic is that from the intake of seed cotton to the packaging stage, all operations are done by machine. Lint, cottonseed, and hulls can all be automatically separated and collected, without requiring much manual labor. This entire set of ginning machines has now been installed and is expected to be test-run within about three weeks. The maximum daily ginning capacity can produce 2,000 dan of lint. It can be called the most advanced new cotton ginning equipment in the country.

Regarding cotton production, the total production in Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, and other places this year is estimated to be about 250,000 dan. According to cotton merchants, this year's harvest is good, with an increase of 30% compared to last year. However, compared to the pre-war annual production of 600,000 dan, it is still significantly lower. Nanhui accounts for the largest share of the production, about half of the total, followed by Fengxian, with Chuansha having the least. The improved cotton varieties from the Cotton Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry were also promoted in Guangdong Province for the first time this year. In Fengxian and Zhoupu, 7,000 mu were planted with Kezi cotton, and in Chuansha and Nanhui, 8,000 mu were planted with Dezi cotton, totaling 15,000 mu. It is estimated that these improved cotton varieties can produce 5,000 dan.

The highest price for seed cotton was 740,000 yuan per dan, and yesterday's price was 635,000 yuan. Based on this price, lint is worth 3,300,000 yuan per dan. Improved cotton fetches a price that is 30% higher than this. Based on these prices, the profit from growing cotton is much higher than that from growing rice. Therefore, it is generally estimated that the cotton field area will increase significantly next year.

[Our Newspaper's Report] William, Taiaff, the Head of the Personnel Department of the US Embassy, went missing after practicing flying a small plane at Hongqiao Airport at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. A search was conducted throughout the night. At 7:00 AM yesterday, the Chinese Air Force finally located him 30 miles southwest of Nanjing. Fortunately, both the person and the plane were safe. According to William, he lost his way after flying out of Shanghai and was forced to land in the countryside.

### City's Land Tax Approved for Reduction; Grain Price Conversion Standard to be Determined by the Ministry

The city's land tax for this year, after the city government submitted a request to the central government for a reduction, has been approved by the Ministry of Food to be reduced to 2.16 dou (unit of dry measure) per mu (unit of area), consisting of 1.2 dou in actual grain, 0.6 dou in requisitioned grain, and 0.36 dou in public grain. It was also stipulated that the conversion standard for the land tax should be calculated based on the grain prices during June and July of this year. However, the city government believes that it should be converted based on the grain prices of the two months before the tax collection, i.e., the average price of August and September of this year. The Finance Bureau has now drafted the conversion standard for this year's land tax.

### Car Fueling Temporarily Follows Previous Method

[Our Newspaper's Report] Before a method for tiered allocation of fuel to automobiles is decided, the Public Utilities Bureau will continue to handle fuel distribution to cars in the city according to the original method. It has been decided to issue car fueling permits for November starting from October 30th. However, each fueling permit will indicate the car's tier so that the tiered allocation method can be implemented once it is decided.

### A Terrifying Profession: Beautifying Female Corpses - Conversation with Ms. Huang of Leyuan Funeral Home

[Our Newspaper's Report] There is a Ms. Huang at Leyuan Funeral Home, around thirty years old, with a charming demeanor. She wears a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, is dressed very demurely, and acts very gently, like a female teacher. She often sits in the accounting room by the switchboard, answering calls for people. People think she is an ordinary female employee of the funeral home, but she is actually highly skilled. Her job is to specifically clean, make up, and inject disinfectant into female corpses. Whether it is day or night, she is always alone in a small room, facing the corpses, undressing and dressing them, bathing and making them up, never asking for help. This kind of work is not open to viewing. She is the only woman in the funeral home, so she handles women's affairs by herself. Sometimes, when business is busy, three or four female clients arrive in a row. Ms. Huang bustles around, washing and cleansing their faces, applying powder and rouge, and dressing them up like jade flowers. When they are laid out in the mourning hall, everyone says their complexions are lifelike and their beauty is no less than in their prime. Who would know that this is Ms. Huang's hard work? It is said that once, when two female corpses arrived at the same time, one was being made up when her body suddenly twitched, her eyes seemed to open, and her lips moved. Someone timid would have been frightened out of their wits. Ms. Huang looked at her calmly, and she stopped moving. Upon closer examination, she was already completely dead and there was no hope of revival, so she ignored it. It is said that there was indeed an old lady who came back to life in her hands, but she went back to the road she came from within two days. This time, because of the news about Xiao Dangui, the reporter visited Ms. Huang again. According to Ms. Huang, she handled Xiao Dangui's final rites entirely on her own. She believes that many of the reports in the newspapers are exaggerated and do not match the facts. First, Xiao Dangui's coffin was bought from Yongxi Hall in the Shaoxing Guild Hall. It was not made of Phoebe zhennan, nor was it of Sha fang, but of Catalpa wood. It was worth only 30 to 40 million yuan. There were rumors of 150 million yuan, so even now, some people are sincerely going to see the coffin. Second, the item placed in the mouth is called Han Kou Ling (mouth filler), which is a small, copper-colored rhombus. The area is no larger than a lentil bean and is not valuable at all. It is mostly given as a gift by shroud shops. The rumor that a one-tael gold rhombus was placed in the mouth is also not true. Third, the copper gold ingots and silver ingots held in the hands were also fake. Other items, such as the more than twenty qipaos (traditional Chinese dresses) she wore before her death, cosmetics, perfumes, glass powder boxes, etc., were indeed present, but they were not valuable items. And the beads that were nailed on her clothes were the most basic small beads, worth only two or three thousand yuan each. Finally, Ms. Huang said: "The most unlucky thing this time was Leyuan Funeral Home, which lost tables, chairs, doors, windows, flowers, and trees worth about 200 million yuan, and no one has come to settle this bill yet!" The reporter said goodbye amid Ms. Huang's sighs. Ms. Huang chased after him and said loudly: "Please, reporter, mention in the newspaper that they should come and compensate quickly."

### Psychological Expert Sun Guiding Broadcasts Review of Mass Psychology

Sufficient to Overthrow Despotic Regimes, but Unable to Build Free Countries; Sufficient to Destroy All Evils, but Unable to Create Any Welfare

[Our Newspaper's Report] Our newspaper held its 30th special broadcast at the 99 Radio Station yesterday, inviting psychological expert and renowned professor Dr. Sun Guiding to broadcast a "Review of Mass Psychology." The gist of his speech is recorded below:

What is a mass? People generally think that a gathering of many people is a mass, but this is incorrect. The composition of a mass has certain conditions: (1) those who are concentrated in one place with the same goal, (2) those who have common emotions, and (3) those whose actions are sufficient to have influence and stimulation. For example, the bustling crowds on Nanjing Road come and go, each with their own purpose, which is not considered a mass. If a big fire occurs, many people have the same goal of watching the big fire and have the same curiosity and fear. These many people are the mass.

Freedom of Action Restricted

An individual in the mass is greatly influenced by the suggestive power of the mass. In the mass, an individual's actions are not free. At the same time, due to the effect of empathy, individuality is submerged. Therefore, an individual in the mass is completely without individuality and loses reason. An experienced orator, when entering a mass gathering, must first see if it is an open-air auditorium, because the reaction of the mass will be different depending on the environment. An experienced orator can make appropriate stimulation to the mass according to different occasions. Individual psychology and mass psychology are completely different. Individuals are mild and humble, but when they get into the mass, they often become rude and impolite. Even afterwards, they are surprised why there is such a big change in the mass, losing their original face.

Advocacy Prone to Change

Now, let's review the four characteristics of mass psychology: (1) The mass is fickle. The mass is different from an organized group. Tens of thousands of people will disperse due to a heavy rain, leaving no trace. When emotions are agitated, the mass will change its opinion due to external influences. The famous French historian Tain, in his writings, describes a passage about the Parisian mob riot. He said, "A crowd was gathered on a street in Paris, pointing out that a woman was a reactionary and wanted to kill her. An old man said, 'Don't be brutal, she is just a woman.' So the crowd shouted that the old man was a reactionary and turned to kill him. Suddenly a rascal jumped out of the crowd and said that the woman was the old man's daughter. The crowd laughed wildly, some bent over and laughed until their stomachs hurt, and the whole thing became nothing." The mass is so fickle.

Loss of Control

(2) The mass is credulous. There is no need to reason in front of the mass, because their ability to analyze and criticize is lost. An incorrect opinion is put forward in the mass and is accepted without consideration. (3) The mass is simple-minded. When talking to the mass, a few decisive words are enough. If words such as "suppose" and "however" are used in a dragging and repetitive manner, the mass will be bored. An agitator who is good at controlling the mass's mind only needs to simply say "Down with so-and-so" or "Support so-and-so" to the mass. (4) The mass is immoral. Because the mass has lost the ability to control and restrain itself, and individuals do not need to take responsibility for what they do in the mass, it is easy to be presumptuous and transgress. The so-called "atrocity" is produced from this psychology. The famous American professor Ross has two famous sayings: "The mass has the power to overthrow a despotic regime but cannot build a free country. The mass can destroy all evils, but cannot create any welfare."

### The Treasure Trove of Quartz in Suqian

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Suqian, 20th] Green Maling Mountains, inheriting the legacy of the Yimeng Mountains, meander beside Luoma Lake and extend all the way to Suqian City. Here lies a vast treasure, the home of glass – the quartz mine. As soon as our reporter arrived in Suqian, they immediately joined the inspection team led by Chairman Luan Xiang and County Magistrate Dong Jianhua, taking a special car to the production area for a visit.

White Horse Ravine Holds the Most Reserves

The quartz production area, as far as is known currently, is all around the Maling Mountains. It stretches approximately thirty li from north to south and twenty li from east to west, covering an area of about six hundred square li. A foreign expert once estimated that its reserves are enough to supply the world for thirty years.

We crossed the Liutang River, and impure quartz was found beneath the soil on both sides of the road. According to the County Magistrate, almost the entire area within these six hundred square li is like this. However, the richest reserves are in White Horse Ravine.

Crude Methods of Extraction and Processing

White Horse Ravine is just a place name, there is no village. There are many gullies and sandbars there, with a small amount of water flowing in between. In the soil layers on both sides of these numerous gullies and ravines lies the pure white quartz. Some are only inches from the ground, and the thickest are no more than three or four feet. Currently, no factories have been established yet; only some locals are using crude methods for extraction and processing, transporting a small amount to Shanghai. Because the quality is good, it is very popular with factories. In White Horse Ravine, we saw piles of quartz, which, after washing, had an irregular, granular appearance.

Zhang Jian's Achievements in Operation

There is a long history regarding past extraction efforts. In July of the 30th year of the Guangxu reign (1904), Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong, along with Xu Jiuxiang, Huang Boyu, and others, raised 500,000 taels of silver and petitioned the Nanyang Minister of the former Qing Ministry of Commerce for permission to establish the Yao Xu Glass Company. Formal operations began in July of the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign (1906), with Huang Boyu serving as the manager. The main products were plate glass and glass lamps, and the results were quite good. After the Xinhai Revolution (1911), due to the impact of war, business declined, and operations were suspended in the first year of the Republic (1912).

Visiting the Ruins, Nowhere to be Found

The factory was located on the north bank of the Grand Canal, covering more than two hundred mu of land with over six hundred rooms. After the shutdown, the factory land, machinery, and other items were still kept in the care of specific individuals, until Suqian fell to the enemy in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). A traitor, Wu Ziyun (the puppet District Chief of the 8th District of Suqian), colluded with the Saito unit of the enemy forces, who dismantled and transported the machinery. Wu, the traitor, sold off all the buildings. Now, not even a tile remains, and it is impossible to find the ruins.

Glass School Once Established

Before the war, there was also a glass vocational school in Suqian, founded by Mr. Zhang Jian. It had many complete instruments. During the War of Resistance, some of it was lost, and some was buried underground beforehand. Because the time was too long, the markers were gone, and it is currently being searched for. The school site was southwest of the city. The former laboratory now only has a large opium den standing, with no machinery or buildings left.

Glass Machines Lack Funds for Transport

Last October, someone from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) came to Suqian to inspect and indicated that they could provide two glass machines unconditionally for use. However, at that time, the transportation costs for these two machines would require more than 4 billion (currency units), which was unbearable in the impoverished county town. Therefore, this plan fell through.

Preparatory Committee Plans for Mining

However, the bright, sparkling light of glass continues to shine in the hearts of the people of Suqian. They believe this is a national resource, as someone once estimated that the reserves here would rank second in the world. They are now organizing a preparatory committee, preparing to suggest to the provincial authorities and the Resources Commission that they plan for mining as soon as possible, to benefit the local area and increase national wealth.

### Child Bandits Discovered in the South China Sea Brandishing Short Guns, Threatening Sampans

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guangzhou, 22nd] In Guangdong, where bandits are rampant, their power has been increasing since autumn. News of robberies of transport ships on various rivers is heard daily. What is even more shocking is the emergence of lawless child bandits. Recently, frequent robberies and killings have occurred on rivers near Donggua Hou and Yinhe in the Nanfu area of Nanhai County. Every sampan passing through is forced to pay a "protection fee" of 200,000 yuan. If a boat refuses to pay, the sampan is detained or shot at. The bandits entrenched there are actually children around twelve or thirteen years old, all dressed in yellow twill shirts and pants, with short guns at their waists, resembling heroes of Liangshan Marsh. According to informed sources, this group of child bandits numbers nearly a hundred and is commanded by remnants of the "Protecting Sand Brigade Commander," a large bandit group from the enemy-puppet era named Gong Zhuo. Most of them are the children of bandits, truly "hereditary thieves." The area is located at the junction of Nanhai, Panyu, and Shunde counties and has long been a hideout for major bandits. Since the discovery of this group of child bandits, sampan merchants have been hesitant to move forward, contributing to the recent surge in firewood prices in Guangzhou. This can be described as a new scene in a chaotic world.

According to a visitor from Jieyang, Mr. Zhang of Xiecuoliao Village in Jieyang County recently unearthed a wooden coffin while digging on his ancestral mountain five li outside the village. The exterior was completely rotten, and it crumbled at the touch. It was believed to be an old coffin from 200 years ago. However, the corpse inside was not decayed at all, and the remains were still intact. The deceased was a sixteen-year-old girl, with a beautiful face as if alive, but the clothes disintegrated upon touch. The features and limbs were perfectly preserved. The coffin opener was shocked and at a loss. Upon receiving the news, the local charity urgently prepared incense, paper money, and sacrificial offerings to pay respects and replaced the girl's clothes before reburying her. Villagers flocked to offer sacrifices. Unfortunately, there was no inscription, so it is unknown who this woman was. (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

### Fujian Agricultural Improvement Office Launches Winter Cultivation

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou, 22nd] Farmers in Fujian Province traditionally do not practice winter cultivation, but in recent years, due to the shortage of agricultural products, rural hardship, and the government's active promotion, more people are engaging in winter cultivation. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Office is now launching a large-scale winter cultivation plan, organizing supervisory teams to go to various counties to guide farmers. It is reported that the winter crops being promoted this year will mainly focus on "green manure" in addition to soybeans, wheat, and other crops. This "green manure" consists of more than twenty types of wild legume crops, such as Chinese milk vetch. They can grow and flourish on their own after sowing without the need for fertilization. When they mature, they are plowed into the soil to become natural fertilizer, which can greatly increase the yield of spring crops in the coming year. The use of this fertilizer in the farmland of northwestern Fujian Province has already shown effective results.

A Dispute Arises Over Rescuing Cotton in Anyang

### A Dispute Arises Over Rescuing Cotton in Anyang

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhengzhou, 20th] The matter of rescuing the 10,000 bales of cotton left in Anyang by air transport was just concluded yesterday. However, a dispute arose during the conclusion. Because Chennault, the person in charge of the China-America Cooperation Organization (中美公司), agreed to send planes to rescue the cotton in Anyang after hearing the Rescue Committee say that they would take 15% of the value to help Anyang students who had fled to Zhengzhou, the Trial Committee also issued a check to the Mo Sheng, saying that each student should receive a cotton coat and a cotton quilt after the cotton was rescued. Now that the cotton has been carried out, they are only willing to give each student a relief fund of 500,000 yuan. The Anyang students were indignant and went to a National Assembly representative surnamed Liu (from Anyang) to complain and ask him to uphold justice.

It is said that although 10,000 bales of Anyang cotton were transported out, some of them belonged to a certain military unit, so some of the merchants' cotton has not been transported out yet. At the same time, they also suffered a loss, which is that although more than 500 bales of cotton have not yet been transported, the merchants are responsible for the assessment and payment, so the amount of relief funds has been reduced even more. In the distribution of relief funds, some ignorant agencies and idle people also went to compete for a share, making it even more difficult for the Rescue Committee. As a result, they had to resort to the method of publishing a thank-you notice in the newspaper to avoid offending some people who could not get the money.

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou, 25th] Suspicions of corruption at the UNRRA Fujian Office have aroused great attention from all sectors here. It is reported that government agencies requesting materials from the office invariably suffer from the delays of cumbersome procedures.

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] Zhang Qianhua and other members of the Northeast Relief Association arrived in Beiping from Nanjing the day before yesterday and will return to Nanjing within days to report to Madame Chiang.

The regional relief is further divided into three regions: Liaoning (Liao), Andong (An), Jilin (Ji), Changchun (Chang), and Liaobei. The Liaoning and Andong regions receive 300 million yuan, with a portion of the cash distributed directly and a portion used to set up porridge kitchens and shelters. The Jilin and Changchun regions receive 200 million yuan, and the Liaobei region receives 150 million yuan. However, due to the ongoing fighting, the work has not yet officially started.

The 50 million for refugee children, specially allocated by Madame Chiang, is divided with 15 million for the Jilin and Changchun regions, 10 million for the Liaobei region, and 15 million for the Liaoning and Andong regions.

### Anhui Provincial Middle Schools in Bandit Areas Relocated to Safe Areas

### Zhou Gengsheng Talks to Wuhan University Alumni in Shanghai, Four Research Institutes of Wuhan University Plan to Expand Equipment on a Large Scale to Become the Academic Research Center of Central China

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Zhou Gengsheng, President of Wuhan University, went to Nanjing to attend the Academician Review Meeting and came to Shanghai the other day. The supervisors and directors of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the school held a banquet yesterday at the savings department of Siming Bank on Nanjing Road. Professor Zhang Zhifu, Director of the Accounting Department of the National Resources Commission, was also invited to attend. During the banquet, Zhou said that it is easier for professors to approach students, while administrative work unconsciously alienates students and colleagues, causing spiritual pain.

Wuhan University returned from western Sichuan without receiving any transportation conveniences from the government. Zhou believes that the speed and certainty of the repatriation work were due to the unity and efforts of teachers and students inside and outside the school. After returning, in addition to restoring the original College of Agriculture, colleges of Arts and Medicine were also added. The construction of college buildings and hospitals is the most gratifying achievement, otherwise the construction cost of billions of yuan at that time would cost hundreds of billions today.

Regarding the June 1st Massacre that occurred at Wuhan University, Zhou believes that it is purely a political issue. However, rational political methods can achieve a reasonable solution. Wuhan University's style has always been independent and generous. As long as there is no action to undermine the government, the school is absolutely responsible for the safety and freedom of teachers and students. The school has not arbitrarily expelled students this term, nor has it dismissed professors without cause. Wuhan University has gradually made achievements in academic work in recent years. The four quarterly journals of Arts, Philosophy, Social Science, Science, and Engineering are about to be fully restored. The four research institutes of Arts, Science, Law, and Engineering also plan to expand equipment on a large scale and increase the number of books to become the center of academic research in Central China.

Zhou expressed his agreement in principle with Hu Shi's plan for educational independence, but five or ten schools are another issue. Zhou finally believed that if educational funding is not enriched, it will be difficult to achieve good results. If it can be combined with a comprehensive and stable environment, it will not be difficult to catch up with the improvement of academic standards.

[Another News] The Shanghai Alumni Association of Wuhan University will hold a celebration meeting for the anniversary of the mother school at the Nanjing Road Nanguo Restaurant at 2:00 PM on November 2nd. It was originally intended to invite President Zhou to attend and preside over the meeting. It is heard that Zhou said that after meeting Minister Wang Shijie in Shanghai today, he will return to Nanjing and fly to Wuhan to personally preside over the grand celebration of the 35th anniversary of Wuhan University.

On Thursday (the 23rd), there were also three matches. After Sing Tao suffered a crushing defeat of 2-7 to Kitchee, they should have performed better against St. Joseph's today, but they still played like a scattered sand, winning 2-1, which was really a lucky win.

In terms of lineup, Sing Tao mobilized eight major players who had traveled far. The St. Joseph's team also had Xiao Gaoshan Nu in the lineup and borrowed good players such as Jia Hualu and Chen Lixiweiya from Macau, so they played vigorously.

The match was spent in fierce competition. In the first half, the situation belonged to the St. Joseph's team. In the second half, after Jia Hualu was injured, Sing Tao was able to turn the tide. In the first half, each team got a penalty kick, but Jia Hualu scored, while Jingxiang missed, so Sing Tao lost first. In the second half, Jia Hualu was injured, and the Lido team poured in, Li Dianqi shot an empty goal, tying the score. After that, although the St. Joseph's team was besieged, the goalkeeper Zhang Dangao performed well, so Sing Tao could not do anything. As time was running out, Qiu Shi stole an offside opportunity and pushed the ball in, thus angering the St. Joseph's team. The two teams' lineups are as follows:

Sing Tao: Yu Yaode, Mo Jiesong, Hua Tianshen, Xu Jingcheng, Shan Yousheng, Feng Kunsheng, Cao Qiuting, Pi Shuping, Zhang Jinhai, Feng Jingxiang, Li Yanqi.

Other Two Matches

In the other two reports, the outcomes were inevitable. Ba Shi defeated Guanghua 6-0. Guanghua's defeat was their own fault. The reason for the crushing defeat was that the lineup changed too much. The lineup was different in every match, so how could the players play well? Eastern won against the Navy 4-2.

### Hualian Says Goodbye in Singapore; Defeats Malaysia 2-0; Li Yao and Long Hai Cooperate to Break the Enemy's Goal Twice

[Guoguang News Agency, Singapore, 20th Dispatch] The Shanghai Hualian Football Team said goodbye yesterday, competing against the Malaysian team. The Malaysian team is known for being brave. The audience was very enthusiastic. Consul General Wu and his wife, and Deputy Consul General Xu and his wife, also attended on time, with enthusiastic mood.

First Half

At 5:00 PM, the referee Rong Yu took the field, and the two armies chose their positions. Shanghai was in the south and Malaysia was in the north. Malaysia kicked off from the center line and attacked, but were repeatedly blocked. Hualian tried to attack, but there was no development. After about five minutes of stalemate, Li Yuan got an opportunity and dribbled the ball quickly. La Shou was tackled, and hurriedly passed to Neng Hai, who scored a corner kick. Li Yuan attacked again without success. In the melee in front of the enemy, Chunhua was alert and tried a cold shot. Long Hai headed the ball into the net. Cheers erupted, and Hualian took a 1-0 lead. The agile Lianji Foot showed again, advancing on the left, right, and center, but there was no chance to enter. Malaysia counterattacked, like overturning mountains and overturning seas. Qixiang, Shixin, and Nengbo stood guard, forming a bronze wall and iron fortress. The enemy's offensive gradually declined. Hualian took a break. Jinshun and Yichen went deep on the left and passed to Li Yao. Li Yuan raised his arm and shot hard. Long Hai jumped up and added a header, which was wonderful. The Shanghai army scored again, and the first half ended with 2-0.

Second Half

In the sound of the resumption of the battle, Hualian was as steady as Mount Tai. Jinshun had seen success in the first half, and at this point, he swung the ax boldly, slashing wildly, but it was still ineffective. Malaysia lost two cities and fought to the death. However, the defenders such as Qixiang were seamless. After maneuvering for more than ten minutes, the Malaysian army suddenly stopped. La Shou was especially fiery. Seeing that the forwards were powerless, he personally came to the rescue. However, he was exhausted from the long journey, and there were also many concerns in the rear, so the attack was difficult to achieve. The veteran Banglun calmly dealt with it. When the legal time was over, Hualian still defeated Malaysia 2-0.

### Government Implements Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn; Hopes Cotton Spinning Industry Will Cooperate to the End; Minister Chen Expresses Determination Not to Exploit Legal Profits

[Our Newspaper] Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs met with Mr. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, at his residence at about 3:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on the upcoming joint distribution system of cotton yarn. Minister Chen stated that since he took office as the Minister of Economic Affairs, he has attached great importance to the cotton spinning industry. The National Textile Industry Production Conference held in September this year was to study how to guide China's textile industry to gradually achieve the plan of increasing production and development in a short period of time. The implementation of this joint distribution system of cotton yarn is only a link in the government's overall policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, and can only be handled under orders. The government is determined not to exploit the legitimate profits of the cotton spinning industry, so it is hoped that the industry will understand the government's good intentions and cooperate to the end.

Mr. Wang then explained to Minister Chen the difficulties currently faced by the private cotton spinning industry, one being the difficulty in sourcing raw cotton, the second being the shortage of operating funds, and the third being the frequent disconnection between the agreed price and the actual cost, which makes the general industry feel that the problem of reproduction is often threatened. Therefore, the industry felt that it was difficult to comply with the implementation of the joint distribution system. Minister Chen requested that the industry's willingness to cooperate would be conveyed to all colleagues.

### Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association to Hold Council Meeting

[Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association will hold a temporary council meeting this morning, at which the chairman of the association, Wang Qiyu, will report on the meaning of the meeting with Minister Chen, and discuss it at the same time, so as to collect the industry's final opinions on the joint distribution system.

### Investigation of Import and Export Industry; 300 Companies Completed

[Our Newspaper] The Industrial and Commercial Counseling Office is conducting an investigation of the import and export industry in this city. The investigation period is three months, and the estimated number of companies to be investigated is 1,300. Currently, about 300 companies have been investigated. The scale of import and export companies in this city varies greatly. Large companies have many employees, while small companies are simple in scale, and some even have only one person handling all affairs. As for the business situation, it is generally good, because due to foreign exchange fluctuations, it is possible to make a large profit with just one successful transaction.

### Domestic Exchange Rate Decreases

[Our Newspaper] The domestic exchange rate of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be adjusted again by region from the 27th, and most of them will be reduced. The adjusted exchange rates for each region are as follows:

Xiamen: 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan; Fuzhou: 80 yuan; Quanzhou: 120 yuan; other places in Fujian: 100 yuan; Guangzhou: 80 yuan; Shantou: 90 yuan; Haikou: 100 yuan; other places in Guangdong: 90 yuan; Wuzhou: 80 yuan; Nanning: 80 yuan; other places in Guangxi: 80 yuan; Changsha, Hengyang, and other places in Hunan: 60 yuan; Lianyungang and Xinpu: 25 yuan; Hankou and Wuchang: 60 yuan; Shashi, Yichang, and other places in Hubei: 100 yuan; Nanchang: 30 yuan; Jingdezhen: 50 yuan; Jiujiang and Ji'an: 40 yuan; Ganzhou and other places in Jiangxi: 50 yuan; Ningbo: 6 yuan; Shaoxing: 8 yuan; Chongqing and Chengdu: 10 yuan; Yunnan: 25 yuan.

### Tungsten Sand Smuggling Reduced

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs increased the purchase price of tungsten sand, tungsten sand smuggling has gradually decreased. The amount of tungsten sand purchased by the Third Special Mining Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has doubled compared to the past.

### Smuggling Exports in South China; Rice and Oil Account for the Majority

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Due to the recent rise in Hong Kong dollars, the amount of smuggling in South China has also been affected and has suddenly increased. It is reported that smuggling exports are mostly rice and oil. Many smugglers have shifted their routes, using Xintang in the East River and Jiangmen in the West River as their bases. However, under the strict investigation by the customs, more than 10,000 kilograms of smuggled rice have been seized in three weeks of this month.

Cigarette Crushed

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened steadily. At 9:15, a small number of transactions began. Because Yizhong and other out-of-town colleagues were still selling, the purchase sentiment was slack. As a result, ten Old Knife cigarettes from British American Tobacco fell by 150,000 yuan. The prices of other Chinese and foreign brands of cigarettes fell more than they rose.

Soap Candle Downstream

The daily-use soap market was not smooth, and there were sales, so the price of Guben Arrowhead soaps fell by 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The markets for other brands of soap, matches, and candles also trended downstream.

Kerosene Fell

The wholesale kerosene market has a large supply of goods at the price of 2.9 million yuan per barrel, so the market is well-stocked and the price has also fallen. The price for high-grade barrel goods was 2.9 million to 3 million yuan, and the price for canned goods also fell by 400,000 yuan. The retail price was 8,000 yuan per box and 8,500 yuan per full pound.

### Commercial Briefs

The first meeting of the Council of the Central Trust Bureau after the reorganization will be held at the bureau at 3:00 PM today. At the meeting, the standing directors and chairman will be elected, and the director of the bureau will be appointed.

The Textile Export Committee, jointly formed by the Textile Adjustment Committee of the Central Bank and the China Textile Company and other relevant agencies, has been prepared and will be formally established today, and will be working at the China Bank at 15 The Bund.

In order to strengthen the absorption of overseas remittances, the government will expand the remittance locations in Southeast Asia, expanding remittances by the Postal Savings Bureau and the Bank of China. Using post offices across the country to remit money will facilitate overseas Chinese and greatly absorb overseas remittances.

### Allocation Quota Announced Too Late; Guangdong Customs Revenue Drops Sharply

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Since the implementation of the import management system, the allocation of import quotas for each quarter is announced and implemented too slowly. It is only announced at the end of each quarter. Therefore, in order to purchase their needs, manufacturers and importers have to rely on smuggled imports. This affects the industrial and commercial sector on the one hand, and has a significant impact on customs revenue on the other. After the completion of the import of the second quarter of this year, the daily tax revenue of the customs has dropped from 600 million yuan to more than 30 million yuan, a sharp decrease of nearly 20 times. As of the 26th of the third quarter, the first permit has not yet been issued.

### The Airplane of Tomorrow

— Meng Kun

The progress of airplanes is much faster than that of other inventions. It has been almost 500 years since we first understood the structure of bird wings and the principles of soaring, but the date when the Wright brothers in the United States created the first aircraft was only 1903, which is only 44 years ago. In these 44 years, all scientific successes, such as printing, gunpowder, anti-tuberculosis drugs, guns, ships, skyscrapers, and atomic theory, have also made amazing leaps forward, but they are not as fast as the progress of airplanes, especially after this great war.

The first airplane 44 years ago only flew in the air for 12 seconds, a distance of more than 100 feet. 44 years later today, not long ago, Orton flew the "Renault Shell" around the world in just 74 hours. In this short period of 44 years, the development of airplanes has indeed been too fast. Its milestones can be proven by the following series of facts: In 1905, the Wright brothers created a flight record of 40 kilometers; in 1911, the first airplane assisted in the Italian attack on Tripoli; in 1927, Lindbergh (C.A. Lindbergh) flew alone from New York to Paris; in 1933, Post flew around the world; in 1935, the Soviet Gorky airplane appeared, carrying more than 100 passengers. After that was the period of rapid advancement in flight technology, which was also the outbreak of World War II. In this cruel process, the speed of airplanes exceeded the speed of sound, the load reached 20 tons, the altitude exceeded 10,000 meters, and the average output was one airplane completed in less than five minutes.

Of course, this progress is still continuing, and developing even faster. Therefore, the airplane of tomorrow will also be different from the airplane of yesterday and today. This difference is not only in the numbers, but more in the performance and quality. There is no doubt that a new century of airplanes will unfold from now on. According to recent reports in newspapers and magazines, the progress route of tomorrow's airplanes roughly follows the following directions.

In terms of form. In the past, airplanes were only divided into single-wing or bi-wing. The latest type of airplanes in the war gradually imitated cigars; in order to increase speed and prevent air resistance to objects, tomorrow's airplanes will appear in the shape of a projectile, seemingly without a tail, and the wings will really be like bird wings, shorter and rounder. In addition, formal changes will be excessively large or exceptionally small. Of course, although the improvement of form is the most obvious improvement, it is not the most important improvement, and the improvement of form is subordinate to the improvement of performance.

In terms of performance. Some people think that the performance of airplanes is perfect, but in fact and in theory, it proves that airplanes still have a lot of room for development. The highest speed at the end of the war was nearly 800 kilometers per hour. In the past two years, it has been rumored that an airplane with a speed of 1,000 kilometers has appeared; the speed of this airplane has exceeded the speed of sound and is approaching the Earth's rotational speed. If there is a continuous supply of atomic energy, it can circle the Earth in 24 hours and fly forever in the sunlight. In terms of capacity, the largest American airliner is no less than a small steamer, with restaurants, dance halls, cinemas, libraries, and swimming pools. Even the latest "Boeing" Model 36, which is used for military purposes, can carry nearly 50 tons. At the same time, it is said that "Boeing" Model 42 is also being produced. The maximum altitude can reach about 13,000 meters, which is already in the stratosphere. The range can reach at least 10,000 kilometers. In this way, airplanes will replace all flying machines, and balloons, airships, and kites will be eliminated. In addition, the theory of airplanes taking off and landing vertically is also gradually being completed. It may not require any wide flying field, but it is currently only applicable to pocket-sized small airplanes for people to play with, and they can already land or take off on the road, and some can be parked on the roof.

In terms of driving. Airplanes that were previously propelled by various engines are likely to be replaced by atomic energy engines. Atomic energy airplanes, it is said, have similar designs completed in the United States and the Soviet Union. The potential energy of the atomic nucleus is used to supply power. With this new success, the speed and range of airplanes can be greatly improved, and airplanes can also be much lighter. In addition to atomic energy, the application of the rocket principle to airplane devices is becoming increasingly realized due to the success of missiles (V1); however, it may not be possible to immediately achieve the goal of launching airplanes to the moon, enabling airplanes to escape the air and advance in a vacuum. In addition to the improvement of power, radio driving technology is also gradually being perfected. Recently, an airplane of this type has crossed the Atlantic Ocean, which is indeed a major commemoration worth celebrating in the history of airplanes. The establishment of this system, applied to long-distance or high-altitude flights, can prevent flight personnel from encountering the fate of being tired and sacrificed.

In terms of effectiveness. The effectiveness of airplanes is not limited to war, but in order to serve the war, the service capacity of airplanes in peacetime has also been expanded. Airplanes can now be used for transportation, as hospitals, measuring land, ground, stars, and climate, not just carrying passengers and mail. Moreover, even in terms of carrying passengers, the emergence of silent airplanes will greatly increase the comfort of passengers. In addition, the flying skills of tomorrow will be particularly simple, similar to driving a car. Anyone only needs a short period of learning and practice. Airplanes will be popularized, and will be related to the general public.

In addition to these, such as the use of plastic as a material for airplanes, making airplanes light, strong, beautiful, and the improvement of airplane manufacturing technology, which will enable airplanes to be produced in large quantities, are all inevitable advances in the future. It is generally expected that by the time of the 50th anniversary of the invention of the airplane, all aspects of the airplane will definitely be several times better than today. The progress of airplanes is part of the engineering of human wisdom.

### A Postscript to the Annual Meeting of Physics

— Chen Yuesheng

Although there were no particularly lively signs or particularly pleasant cheers to be seen or heard on October 10th this year, Shanghai had the grand event of the annual meeting of the Chinese Physical Society, adorning our third National Day holiday after victory. Members from the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas, with excited spirits and relaxed moods, ran to the Academia Sinica on Yueyang Road to participate in this very meaningful gathering of scholars. At the same time, they also held a heart of happily meeting old and new friends, wanting to take this opportunity to pour out their accumulated feelings with colleagues whom they had not seen for a long time, or whom they could not often meet, or whom they had long wanted to know.

Wu Youxun, the president of National Central University, was the speaker at the annual meeting, and arrived at the venue long ago. Wu was simply dressed and had a clear appearance. He felt like a scholar rather than a high official. Elder Qian Xuesen did not arrive. It was said that he was ill. Qian had been reviewing new physics terms with Qiu Weiyu, Zhou Changshou, and others at Jiaotong University for eleven consecutive days, returning late every day. There was no car to send him home. The elderly could not withstand excessive hardship, which led to a cold and the loss of three days and six meals of good flavor, which could not help but make people complain. Chen Zongqi, a geomagnetism expert, often carried a large leather bag. It was unknown what treasures were hidden inside. Wang Fushan, a disciple of Heisenberg and a quantum mechanics expert in China, waited quietly for the meeting to begin with great wisdom. Liu Xian, an anthropologist, and Lu Zidao, a neurologist, also attended as participants.

When President Zang Bentong delivered his opening remarks, he said that centimeters and millimeters should never coexist, and the word "yi" should never be used to refer to ten thousand times ten thousand. His words reminded the fool of the debate between counting and mathematics, the debate between metaphysics and science, and even more of the other double-dealing cases in the country. The world is determined by "one," but it is really difficult, very difficult to achieve this "one." Wu Xuezhou, a chemical expert, appeared on the stage as a representative of the Ministry of Education. From a comparison of the development history of Eastern and Western thought, he predicted that Chinese physics, and even all of science, should have a day of flourishing. Ren Hongjun, who has devoted himself to promoting science in China for more than 20 years, took the stage as a representative of the Science Society, believing that it was urgent to repair the wounds of China's physics research institutions. It is hoped that these wounds will be repaired quickly so that science can recover its health and move forward as soon as possible, and not end up with new wounds being added before the old ones have healed.

Wu Youxun's speech was almost entirely delivered from a biased perspective, and his tone was sometimes high and sometimes low, and his words were sometimes humorous and sometimes solemn, which indeed impressed the author. He believed that the "advancement" and "popularization" of physics should be promoted simultaneously; he wanted us to "appreciate and encourage each other"; and he put forward the slogans of "rigor" and "not deceiving people." Academic research should certainly not "deceive people," and it also "cannot deceive people." The rumor that Zhou Moumou had won the Nobel Prize was ultimately an unflattering thing for the Chinese people. In fact, in terms of "popularization," there should also be a spirit of "not deceiving people" and creation. Suppose a Chinese popular science magazine insists on printing an English name Scientific China on the cover, and most of the content is not Chinese, this seems to be close to deceiving people and has a suspicion of plundering the beauty. Suppose there is another Chinese popular science magazine that almost entirely reprints works from foreign books and newspapers. The owners of those works write letters to the Chinese editors, requesting royalties for the reprints in very tactful terms. The editor actually comes up with a mistranslation that makes no sense, and publishes it together with the original letter, saying that he hopes they will publish a Chinese version. This is simply worse than deceiving people. If this habit of "deceiving people" is exposed, how can we uphold the words of "not deceiving people" in the future? Wu also told a very interesting story with overtones, saying that more than 20 years ago, Langmuir came to China for the first time and looked down on everyone. Later, he saw that China actually had X-ray equipment and even Wilson cloud chambers, and only then did he go from being arrogant to respectful. This story reminded the author of what Liu Xian said at the symposium of seven scientific groups, that we should wait until China has atomic energy research before expressing our opinions on atomic energy to the world.

When reading the papers, Ding Xushi performed several demonstration teaching instruments with a humorous attitude, which brought a lot of laughter. The important papers included Lu Xueshan's "Preliminary Report on Uranium Oxide Crystals," Shi Ruwei's "Influence of Magnetic Coercivity on Coercive Force," and Chen Zongqi's "Geomagnetism in Southeastern China," all of which were the result of careful research in China. There was also Shu Xingbei's "Force - A Fictitious Concept," but because the author did not come, he asked someone to read it on his behalf, which was inevitably a bit unsatisfactory. It is said that Lu's research also exists in the American Manhattan Project, but it is still being kept secret.

The Air Force performed radar, and was given the privilege of previewing it. When an airplane passed dozens of miles away, the green fluorescent line on the screen fluctuated. A point immediately appeared on the white fluorescent line, and the direction and distance were immediately known. The whole machine is only like a bookcase in size, but the theories and skills in it cannot be exhausted by a cabinet, nor can they be achieved overnight.

During the symposium, someone said that the teaching materials used in a certain middle school in Shanghai were all university physics, which seemed too deep. Someone said that the test questions for recruiting new students at a certain university were unknown whether they were testing middle school students or university students. These words won applause from the whole hall. Ding Xubao came up with new and strange things again and performed them. It seemed that someone heard someone say that there was nothing special about it, but the author strongly disagreed. How could one not admire Ding's creative spirit and his good intentions in education? It should be known that inventing the atomic bomb and the theory of relativity are certainly amazing things, but making the ignorant public understand the basic knowledge of physics is probably not an easy task.

### Announcement

In the article "New Elements" by Yu Jun published in the 11th issue of this journal, the three Greek letters Alfa, Beta, and Gamna were replaced by the English letters L, B, and I because the typesetting room was not equipped with them, which was quite inappropriate. It was not a mistake on the part of the typesetter. We are answering inquiries from readers.

Yu Jun: Please provide your detailed name and address so that we can pay you.

### Cold Light

— Qing Yin

Physics tells us that when an object is heated to a certain degree, it will emit light. Light and heat are always linked together. In the sky, the sun is the most common heating and luminous object. Many of the stars at night are hotter and larger than the sun, but because they are too far from the earth, we can only detect faint light and measure extremely small amounts of heat. For this reason, when we encounter light, we always associate it with the existence of heat. The two are simply like a pair of close brothers who are difficult to separate.

However, when it comes to so-called "cold light," we cannot help but separate this pair of close brothers. Originally, "cold light" is not related to "heat."

Although cold light is not made from heat, its function is still the same as ordinary light generated by heat. It can make various substances produce adjacent light and fluorescence, can make photographic film sensitive to light, plant seedlings can bend in its direction, and can also make leaves produce chlorophyll.

The source of this cold light is almost all in living things. Dried fish and dead animal meat often emit light at night. This is caused by a kind of bacteria. There are 30 kinds of these bacteria, the most common of which is called Bacterium Phosphoreum, which lives on fish and meat. Light emission is a side effect of its activity. Near the ocean, one can often see dead fish emitting a grass-green glow in the early stages of decay at night. This is also due to this bacteria.

In deep caves, there is also often luminous moss. The reason for this moss is that a kind of lens-shaped cell on its epidermis reflects sunlight. The reason why cat eyes can glow in the dark is also because there is a very developed mirror-like layer on the back of their eyes that reflects light.

Among luminous animals, the most numerous are fish and shrimp in the sea. Many parts of them emit light, mostly near the abdomen, such as sea pens, starfish, and brittle stars. There is a kind called the luminous anchovy, whose light can even be used to read newspapers. Some seas often contain countless noctiluca, which are single-celled small animals that can emit light when stimulated. Therefore, often when sea ships pass by or people walk on the beach that has just receded, they leave a golden trail of light.

There are many other animals that can emit light: in South America, there is a kind of beetle called the automobile worm, which emits white light in the front and red light in the back; in New Zealand, there is a large cave whose walls and ceiling are full of thousands of fireflies, illuminating the entire cave; in Sumatra, there is a kind of firefly with twenty-eight luminous spots, which is famous for its light emission. In addition, countless kinds of jellyfish, sponges, sea worms, earthworms, ophiuroids, mollusks, shrimp, crabs, squid, and anglerfish can also emit light.

### Are Mutations Chemical Changes? (Continued)

— Hao Tianhe

On the other hand, the corrective efficiency of mustard gas is sometimes no lower than that of X-rays. Slizynska and Slizynski used various methods for cytological research to produce sex-linked lethal factors, and found that in 20% of the cases, only one lethal factor was produced. This kind of hereditary change is caused by minor defects on the chromosomes. Moreover, the occurrence rate of this factor is the same whether it is irradiated by X-rays or ultraviolet rays, or treated with mustard gas. Although some factors have truly mutated, others have undergone slight reorganization of the chromosomes. Geneticists focus on this common point, which is why the same occurrence rate occurs without any difference. Perhaps it is because there is no significant difference between gene mutation and chromosome reorganization, because that kind of reorganization is extremely slight and cannot be detected by cytological methods. It is worth noting whether small defects on chromosomes are the cause of the same proportion of lethal factors. That kind of lethal factor can sometimes be produced by chemical drugs that are weaker than mustard gas.

There is also a second difference between the physical and chemical effects of X-rays and mustard gas. After chemical drug treatment, a visible mutation was found, but this study was a bit of a failure. This is because the mutations observed in the research process were of the same type as those obtained after X-ray irradiation. Moreover, this gas did not show any special effect on the individual factors. Therefore, there seems to be no difference between the radiation of mustard gas and X-rays. However, there is indeed a difference between these two forces, not in the type of mutation produced, but in the different trends shown by the mutations in the offspring of the treated fruit flies. After male fruit flies are treated with X-rays, abnormalities occur in most of the offspring, such as yellow body color, replacing the normal gray-white color, covering the entire surface of their bodies. Only a small part (less than 15%) of the mutated individuals belong to the mosaic type, that is, the color of a part of the body shows abnormalities, while other parts are still normal. On the contrary, after male fruit flies are treated with mustard gas, the proportion of mosaic offspring is higher (usually between 30% and 50%). Moreover, the gonads of mosaic fruit flies caused by X-rays rarely contain both normal and mutated cells, while mosaic fruit flies caused by mustard gas usually produce these two types of cells. Special studies have been done on this mosaic gonad, focusing specifically on the mutation of sex-linked lethal factors. If a female fruit fly (whose ovary produced by a treated male fruit fly contains cells carrying a sex-linked lethal factor in some tissues), the males produced in the future are often fewer than normal female fruit flies. The degree of male deficiency depends on the ratio of the normal part to the mutated part in the ovary. If a female fruit fly has a sex-linked "semi-lethal" mutation factor evenly distributed in all the cells of the ovary, this mutation will inevitably reduce the production of males. Therefore, only a part of the male offspring can fully develop, and the sex ratio in her offspring will also be reduced accordingly. The reason is that this female fruit fly is the daughter of a male fruit fly that has been wrongly radiated, and the low sex ratio in her offspring is almost entirely due to the semi-lethal mutation factor affecting the entire ovary. On the other hand, if male fruit flies are treated with mustard gas, nine out of every twenty daughters produced will lack males in the future. This is because in their abnormal ovaries, some mosaic cells carry a sex-linked lethal factor. Finally, it is also necessary to mention a very significant example of mosaicism, a male fruit fly born to a male fruit fly treated with mustard gas, whether in their gonads or body cells, are all mosaic cells. Assuming that after the factors in the sperm cells are affected by the treatment, although they do not mutate immediately, they can obtain a tendency to mutate, and this tendency can be latent until the cells divide later, this assumption has also been supported by facts. Because in several cases, it has been found that the offspring produced by fruit flies with mosaic gonads still have the same mosaic gonads. In this example, a certain unstable mutation characteristic caused by external forces can be seen. After becoming stable, it seems that it can also be passed from this generation to the next. There is no similar parallel observation report in radiation genetics. However, this so-called unstable factor seems to be worth noting. This factor has been found several times in untreated materials and has a tendency to continue to mutate in the same direction.

### On the Tragic Protagonist

— Chen Shouzhu

Aristotle gave a detailed explanation of the protagonist in tragedy in Chapter 13 of "Poetics." This is one of the most important issues in Aristotle's drama theory. The original text is translated as follows:

"All perfect tragedies must arrange complex structures and should not arrange simple structures, as has been explained in the previous article. Furthermore, tragedies should express actions that can arouse pity and terror, because this is the characteristic of tragedy. Based on this inference, the first point is that the change in fate written in the tragedy should not express the scene of good people falling into misfortune from good fortune; because this neither makes people pity nor terrifies people, it only amazes us. The second point is that it should not express the scene of bad people turning from misfortune to good fortune, because this is the most inconsistent with the spirit of tragedy. There is no tragic nature in it, and it is not enough to satisfy moral consciousness, nor is it enough to arouse pity or terror. Third, it is also not suitable to include in the play the fact that extremely evil people eventually get evil results. This kind of structure can indeed satisfy moral consciousness, but it is also not enough to arouse pity and terror; because innocent suffering can arouse our pity, and only people similar to us encountering misfortune can arouse our terror. Therefore, evil people getting evil retribution is neither pitiful nor terrifying. In other words, the most suitable character for tragedy is one who is between these two extremes—the person is not extremely good and upright, and his misfortune is not caused by evil deeds or bad behavior, but by some kind of mistake or shortcoming. Therefore, the person must be famous and respected, with a prominent position and influence, such as Oedipus, Themistocles, or other members of prominent families."

Aristotle's intention is that the tragic protagonist must be between all good and all evil, with errors or shortcomings that are unavoidable for people, so that a tragic effect can be achieved. Tragedy is a kind of conflict, a kind of suffering; if a perfect person has almost no conflict, even if he suffers because of conflict, he will definitely remain calm and composed, as if he has never suffered. Gods will not suffer, and saints regard suffering as happiness; therefore, we do not believe that gods will truly produce tragedy, and the tragedy of saints is beyond our sympathy. Although we admire gods and worship saints, we are ultimately not gods or saints. They are above us, and we do not truly love them or truly hate them, so we do not have the most profound sympathy for them. We sympathize with people like us, who have humanity and are close to human feelings. We truly love them and truly hate them, so we have the most intense interest. Therefore, only their tragedy can move us.

Since tragedy takes an imperfect ending as the orthodox, it is natural that neither good people getting good retribution nor evil people getting good retribution is sufficient to constitute a tragedy. As for evil people getting evil retribution, although it conforms to "poetic justice," it is also insufficient to produce a tragic result. Whether tragedy is to make people get catharsis or to be moved, it is definitely not to persuade people to do good and cultivate moral concepts; and the evil retribution of evil people has no meaning other than making people applaud and cheer.

The German playwright Schiller is said not to have read "Poetics," but his views on the tragic protagonist are the same as those of Aristotle. Schiller once said in his "On Tragic Art" (Ueber die Tiagische Kunst): "Tragedy imitates actions, and this action allows us to see a person suffering. The word 'person' is enough to mark the scope of tragedy. Only when people like us suffer can we arouse our pity. Therefore, evil ghosts and gods, or even morally depraved people like them, and flawless spirits, are not suitable for tragedy. Suffering means the suffering of a complete person. Spirits have no reason to suffer, and people who are close to spirits cannot arouse our deep sympathy. An evil person will certainly encounter terrible suffering; but if a person has no moral consciousness, he is just a puppet of suffering, and any scene of suffering that is not related to reason is enough to make people disgusted. Therefore, the tragedian prefers to portray complex characters, and it is very insightful to make the ideal tragic protagonist between all evil and all good."

In Greek tragedy, we can find three tragedies to study Aristotle's theory. The tragic protagonist's misfortune is caused by mistakes that are unknowingly committed or knowingly committed, or unwarranted mistakes. The tragic cause of "Oedipus Rex" is due to Oedipus Rex's patricide and marriage to his mother. However, this kind of mistake is caused by fate, and the protagonist was unable to foresee it, so it evolved into a tragedy. This kind of tragedy is purely a product of Greek religion. According to modern concepts, anyone who unintentionally makes a big mistake cannot be held responsible. Therefore, this example is rare in modern tragedy. The play "Medea" is a good example of a knowingly committed mistake. Medea deliberately retaliates, carefully considers and gradually realizes her poisonous plan. She knows what kind of results will be produced. Although there is no lack of contradiction in her heart, her poisonous plan is finally realized. Regarding the play "Antigone," although Hegel believes that the protagonist is too biased, if we think carefully, who can admit that she really has a mistake? She violates national law for the sake of friendship, who says she shouldn't? Therefore, Antigone encountered misfortune, and she herself cannot be held responsible.

This third example, that is, the protagonist suffers innocently, is obviously contrary to Aristotle's saying that the tragic protagonist must have errors or weaknesses that are unavoidable for people. And most modern social tragedies belong to this example. Under the unreasonable social system of modern times, ordinary good people, who can be said to have no defects in themselves, suffer all kinds of unreasonable oppression and harm in vain, and even die. Tragedy aims to express life, and human life is always changing, so the basic spirit of tragedy and comedy is the same in ancient and modern times.

Regarding the identity or status of the tragic protagonist, Aristotle believes that "they must be of high status, famous, and influential." This kind of view is only enough to explain ancient tragedies; it may not be true for modern tragedies. In the era of theocracy and monarchy in Europe, gods, emperors, and heroines occupied an important position in the minds of ordinary people. Therefore, not only Greek tragedies, but also Shakespearean tragedies, the protagonists are all of high status, famous, and influential. But since the prevalence of democratic politics in the eighteenth century and the rise of family tragedies, the middle class and even the proletariat have acquired a legitimate position in tragedy. Modern audiences go to the theater to see their own lives expressed on the stage, and they are not as interested in the gods, emperors, and heroines in ancient plays as ancient audiences were. The love and hate of ordinary people, the material life and even the spiritual life, are excellent themes in modern plays. Therefore, our requirements for the tragic protagonist are not in the superiority or inferiority of their identity or status, but in their noble character and strong perseverance.

Regarding character, there is another regulation in Chapter 15 of "Poetics":

"Regarding character, there are four things to pay attention to. First, character must be good, this point is the most important. All languages or actions that show any moral purpose are enough to express the character of the person; if this moral purpose is good, the character must also be good. This rule applies to every type of person. Because women are inferior to men, and slaves are humble and insignificant, women or slaves are not without goodness. Second, when describing character, strive to be appropriate. Perseverance and bravery are the spirit of a man. It is not appropriate to say that a woman is brave, or clever and reckless. Third, character must strive to be real, and what is consistent with life is called real. It cannot be confused with goodness and propriety. Fourth, when describing character, strive to be consistent; because although the character of a certain person is inconsistent, there must be consistency in its inconsistency."

The goodness Aristotle speaks of here refers to character, not perfection, as mentioned above that a perfect person is not suitable for tragedy. However, modern people's views on whether a character must be good are somewhat different from those of Aristotle. For the sake of realism, Euripides included many base characters in his tragedies, such as Jason in "Medea" and Menelaus in "Orestes." In English Elizabethan tragedies, there are even more villains. From this, it can be seen that the characters in tragedy do not have to be good. What we require of the characters in the play is not whether their character is good, but whether they do have a special character, which is obvious and profound.

Regarding the point that the description of character must strive to be appropriate, our views are also not entirely the same as those of Aristotle. So-called propriety means being consistent with the type or being consistent with the general nature (True to Type). Ancient writers often divided people into several types, and deeply studied their common characteristics to distinguish them. The general nature of each type of person is different, so when describing the character of a certain type of person, it must be between the general nature of a certain type of person. Greek tragedies are based on myths and legends, and the characters in them are stereotyped. Therefore, tragic poets must strive to conform to the character of the type before they can be trusted. The Greek philosopher Theophrastus wrote thirty-six "Characters," vividly depicting the general nature of thirty-six types of people. He had a great influence on the writers of the time, and the Greek comedian Menander, who founded European comedy of manners, was deeply influenced by him. From Menander's surviving fragments and the comedies of Terence and Plautus, who imitated him, we can always encounter昏庸老朽的父親,荒唐熱的兒子,以及智足多謀的僕人. These characters are all typical characters, with obvious general natures and lacking special personalities. Although describing the general nature of characters is convenient for identification, its biggest shortcoming is that the characters are mostly the same, and the typical characters become clichéd characters (Stock Character), which often makes readers and audiences bored. Because human life is becoming more and more complex, the influence of the social environment on human beings is also becoming stronger and stronger, and the research on human nature is becoming more refined and profound. Therefore, in modern drama, not only is character more important than plot, but also in the description of character, individuality is more important than general nature. Although Aristotle advocated that the character of a person must conform to the type, he criticized modern drama with the four words "conform to the type," and his meaning was more derogatory than commendatory. If we stick to Aristotle's theory and insist on typical character, we will make the same mistake as Thomas Rymer, the master of English neoclassicism. Rymer believes that the character of Iago in "Othello" cannot be established. Why? Because in Rymer's view, it is a universally accepted fact that soldiers are honest and repay kindness with kindness. The value of an artist lies in being unique everywhere, expressing what others have not expressed, and avoiding following others blindly. The modern Irish literary giant Yeats once said in his "Plays and Controversties": "All art is based on personal fantasy, and the greater the art, the more personal the fantasy; all clumsy art is based on impersonal types and images. Ordinary men and women, because they lack imagination, do not dare to travel in fantasy, or because they only know hard work and have no talent, so they accept that impersonal type and image." The so-called impersonal is generalization, and the personal is originality. The spirit of science lies in generalization, and the spirit of art lies in originality.

Although modern people's views are slightly different from those of Aristotle, this is not enough to reduce Aristotle's value. As Dryden said: "To say that Aristotle would say so is not enough to be a conclusion, because Aristotle's basis is only the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides; if he were born today and could see the works of modern people, he might change his tone." Literature and art evolve with human life, and the past and present are different. If we stick to his theory without adding supplements and inventions, we will be violating his critical spirit.

### Touching Fish Tune - Autumn Sound (Using Jiaxuan's Rhyme)

— Gu Yiqiao

Who is worried about the misty rain in a building, and the swallows flying away from the reef? The Qinhuai River is green, and Zhongshan is purple, with countless frost leaves and building clouds; autumn doesn't stop. Mourning the rouge at the bottom of the well, the lonely road of Taicheng, the rivers and mountains are silent, asking about the falling flowers, the opening flowers, the withered flowers, the good flowers, neither fog nor catkins. Board game is needed, but the lives of the people are completely mistaken. How many times have the winds and moons envied each other; do the winds know the changing phases of the moon? Who can tell the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion? Wind, don't dance, I'm afraid that the fallen leaves will be swept away by the wind to the central plains. The rise and fall of dynasties are the most bitter, let's hold the dangerous railings together, the autumn sound surrounds us, let's go to a higher place.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Fortunately, after arriving at Changping, I used a golden cicada shedding its shell to slip away for most of the night. I also luckily encountered engineer Mr. Wu. Immediately afterwards, Brother Hu also found me. Brother Hu then discovered the large group of comrades outside the pass (I don't know how they ended up here). Only then did I regain my full freedom.

"I only explained these few things, so you can imagine how difficult it was for me to meet Brother Hu in Tianjin. It's better to say it's impossible than difficult... truly impossible! I remember that after I came out of the Japanese "Action Command," I immediately tried to make a phone call to the hotel. The old receptionist told me that "Brother Chu had already been there, and the note and one hundred yuan bill left behind had already been given to Brother Hu." This was the only direct news I received about Brother Hu in Tianjin, and I was almost discovered by Maisaf...

Yaoqun continued his narration:

"That very night, Maisaf told me personally, as if reporting some special news, that "a monster" had appeared in Tianjin! When I saw the spirit in which he spoke, I determined that the word "monster" referred to Brother Hu. Here is a section of our conversation at the time:

"What monster?" — I asked.

"A monster who kills people!" — Maisaf answered.

"Kills people?" — I asked.

"That's right... and doesn't use weapons!" — Mai answered.

"How do you mean?" — I asked.

"Doesn't use a gun, and doesn't use a knife. Don't you think that's special?" — Mai answered.

"Then, how can he kill people?" — Actually, I had already understood that it was Brother Hu's doing, but I still pretended to be surprised and asked.

"It's very special!" — Mai said.

"But does he kill people with poison?" — I pretended not to understand and asked him.

"Don't pretend to be stupid. Maybe this trick can fool the Japanese, but you and I have both practiced a little Chinese martial arts. How could we not know?" — Mai squeezed me coldly.

"Practiced martial arts? Doesn't that just mean killing people with fists?" — I still didn't change my attitude.

"Hmm, pretty close!" — Maisaf said in a strange tone, as if saying that I shouldn't pretend.

"How many people did he kill; who were they?" — Because I wanted to understand why Brother Hu had to do that, I wanted to find out from Mai Saf, so I asked him this.

"I heard that two Japanese secret agents, two guards, died; you know, the guards who watch the prison, and also a few Chinese police officers - probably this guy thought his partner had disappeared, thought he was arrested, so he did this so ruthlessly" -

Haha, not bad results, I intentionally said, what do you think Mai Saf.
