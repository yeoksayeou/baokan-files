### The Northeast Communist Offensive Crushed: Dehui Siege Lifted, Jiutai Recovered; National Army Pursuit Force Advances in Seven Directions

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] The crisis in Changchun has passed. National Army forces advancing north from Changchun entered Dehui at 11:00 AM on the 3rd. The city was surrounded on the 23rd of last month by a Communist force of six divisions, over twenty tanks, and over one hundred artillery pieces, representing a formidable force. At the beginning of their offensive, the main force of the National Army retreated, with a portion remaining to resist. The National Army forces near Changchun then mobilized their main force and launched successive attacks. Around the 27th of last month, the Communist forces began to show signs of wavering. The fighting was extremely fierce, and finally, the siege was lifted on the morning of the 3rd and the National Army entered Dehui. With the lifting of the siege, the Northeast war situation can be temporarily paused. The Communist offensive against Changchun suffered a major setback. In the overall outcome, the Communist forces suffered over 20,000 dead and over 10,000 wounded. Under the pressure of the advancing National Army, the Communists admitted defeat and finally withdrew.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] As of now, the Communist forces on all lines outside Changchun have been completely routed. The so-called Second "Spring Offensive" by Lin Biao has been thoroughly crushed. In this battle, the National Army discovered a total of twelve Communist combat units, namely the 1st to 7th Divisions, the 16th to 18th Divisions, the Songjiang troops under Cao Lihuai, and the 359th Brigade of Lin Biao's cadre force, totaling over 100,000 troops (previous estimates of 200,000 may have been exaggerated). In the nearly ten days of fighting, the focus was always on Dehui. No fewer than 30,000 Communist troops besieged the city. According to intelligence obtained by the military, Lin Biao ordered Dehui to be captured within four days. However, after eight days of fierce attacks, they failed to achieve their goal and finally suffered a painful defeat, retreating in different directions. It is reported that the National Army pursuit force is divided into as many as seven routes. The general direction of the Communist retreat is north for those north of Dehui, northeast for those in the southeast of Dehui along the Jilin-Changchun line, and northwest for those southwest of Dehui along the Changchun-Tao'an line. These routes are generally the same routes they used for the attack.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Fulongquan, northwest of Changchun and southwest of Nong'an, was recovered by the National Army at noon on the 3rd. This area is one of the important outposts for defending Changchun. Furthermore, the Communist forces in various areas are fleeing towards Qitamu, Xiushuidianzi, Wukeshu, Taolaizhao, and the Guo'erluosi Wangfu (princely residence). The National Army pursuit troops have crossed Dafangshen, northeast of Dehui.

[Another Dispatch] The right wing of the National Army counterattacking north from Changchun reached the line of Sima Jiazi and Xinglong Jiazi on the 1st. The central route advanced along the Changda Road, crossing Buhai, with its vanguard continuing to advance north towards Dehui. The left-wing cavalry unit advanced towards Nong'an, Shuangchengzhi, and Huaide, searching as they went. The Communist forces in the above areas scattered at the sound of the wind, putting up weak resistance. The Communist dream of threatening Changchun has been shattered.

Sun Liren Arrives in Dehui to Comfort the Troops Who Fought Hard to Defend the City

[Report from our Changchun Office on the 3rd] Sun Liren, Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone, arrived in Dehui at 7:00 AM on the 3rd to oversee the troops. The Communist forces besieging Dehui fled in three directions: northeast, northwest, and due north. The National Army is in pursuit. The Communist forces are scattering at the mere sight of the National Army, but the results of this battle may not be as good as expected. Also, the National Army advancing north along the Changtao Line crossed Nong'an and reached Chaigang yesterday. The National Army advancing east along the Changji Line, after driving away the Communist forces in the Yinma River area, advanced further to mop up the remaining Communist forces near Jiutai.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The National Army advancing north along the Changchun-Harbin Line, after breaking the Communist resistance in areas such as Hala Ha and Buhai, joined up with the Dehui garrison, which had been fighting alone, at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. The main force of the Communist forces attacking Dehui retreated in the north and northeast directions. The National Army is striving to expand the battle results by pursuing them from various angles. Under the personal guidance of General Pan Yukun, the 4,000-strong garrison in Dehui resisted the siege of Communist forces ten times their size for eight consecutive days and nights. Commander Sun Liren, recognizing General Pan's high merits in battle, rushed to Dehui from his forward command post to shake his hand.

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] The Communist forces on the Changchun-Harbin Line are now retreating to the north bank of the Songhua River. Also, the Communist forces at the Songhua River bridgehead have not advanced. Furthermore, the National Army advancing west from Jilin on the Changchun-Jilin Line and the National Army advancing east from Changchun have joined forces near Jiutai.

[Report from our Shenyang Office on the 3rd] The battle on the Songhua River, where the main force of the Communist army is located, will soon be resolved. The Communist forces in Jiutai on the Jilin-Changchun Road began to withdraw on the morning of the 2nd, and the National Army recovered Jiutai on the morning of the 3rd.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Jiutai County, in the middle section of the Jilin-Changchun Line, was recovered by the National Army at approximately 8:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. The Communist forces fled towards Chengzijie, and the National Army is pursuing them closely. The National Army advancing west from Jilin, after recovering the stations on the eastern section of the Jilin-Changchun Line, also turned north to pursue the retreating Communist forces.

[Another Dispatch] On the Changchun-Tao'an Line, the National Army encountered the main forces of the Communist 4th and 5th Divisions and part of the 3rd Division, totaling over 10,000 troops, at Jiangdongwopu and Caojiafenfang, a dozen kilometers southeast of Nong'an, yesterday afternoon. A fierce battle immediately ensued. The Communist forces, caught off guard, suffered heavy casualties, and most of the Communist forces fled towards Fuyu, northwest of Nong'an, at night.

### Changchun Gradually Returning to Normal: Traffic Lockdowns in and Out of the City Lifted Yesterday; China-Changchun Railway Engineering Team Accelerating Repairs

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Changchun is now gradually returning to normal. City Defense Commander Mai Youqiao ordered on the 3rd that the traffic lockdowns in and out of the city be lifted starting at 2:00 PM today, allowing pedestrians, vehicles, and horses to enter and exit freely, but they must still undergo fairly strict inspections to prevent criminals from sneaking in. There is increasing trading in the grain market. Vegetables will only be available after rural vegetable vendors enter the city on the morning of the 4th. Fresh meat will be available on the market on the morning of the 4th. Among the prices of general commodities, the most volatile this week have been food and fuel. Now that sources of supply are open and traffic is flowing, prices have stabilized. However, it is generally believed that due to the Communist disturbances, materials in various counties have been almost completely lost, especially grain. Therefore, after a short period of stability, prices will likely rise again.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The China-Changchun Railway engineering team, repairing the railway day and night at the fastest speed, repaired 200 meters of track and one bridge 31 kilometers from Changchun on the afternoon of the 3rd. It is expected that the section between Changchun and Mishazi (33 kilometers north of Changchun) will be repaired and open to traffic within days.

### In the Pulandian Area, the National Army Takes the Initiative

[Report from our Shenyang Office on the 3rd] The overall Communist offensive in the Northeast is coming to an end. In the south, in the Pulandian area, the National Army has regained the initiative. The situation on the eastern front, in Shen'an and Pingmei, is also trending towards stability. However, the National Army in Liuhe, on the Meihe-Ji'an Road, still needs to overcome difficulties. The National Army cavalry on the northwest route entered Nong'an on the afternoon of the 2nd, and the infantry arrived on the 3rd.

[Report from our Qingyang Office on the 3rd] The National Army on the Pulandian front searched areas south of Pulandian on the 2nd to reduce the threats they faced.

[Report from our Xi'an Office on the 3rd] The Communist forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have recently been frequently redeploying in the eastern Gansu area. It is reported that a large force has been transferred from Yan'an to Qingyang, Heshui, and Xihua, south of those areas, in Gansu Province to strengthen defenses. Jiuyuan, northwest of Zhengning County, and the northeastern and northwestern areas of that county, close to the Shaanxi provincial border, have been harassed by Communist forces. The defending troops intercepted and blocked them, and recovered Chichengzhen, 20 kilometers south of Qingyang, and Yimaguan, 40 kilometers southwest of Qingyang, on the 1st. This pass is a major thoroughfare between Qingyang and Jingchuan.

[Report from our Hankou Office on the 3rd] At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the Wuhan Times office was suddenly smashed by a crowd of over fifty people wearing short coats and carrying a banner reading "Hubei People's Anti-Insult Movement Congress." According to the newspaper's president, Dai Zhen, the crowd arrived in formation, stating their intention to smash the office but not to injure anyone. The total damage is estimated at nearly one hundred million yuan. By the time the police arrived, the crowd had already left, leaving only the banner and several leaflets, accusing the newspaper of selling out the personality of the Hubei people and publishing text that violated the "Anti-Insult Movement Congress." Afterwards, reporters from the Shanghai newspaper visited the security authorities and Sun Weiru, the deputy director of the Xingyuan, and Wang Tianming, the chief of staff. They stated that the case had not yet been reported, but from a security standpoint, it was unfortunate, and they would immediately investigate it thoroughly.

### Center of Shandong Battlefield Shifts East; Fierce Battles in Tanjiafangzi, Zuoshan, and Other Places; National Army in Hebei Province Advances South, Approaching Wanxian County

[Report from our Jinan Office on the 3rd] The area outside Jinan has been fairly quiet for the past few days. However, in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, from Tanjiafangzi in the west to Jiaoxian in the east, the war has fully broken out since the 1st. The Communist forces used to attack the outer ring of Weixian were divided into three routes. One route consisted of the 15th New Regiment, the Joint Defense Brigade, the Jiaoji Brigade, etc., totaling 5,000 troops, attacking Tanjiafangzi Station, 13 kilometers west of Xinle, and Tianma, 10 kilometers north of it. Another route followed the Liyi Highway south from Huibu, attacking Changyi, northeast of Weixian. After inflicting heavy casualties on the Communist forces, the National Army in this area has transferred to the mountainous area near the south of the city. Another route, consisting of the 5th and 6th Relief Divisions and the 3rd Police Brigade, etc., totaling over 10,000 troops, with over ten artillery pieces, attacked Zuoshan Station, 30 kilometers southeast of Lixian. As of the evening of the 2nd, fierce fighting was still ongoing. In addition, fierce battles have also broken out since the evening of the 2nd in Leigou, Xia Zhuang, north and south of Gaomi, and Wanghuangmiao, northwest of Jiaoxian. At the same time, a large force of Communist troops was transferred east, north of Yidu in central Shandong. Another large force of Communist troops was discovered continuously in Yangjiaogou, north of Shouguang. Judging by their actions, it seems that they first plan to sweep the entire Jiaoji Line, combine the Communist forces in eastern Shandong and central Shandong, and then attack Jinan and Qingdao.

[Report from our Xuzhou Office on the 3rd] There were no major changes in the Jinpu Railway situation on the 3rd. The National Army in Wenshang and Qufu continued to consolidate their new positions on the 3rd. The battle situation will develop significantly in a day or two. Also, there are no traces of Communist forces on both sides of the highway from Haizhou to Linyi.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The National Army in the central area and on both wings of the Jinpu Railway has been conducting extensive search-and-mop-up operations for days and has achieved considerable results.

[Report from our Beiping Office on the 3rd] Laiyuan, at the foot of the Taihang Mountains in southern Chahar, was occupied by the National Army on the 28th of last month and is continuing to be mopped up. There are currently no Communist forces in the mountainous area from Yixian Zijin Pass to Laiyuan. The troops that recovered Mancheng continue to search. A part of the Communist forces, consisting of two brigades, has sneaked into Xinle, south of Shijiazhuang. In addition, near Changxindian, south of Beiping, seven Communist brigades were discovered on the morning of the 3rd, but they actually number less than 4,000 troops and are attempting to attack Changxindian.

[Report from our Beiping Office on the 3rd] Shunyi County, on the Beiping-Gubei Line, was attacked by over 1,000 Communist troops last night. They retreated at dawn. A section of the railway near Zhangxin Station was destroyed.

### Communist Personnel in Beijing and Shanghai Are Gradually Withdrawing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] According to sources from the American embassy, the withdrawal of Communist personnel in Nanjing began on the 2nd. Three planes flew to Yan'an on that day, carrying Communist personnel and five family members. According to the American embassy spokesman, the withdrawal is currently proceeding smoothly.

[News from our correspondent] After the list of Communist personnel withdrawing from Shanghai was submitted the day before yesterday, it was decided that they would take the express train to Beijing at 7:00 AM tomorrow. The Garrison Headquarters will send personnel to provide adequate protection along the way. After arriving in Beijing, they will join the Communist personnel in Beijing and, on the 7th, the American side will send five military planes to return them to Yan'an. As for whether the Communist representative to the Executive Headquarters should also withdraw at the same time, military and political authorities are requesting instructions from Nanjing.

### Dong Biwu Went to Beijing Yesterday, Still Attempting to Delay the Withdrawal

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] Communist representative Dong Biwu, who had gone to Shanghai to negotiate about the negotiations, returned to Beijing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd because the withdrawal was imminent. He received strict protection along the way. After resting at the Lianluo Office in Meiyuan New Village, he immediately visited Zhang Zhizhong, still attempting to make a final effort to delay the withdrawal date. He then visited Zhang Qun to discuss the issue of transportation for Communist Party personnel in Chongqing and Chengdu. He returned to the Lianluo Office after visiting Bu Lizhi. Dong is scheduled to bid farewell to all parties at noon on the 4th and is scheduled to leave Beijing by plane on the 7th. There are still 25 people at the Beijing office, all of whom plan to leave Beijing on the 7th. A roster of personnel at that office was sent to the Capital Garrison Headquarters on the morning of the 3rd. This roster includes the forty-plus people who withdrew to Yan'an yesterday morning. There are currently 25 Communist Party members waiting to leave Beijing by plane.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] It is learned that regarding the limited withdrawal order, the Nanjing Communist delegation recently sent a letter in reply to the Capital Garrison Headquarters, stating: "The air transport provided by the American side cannot be fully allocated within the time limit set by your department and must be extended to the 7th of this month. If the weather is not a problem, the personnel and family members of our office remaining in Beijing will definitely fly to Yan'an on the 7th. We are now sending two copies of the roster of the personnel of our office remaining in Beijing and the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, as well as a list of transportation, radio stations, and pistols, for your review. As for the transportation of our office, which was originally purchased, we plan to entrust the Democratic League to keep it in custody. The three self-defense pistols were originally for the representatives' use."

[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, issued a statement yesterday on the withdrawal of Communist personnel and the overall reorganization of the government, stating: The Communist Party's refusal to recognize any agreements concluded by the government after June of last year is the main reason for the government limiting the Communist Party's stay of personnel. Since the National Government is the legitimate government recognized by the international community, it has the right to conclude treaties with any country. Now the Communist Party suddenly declares that it does not recognize the legal basis of the said treaties, which is equivalent to not recognizing the legitimate status of the National Government. From this point alone, it can be seen that the Communist Party obviously has no sincerity in resuming peace talks with the government. The withdrawal of Communist personnel is, of course, the proper move.

### Communist Personnel at the Executive Headquarters Have Not Yet Decided Whether to Stay or Leave

[Central News Agency, This City] After the Communist personnel stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing were ordered to withdraw completely before March 5, the Communist representatives participating in the Executive Headquarters relief work have not yet decided whether to stay or leave.

Huo Bingshu, the director of the Executive Headquarters, notified the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in the name of the Executive Headquarters. Huo also went to Beijing last night to request instructions from the authorities.

### Xuzhou and Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters Abolished; Chief of Staff Chen and Gu Zhutong Arrive in Xuzhou; Xue Yue to be Transferred to a Senior Position in the Ministry of National Defense

[Report from our Xuzhou Office on the 3rd] The Central Government, in order to accelerate the completion of the troop reorganization and road restoration plan, due to the settling of northern Jiangsu, the restoration of the glory of eastern Henan, and the changing situation in Hebei and Henan, has abolished the Xuzhou and Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters.

### The National Army's Strong Fighting Power is Increasingly Proven in Defeating Communist Offensives in Various Areas

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] After Chen Yi's defeat in southern Shandong, in order to stabilize internal morale and reverse the declining situation, the Communist Party launched a propaganda war of spreading rumors and a large-scale offensive propaganda war in the vicinity of Jinan and in the Northeast. They fabricated results of battles and amplified propaganda in order to divert attention and confuse the audience. However, their offensive on the Jinan front remains unsuccessful to this day, and the offensive has stalled. In the Northeast, the Communist Party mobilized 250,000 troops and launched a full-scale invasion, attempting to restore their reputation and expand the rebellion. They completed preparations on the 20th of last month and invaded south across the Songhua River. The National Army, in order to lure the enemy deep and inflict a heavy blow, except for leaving a small number of troops at the bridgehead north of the Songhua River and in Dehui, gradually retreated. The Communist forces thought they had succeeded and reached the line of Mishazi, Wanbaoshan, and Xiaohelong on the 27th. At that time, the National Army at the bridgehead north of the Songhua River, after being fiercely attacked by Communist forces with more than twenty times their strength since the 21st, were still able to respond calmly and remain standing to this day. In the Dehui area, the two-division garrison has been fiercely attacked by the main force of six Communist divisions, with 21 tanks and over 100 large and small artillery pieces, since the 23rd. The National Army fought a hundred against one, repeatedly charging and killing, advancing and retreating several times, killing over 20,000 Communist troops. The Communist forces suffered this blow, and their momentum was immediately checked. The main force of the National Army completed its assembly in the area north of Changchun on the 28th and, according to the pre-determined plan, launched a sudden counterattack with thunderous force. The momentum was like splitting bamboo, and the Communist forces suffered widespread casualties, scrambling to flee north, abandoning countless military supplies. The vanguard of the National Army reached Dehui on the morning of the 3rd. The siege of that city has been lifted, and the main force is pursuing north. The Communist offensive in the Northeast, which had been preparing for over half a year, has now been completely crushed. This battle not only caused heavy losses to the Communist forces, but also proved that the National Army's fighting power is sufficient to fight against and defeat Communist forces twenty times their size. This point is particularly noteworthy.

### End Party Rule and Return Political Power to the People; Third Plenary Session to Announce to Chinese and Foreign Personnel

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] Zhong Wangqijiang said that this Third Plenary Session is more important than all previous plenary sessions.

### Inauguration of Zhang Ji, Director of the National History Museum; Chairman Chiang Personally Conferred the Seal and Delivered an Admonitory Speech to Encourage Joint Completion of the Mission of National Construction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Father Memorial Week and the inauguration ceremony of Zhang Ji, Director of the National History Museum, and others were held jointly at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 3rd.

### Gold Note Exchange Rate Unlikely to Change

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the fluctuations of Chinese stocks and public bonds in the Shanghai financial market in the past two days, an official from the Ministry of Finance told reporters: "The rumors that this is related to the departure of T.V. Soong are excessively sensitive and have led to this situation. It will definitely calm down in the very short term." Regarding the rumors in Shanghai that the gold price listing will be adjusted recently, it is not credible, because the official price of 4.8 million taels of gold is determined based on the exchange rate of 12,000 US dollars. Therefore, if the US dollar exchange rate does not change, the gold price will not change. At the same time, the US dollar exchange rate will not change at any time."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Economic Policy Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 3rd in the temporary conference room of the Central Party Headquarters, presided over by Minister Chen Lifu.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] After two deputy military attachés of the US Embassy were captured by the Communist army near Changchun on the 1st, the US Embassy here notified the CCP personnel stationed in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, notifying Yan'an to request their immediate release. However, as of the evening of the 3rd, there was no telegram from Yan'an.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The reporter recently visited Mr. Colebrook, the US Consul General in Harbin, to inquire about the detention of Major Rick and Captain Collins by the Communist army. According to reports, Major Robert Rick, Deputy Military Attaché of the US Embassy in China, and Captain John Collins were driving a jeep at noon on the 1st when they were stopped and detained by the Communist army in Dajiazi Village, four kilometers southeast of Kalun (23 kilometers east of Changchun). According to the driver who escaped from Changchun, the two men had not been harmed until he left Major Rick and others, so he believed that they were only detained by the Communist army and would be released in order. As for their current location and status, nothing was known as of the 2nd. Consul General Colebrook continued: "We still do not know the exact circumstances of these two US military officers after they were detained." He said: "The US is now questioning the Communist side through the CCP office in Nanjing, which is about to withdraw. We believe that Major Rick and Captain Collins will be able to safely return to Changchun in the short term. Mrs. Rick and her seven-year-old daughter and Mrs. Collins are all currently residing in Changchun."

### Government Decides to Reorganize Early; Completion Possible Before the Opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee; Lei Zhen, Zhang Junmai, and Others Arrive in Nanjing to Discuss

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Central figures have stated that the government reorganization plan will be expedited. It is generally believed that the reorganization can be completed before the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee on the 15th. Lei Zhen has discussed the government reorganization plan with various parties in Shanghai and has achieved results. Mr. Lei, along with Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, and others, will arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 4th to consult with the central government.

[Our Newspaper Report] Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, returned to Nanjing by night train yesterday. Before leaving, he told reporters that the government does not want only the Youth Party to participate in the government alone, so he was ordered to come to Shanghai to invite representatives of the Social Democratic Party to Nanjing. Most of the party's standing committee members are in Nanjing to discuss with the government, hoping to make a decision on full participation. As for the manner in which the Nanjing talks will be conducted, whether the two parties, social figures, and government representatives will gather together to discuss the overall reorganization; or whether individual negotiations will be conducted, it will be decided entirely by the Chairman, and I cannot answer.

[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Social Democratic Party, and the standing committee members remaining in Shanghai took the night train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM last night to discuss the overall reorganization of the government with the authorities. They plan to stay in Nanjing for two or three days, which may be extended if necessary. According to reliable sources from various parties, although the Social Democratic Party made a decision at the standing committee meeting the day before yesterday to limit participation in the government to four institutions, if the authorities can provide a guarantee to abolish one-party rule, the party's full participation does not necessarily have to be after the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. It is heard that among the standing committee members remaining in Shanghai, very few firmly advocate not participating further. Most advocate conditional participation, such as the government enabling the Social Democratic Party to participate in the secrets of national defense, diplomacy, and finance, so that they can understand the actual situation of national affairs. It is generally believed that there are still ways to deal with finance during the transition period, and that internal strife is not caused by the Social Democratic Party's participation in the government, so joining the government will not "take the blame for others." In addition, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao's visit to the south has had a considerable impact on Mr. Zhang Junmai's attitude, so if the authorities can sincerely invite him, the negotiations in Nanjing are expected to yield concrete results.

[Central News Agency, This City] Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, and Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, returned to Nanjing by train at 11:00 PM last night. Among those traveling with them were Zuo Shunsheng and Zhang Bolun of the Youth Party, and Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Wan Renqian, Feng Jinbai, Tang Zhuxin, Sun Baogang, Ji Yiqiao, Lu Guangsheng, Wang Shiming and twelve other people of the Social Democratic Party. Li Huang of the Youth Party will also go to Nanjing in the next day or two due to matters in Shanghai. After all the central standing committee members of the two parties, the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party, arrive in Nanjing, they will meet with the central standing committee members of the two parties remaining in Nanjing to conduct important negotiations with the highest authorities on further reorganization of the government. Zhang Junmai said: "Regarding our party's attitude towards the government reorganization, it is still the same as stated in the previous statement on participating in four institutions. This trip to Nanjing will first listen to the government's opinions before making a decision." He said that he only intends to delay for one day in Nanjing before returning to Shanghai, because he must make full preparations before going to India to participate in the Asian conference.

[Also] The Democratic League decided yesterday not to submit Zhang Lan's letter to Chairman Chiang, but will issue a statement to the outside world within days, detailing the Democratic League's attitude towards the current situation. The draft statement was taken to Nanjing by Ye Duyi last night to solicit the consent of the Democratic League members remaining in Nanjing before it can be published.

### Zhang Qun Denies Presiding Over Reorganization

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, on the 3rd and asked whether it was true that Zhang was ordered to preside over the reorganization of the government and was appointed as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Chairman Zhang replied: "I have participated in discussions on the reorganization of the government, but I have not been ordered to preside over it. All kinds of rumors are unfounded, but I am sorry that these newspaper reports have increased a lot of work for my secretary."

### Fellowship Meeting of Students from the Central Training Corps in the United States; He Yingqin Delivers a Speech to Encourage; Should Study and Research Practical Problems More

[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing, New York, 2nd] There are more than 100 members of the New York branch of the Central Training Corps Alumni Association in the United States, spread all over the United States. Today, they held a fellowship meeting at the "Lushun Restaurant" here. A total of thirty-one members attended voluntarily. General He Yingqin delivered a speech on the spot, saying: "There are four factors that have made the United States the richest and most powerful country in the world, namely, the high level of dedication of civil servants, the close cooperation between the people and the government, the excellence and foresight of planning, and the tradition of democracy." General He also analyzed the differences between Chinese and American rural areas, saying: "I have traveled through fourteen states in the United States and often feel that Chinese farmers are fifty years behind in life. This is really unfortunate. When I arrived in northern Kodak, I investigated the American land system and found that the poorest American farmers also own 240 acres of land, which is six times more than the land owned by my family in Guizhou Province, but the Chinese Communists still refer to me as a big landlord. This shows how pitiful the Chinese are."

General He Yingqin encouraged the students of the Central Training Corps to study the academic subjects that China urgently needs and to jointly study China's problems, such as improving agriculture, in a practical way. In short, they must use their time to serve the motherland in a useful way and try to correct the American people's misconceptions about China.

General He also said: "The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee will open on March 15th. He has made a proposal calling for the development of China's agricultural economy, the improvement of farmers' lives, the implementation of our party's policy of 'land to the tiller,' and the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood through scientific methods."

According to General Bao Yingqin's words to reporters: "He has just returned from a visit to the West Coast and has inspected the agricultural conditions in fourteen states. The suggestions he has made to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee have been telegraphed to Nanjing, totaling about 1,000 words, and the important reference materials are all taken from the documents of the US Department of Agriculture." When asked about his observation of the current war situation in Shandong Province, he said: "Although there are difficulties at present, I firmly believe that the national army will be able to complete its mission." General He said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the future of the country will definitely be optimistic."

When the reporter asked about the reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense, he replied that it was purely a rumor.

General He expressed satisfaction and thanks for the speed with which Shen Bao was delivered to overseas readers (reaching them in seven days).

### Most of the 20,000 Overseas Chinese in Japan Live in Extreme Hardship

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Li Binghan, Director of Overseas Chinese Affairs of the Chinese Mission in Japan and former Specialist of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently issued a statement saying that there are approximately 20,000 overseas Chinese in Japan registered with the mission, most of whom live in "extreme hardship." Half of the registered overseas Chinese are Taiwanese, all of whom are small businessmen and restaurant owners. There are now more than 700 restaurants opened by Chinese in Japan. Li continued: "Overseas Chinese, like other Allied overseas Chinese, enjoy privileges in Japan, so they can obtain a large number of rations. Although Chinese overseas Chinese are not subject to Japanese criminal law, there are still 300 Taiwanese in Japanese prisons because American prisons cannot accommodate them. For the sake of the prestige of the Chinese government, they should be sent back home together with the unemployed, poor students, and those who voluntarily repatriate. Some of the traitors captured in Japan will also be transported back home for trial."

[Our Newspaper, Zhangyuan, 3rd] Minister Bai Chongxi, accompanied by Fu Zuoyi, Leng Xin, Deng Wenyi, and a group of fourteen people, arrived in Xuanhua at 3:00 AM this morning for a short rest. At 9:00 AM, they visited the Longyan Iron Mine, and at 10:00 AM, they arrived in Zhangyuan, where officers and soldiers lined up to welcome them.

Director Deng Wenyi summoned the personnel of the Provincial News Office for instructions. At 4:30 PM, he attended a mass rally of the people.

### Five Public Trials End in Debate; Tani Hisao to be Sentenced on the 10th; Looked Flustered and Depressed After Hearing the Court Order

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The fifth public trial of the Nanjing Massacre case began at 2:00 PM on the 3rd and continued to debate. Tani Hisao first refuted, repeating his words, completely quibbling, and his defense was lengthy, lasting for one hour and fifteen minutes. His main points were still the following: (1) The residents near Zhonghua Gate had already fled due to the fierce fighting. From a war point of view, the so-called massacre is not something that anyone can admit. (2) Tani's troops were stationed in empty houses or schools. (3) Tani patrolled outside on the 17th, 18th, and 19th and did not see any incidents. If there were any, it was after Tani left. (4) The location of the collective massacre is unknown, completely fabricated. Most of the three major incidents were within the stationing area of the 114th Division, and he requested that relevant personnel such as Yanagawa be called as witnesses. After he finished speaking, the translator continued to translate the unfinished arguments from the previous time. The prosecutor then refuted, and the lawyer Zhang Rende defended him. The presiding judge then declared that Tani was guilty of participating in military conspiracy, etc. Tani then made a final defense, roughly in four points: (1) It was a duty that could not be resisted to come to China to fight. (2) The Nakajima unit and Tani's unit are completely different and could not have committed such acts together. (3) The planned massacre at Zhonghua Gate cannot be admitted. (4) All the events were committed by other troops. When Tani submitted his final defense to the court, the presiding judge announced that the sentence would be announced at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. After hearing this, Tani looked flustered and hurriedly shouted that the sentence was being pronounced so quickly. He then made a request to call relevant personnel such as Yanagawa to testify in court and investigate the matter clearly. By that time, it was 7:30 PM, and the court was adjourned. Tani was taken back into custody after five hours of trial. His consistent arrogant and domineering attitude has now had to be replaced with depression. Everyone believes that Tani's crimes are so heinous that he will definitely not escape death.

### Coincidence; Forged Money Organs Cracked in Peiping and Hangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] A shocking case of forging money was recently cracked in Peiping. All six criminals have been arrested, and three large printing machines and many other printing materials have been seized. Liu Keding, 43 years old, from Hejian, lives at No. 4 Yanshou Temple, Peiping. Yang Kexian, who lives at No. 2 Elephant Nose Back Alley, both wear general uniforms and travel by car. They both claim to be commanders of a certain army. Both houses have secret rooms, in which printing machines are set up to forge 2,000 yuan banknotes of the Central Bank.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd dispatch] Mayor Shen Yi previously learned that the German expatriate John Rabe spared no effort to save our compatriots during the fall of Nanjing, despite the hardships and dangers. Such humanitarian and righteous actions are truly admirable. Since Germany's surrender, Rabe's whereabouts have been unknown.

At the same time, he will also seek Rabe's opinion and invite him to come to China for rest and recuperation.

Editorial

### The Signing of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty

At 2:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) today, the Anglo-French alliance treaty will be signed in Dunkirk, a place with historical significance. The signing of this treaty is taking place on the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The French delegation to the Moscow Conference has extended their trip to Moscow for the signing of this treaty. Dunkirk holds deep significance for both Britain and France in World War II, and the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty in this historic city will undoubtedly evoke a profound sense of communion among the people of Britain and France. According to news reports, the treaty is valid for fifty years, and its important provisions include: (1) If Germany adopts an aggressive policy or any measures that endanger the security of both countries, Britain and France will decide to adopt coordinated policies to resist them; (2) If Britain or France is at war with Germany, whether to prevent German aggression or to implement resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, the other party must provide military assistance; (3) If Germany fails to fulfill its obligations in the future, the two countries must reach an agreement on how to deal with Germany; (4) Britain and France should consult with each other and decide on actions regarding economic issues of concern to each other. Based on these four points, it is clear that the purpose of the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty is to prevent Germany from rising again. Regarding the signing of this alliance treaty, we hereby state our views as follows:

The first thing we must point out is that some people believe that the purpose of the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty is to form a Western European alliance to counter the Soviet Union. Looking at the main provisions of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, its purpose is more accurately described as targeting Germany rather than the Soviet Union. France and Germany are adjacent to each other, and France has fought against Germany twice in the past thirty years; France has always harbored a sense of fear towards its eastern neighbor. Now that Germany has surrendered, in light of the experience of World War I, the Fourth French Republic has always been wary of its neighbor east of the Rhine; in order to prevent the recurrence of this painful experience and to prevent France from being invaded by Germany again, the Anglo-French alliance treaty has been signed. Its purpose is more accurately described as preventing the resurgence of Germany rather than preventing the further expansion of Soviet power, so the signing of this alliance treaty is definitely not a combination of an anti-Soviet Western European bloc.

France and Germany were originally brotherly nations; in the era of the Carolingian Empire, France and Germany were one family, with no distinction between them. After the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, the histories of Germany and France embarked on different paths; during this time, the emotions between the two nations became increasingly deteriorated. To this day, France's policy towards Germany is still to prevent the resurgence of a unified and powerful Germany. Today, France's policy towards Germany is still to advocate the separation of the Ruhr region from Germany, the annexation of the Saar region to France, the internationalization of the Rhineland region, and the federalization of Germany, as well as the demand for appropriate reparations. All of these measures are aimed at making the re-emergence of a strong and unified Germany impossible. The signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty is aimed at preventing the re-emergence of this strong and unified Germany. We do not wish to discuss whether France's adoption of this policy towards Germany and Britain's alliance with France as a result are wise and well-considered; however, international treaties, especially alliance treaties, undoubtedly benefit both signatory countries. Otherwise, there would be no need to sign such a treaty. It is under these mutually beneficial conditions that we see the conclusion of the Anglo-French alliance treaty.

Regarding the future of Germany, it is undoubtedly tied to the peace of Europe and even the entire world thereafter. Since the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty is aimed at Germany, its significance must be fully understood from a broader perspective. First, the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty complements the Anglo-Soviet alliance and the Franco-Soviet alliance. There already exists an alliance relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union and France and the Soviet Union, but it would have been regrettable if Britain and France, as traditional allies, did not have an alliance relationship after this war. The Anglo-French alliance was advocated as early as two years ago, when relations between Britain and France were quite tense over the issue of Syria and the Near East. The signing of this alliance treaty fills a missing link and is something that everyone expects. Second, now that there is an alliance relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and the purpose of this alliance is to target Germany, we firmly believe that it will further lead to the possibility of an agreement between Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union on Germany. Although the United States is not a European country, it has participated in two world wars for the sake of the European situation; the United States cannot stand idly by regarding the situation in Germany. Therefore, on the eve of the convening of the Moscow Conference, making the Anglo-French alliance a fait accompli, in a sense, is sufficient to promote the establishment of an agreement among Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the European situation. The cooperation under difficult and arduous circumstances during the war should be further strengthened after the enemy's collapse in order to solidify the alliance forged during the war.

In this sense, what we feel is regrettable is that there are no signs of further cooperation to solidify the wartime alliance with Japan's wartime allies; and among them, there may even be some allies who are even supporting the rise of a newly emerging Japan after the war. The purpose of the multilateral alliance in Europe is to target Germany. Why can't we, in Asia, have the same post-war development as Europe among our wartime allies? In Europe, we should prevent the resurgence of Germany after the war; shouldn't we also prevent the resurgence of Japan after the war in Asia? In Europe, we see the possibility of a bilateral alliance leading to a four-power agreement; in Asia, shouldn't we also follow the example of continental Europe, form alliances, and then have multilateral agreements to prevent the resurgence of Japan after the war? We are an Asian country, and we are naturally deeply concerned about the resurgence of Japan after the war. Among China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, we should separately sign alliances; and then have a multilateral agreement between China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. The 20th century is known as the Pacific Century, and the maintenance of peace in the Pacific is related to the safety and security of the world's future, and its significance is particularly important. Under the United Nations structure, there can be regional agreements, which do not conflict with the spirit of the United Nations structure. We hope that due to the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty and the evolution of the European situation, our diplomatic authorities can also take the same initiative regarding the Asian situation, especially regarding post-war Japan.

However, there is one thing we must say here, that is, the most important part of the signing of a treaty is how to fulfill the treaty obligations thereafter. After World War I, there was also a period of extremely active treaty signing. However, of the treaties signed at that time, how many were able to faithfully fulfill their treaty obligations? Whether the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty can have the expected results depends on whether its treaty obligations can be faithfully fulfilled in the future. Although the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty received enthusiastic support in the French National Assembly, general observers in Paris are still concerned about the Communist Party's opposition to the signing of this treaty. Whether Britain and France can have a coordinated pace regarding Germany and Western Europe thereafter depends on whether the obligations stipulated in this treaty will be faithfully fulfilled thereafter. But in any case, having a treaty is better than not having a treaty. It is in this sense that we express our pleasure at the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty.

### Bevin and Bidault Head to Dunkirk; Anglo-French Alliance Treaty to Be Signed Today; World Public Opinion Generally Welcomes It

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to leave London by train at 9:20 AM on the 4th for Dover, where he will transfer to a destroyer to head to Dunkirk to sign the Anglo-French alliance treaty. Defense Minister Alexander and a certain official from the reserve department will accompany him.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd dispatch] French Foreign Minister Bidault is scheduled to leave Paris by special train on the morning of the 4th to meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in the port of Dunkirk to sign the Anglo-French alliance treaty. Bidault is expected to arrive in Dunkirk at 1:00 PM, and the signing ceremony will be held in the afternoon. Bevin will arrive in Dunkirk by British destroyer, and the Governor of the Pas-de-Calais department in France is preparing to lead a welcome party.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd dispatch] The news of the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty has aroused worldwide concern. However, the officialdoms of several countries have not yet commented. All newspapers in the nation have printed this matter with extensive coverage and have added commentary, which generally expresses approval.

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 3rd dispatch] Regarding the matter of the Anglo-French signing of an alliance treaty, the officialdom here has not yet made any reactions. However, many political figures who admire the Eastern neighbor have expressed satisfaction. They all say that the joint statement regarding the forthcoming signing of the convention recently released by France and Czechoslovakia, and the explanation issued by Foreign Minister Masaryk and the French ambassador, are all enough to dispel the various doubts raised by the Anglo-French alliance. However, the general perception is that the goal of the Anglo-French cooperation is to organize a Western European anti-Soviet bloc. The reason why the reportage here publishes the news with very little coverage is probably due to this.

### The Situation in Greece Is Extremely Delicate; America Faces a Major Diplomatic Test; Acheson Authorized to Negotiate with Congressional Leaders

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd dispatch] It is learned that President Truman has authorized Under Secretary of State Acheson to inform Republican financial experts in Congress of the complete truth about the administration's foreign loan regarding the diplomatic crisis faced by Greece. Some Republicans have reportedly expressed sympathy with President Truman's desire to shoulder the cost of British troops stationed in Greece in order to prevent Greece from falling into Communist hands, but they are still hesitant to hand over a blank check to the administration. Representative Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, held secret meetings with Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and leaders of both parties in Congress last week to discuss the delicate situation in Greece. On the 3rd, he told the Associated Press that Acheson had been commissioned to draft a detailed analysis of the foreign financial burdens that the administration has decided on or is considering, but there is still no indication whether this study will be prepared in time to be presented at the Appropriations Committee meeting scheduled for Marshall's attendance tomorrow. At that time, Taber will scrutinize the State Department's funding request. Although the Moscow Conference is important, it is understood that the delicate situation in Greece, which President Truman and Marshall are concerned about, is the most important diplomatic issue facing the United States. The Appropriations Committee chaired by Taber will be the main factor in deciding the fate of the request for $250 million to assist British troops stationed in Greece. According to diplomatic sources, a setback in the United States' tough action in Greece would result in a serious setback at the Moscow Conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 3rd dispatch] The government announced today that if Britain finds it impossible to continue stationing troops in Greece for three months, the Greek government should be prepared to entrust the United States with maintaining Greek troops.

Greek Army Size to Be Increased to 200,000

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 2nd dispatch] Regarding the economic aspect of the Anglo-American negotiations for American assistance to Greece, it is understood that the Greek government held a state council meeting last night to discuss the ongoing Anglo-American negotiations. According to informed sources, the Anglo-American negotiations are not only related to economic assistance, but also to the entire Greek issue. In addition, it is understood that the Greek government has instructed its ambassadors to Britain and the United States to request the United States and Britain to allow Greece to increase its army quota to 200,000 men. In addition, the rumor that the United States will lend Greece $250 million has not been confirmed by the American authorities.

### German Socialist Unity Party

Demands the Establishment of a Central Government as Soon as Possible

[Our dispatch] London, 3rd broadcast: On the eve of the Moscow Conference, the German Socialist Unity Party, controlled by the Communist Party, issued a statement calling on the German people to hold a referendum on the merger of the four occupation zones and demanding the establishment of a German central government as soon as possible. In view of the upcoming Moscow Conference, the party strongly stated that the German democratic and anti-fascist front should unite as one to resolve the current national crisis.

### Japanese War Criminal Lawyers Defend Breach of Contract

Citing Incidents in Finland, England, Iran, etc.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 3rd dispatch] A fierce debate arose today between the defense lawyers and the presiding judge at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Defense lawyer Blakeney, in defending Japan's anti-treaty stance, cited the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, arguing that the Soviet Union, which is participating in the trial of Japanese war criminals, is also a violator of treaties. The presiding judge stated: "Our task is to determine a war of aggression, not to deal with all wars of aggression in the world. These treaties have lost their legal effect with penalties."

The defense lawyer also wanted to present Churchill's "Statement on the Actions Taken by Britain in Iran" as evidence, but after deliberation by the presiding judge and judges, it was declared that documents related to Russia and the Baltic states, Russia and Britain's relations with Iran, Greenland, Iceland, Denmark, etc., would not be accepted.

The defense lawyer also stated: "The use of the atomic bomb is related to the matter of retaliation in the prosecution." The presiding judge immediately declared that documents related to the atomic bomb would not be accepted.

### Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's Diary of Nine Hundred Volumes, Valuable Content to Be Published in Summary

### Moscow Conference Approaching, European Small Countries Give Importance

[Associated Press, Stockholm, 2nd dispatch] All small European countries are now focusing on the Moscow Conference. This feeling is particularly strong in Sweden. Official sources believe that if a third world war were to occur again, Sweden would have little chance of maintaining neutrality as in the second world war. When diplomatic conflicts occur between the Soviet Union and Western powers, Swedish policy is to take a middle path, especially in trade. The Swedish government is pleased with the agreement it signed with the Soviet Union last year and the gradual improvement of Swedish-Soviet relations, regardless of criticism from U.S. officials who fear the growth of Soviet power, and is determined to avoid becoming a vassal of any major power. However, if the East and West continue to drift apart, it will be quite difficult for this country, which is geographically in the East but has Western customs, to avoid becoming a vassal. Therefore, diplomatic authorities here generally believe that the fate of small European countries depends on whether a balance can be maintained among Washington, London, and Moscow. The ease with which the Swedish people become terrified can be seen from the mysterious rockets of last summer. Regarding the rocket news, the authorities have now disclosed almost everything. According to a recognized report from the United States, more than 800 rockets were discovered over Sweden, but qualified sources claim that detailed investigations by military experts show that the number does not exceed 3 to 5 percent of that number, and even if so, there is no concrete evidence of flying over Sweden, because no debris has been found. But these kinds of terrifying rumors give the Swedish people a future vision of new-style warfare, along with knowledge of the devastating power of atomic weapons, making them believe that the only way to achieve neutrality is to rely on world peace.

### Truman Flies to Mexico, U.S.-Mexico Friendly Relations Will Become More Consolidated

This trip to Mexico is a "goodwill" tour. Truman will make two speeches, the first on Monday night in Mexico City, and the second in Waco, Texas. The Mexican Ambassador to the United States accompanied President Truman to Mexico. These two diplomats expect that this visit to Mexico will further consolidate the already friendly relations between the two countries and show the world that the United States' Good Neighbor Policy is still effective. Mexican President Alemán will meet him at the Mexico City airport.

### A Visit to Penang, Hometown of Wealthy Overseas Chinese Merchants

— Special Translation by the Editorial Office of this Newspaper

All cities in the Far East have a prominent feature. Penang, a clean and prosperous seaport on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, is known to the world as the hometown of wealthy overseas Chinese merchants.

Originally, the British recruited Chinese laborers to work in rubber plantations and tin mines here. Now, these hardworking and thrifty Chinese laborers themselves own many plantations and tin mines, and have become leading merchants in Malaya.

Although it is impossible to know exactly how many wealthy overseas Chinese merchants live here, the exquisite residences you see in the western suburbs are mostly the properties of Chinese mining magnates, plantation owners, or wealthy merchants.

During the Japanese occupation, most of the overseas Chinese took refuge in the interior of Malaya, and now they have returned to their old homes. At present, bandits are rampant in various parts of Malaya, and wealthy overseas Chinese are often kidnapped. For safety reasons, they have moved to Penang, because overseas Chinese in Penang are protected by local military police and can avoid the risk of being kidnapped.

Penang is also famous like Singapore, but it occupies an important page in British colonial history and boasts the longest-running English-language newspaper west of the Suez Canal.

The cargo transportation here is now crowded again. The quantity of export goods is increasing monthly, and will soon reach pre-war figures. Raw rubber is the main export commodity. The quantity of automobile tires exported from Penang is second only to Singapore in Southeast Asia.

The shops in the commercial district of Penang are lined up one after another, with goods piled up like mountains, mostly opened by overseas Chinese and Indians. Although the prices are high, the quality is better than in other parts of the Far East. Before the war, silks, exquisite handicrafts, and beautiful gems imported from China were sold at lower prices than in Singapore, where all the good things were swallowed up by the large occupation army.

Fruits and vegetables are abundant here, but there is a rice shortage, which is the greatest suffering of the people. Rationed rice sells for only two cents per pound, but the ration is only four ounces per day for adults and two ounces per day for children, which is not enough. Rice on the black market sells for as much as five cents per pound. Sugar is not rationed and must be obtained from the black market, selling for $1.25 per pound.

Penang was occupied by the Japanese army in the early days of the war, but the scars left by the war are not many. The damage caused by the United Nations bombers is greater than that caused by the Japanese army. The local tin smelting plant—one of the two largest tin smelting plants in the Far East—became a military target for American Flying Fortresses and was destroyed.

Penang is one of the most beautiful holiday resorts in Southeast Asia. Europeans and Chinese who feel that life is monotonous and tired in the interior of Malaya or in bustling Singapore often come here for sightseeing.

A total of 332,111 U.S. dollars were seized on the spot, as well as 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, 38 large bars of gold, and many account books, remittance drafts, and stubs. The principal offender is a Dutch national named Fredrik Mysberg, 55 years old, who was also arrested at the scene.

The secret organization is outwardly called Abis.Co and is registered with the U.S. government, specializing in the black market trade of foreign exchange, U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollar notes, British pounds, and gold. The daily turnover is hundreds of millions of legal tender. There are more than sixty Chinese and foreign merchants among its customers. During this gold rush, the company had massively purchased more than 2 million U.S. dollars in advance and immediately announced to the public that the government's foreign exchange was exhausted and that those who needed foreign exchange in the future must purchase it with U.S. dollars. Merchants were temporarily unaware of the truth and sought it from the black market, and the company took the opportunity to raise prices, creating an unprecedented and shocking price, resulting in a surplus of more than 800,000 U.S. dollars under the company's U.S. dollar account. However, good times did not last long, and after our government implemented emergency economic measures, the company could no longer engage in speculative manipulation.

Unexpectedly, within a few days, the company revived and continued to secretly engage in the buying and selling of foreign currency and gold foreign exchange. The company also has a branch in the United States, and at the same time, it purchases checks issued by the U.S. military at black market prices to arbitrage and obtain huge profits. Finally, the Investigation Department of our Garrison Command learned of this. After Director Tao Yishan verified the facts yesterday morning, he reported it to Commander Xuan Tie-wu and then went to the Foreign Exchange Audit Department of the Central Bank. After discussing the steps with Director Lin, the department dispatched two auditors, Ren Gai and Xu Renji, to start the operation together at 3:00 p.m. Under the personal leadership of Inspector-General Lu Kun, First Investigation Brigade Commander Wu Run-sun, Brigade Adjutant Tang Yu-yuan, Squad Leaders Zhang Hanyuan, Jin Suhua, Foreign Affairs Team Leader Zhao Guanglu, Deputy Inspector-General Cheng Yichuan, and others rushed to monitor the entrances and exits and telephone switchboards of the second floor of the building and then rushed into room 118.

At that time, dozens of people were gathered there, carrying out secret delivery procedures. When they saw the police officers suddenly arrive, they were all frightened. However, only 2,111 U.S. dollars were seized at that time. After the company manager, Frederick Mysberg, was arrested, 330,000 U.S. dollars, 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, 38 gold bars, and a large number of important account books, remittance drafts, and stubs were seized in the manager's office. Inspector-General Lu ordered Mysberg to seal them after counting and handed them over to the two auditors, Ren and Xu, of the Central Bank to take back for safekeeping. At the same time, two other important employees (Westerners) of the company were also taken to the headquarters for interrogation.

According to the account records, the company still has a large amount of legal tender. Not long before yesterday's crackdown, 600 million yuan was transferred to the Dutch Bank. At the same time, Mysberg was calm when he was arrested and asked the police officers not to involve irrelevant money in the case. The company also has several safe deposit boxes, which are said to be deposited by customers. The police officers granted his request and sealed them together with the Central Bank before the accounts are verified.

After Mysberg was taken to the Garrison Command, dusk was approaching. Two Western legal consultants of the company went to request bail, but they were rejected by the Garrison Command. At the same time, the Garrison Command has asked an accountant to start checking the account books overnight. As for the rumor that the company has used the name of Xinfeng Foreign Firm as a cover, it will not be clear until the account check is completed.

### Labor-Management Evaluation Conference Decides on Detailed Rules for Differential Subsidy System; Revisions to Methods of Granting Leave for Weddings and Funerals Passed

[Report from this newspaper] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee held its eighth meeting yesterday afternoon in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau. Attending were Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Wei, Du Yuesheng (represented by Zhu Wende), Xuan Tiewu (represented by Huang Dongsheng), Shui Xiangyun, Huang Rengui, She Jingcheng, Wu Yunzhu (represented by Tian Heqing). Also present were Li Jianhua, Liu Jingyan, Fan Zhenbang, etc. After the freezing of the cost of living index, the differential subsidy system was implemented in February, stipulating a subsidy of 73,000 yuan per person. Various factory guilds are very concerned and have requested the Social Affairs Bureau to explain. However, because there is no unified method, it is feared that disputes will arise in the future, so it was discussed and decided to issue differential wages, and the detailed rules are: (1) Piecework: Regardless of the amount of work produced by the workers, the number of working days will be used as the standard for issuing differential wages. (2) Child labor (including apprentices, skilled apprentices, trainees, etc.): Those who have been provided with free meals will not be issued differential wages for rice, oil, salt, and coal, only for cloth and sugar. Those who are not provided with meals will be given one-third of the differential wages. (3) If employees' wages are deducted for leave, the differential wages will be deducted proportionally. However, differential wages will not be deducted for sick leave. In addition, differential wages will not be deducted if wages are not deducted as a custom. (4) Factories, companies, and firms that dismiss employees and issue severance pay in accordance with the methods of the Evaluation Committee shall issue differential wages together with wages from February onwards. (5) Differential wages will no longer be issued for extended working hours and temporary processing. (6) Factories that have provided free rice in the past will not deduct the rice portion of the differential wages. (7) Differential wages will not be differentiated based on the amount of wages. In addition, how differential wages should be issued in the case of workers in the Western clothing and fashion industries during peak and off-peak months and shutdowns is still under study.

Next, the meeting discussed the methods for granting leave for weddings and funerals of spouses and immediate family members of workers in factories in the city. After revisions, it was passed and will be implemented after being submitted separately to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Social Affairs for approval. The main points are (1) The employee himself can take five days of wedding leave, the wedding leave for his children can take two days, and the funeral leave for his parents and spouse can take five days. (2) Those who have a long journey can be given additional travel leave. The date shall be determined by the factory. (3) Wages shall be paid during the leave period. (4) Piecework workers may refer to the provisions of these measures. (5) Factories that have already established wedding and funeral leave methods before the implementation of these measures shall continue to implement the original methods. (6) Temporary workers and contractors are not subject to these measures.

At the same time, two other proposals were passed: (1) The Meiguang Match Factory caused a dispute due to the transfer of employee Zhang Chunhua's work. The proposal to request the three committee members Shui Xiangyun, Huang Rengui, and She Jingcheng to persuade them to accept the Social Affairs Bureau's punishment was resolved. (2) The Meiguang Match Factory dismissed the case of worker Lu Yongrui with pulmonary disease. The resolution was: Wages equal to one month's notice period shall be issued in accordance with the Factory Law. Retirement pay shall be given in accordance with the settlement record, and relief funds equal to three months' wages shall be issued.

### Cigarette Industry Trade Union Requests Price Suppression

[Report from this newspaper] The Federation of Industrial Trade Unions of the Cigarette Industry, in view of the fact that workers' daily lives have been greatly affected since the cost of living index was frozen, gathered yesterday to discuss remedial measures. As a result of the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the government's freezing of the cost of living index was an unavoidable emergency measure and should advise all workers to endure it temporarily, but hoped that the government would announce the average price difference of daily necessities monthly, and also hoped that it would quickly suppress prices to be the same as in January to stabilize workers' lives. It has now been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for prompt processing. It is also reported that the association is extremely anxious that several cigarette factories have continued to lay off workers in large numbers recently and hopes that the government will quickly stop them to avoid increasing unemployment and affecting social security.

### Results of Research by Two Council Subgroups: Municipal Finances Cannot Be Balanced, Shortfall Reaches Over 220 Billion

[Our Report] The Budget and Finance Committees of the Municipal Council held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the municipal government's budget for the 36th year. Zhao Dihua presided over the meeting, attended by about 30 people, including members of both committees and heads of various municipal bureaus. Li Wenjie reported on the current budget statistics, stating that on the income side, the municipal government originally listed 143.9 billion yuan in regular revenue and 17.9 billion yuan in temporary revenue. After repeated discussions and item-by-item increases by the Budget Committee, the maximum increase could be 51.895 billion yuan, bringing the total revenue to 213.89 billion yuan. On the expenditure side, the original listing was 258.773 billion yuan, including cost-of-living allowances. However, with the continuous rise in prices, the various municipal bureaus proposed an additional 184.116 billion yuan. Adding 150 million yuan for conscription expenses, the total expenditure would be 443.0 billion yuan. The total shortfall between revenue and expenditure is 229.16 billion yuan. After inspecting the various bureaus and reviewing their reports, the committees concluded that it was difficult to further reduce expenditures. The staffing of each bureau has already been economized to the best of its ability. Therefore, it was proposed to further discuss how to make up for the expenditure shortfall. The discussion resulted in a decision to reduce the number of conscription centers for new recruits by two and the number of national guard training teams by 22 (both reduced by half), which would save approximately 2 billion yuan. However, it was impossible to decide on reducing other expenditures at this time. Furthermore, the substitute labor service fee for military service has no legal basis and cannot be collected, so this 40 billion yuan was not included. Currently, only the municipal construction donation of 28.9 billion yuan can be reconsidered. It was resolved to submit it to the general assembly for discussion. Regarding the budget increase requests from various municipal bureaus and offices, it was resolved that, based on the principle of living within one's means, the municipal government should recompile this year's expenditure budget.

(2) Request the general assembly to further discuss the proposal to improve police treatment, raise police quality, and eliminate bad habits.

The Public Works Committee also held a meeting yesterday to review and approve the Public Works Bureau's detailed implementation rules for managing construction contractors.

### Council to Reconvene on the 7th, Two-Day Agenda Set

### Mayor Wu Hosts Tea Party for Councilors, Hopes to Increase Municipal Government Revenue Within Reasonable Limits, Speaker Pan Suggests Municipal Donations Can Be Considered

[Our Report] Mayor Wu hosted a tea party for the city councilors at the Ewo Hotel yesterday at 5:00 PM, attended by Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, city councilors, and heads of various bureaus, totaling about 200 people.

Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating: When I first took office, I said that the city's economy would decline in six months. This prediction has now come true. 1947 is indeed one of the most difficult years. On behalf of my colleagues in the municipal government, we believe that if we could resign and have it approved during this period, it would be good luck. If we are dismissed, it is small luck. The third option is unspeakable.

If the Budget Cannot Be Resolved, Municipal Administration Cannot Be Implemented

The fewer people involved in handling affairs, the better the administrative efficiency. Therefore, I reduced the number of personnel considerably when I first came. However, if ten people's worth of work is not done by ten people, then it cannot be done. Therefore, those who cannot be reduced should not be forcibly reduced. The various committees of the Municipal Council have inspected the municipal government's various institutions, and I strongly agree with this. I hope everyone will contribute their opinions as much as possible. If there is a need for reductions, the municipal government will definitely comply. Regarding the budget issue, I feel deeply sorry because, unfortunately, prices have recently soared, and the budget initially drafted is now difficult to balance. This has troubled the Finance and Budget Committee, which has repeatedly discussed ways to find a solution. However, I hope the Municipal Council will take more responsibility and allow the municipal government to increase revenue within reasonable limits. If even the minimum budget cannot be approved, then no matter who is in charge of the municipal government, it will be impossible to implement policies.

Speaker Pan's Reply: The Key Lies in Prices

Speaker Pan then delivered a reply, stating that the budget issue is indeed a difficult one. During this period of unstable prices, I dare say that no budget can be compiled for more than three months, let alone a year. The key to the difficulty lies in prices. Price controls can rely on techniques or methods, but if the national treasury's budget is not balanced, prices cannot be controlled. The central government recently promulgated emergency economic measures, the most important of which is to balance revenue and expenditure. To suppress prices, it is necessary to see to what extent the balance of the national treasury's revenue and expenditure is achieved. This is beyond the power of the municipal government and beyond the capacity of the Municipal Council. However, to find a solution in a situation where there seems to be no solution, the only way is to re-estimate the municipal government's revenue and ask the municipal government's budget and finance officials to contribute the actual collectible amounts as much as possible without concealing anything. It would be better to submit a supplementary budget when it is absolutely necessary, as the central government can also submit a supplementary budget.

The Mayor is Like a Big Contractor, Councilors Should Assist

We are unwilling to waste financial resources or start new projects during this period, but things that need to be used cannot be unused, and existing projects have to be maintained. Currently, the estimated imbalance between the municipal government's revenue and expenditure reaches 230 billion yuan. We can only live within our means, so we have to propose the municipal construction donation item for consideration. If the general assembly can pass a resolution, then we can ask the municipal government to recompile the budget based on this amount. To tell a joke, we ask the mayor to be a big contractor, commanding everything, and the municipal councilors will be responsible for explaining the municipal government's difficulties to the citizens and assisting in the implementation as much as possible.

Subsequently, Deputy Speaker Xu, Councilor Xu Yongzuo, and others spoke in succession, supporting the municipal government's collection of municipal construction donations and explaining the current difficulties.

### UNRRA Water Transport Corps: Shipping Industry Unwilling to Undertake

[Our Report] The UNRRA Water Transport Corps originally intended to entrust the operation to the Shipping Industry Association, but after several months of planning, the association concluded that it would incur losses and decided the week before to have UNRRA operate it itself.

According to a person in charge of the Shipping Industry Association, the UNRRA Water Transport Corps has over 100 ships, totaling 100,000 tons, many of which are damaged. Only 40,000 to 50,000 tons are seaworthy, and the repair costs are extremely high. Secondly, the salaries and other expenses of the American personnel on the ships are considerable, while the association's raised funds are only 500 million yuan, and there is a risk of losing 1 billion yuan per month. Therefore, the operation will still be carried out by UNRRA itself, and the personnel hired by the Shipping Industry Association will be employed by UNRRA.

### Chen Bofán Suddenly Disappears After Serving His Sentence, Affecting Family Members and Guarantors

[Our Report] Chen Bofán, who was previously accused of serving as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee and the director of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Puppet Central Political Council, has served his one-year and three-month prison sentence and has been released.

### Youth Party Members Accused of Being Traitors, Informant is Convicted Traitor, Claims to Also Be a Youth Party Member

[Our Report] Youth Party member Zhu Weicong served as the director of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and the director of the Puppet Zhejiang Province Incense and Candle Tax Bureau. Lu Xihuang served as a director of the Puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and secretary of the Puppet National Economic Committee, and concurrently held positions in the Puppet Rice Grain Control Association's Dare-to-Die Team and the Puppet China Salt Industry Company.

He also stated, "They are members of the Youth Party, and I am also a member of the Youth Party. We three families all live in the Lian'an Fang in Yuyuan Road. After the victory, they bought someone to accuse me of being a traitor, so I truthfully reported them."

[Our Report] Chai Gandong, a shop assistant at 136 Xizang Middle Road, had 400,000 yuan in legal tender stolen on the French Concession Route 22 bus on the morning of the 21st of last month.

On the afternoon of the 23rd, they successively arrested Shen Jianqiu, Pan Changgen, and Yang Guobin in the Yunnan South Road and Linsen Road area. After interrogation, they confessed to stealing 400,000 yuan but denied carrying weapons and firing shots. However, after further investigation, it was learned that Shen had a long criminal record. From October 27, 1945, to January 12, 1946, he had colluded with the notorious robbers Shen Zhixiong, Lu Kongbiao, and Lu Wei, who had been executed by the garrison headquarters, as well as Fu Sheng, A Xing, Xiao Mao, and Lao Dai, who were at large, to rob three businesses with weapons: 16 Lane 356 on Jessfield Road, 4 Songshan Road, and the Hongxing Iron Factory at 835 Suzhou South Road.

### Fraudulent Use of Guarantee to Obtain Vehicle License Exposed, Police Bureau Deceived, Arrested Car Shop Owner and Manager

[Our Report] After the Municipal Government implemented traffic regulations restricting the registration of three-wheeled vehicles, the three-wheeled vehicle manufacturers in the city suffered a blow, and their business declined sharply. However, Xu Zhiqin, the owner of Jinlong Three-Wheeled Vehicle Shop at 63 Lane 779 on Chengdu Road, came up with an idea and colluded with Zhou Rongzhang, the manager of four three-wheeled vehicle rental shops, "Youlian," "Youning," "Yunfei," and "Xinxin" at 160 Shanhaiguan Road, claiming that anyone who bought a new car from Jinlong Car Shop could guarantee the issuance of a vehicle license. As a result, many people who did not know the truth fell into their trap, and the amount of car payments and license fees defrauded reached more than 40 million yuan. Wu Yuansong from Dongtai and Mei Diqing, Pan Jinmiao, and Yang Bin from Taizhou, 20 three-wheeled vehicle drivers residing at 276 Lane 409 on Zhongzheng South Road, purchased a three-wheeled vehicle from Jinlong Car Shop one after another at the end of last year. At that time, in addition to paying the car price of 1 million yuan per vehicle, they also prepaid license fees ranging from 400,000 to 1.4 million yuan. Xu issued a receipt and accompanied them to Zhou Rongzhang's place, where the car body was painted with the words "Youlian," "Youning," etc., and another license plate number identical to the one Zhou Rongzhang had already obtained was painted on each car. At this point, the procedures were completed, and they began operating. Occasionally, when the police bureau imposed fines, Zhou Rongzhang would present a temporary license identical to that of the vehicle to the police bureau for negotiation, falsely claiming that the license had been lost, in order to deceive the authorities. This continued for more than three months without being detected. However, recently, Wu Yuansong and others felt that it was too much trouble to continue this way and demanded that Xu Zhiqin provide them with a formal license, but to no avail. A conflict arose, and they reported it to the Criminal Investigation Division of the police bureau. After officers dispatched by Feng Ershan investigated, they learned the whole story. The two suspects, Xu and Zhou, were arrested and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation today.

### Robbery of Bank Owner: Accomplices Apprehended in Chuansha Dachang

To what extent should children's artwork exhibition be arranged? Wen Zhaotong
The municipal education authorities, in order to universally promote teaching activities in various subjects, held elementary school athletic meets and children's concerts last year. Recently, they are also preparing a children's labor art exhibition. The deep intention cannot be denied. The author, honored by the Education Bureau's kind invitation, was invited to be one of the preparatory committee members and would like to present some humble opinions on this exhibition of achievements, and discuss them with the preparatory committee members and the actual instructors of various schools.
First of all, we should pay attention to the fact that labor, art, physical education, and music teaching, in a broad sense, are all artistic teaching activities. However, from a sensory point of view, labor and art achievements are spatial, while physical education and music achievements are temporal; that is, the former is static, and the latter is dynamic. Therefore, the achievements of physical education and music teaching can only show the results on the sports field and in the concert hall, neglecting the process, and it is even more difficult to show what position physical education and music occupy in the entire educational facility, what relationship they have, and what value they have. However, in the labor and art achievement exhibition, it seems that it is not necessary to focus on the presentation of results.
We still remember that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Ministry of Education officially implemented the elementary school labor curriculum standards in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The elementary school education circle in our country once set off a climax of labor education research, that is, the entire education was centered on labor, so as to achieve the highest educational goal of combining hands and brains. Although the research results were covered up by the War of Resistance, labor education still occupied an important part in the wartime educational facilities. Now, labor education, which has the significance of production labor, naturally also has its importance in the education during the founding period.
Regarding children's art education, life beautification is its goal, and creation and appreciation are its means, which is already beyond doubt. At present, it is not a matter of theoretical establishment, but a matter of teaching practice.
Based on the above discussion, the achievements that should be exhibited in this children's labor art achievement exhibition are the achievements of children's labor art teaching in national education. In other words, what should be exhibited is the achievement of teaching—the process—and the achievement of learning—the result.
Under such an ideal, the achievements of teaching should include what to teach, why to teach, and how to teach. Similarly, the achievements of learning should include what to learn, why to learn, and how to learn. Specifically, the facilities in urban and rural areas are different, and the achievements are also different. Even in the same school, the three stages of low, middle, and high should also have different teaching achievements. If we start from the research of local culture, life center, production training, appreciation and enjoyment, and design creation, and integrate labor and art into one teaching, I dare to believe that such an achievement exhibition will definitely not be the old-fashioned toy stall and flower paper stall-style so-called excellent achievement exhibition, but an exhibition of the total achievements of labor art teaching research and implementation, which is of educational value, demonstration effect, and guiding effect. Otherwise, it is futile to admire and marvel at the works of a few artistically talented children. The status, relationship, and value of labor art teaching in the entire education have never been demonstrated, and it will never be possible to correct the social prejudice of people and students' parents against labor art teaching, and it will be a waste of many distinguished human and material resources.
We should not lightly let go of this exhibition, because this is an examination. From this, we can see how the children's labor art curriculum is implemented? How does the central national school guide the labor art teaching of various schools in the district? Are there any problems with labor art teachers? Are there any problems with equipment? In short, we want to see the achievement exhibition of labor art teaching and learning.

At 3:00 PM on Saturday afternoon, the Mayor's Cup will see Qingbai face Railroad again at Yiyuan. The two sides previously met last Saturday, with Qingbai being held to a 2-2 draw by Railroad. Extra time failed to produce a winner, so the two sides will meet again this Saturday.
The weekend First Division League match, a make-up game from the second round, will see perennial powerhouse Tung Wah face the Military Court Soviet Union, also at Yiyuan. In the first round match, Tung Wah defeated the Soviet Union 4-2. The two sides will meet again this weekend, with the former looking to maintain their winning streak and the latter looking to avenge their defeat. A tense battle is expected.
In another Mayor's Cup match, You Tai will face Shanyun, also at Yiyuan. Shanyun lost to Longjie in the preliminary round, but Longjie was later disqualified by the Football Committee for using unregistered players, allowing Shanyun to advance.

Tonight's Basketball League: A Notable and Exciting Matchup; Navy-Marine Youth Meets Giant; Women's Division: Girls' Youth Purple Faces Zhanli Team; Hualian Plays Railroad Beijing
The Second Basketball League, with three matches in the women's division starting at 5:30 PM today, will continue to be held at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets are available for 2,000 and 3,000 yuan.
The first match in the women's division will pit Girls' Youth Purple against Zhanli Team. This match is no longer of major importance, but in terms of strength, Girls' Youth Purple is stronger, and Zhanli Team will find it difficult to compete with them. Although the match will not be one-sided, Zhanli Team will undoubtedly lose.
Two Powerful Foreign Teams Engage in Internal Strife
The second match will feature a First Division showdown between Giant and Navy-Marine Youth. Both sides are foreign teams. Giant is a well-known strong team in Shanghai, with players such as Fuyuk, Taobolin, Qiang Dulai, and Pigu Nai, who have tacit coordination and abundant strength. They are also guided by Kaiji Mi Luofu, who is full of tricks. Navy-Marine Youth is based at the US Navy Port Service Office and was once awarded the Far East US Navy Basketball Championship. They traveled to Guam to compete and are also considered strong. Their players, such as Bi Tuo Qiong, Bi Tuo Xun, Folake, and Pi Sheng, have ample stamina. They have won several consecutive matches recently and are in high spirits. Therefore, a fierce battle is inevitable when they meet today. The excitement and tension are also to be expected. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome, it will indirectly affect Hualian's championship hopes. Giant lost to Hualian by eight points. If Giant wins tonight, it will naturally be beneficial to Hualian. If they lose, we can see the strength of Navy-Marine Youth. This match is one to pay close attention to.
Railroad is No Match for Hualian
The final match will be a First Division clash between Hualian and Railroad Beijing. Hualian is the leader in Shanghai's basketball scene. In this year's league, they suffered an upset loss to Chunmao in the first match. After this stimulation, their players were greatly encouraged and restored their past glory. Da Li, Adi, Lao Bao, Akong, and Xue Chong all look energetic and are likely to win this year's championship and retain the title. Railroad Beijing is a new team in this year's league. They have a northern style of play that is unpredictable and they have excellent morale, the best of all the teams in Shanghai. Their players, such as Yang Xianji, Jiang Guoping, Hu Sizhong, and Gu Zhenhua, have ample stamina. However, due to a lack of experience, they have been unable to succeed. Tonight, facing the league leader, they will be difficult to resist. Hualian can steadily secure a victory. Tonight's schedule is recorded below:
Girls' Youth Purple vs. Zhanli Team (Women's Division) 5:30 PM Referee: Wang Yiqiao
Navy-Marine Youth vs. Giant (First Division) 6:30 PM Referees: Liu Hesheng, Yang Liecheng
Railroad Beijing vs. Hualian (First Division) 7:30 PM Referees: Wu Zibin, Xia Zeren

Charity Boxing and Wrestling Tournament Performance is Exciting and Touching
[Our Report] Tongde Medical College held a charity boxing tournament last night at 7:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium to raise scholarships. There were over a thousand spectators.

Hong Kong Football News: Special Silver Shield Replay: Sing Tao Eliminates English Troops, to Compete with South China for Championship
[Our Hong Kong Correspondent] Last Saturday, Sing Tao A and B went out to compete for the Silver Shield final qualification, and both were forced to draw. In order to accommodate the return of the 45th Battalion of the Gold Soldiers, the Football Association strongly scheduled a replay on Wednesday this week – the 26th, but Sing Tao needed to fight with South China for the league championship on the weekend, how could they fight one battle after another after another within a week? They refused to send a team to play.
The whole of Hong Kong's Xing Lun also did not sympathize with this measure of the General Association, and the General Association also knew that public anger was hard to offend, and was willing to reschedule the weekend battle. Finally, Sing Tao took the overall situation as the most important, because if the Gold Soldiers were allowed to enter the final week in vain, it would undoubtedly give the Silver Shield championship to outsiders – because South China would never be defeated by the 45th Battalion, so they resolutely sent a team to fight.
Adjusting the Lineup
Today, Wednesday - the 26th, although it is a holiday, fans flocked to the coast of Copper Bay, and many people who tasted the closed door were there.
At exactly 4:00, the game began, and the referee was still Deng Situ.
Sing Tao, in view of the fact that the previous battle transferred Liu Songsheng to the front, and the defensive strength of the center back line was weakened, decided to transfer Songsheng back, and used Qixiang to string the left back, and the striker "Magic Leg" still failed to press the battle, and was forced to use Guangsen. The lineup is as follows:
Yu Yaode Wu Qixiang Hou Rongsheng Feng Kunsheng Xu Jingcheng Liu Songsheng Cao Qiuting Li Zhaorong Zhang Jinhai He Yingfen Deng Guangsen
The Gold Soldiers used the same formation as before, transferring the most outstanding center back to the right back to attack Qiuting, but the formation was as follows:
Tai Lai Di Ya Ban Li Zhi Li Gao Chen Ba Dingdun Xian Binlu Bu Luqi Lian Mashi Gao Lituo Di Ge Ni Lu
One Draw Each
As soon as the silver flute rang, the Gold Soldiers attacked first and were forced to retreat. After that, Sing Tao held on to the attack.
At 23 minutes, Qiuting picked over Xian Bulu and passed to Zhaorong, who topped Songsheng. Songsheng watched and shot remotely from 25 yards away. The ball came out like an arrow and went straight through the net. Although Tai Lai welcomed the ball and patted it, his hand slipped and the ball went in. Sing Tao scored first.
Then Zhaorong got the ball hooked by Jingcheng, dribbled straight in, and missed his footing when he was close to the goal. The four seats sighed.
At 35 minutes, the Gold Soldiers attacked urgently, forcing a corner kick. Bu Luqi opened it well, and Gao Lituo topped it. Yaode patted the ball out, but the enemy front surrounded the goal and attacked. In the chaos, one was grabbed back. The first half was a 1-1 draw.
One Goal Decides the Outcome
After the break, the wind suddenly turned and blew urgently towards Sing Tao's goal. Domestic fans were all worried for Sing Tao. After the start, Guangsen got the ball and went to the meeting alone, cutting into the middle along the edge, but was pushed down by Di Ya in the penalty area. The referee turned a blind eye and lost the opportunity.
Once again, Zhaorong received the ball from Jinhai and rushed towards the goal, and was also illegally intercepted in the penalty area. The referee ignored it again, and the audience was in an uproar.
Until 20 minutes later, Jinhai led the army to advance again. He originally wanted to pass the ball high to the right, but Di Ya jumped to the top. The ball fell in front of Jinhai's feet. "Sanlang" crossed to Zhaorong. When he saw "Buddha" lifted his foot, the ball rolled into the left corner. 2-1, Sing Tao took the lead again.
After that, the wind became more urgent, and Sing Tao was forced to retreat and defend. The Gold Soldiers used long passes and rushed to the door to fight, forcing seven corner kicks. Fortunately, the generals of Sing Tao's rear defense all had transcendent performances and were able to preserve the victory. Amidst the cheers of thousands of fans, they defeated the Gold Soldiers and will compete with South China for the championship on April 11.

中央銀行新總裁　張嘉璈昨日就職　勗勉同人繼續努力共渡難關　
Zhang Jia'ao Took Office as the New President of the Central Bank Yesterday, Encouraging Colleagues to Continue Their Efforts to Overcome Difficulties Together
[Our Report] Zhang Jia'ao, the new president of the Central Bank, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at around 11:00 AM a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, he went to the Central Bank to assume his duties. He was greeted by the former president, Bei Zuyi, and taken to the president's office, where a simple handover ceremony was held. He also summoned the heads of various bureaus and departments to meet with him, and President Zhang delivered a speech, stating that President Bei had presided over the Central Bank for a short time, but during this year, he had been supporting it with great effort during the difficult times after the end of the war, when everything was waiting to be done. At present, the Central Bank is at this difficult time, and colleagues are urgently needed to continue their past service spirit to overcome the difficulties together. Then, former President Bei delivered a speech, stating that President Zhang is an outstanding talent in China's financial and economic circles. In the current environment, only President Zhang is capable of overcoming the current difficulties. From the perspective of national interests, it is fortunate to have found the right person. From the perspective of personal interests, this is really a savior to reduce my difficulties. Then, Vice President Chen Xing delivered a speech, stating that at this time of financial turmoil, no matter from any aspect, we should sincerely support the national policy. Our colleagues should work hard under the guidance of President Zhang, work together, and overcome difficulties together. After the speeches were completed, the new and old presidents immediately handed over the seals of office, and the ceremony was declared completed.
At around 4:00 PM, the tea party began, and the new and old presidents stepped out of the president's office. At that time, the heads of the organs and leaders of the Chinese and foreign financial circles also arrived one after another to congratulate him. The new and old presidents and the heads of various bureaus and departments of the Central Bank entertained them in the meeting room on the third floor of the Central Bank. Those present yesterday included Kong Xiangxi, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiguang, Xu Baiyuan, He Dehui, Zhao Zengyu, Zhao Zukang, Li Du, Ding Guitang, Liu Bingyi, Wang Xiaolai, Li Fusun, Chen Guangfu, Qian Yongming, Zhao Dihua, Liu Gongyun, Cheng Cangbo, Song Hanzhang, Xu Xueyu, and more than 60 others. President Zhang then made a statement to the reporters of various newspapers on the situation of taking office, such as striving for economic freedom.
Recalling that since leaving the Bank of China in the 25th year of the Republic of China and working in the Central Bank, more than ten years have passed. Today, I am returning to serve in the financial sector and have the opportunity to learn from old friends from all walks of life. I feel infinitely happy in my heart. However, my talent is limited and my responsibilities are heavy. I hope that social elites and financial leaders will not hesitate to correct me, which is especially what I look forward to.
After eight years of war, our country was fortunate to have a wise leader at the top and 400 million compatriots working together, sacrificing and fighting at the bottom, to achieve the most glorious victory. However, an independent country and independent people must strive for two inseparable freedoms: one is political freedom, and the other is economic freedom. The day of victory in the War of Resistance is the day when our country and people gain political freedom. However, the economy has not yet been consolidated, and the vitality has not yet been restored. Not only has the people's livelihood not been stabilized, but there is also a great sense of insecurity. That is, economic freedom and happiness have not yet been obtained. It is necessary for our compatriots to strive for this freedom that everyone cannot do without for a day with the same spirit as the War of Resistance, so as to achieve true victory.
Overcome Inflation
Inflation is an inevitable phenomenon in wartime. After the war, sorting out the currency must go through an extremely painful process. After the First World War, there were many precedents in many countries. In this war, many countries with first-time experience used various preventive methods to reduce the danger of inflation, but they did not have the basic conditions for prevention, resulting in today's economic phenomena.
The methods used by European and American countries to prevent the danger of inflation are to control prices, implement rationing, support production, and save consumption. On the other hand, they increase income tax rates, promote savings, and increase the issuance of public bonds to absorb the people's excess purchasing power. Therefore, financial revenue and expenditure and material supply and demand can still maintain a balance in the midst of inflation. What we must pay attention to is that the key to their success lies in the sincere cooperation between the people and the government. The government loves the people, and the people lead the government. If China wants to escape the danger and pain of inflation, it still cannot avoid going through the process that European and American countries have gone through. What's more, although our country has won the War of Resistance, domestic peace and order have not yet been fully restored. The economic emergency measures recently promulgated by the Central Government are based on the wartime economic policies of European and American countries, and I hope that all our compatriots in the country will regard this as an inevitable process to guide them to economic stability. The key to its success lies entirely in the mutual trust and mutual assistance between the people and the government, and only sincere cooperation.

表現自治能力　建立金融中心
Demonstrate Autonomy, Establish a Financial Center
The Shanghai market was created by countless hardworking, diligent, and capable young shop assistants and workers under the guidance of responsible and promising leaders. It has a long and glorious history. In addition, the country's legal rights have been completed in recent years, and it is the day for our citizens to demonstrate their autonomy. I hope that we will not only strive to maintain the existing glorious history, but also work together to build an organized, orderly, and ethical financial center and commercial market. All bad habits of deceiving each other, forcibly seizing, and all speculative profiteering will be corrected and eliminated to set an example for the whole country. If this can be done, the legitimate production industry and international trade will surely flourish. Shanghai will not only become the commercial hub of the country, but also the center of international finance. The Central Bank is responsible for regulating the national finance, and its responsibility is even more arduous in this economic crisis. Jia'ao looks forward to the future and is deeply afraid that he will not be able to handle it. Fortunately, the past presidents of this bank have been well planned. The colleagues in office can also serve diligently and prudently. We can only adhere to the spirit of serving the public in the past, and do our best to be a bridge for cooperation between the government and the people. I especially hope that leaders from all walks of life and friendly countries will not hesitate to give guidance and assistance from time to time, so as to avoid damage. I am very fortunate.
人事並無更動
No Changes in Personnel
Reporters then asked President Zhang some questions, and he answered them. The following is an excerpt: He said that he had just taken office yesterday, and he had not yet considered the resignations of the heads of some bureaus and departments of the Central Bank, or the appointment of the successor vice president. However, he did not bring any new people to take office, so he eagerly hoped that there would be no changes in personnel. As for the positions of Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee, according to the regulations, they are concurrently held by the President of the Central Bank, so they must be concurrently held.

The main points are as follows: (1) The focus of future financial problems will still be on reducing interest rates. At present, if we want to relieve the distress of the industrial and commercial sectors due to high interest rates, we must issue loans. However, after issuing loans, we must also consider not allowing them to flow into speculative hoarding channels, so as not to lose the willingness of the loans. It is believed that President Zhang will be able to find appropriate methods to reduce interest rates after presiding over the Central Bank. (2) Regarding the silver building industry's request to maintain the trading of jewelry and the auditing firm's request to allow opening, although both have their difficulties, the government's laws and regulations have been established and must be strictly implemented. It is now planned to find a solution between the two.
市塲盛傳「禁做」消息　華股狂漲之風稍挫
Market Rumors of "Prohibition" Slightly Dampen the Frenzy of Soaring Chinese Stocks (The Police Department is Investigating the Account Books of Counterfeit Trading Firms)
Although Chinese stocks rose wildly and chaotically yesterday, the hot stocks rose too much. Once there was an external blow, they quickly fell back. In the afternoon, there were many silkworm movements due to the depletion of chips, but due to the rumors of "prohibition," they ended at a low price.
In the morning, the buying was very strong. Cement Xinya hit the limit. After the opening, numbers 145, 61, 217, 224, 186, 9 (up), 215 were all buying. Deyong Yarn stepped up to 2,880 yuan. Numbers 76, 145, and 207 sold at 2,830 yuan. Jingfu and Dexinhe were the first to hit the limit. Numbers 85, 199, 106, and scattered buyers all bought Deyong Yarn up to 2,940 yuan. Numbers 218 and 76 sold, falling back to 2,830 yuan. Numbers 171, 223, and 197 entered to 2,900 yuan. Numbers 76, 79, and 171 suddenly sold to 2,790 yuan. Numbers 235, 224, 211, 4, and 154 entered, and the buying spree started again. Numbers 152 and 198 entered strongly. At 10:30, Deyong Yarn rose to around 2,960 yuan. At this time, there were rumors that a major player, Hong, was selling strongly outside the market, and there were also rumors of a reduction in the US exchange rate, and a falling wind immediately rose. Numbers 231, 179, 9, 219, 91, 85, 76, 139, 125, 83, 2, and 112 were sold off one after another and fell to 2,660 yuan. It was also heard that the bond market was dispersed by the police, and that the counterfeit trading firms were being investigated. The number 3 and other banks helped maintain the low level, and the number 68 also rose to 2,820 yuan. Numbers 142, 85, 65, 76, and 112 sold again to 2,690 yuan. Numbers 31, 223, 211, 145, and 171 entered to 2,800 yuan. However, because there was a saying outside the market that it was only for settlement, the floating positions were available, and the noon was closed flat. As a result, compared with the closing price last Saturday, Yongsha Qinxing Zhongfa rose slightly, Xinhe Xinguang Huafeng Sheng Guanzhi, Jingfu rose by 10%, Meiya fell by 5%, and Xinhua fell slightly by 9%. Dexin Yongsha Xin Xinguang rose slightly, Huafeng rose by 50%, Meiya fell slightly, and the cold stock Jinglun hit the limit. Zhongsi Commercial Cement rose by about 10%, underwear fell by 10%, and the rest rose and fell slightly.
In the afternoon, numbers 14, 215, and 78 had Na, and Shang Dejiao rose to 2,800 yuan. Numbers 231, 76, 141, and 223 took the opportunity to sell, falling back to 2,720 yuan. Numbers 186, 215, 85, 219, 145, 99, 152, 142, 91, 180

### The First Batch of Conscripted Soldiers in This City Will Not Exceed 3,500

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the establishment of the Shanghai Garrison Command, it has been actively preparing for various training programs for conscripted soldiers and national service soldiers. The uniforms issued by the Ministry of National Defense have also been transported. The Shanghai Regiment Management Area under the command has two battalions and a total of ten companies, waiting for conscripted soldiers to enlist for training. According to the person in charge of the department, the maximum number of conscripts in the first phase will not exceed 3,500. However, the actual number of conscripts, age, and time have not yet received clear instructions from the Ministry of National Defense. In terms of conscription administration, the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department will establish a military affairs section in the short term, and each district will establish a district security team, requiring more than 1,300 cadres. The department has suggested to the Civil Affairs Department that demobilized officers, youth soldiers, and members of the Central Training National Administrative Class can be recruited. Yesterday, Chief of Staff Chen of the department discussed this matter with Director Zhang. It is reported that the budget prepared by the Municipal Government for the establishment of the military affairs section and district security team will be submitted to the City Council for discussion.

### Three Labor Unions Demand the Lifting of the Frozen Cost of Living Index; Director Wu Urges Them to Overcome Difficulties Together

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, more than 30 representatives from three vocational labor unions, including the machine industry in three districts, the silk weaving industry, and the machine industry in six districts, went to the General Labor Union to petition, making two demands: (1) to lower commodity prices to the level of January; (2) to lift the frozen cost of living index. Because Chairman Shui went to the Social Affairs Bureau to attend a labor-management assessment meeting, they turned to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. After the labor-management assessment meeting ended, Director Wu received them. The union representatives presented a formal document and requested that if the index could not be unfrozen, they hoped to increase the variety of in-kind allocations. Director Wu said: The difficulties in the lives of employees are very clear, and the demands will be forwarded to the higher authorities. However, it is hoped that employees can understand the government's difficulties and work together to overcome this difficulty. The government is implementing emergency economic measures, and this period of time is not expected to be long. The government is about to freeze the cost of living index, and it will do its best to suppress commodity prices. If it is not possible to suppress prices, workers will not be the only ones to suffer losses, and there will be other remedies after the cost of living index is frozen. He will definitely strive for the reasonable demands of the workers. Because there were many people and opinions were mixed, Director Wu decided to meet with the representatives of the three labor unions, Gu Gang, Shen Mo, and Tan Fugen, again this afternoon to listen to their opinions.

Regarding the General Labor Union's request to adjust the workers' cost of living index every three months, Director Wu said that he would forward it to the central government.

### Symposium on Education Issues Discusses Textbook Problems; Lu Dianyang Reports on the Compilation Process of the National Standard Edition

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] A symposium on education issues was held at Jinling University on the 2nd to discuss the problem of the national standard edition of textbooks. Lu Dianyang, director of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and the Elementary and Secondary School Textbook Editorial Committee, reported on the compilation process of the national standard edition of textbooks, as well as its advantages and disadvantages. It is said that the national standard edition of textbooks that have been printed so far include junior high school Chinese, civics, history, and geography. For elementary school, except for natural science and arithmetic, all are complete. The textbooks compiled and printed by the Ministry of Education strive for completeness in subjects and have no bias in content. This is a significant advantage. There are also several shortcomings. There is only one type in each category, which not only eliminates the possibility of comparison or competition, but also leaves teachers no choice. Some people even believe that it has the suspicion of ideological control. Subsequently, Cheng Shi, Luo Tingguang, and Cao Chu separately reported on the supply of textbooks in the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. Chen Heqin also presented American textbooks with excellent printing and rich content for the attendees to view. Finally, Yuan Boqiao concluded that, in principle, the state could compile multiple types of textbooks and allow schools to choose and apply them freely. However, the term "national standard edition" seemed inappropriate. If the Ministry of Education formulates a complete curriculum standard, experts can edit textbooks according to the standard, and the Ministry will review and approve them according to this standard. It would be more ideal for the textbooks compiled by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to also be reviewed and several types to be implemented in parallel. Wang Tongqi distributed a form to test the attitudes of the experts present. The results were: (1) No one agreed to designate the use of the national standard edition; (2) 14 people agreed to allow the selection and use of various approved editions; (3) No one agreed to designate the use of one approved edition; (4) 7 people agreed to issue the national standard edition or approved edition at the same time and allow selection; (5) 1 person agreed to use the national standard edition for certain textbooks and the approved edition for certain textbooks.

### Eastern Fish

— Zi Liu

In my hometown, I used to eat a kind of salted fish called Eastern Fish. The scales of this fish were gray-yellow after being salted, and the meat was as red as ham. It tasted quite good. At that time, the Chinese people's impression of Japan was extremely bad, and there were often boycotts of Japanese goods. The Eastern Fish on the stalls would also be dumped by young students. At that time, I thought that the action of dumping Eastern Fish was very correct, and these unpatriotic people should be punished. Therefore, my interest in eating Eastern Fish was also reduced.

But later someone told me that the so-called Eastern Fish was not really transported from Japan, but was caught by the Japanese in the coastal areas of Northeast China, salted, and sold to China. In this way, I felt very unhappy: why should the fish in the Chinese sea be caught by the Japanese and called "Eastern Fish"?

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I had never seen this kind of fish. By the time of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I missed this kind of fish and firmly believed that the Japanese would no longer be qualified to catch such fish? And this fish would surely be renamed something of our own Chinese. But I have not seen this fish so far, which makes me feel very strange!

Reading the evening paper today, it says that China has established a partnership with General MacArthur's headquarters in Japan, allowing Japanese ships to fish in the Chinese overseas, Korean and Ryukyu territorial waters. We will not talk about them being able to fish in the Korean and Ryukyu territorial waters for the time being. Perhaps they will catch fish in the Chinese overseas, just like before the Anti-Japanese War, and call the fish in the Chinese sea "Eastern Fish" and sell it to the "Chinese"?

I really feel strange: can't we Chinese catch the fish in our own sea, and must we ask the Japanese to catch it and sell it to us? Have we forgotten that the reason why Japan was able to militarily invade China in the past was gradually developed from economic aggression, and the infringement of fishing rights was the starting point of economic aggression?

### "Old J.B."

— Mei Bai

J.B. Powell, the former editor-in-chief of the China Weekly Review, died of a sudden heart attack in Washington. Although he repeatedly expressed his desire to return to Shanghai to see his old friends, he finally had no chance to see China after the victory!

In Shanghai's journalistic circles, if you mention "Mr. Powell," others will ask, "Which Powell are you talking about?" Because the current editor-in-chief of the China Weekly Review is J.B.'s son, and the father and son have quite different views on China. But if you mention "J.B.," everyone knows that it must be this rather fond-of-dressing-up old Powell.

The time when J.B. was most prominent was during the period when the National Army withdrew westward and the "76" bandits ran rampant in the Shanghai Concession. At this time, the trend of assassinations was extremely prevalent, but the China Weekly Review invariably had an article in each issue exposing the inside story of the puppet organization—such as the dispute between Zhou Fohai and Chen Gongbo, and the infighting between Ding Mocun and Li Shiqun, which were all published to the world in an extremely vivid and incisive manner. At that time, the China Weekly Review was simply in high demand, and it was always sold out as soon as it was published every week, and there were even second and third editions.

J.B. certainly knew that he was in an extremely dangerous situation, so he often went out at night and hired bodyguards. He lived in the American Club, which was very close to the office of the China Weekly Review (No. 160 Edward Road). One day, probably around four or five o'clock in the afternoon, he thought that the area around Jiangxi Road near Fuma Road was very lively at that time, and he ventured to walk to the newspaper office. Just as he reached the intersection of Edward Road, suddenly a person threw a long, round newspaper-wrapped package at him. Presumably, J.B.'s suit was too "streamlined," and the package slid over his shoulder and fell to the ground. J.B. poked the package with his cane—it turned out to be a bomb!

From then on, J.B. was more careful, but he still often sat in front of the typewriter all night, challenging the enemy without reservation. Sometimes I would visit him, and he would suddenly ask me for my opinion on a certain event, asking very carefully and thoroughly, as if it were an exam—sometimes, these immature opinions were actually adopted, but after he "digested" them, they had become very thorough.

J.B. liked to dress up, and the decorations he used were extremely exquisite. He also liked to collect fake antiques and carpets. In his book "Twenty Years Out of the Country," which he wrote after the war, he often mentioned these fake antiques with nostalgia. He also often asked me how much silver I spent in college each year, and then complained that his son spent too much money studying in India. But who knew that Little Powell is now inheriting his father's ambition and has also achieved quite a lot!

Little Powell is called "J.W." We call him Bill. He seems to have different ideas from J.B., but he himself said: "We had a long talk in Japan about many issues, and we found that in essence we were not much different." Really, doesn't America have both Vandenberg and Wallace at the same time?

### Song Entering the Underworld

— Hu Lu

Using coffins, wonderful praise obedient! The dead don't care, well arranged: counterfeit money machinery hides contraband, fanciful!

Arms are also stolen, how strange! How could the coffin want to become "official" and "wealth"? It's not that officials are delusional, unlucky star comes!

Note: Narcotics were found in empty coffins in coffin shops in Shanghai, counterfeit money machinery was found in coffins in the countryside of Wuxi, and arms were found in coffins in a nunnery in Wuhu. All of these were reported in recent days.

### The Story of Pen Names

— Xiao Changdao

After my first submitted article was published, along with the boundless joy and excitement, came an urgent and strong impulse—I had to come up with a pen name for myself.

I considered this impulse very seriously, although I couldn't explain why. A mysterious but very strong subconscious mind kept nagging at me, and I unconsciously set a constraint for myself: I wouldn't publish any more articles until I had a pen name, as if I were already a famous writer, and famous writers almost always have pen names.

So, before I started writing my second manuscript, I began to rack my brains for the most satisfactory pen name.

First, I thought, since I was determined to become a writer, I had to not only study introductory books on literary creation but also imbue my pen name with a meaning of striving, so as to encourage myself and drive me forward. So, I brought out a large number of great writers from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, and extracted the tails of their names, pairing them with words like "admire," "imitate," "also," "look up to," etc., such as Mujie (Gorky), Xiaoxun (Lu Xun), Yibai (Li Bai), Yangsha (Shakespeare)... and so on. But in the end, none of them worked because it was like trying to paint a tiger but ending up with a dog, wouldn't it be insulting to their great names instead? Thinking this, I decided to give up.

Secondly, I planned to choose a pen name based on a figure worthy of commemoration, which would be killing two birds with one stone. But the problem arose again: in terms of people, the most worthy of commemoration should be one's parents, but that seemed unfair to my beloved wife, because her union with me was so tortuous and so dangerous, but if I really used my wife as the object of commemoration and chose a pen name, I hesitated again. Isn't it true? Xiaolin is a good friend who encourages and helps me engage in writing most enthusiastically and effectively, how can I forget him when drinking water, think of the source? Therefore, in order to avoid deceiving the old and the young and not taking sides, I finally gave up this principle.

Here, I thought of the names of studios that the ancients liked to use. Weren't there countless examples of ancient people using studio names as aliases? For example, Mi Fu had Ba Jin Zhai, Su Shi, in addition to Dongpo Jushi, also had the name Xuetang, and Yuan Mei's fame with Suiyuan was something that even women and children knew, so I decided to work on words like pavilion, platform, building, pavilion, zhai, room, hall, etc. But before I had even obtained a pen name, I already had the feeling of ascending to immortality. I doubted whether I was worthy of being such an "elegant scholar." Just as I was hesitating, I accidentally flipped to a passage in Banqiao's family letters: "In recent times, the titles of poems... such as Mou Xuan, Mou Yuan, Mou Zhai, Mou Lou, Mou Yan, Mou Cun, Mou Qi, are all vulgar and unbearable things from the market place. Today they create an alias, and tomorrow it's on the poem paper. With such titles, one can know their poems! With such poems, one can know their character!" After reading it, I was sweating profusely, so I quickly abandoned all those paths and hurried to find new material.

Heavens, I felt lost, I couldn't help but sigh three times: Only now do I know that a writer can be and cannot be!

The enjoyment of embedding characters is mostly for gifting to people in songs, and those that are collected into sentences and widely circulated for a time, such as: "Smaller than a nightingale and lighter than a swallow, clouds remind one of clothes and flowers remind one of a face." Embedding the two characters "Xiao Yun" is well known. If embedding the two characters "Ruyi", then "Everyone says I should return, but I ask you, what do you mean?" It is said that when Xiangxiang was traveling in Hankou, someone advised him to make a plan, so he said this. Embedding the two characters "Dagu", then "Generally, life is like a dream, so just indulge in pleasure here." It is said to be made by Peng Gangzhi, and the language is bold and unrestrained, which is indeed like his person. In the past, there was a talented scholar in Wu, named Xiaolian, or it is said that he was the top scholar of a certain subject. When he first won the autumn examination, he traveled to Hankou. In a song, there were sisters, the older named Mudan, the younger named Shaoyao. The talented scholar was infatuated with the older sister, and forgot to return home. One day, in the midst of wine, he suddenly said: "You two are named after flowers, although elegant, it is actually vulgar. I want to change it to Huajun and Huaxiang, intending to still use the two flowers, but the wording is newer. After the two changed their names, their fame became more sonorous. The talented scholar repeatedly planned to return home, but for a long time could not bear to leave this gentle land. Huajun said to him: "Since you have changed my name, why not make a couplet with embedded characters?" So and so collected Tang poems into a sentence and said: "Flowers can be plucked when they bloom, you ask when I will return." Collecting sentences is not difficult, but the difficulty lies in the suitability of the tone. Huaxiang provoked him and said: "Can you collect another couplet for me?" Someone said: "What is so difficult? The first sentence still uses 'Flowers can be plucked when they bloom', and pair it with 'It is difficult to meet, and difficult to part'." Then it is obtained. This couplet is naturally collected, using the character "Xiang" together, which is more clever than Huajun's couplet borrowing the character "Jun", but it is still not as good as the couplet made by my He Jianchao Taishi, which is even more comprehensive.

In Guoli Yecheng, there was a bricklayer named Feng Daili. One day, he accidentally lost his footing and fell from the roof of a six-story building. He fell into an empty baby carriage and did not suffer any damage. As a result: the woman pushing the cart fainted, fell, and sprained an ankle bone.

### On the Failure of Education

— Qilou

"Now the people who do evil are all educated people, rickshaw pullers won't be traitors, and corrupt officials and bureaucrats need returned students to make it especially sensational..." Such words can be named "On the Failure of Education."

Those who say these things have not thought that if more than half of the population were not illiterate, those traitors and corrupt officials and bureaucrats would not be able to be so rampant; the common people would not let them be so rampant. They also did not think that many intellectuals sacrificed themselves for righteousness during the enemy-puppet period, and many intellectuals, relying on the little faith that education gave them, still struggled to support themselves and maintained their integrity in the most turbid environment.

They are just like seeing a few great men in history with questionable origins, and thinking that all illegitimate children must be geniuses. Seeing that the people who do evil are educated, they think that education has failed, which is like seeing that horses have four legs, and concluding that all four legs are horses, which is illogical.

Education, education, education is such a powerful nourishment for a nation, I feel indignant when I hear the argument of educational failure.

### Chronicle of a City in Peril

— Qin Shouou

"Old Zhong never misses this kind of showy thing!" Someone said.

"If he didn't, how could he be considered a progressive element?" Old Zhong's popularity didn't seem to be very good; several people were discussing him as soon as he left.

"And," the limping man who liked to sigh added, still sorting banknotes with both hands. "His family has already left! Wife, children, nanny, they all took Mr. Zhang's car from Wanguo Pharmacy together the day before yesterday and went to Liuzhou! Alas! At this moment, he and Old Li are going out to get the red plum, that's for sure!"

At least five or six people grunted at the same time, obviously they all thought the limping man's prediction was correct.

"Old Zhong, alas! Full of art, full of struggle, but actually he's just a petty bourgeois!" The limping man happily added a few sentences. "Can he eat our food here? Alas!" He sighed twice every three sentences.

The banknotes on the big table on the left were all sorted out, tied into three long strips. Four young men and a girl stepped back to rest.

"In your eyes, a pessimist, people like Old Zhong are naturally slogan-shouting liars," the girl said in a theatrical manner, "but you can't write it all off, he put in a lot of effort in this flag donation parade, those trucks..."

A seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy took out a harmonica from his pocket and played the March of the Volunteers?

"Trucks! What's so rare about borrowing a few trucks?" Another "anti-Zhong" member chimed in, saying, "He spends all day mixing with those merchants in Guilin who specialize in making war fortunes, how much does it cost them to borrow a few old trucks? Speaking of it, it's still for..."

"Alas!"

"Weren't all those trucks borrowed from Zhongfu Company today?" Someone asked beside the limping man.

"Yes! That's why Xu Shaoming didn't donate any more money when we paraded to the gate of Zhongfu!" the girl explained to him.

"Old Zhu was unhappy because of this; after the parade, he decided to go to Xu Shaoming alone." the limping man told them.

"No wonder Old Zhong is unhappy! Xu Shaoming is his good friend!" three "anti-Zhong" members said loudly.

The limping man's table of banknotes was also counted, and someone went to the curator's office to invite representatives from the Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Municipal Government. Everyone solemnly settled the donations raised today and hid them together in two sacks.

No one discussed Old Zhong and Old Zhu anymore, and the harmonica's March of the Volunteers also stopped.

"Together it is 1,376,592 yuan and 50 cents, plus 18 US dollars." Curator Huanyang, who wore deep myopia glasses, announced solemnly.

A seal jointly signed by representatives of military and political organs and Curator Ouyang was affixed to the mouth of the sack, and then two of the most excited young men dragged it into the curator's office. (Five)
