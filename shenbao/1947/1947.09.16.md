### First Meeting of the Legislative Yuan After Recess: Approval of Treaty with Italy, Civil Servant Loan Proposal Submitted for Review

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its first meeting after the recess on the morning of the 15th. About 80 legislators attended. President Sun presided over the meeting. The legislators, having returned from constitutional study tours in various locations, joyfully recounted their experiences after a separation of two months. The important matters passed during the meeting included: (1) approval of the peace treaty with Italy, (2) approval of the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement, (3) the Organizational Regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Testing Laboratory, (4) amendment of Articles 26 and 27 of the Internal Organizational Law, (5) Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Military Personnel and their Families During Mobilization, and (6) amendment of the Organizational Law of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. In addition, there were also amendments to cases related to elections: (1) the allocation table of National Assembly representatives elected from various counties and cities and equivalent areas, (2) the division table of Legislative Yuan electoral districts in Jiangxi, (3) the division table of Legislative Yuan electoral districts in Anhui, (4) the allocation table of Legislative Yuan representatives from various provinces and cities not divided into districts, and (5) Article 9 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law and the amendment of Article 9 of the Implementing Regulations for the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The first major event after the Legislative Yuan's resumption was the approval of the 1947 Peace Treaty with Italy. This treaty was signed in Paris on February 10th this year, with 20 Allied nations, including China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, participating in the signing ceremony. The treaty is divided into eleven parts and ninety articles, with seventeen annexes. The eleven main points are as follows: (1) territorial aspects, (2) political clauses, (3) war criminals, (4) naval, land, and air force clauses, (5) withdrawal of Allied troops, (6) demands arising from the war, (7) property, rights, and obligations, (8) general economic relations, (9) dispute resolution, (10) various economic clauses, (11) final clauses. Chapter 5 of the second part, political clauses, concerns China's special interests and contains three articles. Article 24 stipulates that Italy relinquishes to China "all benefits and privileges arising from the Final Protocol signed in Beijing on September 7, 1901, and all exchanges of notes and documents supplementing it," and agrees to the abolition of the exchanges of notes and documents annexed to that protocol concerning Italy. At the same time, Italy also waives any claims for compensation arising therefrom. Article 25 stipulates that Italy agrees to cancel the lease granted by the Chinese government for the Italian concession in Tianjin and agrees to transfer all properties and archives of the municipal government of the concession to the Chinese government. Article 26 stipulates that Italy relinquishes all its rights in the public concessions in Shanghai and Xiamen to China and agrees that the public concessions in these two places shall be governed by the Chinese government. After this case was brought up at the 333rd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th, Dai Xiujun, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, first reported on the review process, followed by a speech by legislator Sun Jiulu, who solemnly pointed out that the term "special interests of China" in the treaty was not accurate at all, because China had not obtained any special interests in the treaty, and hoped that the meeting could include this point in the record. The case was passed without objection after a brief discussion. Another important diplomatic case at the meeting was the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement. This agreement was formally signed as early as July 23rd, and the Foreign Affairs and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan had also reviewed and passed it. After it was presented at today's meeting, it was unanimously approved without objection (for the full text, see this newspaper on July 24th). In addition, a case related to diplomacy involved actively and swiftly negotiating with Portugal to recover Macau. After this case was passed by the 328th meeting of the Legislative Yuan, it was reported to the National Government. After the National Government instructed the Executive Yuan to submit a response, which was then reviewed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, negotiations for recovery will be proposed again when the time is ripe. When Secretary-General Lou reported on this case in the Yuan, Legislator Gu and others expressed satisfaction.

[Another dispatch] A proposal by legislators Liu Zhiping, Chen Guyuan, and 50 others, "requesting the Executive Yuan to provide living loans for civil servants to alleviate their urgent needs and improve work efficiency," was brought up at today's meeting. The legislators spoke enthusiastically, all agreeing that the hardship of public educators' lives was unimaginable, and that the government should provide assistance to these essential personnel struggling on the poverty line. The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, first stood up to explain that at this time and place, everyone should share the hardships and practice thrift, but the word "thrift" should not be applied only to civil servants whose lives are already extremely difficult. Liu pointed out that some high-ranking officials live in tall buildings, travel in cars, and are attended by servants, all paid for by the state, which is unfair compared to public educators who are struggling in poverty. He hoped that relief could be planned even in extremely difficult circumstances. Jian Guanzan pointed out: (1) The manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can receive 15 million per month in addition to the cars and foreign houses provided by the government, which is 10 million more than the president of the Legislative Yuan. Suffering is not to be feared, but fairness must be sought. Excessive disparity is enough to affect administrative efficiency. Huang Youchang reminded the legislators that the problem of medical care also urgently needs to be solved. Among his friends, many have died after suffering from illnesses due to high living pressures and being unable to afford treatment. This fact cannot be ignored. Deng Hongye cited the story of Vice President Tan's death, where he was destitute and could not afford a burial, making a painful appeal. Being a civil servant today means you cannot afford to live, cannot afford to be sick, cannot afford to live, and cannot afford to die. The state of affairs is truly heartbreaking. Chen Guyuan, Chen Haicheng, and others all proposed solutions. Finally, because this case requires detailed study, it was decided to first submit it to the Finance and Economic Committees for review.

### Chamber of Commerce Election Announcement: Legislators Deem it Open Defamation, Resolution to Submit to Next Legislative Yuan General Meeting for Discussion

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, dissatisfied with the allocation of seats for professional representatives, published advertisements in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, attacking the Legislative Yuan. At the first meeting of the Legislative Yuan after the recess on the morning of the 15th, the legislators expressed indignation at the Chamber of Commerce's open insult to government agencies. This case was brought up by legislator Chen Guyuan. He asked whether the nation still had laws and regulations if the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce could openly defame government agencies in newspaper advertisements. Zhou Yizhi read the original text of the advertisement in public, believing that the wording was absurd and insulted the entire Legislative Yuan, and that there must be a response. Chen Haimei pointed out that it was incomprehensible that the competent authorities had turned a blind eye to this kind of action and had not corrected it. Liu Butong believed that this matter was only the action of a few people, and that the Chambers of Commerce in Tianjin and other places were unaware of this, and advocated suggesting to the National Government to dissolve the Chamber of Commerce. Wei Tingsheng, Deng Hongye, and others believed that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce did not hold a meeting before publishing this advertisement, so a few people should bear legal responsibility for this matter, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, which is in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, should investigate thoroughly. The Ministry of Social Affairs also cannot be excused for failing to stop it. Finally, because this matter involves criminal law and commercial law issues, it was decided to first submit it to the Criminal Law and Commercial Law Committees for research, and then submit it to the next general meeting for discussion.

### To Purify the Election Atmosphere: An Inspection Team Should be Organized
Legislator Hong Ruizhao Discusses General Elections

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] This morning, a reporter visited legislator Hong Ruizhao to inquire about his views on the upcoming general elections. Hong was one of the drafters of the ten major constitutional laws and has recently returned to Nanjing from his native Zhejiang. According to him, this year's general election is the first in Chinese history. As a former journalist, he returned to Zhejiang to listen to public opinion through news gathering and participate in the election with a modern democratic approach. He gave public speeches in various counties in eastern Zhejiang, attended more than twenty symposiums, and exchanged views on election issues with leaders from the agricultural, industrial, commercial, cultural, and other sectors. His preliminary observations are as follows: (1) The election atmosphere in various places is far from satisfactory, and phenomena such as coercion, bribery, and lavish banquets are still widespread, especially the favoritism and dereliction of duty of the responsible agencies. These phenomena often cannot be corrected by ordinary laws. He believes that to prevent election fraud, special regulations must be enacted and promulgated. At the same time, he is suggesting to the central government that supervisory committee members, legislators, senators, and members of various parties who do not participate in the election should be selected to form a roving inspection team to quickly go to various provinces and cities to conduct strict supervision to purify the election atmosphere. (2) He is a member of the Kuomintang. The guidance on party member election methods issued by the central government is a necessary measure for the party. This shows the wisdom of the authorities' decision-making. Today, the central authorities are generally able to be impartial and patriotic in handling elections, and are carefully planning. However, his impressions in eastern Zhejiang are that the central government's intentions may not be fully implemented at the lower levels, and that facts of Kuomintang members violating orders and using their powers have been seen repeatedly. Thinking of this, he is deeply worried. In order to maintain the discipline of the Kuomintang, in addition to the various regulations currently issued, it seems that further strict measures should be taken to ensure the execution of the central government's laws, otherwise the future of the election will be unimaginable.

### Madam Chiang Concerned About the Disaster Situation in the Northeast: Convenes a Relief Meeting, Elects Standing Directors and Supervisors, Decides to First Raise 1 Billion in Circulation Certificates to Handle Emergency Relief

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Northeast has suffered from the oppression and destruction of the enemy puppets for the past fourteen years, and has been repeatedly disturbed by communist bandits after the war. The local area is dilapidated, and the people's livelihood is miserable. This summer's rains have caused disasters, resulting in the successive flooding of the Liao River, Taizi River, Hun River, Qiaoliu River, Chai River, and Dongsha River basins. Crops have been submerged, and houses have collapsed. More than 2,724,000 acres of farmland in the eight counties and cities of Liaoyang, Haicheng, Xinmin, Liaozhong, Tieling, Panshan, Tai'an, and Yingkou have been flooded, affecting more than 500,800 people. The total loss of livestock, real estate, and assets is estimated at 287.5 billion national currency. Madam Chiang Kai-shek has always been concerned about the Northeast, and she personally went to comfort and appease the people after the restoration, earning their gratitude and praise. Recently, in view of the severe disaster situation in the Northeast, she convened a tea party with the directors and supervisors of the Northeast Relief Association and relevant people from all walks of life at her official residence at 5 p.m. on the 15th to discuss raising large sums of money to handle emergency relief in the Northeast.

2.  Regarding the issue of Japan's political system, we should firmly advocate abolishing the Japanese emperor system, implementing a democratic republic system, and strictly prohibiting any system that could revive warlords and financial magnates.

3.  Regarding the issue of Japanese territory, we should firmly advocate delineating the scope of its mainland in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement.

4.  Regarding the issue of restricting Japanese military equipment, we should firmly advocate thoroughly disarming Japan, prohibiting the reconstruction of naval, land, and air forces, and eliminating its combat potential to prevent the possibility of military aggression again.

5.  Regarding the issue of restricting Japan's industrial level, we should firmly advocate thoroughly dismantling the tools of Japan's economic aggression, just as we disarm it, so that it cannot engage in economic aggression again.

6.  Regarding the issue of restricting Japanese trade, we should advocate strictly managing and restricting Japan's exports and imports.

7.  Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, we should advocate taking the Japanese reparations plan drafted by Pauley as the minimum requirement.

We must decide as soon as possible what our country's attitude towards this batch of reparations goods is and what the transportation method should be to avoid causing intangible losses to the country due to further delays."

Everyone must recognize the Northeast and build the Northeast, and must recognize that the Northeast is the safest and most reliable place. We must build the Northeast psychologically and not abandon the Northeast psychologically. The Northeast is a powder keg and a volcano. We must protect it and build it to prevent it from exploding. This is not only beneficial to China but also benefits the international community and even all mankind. There may have been concerns about the military situation in the Northeast in August and September, but now I can clearly state that there are absolutely no problems with the military situation in the Northeast. Please rest assured that I will definitely seek progress in military, political, and educational construction.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] After the restoration of Hong Kong and Kowloon two years ago, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon initiated a donation to cast a golden statue of President Chiang.

### The U.S. Vigorously Reviews its China Policy: Secretary Marshall Invites Foreign Minister Wang to Meet, Contents of Two-Hour Private Talk Kept Secret

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall invited our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to dinner on the night of the 14th and held talks for two hours. It is reported that Secretary Marshall dined alone with Foreign Minister Wang, but the nature of the talks remains a diplomatic secret.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] U.S. Ambassador Dr. Stuart Leighton said on the 15th that the negotiations between the Chinese and American governments on continuing work after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are being conducted in Nanjing by both sides and an agreement will be reached in the near future. The ambassador declined to comment on the government's statement on the 14th regarding the Wedemeyer Mission, but said that the Americans are willing to see China's peace, unity, democracy, strength and vigor, and the Americans also very much want to do their best to assist China, and this principle will never change. The ambassador finally said, "He is paying the greatest attention to the recent reforms of the government," and said, "This reform is a progress in the right direction."

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Although President Chiang made a new appeal to the United States for aid in his war against the Communists, the United States has not yet decided on the issue of providing further aid to China. President Chiang issued a warning on the 14th through the embassy in the United States that the success or failure of his war against the Communists would not only determine the future of China, but also affect the security of the entire Far East. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that President Chiang's appeal was a timely motion because the U.S. policy toward China is currently under vigorous review, but they stressed that the future course of the China policy has not been decided before Wedemeyer returns to the United States in the middle of this week. It is expected that Wedemeyer will submit his recommendations to the President after President Truman returns from South America this weekend. It is also learned that China has now submitted various plans to the U.S. Export-Import Bank, totaling more than 300 million U.S. dollars.

### I Prevent Currency Inflation: Domestic Floating Capital Must Be Frozen: Views Expressed by Foreign Observers

[United Press, This City] Foreign neutral observers state: China's currency inflation, with prices starting to soar again, the only effective way for the government to eradicate it is to freeze domestic floating capital, so as to prevent it from causing trouble from time to time and disrupting people's livelihoods. Although the rice-producing areas have abundant harvests, the price of rice in this city has risen by nearly 50% in recent days. The exchange rate, which was stable in August, has now followed suit. The main reason for this unnecessary rise in rice prices is speculative hoarding. As legitimate commerce is restricted by regulations and cannot develop, hoarding has become an outlet for floating capital. Hoarding accelerates the rise in prices. Japanese floating capital is now also ordered to be frozen by MacArthur. If China wants to practice thrift,

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Financial authorities here state: The Chinese government now intends to have Chinese people repatriate foreign currencies held abroad, estimated to total between 300 million and 1 billion US dollars, but it is feared that the effect will be minimal. This measure has been approved by the National Economic Commission and is now awaiting official promulgation. Most financial observers here believe that this law cannot be implemented under the current circumstances. Some commentators say that the government's motive for proposing this is political capital rather than financial capital. Chinese officials have now openly criticized British and American banks for refusing to provide the names of Chinese depositors, believing that this will inevitably lead to the failure of this plan.

### Large Amounts of Northeast Capital Enter the Interior; Authorities Pay Attention and Will Investigate Thoroughly

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] It is reported that in the past ten days, large amounts of capital have been transferred to the interior, approximately 1.5 billion yuan in Northeast Circulation Notes and more than 17.2 billion yuan in legal tender. It is heard that the authorities are paying attention to this and will thoroughly investigate the owners of this large sum of money and its source.

[This Newspaper, Changchun, 15th] In order to stabilize prices in the Northeast, Chen Cheng ordered relevant departments to strictly investigate the account books of public and private banks to avoid the influence of floating capital. People who have been frowning over their livelihood due to the influence of floating capital in recent years are delighted to hear this news.

### Elimination of Price Differences in Trade Between the Interior and Exterior is Decided; Barter Method is Adopted; Exchange of Materials Between the Northeast and Taiwan Province is Still Difficult to Achieve

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The method of paying price differences for goods purchased from the interior by the Northeast will soon be abolished, and a barter method will be adopted in the future. The method of paying price differences for Northeast metal exports was formulated at the beginning of trade between the Northeast and the interior, when the price difference between the Northeast and the interior was extremely large. Northeast metals could obtain a large profit after being transported to the interior. The price difference was taken from the merchants' profits. However, since the fall, prices in the Northeast have fluctuated greatly, and at present, there is a trend of exceeding prices in the interior. Merchants do not make much profit from transporting goods to the interior. If they pay the price difference again, they will not only not make a profit, but may also lose money. The continued existence of this method will hinder trade between the interior and the exterior. Therefore, after consultation, the relevant authorities decided to abolish the method of paying price differences for purchased goods and adopt a barter method. In the future, importing merchants must transport materials designated by the Economic Commission from the interior in order to exchange for export permits for Northeast metals. Export merchants must also exchange materials for materials from the interior before they are allowed to export. However, the value of the barter must be equal. As for the types of goods to be bartered, the interior goods are daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rice, flour, and white sugar, and the exterior goods are metal materials such as pig iron, angle iron, and bamboo steel.

[Another Telegram] The exchange of materials between the Northeast and Taiwan is still difficult to achieve in practice. Pan Chesheng, a design committee member of the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee, who was previously sent to Taiwan Province by the committee, has recently returned to Shenyang from Taiwan. According to his report, after many contacts, the exchange of materials between the Northeast and Taiwan is difficult to achieve in the short term. This is because all sleepers in Taiwan Province are directly controlled by the Ministry of Communications. When other provinces need them, they must first apply to the Ministry of Communications for approval before they can be transported out. As for sugar, because the current stock in Taiwan Province is not very large, it is planned to be exported to earn foreign exchange, so it cannot be transported to the Northeast in the short term. As for Northeast metals, the only thing currently needed in Taiwan Province is the thinnest iron plate. The price of transporting this type of iron plate from the Northeast is not very suitable. Although fertilizer is needed in large quantities in Taiwan Province, the quantity of fertilizer powder transported by UNRRA is already not small, and its price is cheaper and its effectiveness is better. As for Northeast soybean cake products, it is still necessary to seek sales in Shanghai.

### Economic Commission Convenes Symposium to Discuss Increased Production of Agricultural Products for Export

(2) How to promote increased production and export through agricultural research and extension agencies. (3) How to coordinate with cooperative organizations. (4) How can the procurement policy benefit farmers without harming the national treasury? (5) How to implement the subsidy policy in a planned manner to stimulate production? (6) How to implement the export interlocking policy? All the above points were carefully discussed at the meeting, and the results will be organized for reference in drafting a long-term plan.

### Baotou-Ningxia Railway to Begin Construction Next Year and be Completed in the Same Year

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The surveying of the Baotou-Ningxia Railway is currently being accelerated.

The Baotou-Ningxia section is more than 500 kilometers long. The Ministry of Communications has instructed that construction must be actively started in January next year so that it can be completed in the same year.

### Details of the Impeachment Case Against Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau: Misconduct in the Distribution of Cars to the New Sui Company

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The case of the impeachment of Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, and others for dereliction of duty by Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang, Mei Gongren, Zhang Lu, and Ji Zhenfu has been established after review and has been transferred for disciplinary action. The details of the case are as follows: In November of last year, the Materials Supply Bureau entered into a contract with the New Sui Company, stating that the Supply Bureau would distribute 200 cars to the New Sui Company for sale in the Northwest region. Subsequently, the Jianguo Industrial Company also applied to the Supply Bureau for the distribution of 22 cars, but the bureau did not distribute them due to a lack of cars. However, Wang Yingbin, Chief Secretary of the bureau, promised to allocate a considerable number of cars to the New Sui Company's allocation, and Liu Zhitang, Manager of the New Sui Company, went to the bureau to complete the formalities and obtain a car purchase certificate. Later, when the vehicles arrived at the Shanghai Customs, the Jianguo Company went to pick them up, but the bureau declared the contract invalid due to the New Sui Company's breach of contract, converted the vehicles for sale in Shanghai, and stopped the sale. As a result, the Jianguo Company was unable to obtain the vehicles that it should have been allocated based on the certificate, and the Materials Bureau also considered the original contract invalid. Later, the bureau entered into another contract with the New Sui Company to distribute 100 cars. The New Sui Company then received 14 cars from the vehicles of the first contract that the bureau had declared invalid. Among them, only one had a certificate issued by a certain Northwest church, while the other 13 were received based only on certificates from local merchants. The Jianguo Company then filed a complaint. After the case was filed, it was established after review by Supervisory Committee members Mei Gongren and others. The reasons are approximately as follows: (1) The New Sui Company should be punished or the contract should be terminated for selling the vehicles that should have been sold in the Northwest in Shanghai in violation of the contract. (2) Only one of the 14 cars that the New Sui Company has already received has a valid certificate. (3) According to the first contract, all 200 cars should have been given to the New Sui Company for sale in the Northwest, but the bureau later allocated a portion of them to the Jianguo Company. Jiang Biao, Director of the bureau, Wang Yingbin, Chief Secretary, and the Director of the Distribution Office should all bear responsibility for the above points.

### Supervisory Committee Recommends Revising Regulations on Punishing Corruption

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Supervisory Committee members Liu Shidu, Miao Peicheng, Wang Guanwu, Yang Zongpei, and others recently suggested to the National Government to revise the Criminal Law and the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The main points of the suggestion are as follows: (1) If a public official does not accept a bribe, the briber is guilty of a crime, but the public official is not guilty of a crime. (2) If a person is solicited for a bribe but does not give it, the person solicited is not guilty of a crime, but the public official is guilty of a crime. (3) Regardless of whether a bribe is offered or solicited and accepted, the person who offers the bribe is not guilty of a crime, but the person who accepts the bribe is guilty of a crime.

Editorial

### Holding of the National Foreign Trade Conference

The National Foreign Trade Conference, initiated by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, held its opening ceremony yesterday in Shanghai and will enter the discussion phase today. The convening of this National Foreign Trade Conference, with the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the business community as the main body, brings together national industrial and commercial tycoons and economists to jointly review the overall plan for foreign trade in the future, which is truly a major event in the current development of foreign trade.

Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, and the government's implementation of trade control policies, the entire foreign trade activity in our country has experienced a bloated and paralyzed phenomenon, unable to return to normal. Taking imports as an example, the Export-Import Management Committee controlled imported goods and foreign exchange, and only foreign merchants and a few commercial firms had the convenience of foreign exchange settlement, while imported goods were biased towards luxury goods and unnecessary materials. Taking exports as an example, the government lacked policies to encourage exports, and exporters struggled without a way out under various restrictions such as unstable currency system, high interest rates, rising raw material prices, and inconvenient transportation, sharing the unfortunate fate with the entire industrial production. Due to the deviation of import and export activities and the deformed control methods, import surpluses have been increasing month by month. On the one hand, the domestic market is occupied by foreign luxury goods, and limited foreign exchange is consumed invisibly; on the other hand, the market for export goods is becoming increasingly narrow, and even the Nanyang market has been unable to gain a foothold. As a result, export goods have no way to go, and exporters have no way to go. The only ones who benefit are certain special trading companies or enterprise companies, who take advantage of foreign exchange fluctuations, get the news first, and make huge profits by hoarding export goods, which does not help the national economy or people's livelihood. This is the crisis of foreign trade in our country, and the major crisis of the overall economy.

The government has accurately grasped this point and is striving to save the current crisis. Therefore, the "Economic Reform Plan" particularly emphasizes that "the government should encourage exports with effective methods to gradually balance foreign trade." It also stipulates that import goods should adopt import restriction policies, "except for production tools, raw materials, and books and instruments, efforts should be made to strictly restrict them to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures." At the same time, a chain system and export promotion policies are adopted for import and export trade, stipulating that "export businesses should be actively encouraged, and the government may purchase materials to facilitate exports, or designate certain items to be operated in a chain import and export manner to ensure increased exports to offset imports" to save the import surplus. These two principles, of course, cannot include all foreign trade policies. If there is a real decision and a real way to implement them, the deformed control can be transformed into reasonable control, and imports and exports can be balanced, so as not to repeat the phenomenon of being bloated on one side and paralyzed on the other. Now, the government is relaxing the scale of foreign exchange control and is planning to implement export promotion policies, which is a reform of trade policies in line with economic reforms. But this decision is not enough, and the promotion is not enough, and great and far-reaching efforts are still needed.

The National Foreign Trade Conference is being held in Shanghai at this time, which has great significance. We hope that this trade conference can integrate theory and practice, formulate constructive plans, and advise the government. First, the implementation of import control must restrict the import of luxury goods and unnecessary materials. Second, the implementation of export incentives must establish export promotion reform policies and coordinate the use of import and export chain methods. Third, foreign exchange management must ensure that there is no waste, and the import of production tools and cultural and educational supplies must be rationally open to foreign exchange. In addition, the soundness of industry organizations, the relationship between international trade and overseas Chinese trade, and the necessity of establishing national foreign trade mechanisms are all important issues related to the development of foreign trade. The National Foreign Trade Conference brings together industrial and commercial tycoons and economists, and there is no shortage of experienced and knowledgeable people. It is hoped that the achievements of this conference will be contributed to the government for adoption and implementation, which will help the government establish foreign trade policies and develop foreign trade activities in our country.

### 55 National Representatives Gather in New York - UN General Assembly Opens Today - Soviet Union Firmly Expresses Maintenance of Veto Power

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: At a time when world problems are emerging one after another and US-Soviet relations are becoming increasingly tense, the United Nations General Assembly will open tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. in Flushing, so the post-war conflict between East and West is about to enter a new stage.

### Formal Exchange of Ratifications - Five-Nation Peace Treaty Takes Effect Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The exchange of ratifications of the peace treaty with Italy was held today in Paris by the four powers of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The treaty took effect at midnight standard time. The exchange of ratifications of the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary was held today in Moscow by the four powers. It was stipulated that 5:00 p.m. standard time was the effective time of the treaty. The exchange of ratifications of the peace treaty with Finland was also held in Moscow, with only Britain and the Soviet Union participating, because Finland had only declared war on the aforementioned two powers.

[United Press, Paris, 5th] Diplomatic representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and representatives from the French government, stored the originals of the ratified Italian peace treaty in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th. The ratified treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were stored in the Soviet government. After the Italian peace treaty formally took effect on the 15th, Italy completed its long-term efforts to replace Fascist politics with democratic politics, just as Churchill said, "Italy has completed its mission of returning home."

[Reuters, London, 15th] The peace treaties with the five countries of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland took effect today, and some time limits also started today. Within these time limits, the troops of the former enemy countries must be reduced, reparations must be paid, the ownership of the colonies should be resolved, the allied troops must be withdrawn, and the ownership of some lands must be determined.

Free Port Officially Born

The most important thing is the Free Territory of Trieste, which was born with the entry into force of the Italian peace treaty. Since the candidate for the governor of the Free Territory has not yet been decided by the Security Council, according to Annex VII of the Italian peace treaty, its temporary regime will continue to be managed by the Allied military government. The Allied troops under the jurisdiction of the military government, that is, the troops stationed in the Free Territory by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and South, are limited to 5,000 each, and Italy's sovereignty in the Trieste port area will be suspended immediately. The deadline for the withdrawal of Allied troops also starts today. The British and American troops in Italy and the Soviet troops in Bulgaria should be completely withdrawn within 90 days from September 15th. The Soviet Union may maintain some troops in Hungary and Romania to protect its transportation line to Austria.

Italian Colonies Resolved Within a Year

The disposal of Italian colonies will also be finally decided by the four powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France within one year from today. A special meeting of the four-power representatives will be held in London soon to discuss preparations for the final decision on the Italian colonies by the higher authorities of the four powers. The land, sea, and air forces of the former enemy countries should be reduced to the number stipulated in the peace treaty within six months from today, but the time limit for the reduction of the Italian navy is nine months. The surplus war equipment of the former enemy countries should be handed over to the Allies or destroyed within one month from today. Italy will also return the antiquities, documents, and all items of historical value taken from Abyssinia to Abyssinia within eighteen months from today.

Allied Countries Monitor the Implementation of the Treaty

Although the peace treaty does not explicitly stipulate when the Allied Management Committee in Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria and the British-Soviet joint military delegation in Finland should end, Britain believes that these institutions should end immediately from the date the peace treaty with each country takes effect. Each peace treaty stipulates that the implementation of the peace treaty and the resolution of disputes arising from the peace treaty should first be handled by the ambassadors of the powers stationed in each country. Therefore, in Rome, they are the ambassadors of the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, in the Balkan countries, they are the political representatives of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and in Finland, they are the ministers of Britain and the Soviet Union.

Four Powers Divide the Remaining Italian Ships

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] The four-power naval committee arrived in Rome today, and the work of distributing the surplus Italian warships has begun. The committee was formally established after the Soviet Union ratified the peace treaty with Italy. According to the supplementary agreement signed by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, after the Soviet Union obtains the warships allocated from Italy, it should return the warships borrowed by Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union during the war to Britain and the United States. The warships that Britain and the United States lent to the Soviet Union include: one battleship borrowed from Britain, seven destroyers, and three submarines. The United States lent one cruiser. It is reported that the Italian government has requested some of the four powers to abandon some of the Italian ships that can be obtained according to the Italian peace treaty. Marshall has stated that the United States can at least give up a part of the Italian ships under its name, and he expects Britain to take the same action. At the same time, Italy is indignant at the division of the Italian fleet.

The Amount of Compensation Owed by the Five Countries

[United Press, Paris, 15th] The peace treaty stipulates that the five Axis powers should pay a total of 1.33 billion US dollars in compensation. Italy should pay 360 million US dollars in compensation and cede about 3,000 square miles of African territory. Although Bulgaria did not lose territory, it should pay 70 million US dollars in compensation. Finland paid 300 million US dollars in compensation to the Soviet Union, cut off the Pete Province, and leased the Bakala Island to the Soviet Union as a naval base for a term of 50 years.

### Edible Oil Directly Distributed to Oil Shops: Avoiding Price Hikes Through Multiple Transfers; Social Affairs Bureau Suggests to China Trust Bureau

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with Mayor Wu yesterday to discuss the issue of edible oil supply in this city and suggested to the China Trust Bureau that it reconsider the current oil distribution method. According to Mr. Wu's conversation with reporters: When the Joint Edible Oil Distribution Office existed, the China Trust Bureau's oil allocation was directly distributed to the oil shops for sale to citizens. Based on the actual sales volume of each oil shop and an investigation of its business situation, the allocation was limited. Oil shops could not hoard it. This prevented oil speculators and trafficking merchants from profiting, but it benefited the citizens. Since the abolition of the Joint Distribution Office, the China Trust Bureau's oil allocation has been changed to direct distribution to oil factories. The oil factories then sell this allocated oil on the market, allowing for free buying and selling, which has pushed oil prices higher and higher. Oil shops must purchase edible oil from the market for sale. This involves multiple transactions, plus commissions, market expenses, and oil factory profits. As a result, the price of oil sold to citizens has increased significantly, and the only beneficiaries are oil merchants. Therefore, it is suggested that the China Trust Bureau restore the past method of direct allocation to oil shops. Otherwise, if the current oil distribution method continues, Mr. Wu believes that oil prices will not fall.

### Shanghai Has a Rare Large Diamond: Value Estimated at US$1.5 Million

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources close to the banking community: A rare, world-class diamond is currently stored in a safe deposit box of a bank in this city. This diamond belongs to an overseas Chinese from Singapore, who inadvertently purchased it at a low price from a miner during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the fall of Singapore, he was detained by the Japanese invaders for two years. This diamond was hidden under the roots of an ancient tree beforehand, and thus was able to survive intact. After the victory, it was re-excavated, and its brilliance was the same as before. He took this diamond to Taiwan, where a certain authoritative professor at National Taiwan University confirmed that it was a type of diamond. When he passed through Hong Kong, he sawed off a small piece of the protruding part of the diamond, weighing about one hundred carats, and sold it for HK$40,000. Experts estimate that the diamond weighs about 680 carats in the rough. With some polishing, the net weight could be more than 400 carats. This is about five times heavier than the 87.5-carat diamond discovered in Arabia in June of this year, and is comparable to the largest diamond in the British Crown, the "Second Star of Africa" (309 and 1/4 carats). It is truly a rare treasure. It is said that the owner of the diamond is currently in Taiwan and hopes to sell it for US$1.5 million.

### Shanghai Municipal Financial Deficit; Central Government "Does Not Intend to Subsidize"; Municipal Government Receives Reply from Executive Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] The financial situation of the municipal government this year is very tight. Director of the Finance Bureau Tian Yongqian and Director of the Accounting Office of the Municipal Government Min Xiangfan went to Beijing last month to request subsidies from the central government.

Therefore, the municipal government has now decided to find ways to raise funds itself.

### Group Assistance to Education Breaks Records; Seven Virtuous Individuals Contribute 100 Million; Impoverished Students Benefit Greatly

At a preparation meeting for the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" a month ago, Mr. Shi Yonggeng, the vice chairman of this newspaper, stated that he would personally be responsible for raising 50 million yuan for the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" as a clarion call for the scholarship movement to attract the attention of society and achieve the goal of "accumulating many small efforts to make a great achievement."

A month has passed quickly. Mr. Shi has been running around in the hot weather, soliciting donations. Now, the facts prove that his efforts have not been in vain, and the results of the fundraising have exceeded expectations by a factor of one. This means that impoverished students who are waiting for assistance have received 100 million yuan in aid.

Mr. Shi joined forces with six other close friends to donate 100 million yuan to the scholarship fund. These six individuals are Mr. Lu Jusheng, Mr. Wu Zhongyi, Mr. Chu Shunwei, Mr. Tan Jing, Mr. Zhu Zhiyang, and Mr. Zheng Hongyan.

These six philanthropists politely declined all the praise that we had planned for them and instructed us not to publish their real names. However, we boldly violated their wishes because we are too excited, and we are also happy and encouraged for the future of impoverished students. We call these seven gentlemen the "Seven Great Philanthropists." They also have a sincere friendship with each other, emulating the style of the "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove" in ancient times.

We hope that this trend of "group assistance to education" can spread quickly and widely. We believe that not only will the Reader's Scholarship Fund Committee benefit from it, but perhaps the lascivious atmosphere of society will also change as a result. (Donation report published in the social services column)

### "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Purging Corruption Committee" Accuses Li Zhuomin of Neglect of Duty with New Facts

[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA), being secretly reported for dereliction of duty and corruption, has been investigated by Supervisor Wu Benzhong and reported to the Control Yuan for impeachment. Yesterday, a person named "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Purging Corruption Committee" sent letters to the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Envoy's Office, the District Procuratorate, the Municipal Council, and various newspapers, stating several new facts about Li's corruption and dereliction of duty. According to the letter: (A) Regarding Li Zhuomin's part, (1) He received traitor Wang Jingwei's assets, intending to embezzle them. (2) He wasted public funds for personal enjoyment. In the spring of the 35th year (1946), he ordered Hu Keshi, the Director of the General Affairs Department, to purchase a piano for 7 million yuan and a carpet for 8 million yuan, in addition to radios, etc., totaling more than 30 million yuan, which is equivalent to hundreds of millions of yuan at current prices. (3) He arbitrarily appointed his relatives. Last spring, the ERRRA selected 30 staff members to study in the United States. Li Zhuomin did not avoid suspicion and sent his younger sister, Li Zhuo, abroad. She was only nominally appointed as a "Commissioner" of the Shanghai branch of the ERRRA a few days before leaving. According to the regulations, the staff members studying in the United States should return to China after nine months, but Li Zhuo has not returned. Also, last summer, the ERRRA decided not to hire new people due to financial difficulties, but Li approved the appointment of his elder sister, Li Qiu, as a staff member of the Agricultural Business Committee. (B) Regarding the allocation of materials by the General Merchandise Purchasing and Marketing Office of the Finance Department: The fraudulent method for distributing electric fans was that half of the total number was actually purchased by buyers, and half was purchased by managing staff for profit, so there were two delivery orders for each large batch of distribution. As of now, there are still 400 units in the Industrial and Mining Equipment Warehouse, and more than 300 units in the store, and they are all trying to disperse them.

### Grievance of a Woman's Chamber: Nominal Couple Sues for Divorce

Yesterday, the District Court received a bizarre divorce case.

However, Xi suffered from a hidden illness and could not have conjugal relations, so she remained a virgin until now. Gu sued for divorce, but fearing that the court would not believe her, she specifically requested that a forensic doctor be sent to examine both the man and the woman to prove her case. It is learned that the District Court has accepted the case and scheduled a preliminary hearing for the 13th of next month.

### Bloodshed Still Present, Flames of Evil Not Extinguished: Raping Female Teacher, Shooting Speaker: The Main Criminal Sun Junbo's Second Trial: Death Sentence? Reduced Sentence? To Be Revealed in Days

[Report from our Newspaper, Xi'an, 10th by Airmail] Sun Junbo, the former magistrate of Zhen'an County, Shaanxi Province, who is famous throughout the country for his case of raping a female teacher and shooting the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, resulting in five deaths, was initially sentenced to death in the first instance by the local court and appealed the decision. During the debate in the Shaanxi Higher Court on the 8th, Sun gesticulated wildly, sometimes speaking vividly and dramatically, and sometimes shouting in a high-pitched voice. He vehemently argued that his marriage with the female teacher Wang Huimin was legal and claimed that Wang's death was not due to poisoning. Sun also claimed that the Speaker of the Assembly, Li Weihan, had been selling opium before his death, and the evidence was conclusive. "This local tyrant and evil gentry usually lends money at high interest rates, exploits the villagers, and wants to control the county's administration, create a private military force, and hide a large number of weapons, plotting a riot." "Li's death has eliminated a great scourge for the people of Zhen'an." However, regarding the shooting incident in which he personally led the county government guards and the provincial inspector Ma Zhuoran to Li's residence, he made various sophistries, trying to shirk responsibility. His "touching" and contrived testimony was: "As a revolutionary soldier and the magistrate, regardless of whether Li was killed by me or not, I am undeniably responsible. If I die, please execute me immediately! This case has implicated many of my subordinates (referring to his guards) who have been sentenced to death, and Inspector Ma has been sentenced to imprisonment. It's unjust! China must advocate humanity, otherwise, China will always have problems!" "The prosecutor in the first-instance indictment said that I fired the first shot. That prosecutor is simply disregarding human life!" Sun's argument lasted for an hour and a half, and he sounded like an "orator," so the hundreds of listeners, crowded like sardines in a can, listened attentively throughout. Sun's

The main evidence included letters between Wang and her parents before and after her death, and private correspondence from Speaker Li, but none of them were new pieces of evidence recently presented to the court. Some of the statements might be favorable to Sun, but they were not entirely favorable. Sun's guards, Yang Baojun and Yang Xutang, both expressed their dissatisfaction with the death sentences in the first instance, and said, "We are guards, please explain what the word 'guard' means? If the presiding judge has guards and encounters an assassin, what should the guards do in an emergency?" His words

Were filled with tears, and those who aided and abetted the crime should regret it now.

Ma Zhuoran, the inspector sent by the provincial government to conduct a secret investigation after Wang's death due to the county's residents accusations against Sun, was demoralized and his testimony was weak and disorganized. He began by saying, "I am innocent. I have no weapons, how could I kill someone? Sun doesn't even admit to killing someone, how could I instigate murder?" When talking about accompanying Sun Junbo to the entrance of Li's residence on the day of the incident and encountering gunfire between both sides, "At that time, there was no time to think. If I had taken good photos on the spot as proof for today, I would have been dead, and I wouldn't be here to testify today, and even, state... ..." He "paused" for half a minute before continuing, "I can't even eat dinner today!" The silent audience burst into laughter for the first time. Regarding some of his confessions at the provincial security command before the case was transferred to the court, Ma still denied them. One of the key phrases was, "Killing a county magistrate or two doesn't matter!" He categorically denied ever making such a statement and said that he was coerced when he made the statement at the security command.

Fan Moshi and his wife Zhang Tianzhen also appeared in court today. Fan was originally the director of the Zhen'an Youth Corps Preparatory Committee. According to the first-instance judgment, Fan and his wife helped Sun lure Wang Huimin to Zhen'an to commit adultery and were sentenced to three years in prison. Fan disagreed and cited counter-evidence in this appeal, believing that

Sun and Wang's union was voluntary on both sides, and they did not participate in the introduction or matchmaking, because Sun and Wang were old acquaintances. When Sun was in Xi'an, Wang moved her luggage to Sun's hotel and voluntarily accompanied him to Zhen'an. Zhang happened to go along the way; Sun and Wang were very affectionate on the way; "Wang got up in the middle of the night to cover Sun with a quilt." After arriving in Zhen'an, Wang stayed at the county government that night, not at the Youth Corps. Zhang visited her at night and learned that they were drunk. When she went again, the guards told her, "The magistrate is sleeping with his wife!" The next morning, Wang ordered someone to go to the Youth Corps to retrieve her luggage, and in the afternoon, they announced their marriage.

Wang's father, Wang Xianzhu, insisted that Fan and his wife could not escape their guilt, because Fan had sent a letter to Wang's daughter, luring her to Zhen'an to find a job in the Youth Corps. After she arrived in Zhen'an, all her actions, including her death, were contrary to the

Original plan, and Fan did not notify Wang's parents, so he had to be considered to have colluded and deceived them.

The defense lawyers argued one by one, but the most surprising thing was: "Murderers should not necessarily be sentenced to death, because the punishment of retribution is long gone. Executing murderers is the plan of traitors and communists!"

Will the sentence be reduced? Will the original sentence be upheld? The result of the second trial will be revealed in a few days. However, one thing is worth mentioning: the criminals all felt that the news media had exerted pressure on them in terms of public opinion, and even believed that the urging of public opinion made it difficult for the judiciary to deliver a fair verdict!

Sun disagreed and appealed. The Shaanxi Higher Court announced today that the death sentence would be upheld. Only the parts of rape and abduction were reduced from the original 12 years to three years in prison. The appeal of Sun's two guards was also rejected, and the original death sentence was upheld. Sun and others will definitely appeal to the Supreme Court again. (Reporter Mai Ye)

### Ning County Goods Station Branch Director Xie Zengrong Not Corrupt; Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office Impeaches Him Twice

[Report from our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Xie Zengrong, the Director of the Ning County Goods Station Branch, was impeached by the Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office in March of this year for privately collecting security deposits, not issuing tax receipts, and increasing tax collections on his own. The Ministry of Finance specially sent an inspector to investigate, but no results were obtained. Recently, he was impeached for the third time by the Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office for colluding with subordinates to commit corruption and fraud. The main case of fraud was underreporting the tax on local yellow rice wine. Xie only reported 10,800 vats of yellow rice wine. After a thorough investigation by the Hangzhou Bureau, 443 vats were added to the report. In the 28th year (1939), there were 34,000 vats of wine, indicating that the number of unreported vats was very large. He also accepted bribes to approve the stamp tax bookkeeping of the Qixingyu Cigarette Factory. Qian Baolu, the director of the Xiangshan Office, was not held accountable for contracting the wine tax. The purchased tobacco leaves of the Fujia Cigarette Factory were found to have tax receipts and stamp numbers that did not match. He condoned the Sanhe Trading Company's sale of tobacco leaves and lent the collected tax money. At a time when Chairman Shen has repeatedly emphasized the strict prohibition of harassment and the rectification of officialdom, it is truly unacceptable to violate the law. Therefore, Supervisory Envoy Zhu submitted an impeachment letter, which was sent to the Ministry of Finance by the Control Yuan for punishment.

### Jiangsu Field Grain Department Gathers to Discuss; Implement Land Designation and Grain Payment

[Report from our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] The 36th year's (1947) in-kind land tax collection is about to begin.

(4) A committee for urging grain payment and rent collection will be formed by representatives from the party and youth leagues, the county council, the county government, the Field Grain Department, the farmers' association, and landlords. (5) All grain-receiving landlords must first pay the grain before they can collect rent along with the grain. (6) The grain collection office in the townships and towns of the grain-issuing department is absolutely not allowed to concentrate or assign grain payments with any slips or vouchers. Violators will be dealt with as corruption. (7) Tenants who complete the land designation and grain payment within the first month after the start of the land designation and grain payment will receive a reduction of 40% of the rent rate, in addition to the 25% rent reduction.

### Xiamen Railroad Tracks Stolen and Sold in Quanzhou; Fujian Authorities Intensifying Investigation

[Report from our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 13th] There has never been a long-distance railway built within the territory of Fujian Province.

### Representatives of the Far East Basic Education Conference Visit Basic Education Institutions in This City; Indian Representative Lavishes Praise on Shanghai's Elementary School Achievements, Comparing Them Favorably to Those in England

[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives of the Far East Basic Education Conference are staying in Shanghai for a very short time. Therefore, though they had only just unpacked their luggage the night before, yesterday they began visiting various basic education institutions in the city. At 9:30 AM, after breakfast at the International Hotel, they were accompanied by reception committee members Chen Heqin, Zhu Junti, Hu Shuyi, Shu Xincheng, Lu Guanliu, and others to visit the First Central National School in the Fifth District. They also attended a welcome meeting held at the school. Principal Hu Huaitian delivered a welcoming speech, and representatives U Ba Lwin from Burma and Dicksey from Sarawak gave speeches in reply, expressing their willingness to do their best to promote international children's communication. At 10:30 AM, they arrived at the Central National School in the Third District of Nanshi to visit the Language Education Exhibition. At 12:00 PM, they returned to the International Hotel for a luncheon hosted by the Municipal Education Bureau. Acting Director Li delivered a welcoming speech, stating that in the past, the Shanghai Concession authorities did not pay much attention to basic education, with only the central urban area having a rough scale. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the war. Currently, the Education Bureau is making great efforts to rebuild the foundation of basic education in order to popularize education. He hoped that the representatives from various countries would provide many suggestions after the visit, pointing out ways to improve. Dr. Luo Ruisi, a representative from the United Nations Educational Organization, and Indian expert Gahada, in their reply speeches, expressed their deep gratitude for the warm reception from the local authorities and stated that future international cultural exchanges would definitely be promoted smoothly. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and hosts and guests enjoyed themselves. At 4:30 PM, the representatives went to visit the editorial office of the China Bookstore on Macao Road. General Manager Li Shuming and Chief Editor Shu Xincheng and others of the bookstore cordially received them. After touring the book and teaching aid exhibitions and educational films, they had refreshments together. Li and Shu both stated that the literacy campaign is a current urgent task, and "China Bookstore" is doing its best to promote various tools to aid literacy in order to eliminate illiteracy. United Nations Educational Organization representative Hubbard delivered a reply speech in Chinese, strongly stating that basic education should be targeted at the "illiterate" common people and should be combined with livelihood education to improve the people's living standards. At 6:30 PM, they went to the Municipal Experimental People's School to observe students' various activities and screen educational films, hosted by the school's principal, Yu Qingtang. At 8:00 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu, accompanied by Hang Liwu, Chen Heqin, and Li Ximou. At 10:00 PM, they went to the Lyceum Theatre to watch the Yicai School's dance drama.

After visiting various schools, a reporter inquired about the opinion of Indian representative Saiyiding, who said that the facilities and achievements of the schools in this city were comparable to those of some elementary schools in England. China is a large country with 500 million people, and promoting basic education is naturally an important goal. India implemented basic education as early as 1937. The achievements are not worth mentioning, but one thing is the same as China's, India's basic education is also fully managed by the Ministry of Education. He hoped that China and India would work together in education with sincerity, which would help world peace.

### United Nations Educational Organization Forms Chinese Committee; Executive Committee Members All Appointed; First Meeting Held Yesterday, Chaired by Zhu Jiahua

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th] The fifteen executive committee members of the Chinese Committee of the United Nations Educational Organization were previously elected ten by the General Assembly, and the remaining five were to be selected by the Ministry of Education according to the regulations. The Ministry of Education has now selected and appointed Ren Hongqiao, Li Shuhua, Cheng Qibao, Jiang Menglin, and Fu Sinian. The first Executive Committee meeting was held at the Ministry of Education at 5:00 PM on the 15th. Chairman Zhu Jiahua (1) resolved that Zhu Jiahua be the chairman of the Executive Committee, with Hu Shi and Wu Yifang as vice-chairmen; (2) decided on the candidates for the members of the six specialized committees on natural sciences, social sciences, philosophy and humanities, education, mass communication, libraries and museums, and arts and literature, with each committee having five to nine members. The meeting adjourned late.

### Hu Shi's University Plan; Opinions Expressed by Scholars in Beiping

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping on the 15th] Hu Shi's ten-year university education plan has attracted considerable attention from all parties after its publication. When a reporter inquired about this from several well-known figures in educational circles here, they offered their opinions as follows:

Hu Xiansu

(1) Hu Xiansu, Director of the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute, believes that Hu's opinion is quite correct, and the five universities mentioned are also quite good. However, the omission of Sun Yat-sen University seems problematic because Sun Yat-sen University has a fairly good scale. With some reorganization, it can become a first-class university, so it may be helpful to list six first. In addition, several second-class universities should also be identified, such as Nankai, Normal University, and Zhongzheng University, which can all be included while assisting their development to bring them up to the first-class level. Regarding using foreign exchange for students studying abroad as funding to develop several universities, Director Hu advocates that part of it can be transferred, but it should not be biased.

Lu Zhiwei

(2) Lu Zhiwei, Acting President of Yanjing University, takes a third-party standpoint. He believes that it is not impossible for the country to concentrate its efforts on developing several universities, but the timing is not yet right. He also believes that Hu Shi's estimate of the amount of foreign exchange is too much. Most students studying abroad are self-funded, and since they are not allowed to go abroad, there is no need to include their foreign exchange. However, in reality, studying abroad is still necessary because China's social environment often cannot match the disciplines. For example, in economics, Chinese society cannot serve as the background for this discipline, while the United States can. "Sun Yat-sen" and "Central" universities are indeed well-managed, but this is subject to restrictions, such as Wu Youxun, who is very capable of running a good school.

Yuan Dunli

(3) Yuan Dunli, President of the Teachers College, agrees with Hu Shi's plan in principle but says that in practice, funding and transportation conditions will limit the implementation of this plan. (4) Zheng Chi, Dean of Academic Affairs at Peking University, fully agrees with Hu Shi's plan. He deeply feels that the 15,000 US dollars the government gives Peking University each year is not even enough to buy magazines. He believes that some disciplines do need to rely on foreigners, but he knows that there are many good professors from the United States or other countries who are willing to come to China, and some are already in contact. Therefore, if the funding is sufficient, the equipment of several universities can be improved without problems. Regarding Zou Lu's question to Hu Shi about Sun Yat-sen University, Zheng said that, as a Cantonese, he is responsible for pointing out that Sun Yat-sen University is not well-managed.

### Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee to Conclude This Week

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiaotong University School Affairs Reorganization Committee has decided to conclude its work within this week and has scheduled its closing meeting for this Saturday. Yesterday, taking advantage of Vice Minister Hang's presence in Shanghai, the committee held a temporary meeting. It was decided that, given that the school only had six weeks of classes last semester and many classes were missed, students in the second and third grades will be required to make up the courses from last semester starting on October 1st, which is expected to take one and a half months. There will be no winter vacation next year. Committee member Zhao Zengjue told a reporter: "The Reorganization Committee is about to conclude its work. In the future, work such as adding school buildings and increasing equipment must still be promoted in a timely manner. We hope that the entire school will work together." Zhao said that the Reorganization Committee, alumni association, and professors all unanimously welcomed Cheng Xiaogang's continued tenure as president.

### National Foreign Trade Conference Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday Morning with 155 Representatives from Various Units in Attendance; Assembly Passes Telegram of Respects to Chairman Chiang

The National Foreign Trade Conference held a grand opening ceremony at 9:30 AM on the 15th in the auditorium of the Bank of China on Renji Road. In attendance were 155 representatives from 33 units, including 19 cities such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Henan, Hunan, Ningxia, Taiwan, Liaoning, Yunnan, Shandong, Chongqing, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Qingdao, as well as overseas Chinese business associations from Nanyang, Mexico, and other regions, the National Industries Association, the National Import and Export Trade Association, the National General Chamber of Commerce, and the China International Economic Association. Guests included Mayor Wu, Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Chairman John Keswick of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Chairman Charles of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, and Tao Si. The conference was chaired by a presidium consisting of Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun Chu, Xu Jilong, Shou Jingwei, Luo Qinghua, Zhang Yujiu, Tao Guilin, Wang Yizhai, and Huang Zaisheng.

The opening address was first delivered by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, who stated: "The current foreign trade problems facing our country are but one link in a chain of urgent economic issues that need to be resolved. In addition to the trade problem with Japan, other issues such as trade with the United States, Britain, Nanyang, India, Australia, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, and France, as well as foreign exchange and tariffs, all deserve our deep attention. Furthermore, how to adapt trade policies to actual needs, how to improve the organization of trade associations, how to strengthen the front lines of foreign trade, and how to effectively promote the modernization of trade management methods are all matters that import and export associations across the country urgently need to discuss in detail in order to find solutions. The National Foreign Trade Conference is being held with this goal in mind. The conference is scheduled for three days, and participants include leaders and experts from industry, commerce, and finance. This conference, initiated and convened spontaneously by the private sector, is a first in our country. We hope that through earnest discussions, we can integrate the opinions of the government and the people into one, achieving the goal of communicating the intentions of the upper levels to the lower levels and conveying the feelings of the lower levels to the upper levels. We hope that both the government and the business community can clearly define their objectives in terms of (A) controlling imports, (B) encouraging exports, (C) opening up foreign exchange, and (D) promoting an import-export chain system, and move forward bravely. This would not only be fortunate for the trade community but also a major turning point for the entire national economy."

Secretary-General Shou's Report

Shou Jingwei, Secretary-General of the conference, reported on the preparations and made two statements: (1) It is a great honor to have the Chief Executive and representatives from various regions attend this National Foreign Trade Conference held in Shanghai. It is especially hoped that the representatives from Mexico and Nanyang and other foreign countries will speak more so that people in Shaanxi can fully understand the trade situation of overseas compatriots; (2) As of now, the conference has received 66 proposals, and 33 units have registered, with 155 representatives (22 representatives were originally scheduled, and 33 were added). Shou also hoped that after this conference, the government would (A) coordinate with national policies, actively protect nascent national industries, and vigorously implement a national mobilization for foreign trade; (B) establish export promotion policies to reverse the crisis of excess imports; (C) establish trade administrative agencies and improve the organization of trade controls; (D) enhance domestic commercial organizations and strengthen close ties with the overseas Chinese trade community; (E) protect the investment interests of foreign businesses and promote international economic cooperation.

Mayor Wu's Speech

Mayor Wu said in his speech: "Shanghai is the commercial and financial center of the country. Without foreign trade, Shanghai would not have its current status. If the center of foreign trade shifts, Shanghai's prosperity will be difficult to maintain for long. The rise and fall of foreign trade is closely related to China's entire national economy and people's livelihood. All of you present here are experts on these issues, so I will not go into detail. However, as a local official, I would like to offer a piece of advice from the perspective of an outsider.

Regardless of what issues are discussed, it will be fraught with difficulties during this period of unresolved internal strife. In this environment, we should pay attention to one premise: 'Seek everything within ourselves, not from others.' When discussing all issues, we must first examine ourselves. Just now, the chairman mentioned the current situation of the business community and pointed out several reasons for the increase in costs. Although the government bears some responsibility for these reasons, the business community itself has much to examine and improve. We must cooperate sincerely, abandon private interests, and think about the overall future.

One of the major problems in China today is that everyone complains but does not seek solutions. Although some plans proposed by some people are good, they often demand too much under the current circumstances and are extremely difficult to implement. Therefore, when discussing all issues, we should adhere to the principle of 'lowering our sights and avoiding lofty pronouncements.' All reform plans should first start with small things, and we must consider whether it is possible to achieve them by starting from ourselves and working step by step. The business community has always been a pragmatic worker. I believe that the issues discussed at this conference will be practical issues and will provide practical assistance to the development of foreign trade."

Vice Minister Liu's Speech

Next, Liu Siying, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, delivered a speech, stating: "Representatives from all over the country have gathered here to discuss foreign trade issues. I believe that the outcome of this conference will decisively affect the government's foreign trade policy, which is of great significance. The focus of this conference is on principles such as encouraging exports and import-export linkage, as well as technical issues. Regarding the former, in my position at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, I am willing to cooperate with all sectors of industry and commerce to encourage exports. Our goal is not only to balance imports and exports but also to stabilize the national budget. As for import-export linkage, there are some prerequisite issues in terms of technology that need to be resolved. We hope that we can study solutions and work hard to overcome difficulties. Furthermore, regarding labor-management issues, we strongly hope that both sides will cooperate closely so that we can concentrate our efforts on developing foreign trade. The government has no barriers or prejudices against the private sector. We hope that in the future, the government and the people will work together as one. Regarding the number of business representatives to Japan, etc., if all sectors have any opinions, they can put them forward as much as possible so that they can be considered and adjusted in the future. Japan's foreign trade is gradually recovering. We can tolerate its self-sufficiency, but we cannot tolerate its development of ambitions to overwhelm China's trade. We must catch up quickly, not only as a political issue but also as an economic issue. Only through close cooperation from all sectors of the country can we achieve complete success."

### Continued Meeting in the Afternoon; Representatives Report on Foreign Trade Situation

Next, Zhang Yujiu and Chen Zhongda, representatives of the Import and Export Business Association, spoke one after another. Zhang Yujiu's slogan was "China's Foreign Trade Needs New Policies," believing that imports must focus on promoting industrial production, and exports must be based on revitalizing the rural economy as the greatest principle. Therefore, he advocated dividing industries into four categories: export, people's livelihood, national economy, and basic, and maintaining them according to their nature. He also advocated emulating Britain's "hunger export" policy and engaging in large-scale exports with all efforts. He also put forward various specific suggestions on the four major goals of transport, import control, finance, and insurance.

Next, Luo Zongqiang, representative of the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce, Yao Xiaolian, representative of the Jiangxi General Chamber of Commerce, He Xiufu, representative of the Shandong General Chamber of Commerce, Wang Zhuoran, representative of the Shenyang General Chamber of Commerce in Liaoning Province, He Yagu, representative of the Guangdong General Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Huiqing, representative of the Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce, Yu Baixi, representative of the Yunnan General Chamber of Commerce, Chen Yuntian, representative of the Hunan General Chamber of Commerce, Chen Zhizhi, representative of the Hubei General Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Xiaoyi, representative of the Beiping General Chamber of Commerce, You Shuming, representative of the Guizhou General Chamber of Commerce, Xie Xiaowen, representative of the Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce, Qian Sunqing, representative of the Jiangsu General Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yizhai, representative of the Nanjing General Chamber of Commerce, and Gui Huashan, representative of the Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce, respectively reported on the foreign trade situation in their respective regions. The gradual decline of the two major export trades of silk and tea, as pointed out by He Yagu, the representative from Guangdong, and Zhu Huiqing, the representative from Zhejiang, attracted the most attention from the conference. Finally, Tian Heqing, representative of the China Industrial Association, and Zhang Yaozhang, representative of the Import and Export Industry Association, spoke separately. Tian Heqing hoped that: (1) The authorities would carefully consider trade with Japan; (2) Importers would assist industry and commerce with industrial raw materials, and the government would relax import controls. Zhang Yaozhang stated the various difficulties faced by import and export merchants over the past year. After the speeches, Chairman Wang Xiaolai announced the list of members of the various group meetings and the drafting committee of the conference declaration, and the meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM.

### Chinese Stock Market Confidence Shrinks; Yonggong Once Hit Limit Down

Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw general retail investors expressing disappointment at the lack of movement in foreign exchange rates. An initial period of optimism after the opening was ultimately forced to give way to a sell-off. Some major investors even sold off-market. Credit tightened severely, while those delivering goods still seemed crowded. The overnight interest rate rose to 1.8 and 2.25 cents, causing Yongsha to shrink further. Hengshu even engaged in spot selling on the market, eventually becoming unsustainable. Yonggong at #187 and Xinya at #158 saw panic selling, both falling to the daily limit.

Slight rise at the morning opening; increasing after opening. Yongsha was bought by #108, etc., rising to 249 yuan. #232, etc. sold and fell back to 242 yuan and 244 yuan. #235, etc. still buying, and #152 even reselling actual Yongsha. At this point, there was speculation that exchange rates would shrink, pulling Yongsha up to high prices of 249 yuan and 25 yuan. #173, etc. closed positions one after another. First, there was the blow of the exchange rate not moving, followed by the impact of the overnight interest rate rising to 1.8 and 2.25 cents. Some long positions were cut off-market. Hengshu was unable to maintain it and engaged in spot selling of Yongsha on the market. Although #103 bought in the middle, #99, etc. strongly sold actual Yongsha. The situation became even more unfavorable after 11:30 AM. Xinya from #158 and Yonggong from #187 saw panic selling and fell to the daily limit.

Near noon, Yongsha gradually fell to a low price of 236 yuan for spot delivery and 241 yuan for forward delivery, before #226, etc. settled spot Yongsha, and the market closed at 238 yuan and 242 yuan. There was a slight rise after the close due to price reductions.

As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yonggong fell by the limit and then recovered, a decrease of 10%. Zhongfa Underwear, Jinglun Matches, and China Textile each fell by 5%. Yongsha, Xinyi, Meiya, Huafeng, Xingguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing saw slight declines. China Silk and Xinhua remained flat. Xinya fell by the limit. Lian'an's trading was not widespread and rose by 0.5%. Zhabei was pulled down slightly. Rongfeng and Shangwu were also the same. Forward delivery stocks showed that Yongsha, Xinyi, Meiya, Huafeng, Xingguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing all declined slightly. Various old stocks off-market also showed a bearish attitude, with slight declines. Bank stocks remained stable.

Another report: Yong'an Company is implementing a capital increase, and its stock will be temporarily suspended from trading starting on the afternoon of the 17th.

### China Trust Bureau Calls Oil Merchants to a Resolution: Edible Oil Restores Free Trading

[Report from This Newspaper] The Material Distribution Advisory Committee of the Central Trust Bureau convened a meeting of various parties related to edible oil in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Decheng, Li Tingdong, Xie Yuxiang, Zhou Weibo, Yu Ruxin, Zhang Chao, etc. attended, and Ren Xianxiang presided over the meeting. The crux of the recent fluctuations in the oil market was discussed in detail. During the meeting, it was believed that the past policy of compulsory low-price sales did not help the actual situation, and the production and transportation of edible oil were instead hindered. Finally, it was resolved that in order to rationalize edible oil prices, so as to facilitate the flow of edible oil sources and increase production, from the 16th onwards, the reasonable free trading price will be restored.

[Another report] According to people in the edible oil industry: The restoration of reasonable free trading prices for edible oil this time can promote the rationalization of production costs for factories and sales costs from producing areas to Shanghai. Oil prices will gradually decline. The China Trust Bureau will continue its previous method of purchasing rapeseed and will purchase oilseed raw materials in various producing areas again, deliver them to various factories to squeeze 30,000 dan of oil, so as to increase the supply of edible oil.

Another report: Yesterday, the digestion of raw oil was acceptable, and prices held steady at 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Soybean oil was scarce and firm. Rapeseed oil and clear oil were all up by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil soared by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Wheat owners were firm, and factory offers were very tight, with the situation trending towards strength.

### Consolidated Bonds Stagnant; Foreign Stocks Decline

Yesterday, bond trading decreased to around 2 million, and the process was very sluggish. Unified Bonds C also fluctuated around 12,000 yuan. Unified Bonds C opened in the morning at 12,000 yuan, rising from 12,200 yuan and falling to close at 11,800 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, Unified Bonds A, B, and C remained relatively stable, while D and E each fell by 300 yuan.

Foreign stocks saw a decline yesterday. Retail investors and foreign merchants were no match for the securities firms' selling. Yisha rose from 102,000 yuan and gradually fell to close within the 100,000 yuan mark. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wheelock Marden, Yeguang, and Paper Industries saw slight declines. Yisha, British American Tobacco, Yip Beer, Navigation, and Steel Industries each fell by 0.5% to just over 0.5%.

### US Dollar Bond Certificates Began to Be Exchanged Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] Thirty-Sixth Year US Dollar Bond Certificates began to be exchanged at National Bank branches and treasury coupon reservation vouchers yesterday. It is also learned that the first round of lottery principal redemption will be held in Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance on the 25th of this month.

Another report: Twenty-Sixth Year Short-Term Treasury Bills sold US$41,080 yesterday, totaling US$364,920 sold.

### Cotton Yarn Negotiated Prices Adjusted

[Report from This Newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Negotiation Committee's negotiated prices were adjusted again yesterday. 20-count yarn has been raised to 12.5 million yuan, an increase of 700,000 yuan from before. The remaining counts of yarn increased proportionally.

Also, yesterday, the Textile Construction Company was notified by the Textile Negotiation Committee that cotton yarn orders must be picked up within seven days. Starting yesterday, customers who purchased cotton yarn must pick up the goods within seven days from the date of the order issued on the warehouse receipt.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Weakened

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market turned weak. The price of 142-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell back by 600,000 yuan from Saturday, down to 18.9 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton market opened steadily, but then went downstream, and the market shouted small all the way. Fortunately, the American Guang Dyeing Factory purchased thirty to forty pieces of Longtou fine cloth in the middle, which supported the market. Near closing, Longtou fine cloth was most frequently traded from 538,000 down to 34,000, and finally down to 523,000, a decrease of 14,000 yuan from Saturday.

### Zhang Jia'ao Flies to Guangzhou

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the National Bank, flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou by China Aviation yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to preside over the establishment of the South China Import and Export Management Committee.

### Copper and Tin Rise

According to people in the hardware industry, the market for zinc and copper and tin was previously sluggish due to the summer off-season. However, with the start of fall sales at the beginning of this month, the market has shown signs of improvement, with the highest increase in zinc and foreign zinc. Yesterday, blue zinc rose to 950,000 yuan per market dan, and Mexican foreign zinc rose to 1.15 million. The industry was absorbing it very actively, and tin foil factories also had strong demand. The price of pure tin soared to 4 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan from last week. Other purple copper and brass also followed suit, rising by more than 100,000 yuan.

### People's Food Allocation Committee Plans to Establish Storage and Transportation Offices to Purchase White Japonica and Bo Rice for Resale

[Report from This Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the recent increase in the price of white japonica and bo rice is due to the influence of the producing areas. Among them, bo rice is particularly expensive due to the shortage of goods. New rice will be available in large quantities in more than ten days, and prices will soften after it enters the market. The price of indica rice, which is eaten by the common people, remains stable. The People's Food Allocation Committee, in view of the fact that it holds foreign rice, which is not easy to sell when white japonica and bo rice rise in price, plans to establish storage and transportation offices at this time when new grain enters the market. The central bank will provide loans to purchase white rice and bo rice from the producing areas and store them. In the future, the Allocation Committee will still use foreign rice as the main body for ordinary rice allocation, but if there is a large fluctuation in white japonica and bo rice, it can also allocate and sell the stored domestic rice. The task of purchasing from producing areas will be entrusted by the Allocation Committee to rice merchants to handle on their behalf. Because there is concern that designating a small number of stores will easily repeat the "grain loan case" and cause disputes, the Rice Merchant Industry Association will be entrusted to organize a joint transportation company to handle it on their behalf, and the Allocation Committee will give them legal profits. Currently, the Association's written opinion on this matter has not been sent to the Bureau. If it is unwilling to take responsibility, the Allocation Committee will directly find merchants to entrust a small number of stores to handle it.

### Reader's Mailbox: University Student Makes Urgent Appeal to Work Hard to Maintain Studies

Editor: I am one of the tens of thousands of poor students today. I want to find a kind-hearted person to help me, because I no longer have family support (my family is a poor tenant farmer in Sichuan, which has now suffered from a devastating flood), and even the student canteen that I relied on to maintain my studies after returning from military service is about to close. This puts me in a desperate situation. Autumn is coming, and when school starts, books, stationery, winter clothes, and other things are all necessary, but these cannot be obtained for nothing. I must rely on my own efforts to obtain all of this, so I urgently need to find work (such as a long-term home tutor), and I am even willing to do manual labor. I think someone will give me a sympathetic hand. I will repay those who help me with diligent work. I humbly request that your newspaper grant me a small corner of the service column to disclose my situation, so that those who are struggling in poverty will benefit greatly. With best wishes for your well-being. Reader Huang Daxian, September 14, Communication Address: No. 311, Central Courtyard, Jiaotong University, Xujiahui.

### Enlightenment from a Historical Standpoint: Examining the Near-Century Painting Exhibition

— Zheng Wuchang

Every era's paintings have a close relationship with the politics, education, economy, and customs of the time. When we observe the dynamics of painting with a historical perspective, whether good or bad, flourishing or declining, its position and significance in history are equally worthy of study. The Shanghai Art Museum Preparatory Office's holding of a century-long painting exhibition has led some who care about the art movement to believe that there are very few masterpieces among the painting relics of the past century, so why promote them specifically? However, if we only talk about painting as painting, this suspicion is not excessive; from a historical perspective, looking back and forth, we feel that the paintings of the past century are worth collecting and exhibiting for those who care about art to explore.

Since the early Qing dynasty, the imperial family used painting to embellish politics, and the so-called "Four Wangs" were most respected. For a time, painting historians competed to imitate them, making Lou Dong and Chu Shan as bright as the sun. After Qianlong, Yangzhou became an economic center of China due to its location as a transportation hub between the north and south. Painters from all directions came to show off their skills and compete for fame and profit, and thus the Eight Eccentrics emerged. They set up different banners outside of the Four Wangs, gaining considerable momentum. Because of the agitation and attraction of these two major schools, if one did not follow the Four Wangs, they would learn from the Eight Eccentrics. Everyone became Shigu, and everyone became Xinluo, focusing solely on "imitating a certain master's style" or "learning a certain master's intent" as their ability. Not only did they not know how to improve, but in the end, they did not even capture a trace of the spirit of the Four Wangs or Eight Eccentrics they were imitating. This kind of malpractice has become particularly prominent in the past century. Except for Ren Bonian, Wu Qiunong, and Wu Changshuo, almost all were victims of this malpractice.

During the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Western paintings followed religious figures into China, and Chinese paintings were greatly influenced by them for a time. However, because they did not suit the tastes of the Chinese people, they did not gain much influence. In the past century, in addition to Western paintings for religious propaganda, copies of masterpieces by famous Western artists and cameras capturing natural scenery have been continuously introduced. Painting historians inevitably abandoned the old for the new, favoring the new and disliking the old, and competing to imitate them, advocating innovation. However, the moods of Chinese and Western paintings are quite different; communication between the natural world and silk is also difficult; and the skills of those engaged in innovation are very immature. This resulted in something that was neither a donkey nor a horse, and their thoughts and opinions on painting became chaotic, leading later scholars astray and at a loss as to what to do.

The rise of a generation's painting style seems to require a few famous and high-ranking painters to crown and lead it. The masters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties were almost all "official hat" figures. In the past century, initially because of the suppression of chaos and the restoration of prosperity, importance was attached to fame and fortune; later, in order to cope with foreign troubles, everyone discussed foreign affairs. Not a single famous official or noble was skilled in painting and could become a master of the generation. Even those few with fame and status who loved painting, such as Weng Tongsu and Duanfang, only did casual brushstrokes to express their feelings. The fate of painting was in the hands of ordinary people, historical figures, and famous Jianghu figures, either indulging in temperament without knowing the principles of painting, or specializing in copying without any vitality, or favoring ease and simplicity as being superior, and wantonly pursuing strangeness as being heroic. Therefore, very few pure and erudite people succeeded.

There are many ancient Chinese paintings handed down, but some are hidden deep in the inner palace, and some are treasured by private families. They have never been publicly exhibited for everyone to view. In the past century, the imperial families and gentry who were rich in collections, in addition to dedicating themselves to ledger-style records, boasting of wealth, and facilitating sales, have done very little practical work for painting. Gu Xijin was still able to copy the Four Wangs, and he was truly outstanding among ordinary people. In addition, only one or two Qing guests of collectors were still able to view and copy them, and few achieved much. People like Lu Lianfu and Zhang Zixiang were considered fortunate. It is no wonder that most other painting historians with limited experience were unable to progress due to the lack of artistic food.

During the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, domestic and foreign troubles worsened year by year, and the country was poor and the people were impoverished. Not only did they not have time to promote painting, but they also regarded it as not urgent and often underestimated it. Most of those who could paint sold their art for a living due to economic pressure. They only sought to complete the work, not to be exquisite; they only sought to please the public, not to respect antiquity. This created a rough and superficial style, with very few grand and magnificent works.

Because of the molding of the above-mentioned situations, the painting scene of the past century has been formed. This is very clear and certain. Those who are responsible for the revival of literature and art and have lofty aspirations must prescribe the right medicine and seem to pay attention to the examination of the disease. This centennial exhibition has collected many reports of illnesses for people to diagnose. Together with the "lessons of the past," they can be "horses that know the way" and find the "road to revival." This centennial painting exhibition provides us with at least the following enlightenment:

One: Painters who blindly imitate a certain school will eventually be sacrificed by that school.

One: To innovate painting, one must have considerable cultivation, profound understanding, silent transformation, and not start with destroying the old.

One: It is hoped that famous officials and nobles with fame and status, rich in artistic food and artistic talent, should work hard for art and become leaders of the era.

One: It is hoped that there will be more opportunities for public exhibitions of ancient masterpieces so that everyone can appreciate and observe them. Do not hide them deeply, losing the meaning and effect of preservation and transmission.

One: The life of a painter emphasizes the spiritual and deemphasizes the material; the life of a painter is not limited to the present but extends to the afterlife. It is their duty to endure poverty and hardship. Do not be greedy for cheap profits and abandon oneself carelessly. All the oppression of the times will also stimulate the development of the artistic spirit. The philosophers of painting in the Five Dynasties and the late Yuan Dynasty are worthy of our respect and imitation.

The centennial painting exhibition has already opened on the fifteenth. This is the total unveiling of the painting achievements of the past century. It is hoped that everyone will visit and examine it—comparing how the paintings of the previous century were? Comparing how the paintings of the next few decades will be? How should we promote it? How should we improve it? To inspire the future of the literary and artistic revival movement.

### Preface to the Near-Century Painting Exhibition

— Li Ximou

Examining the origins of world civilization, it can be divided into East and West. The West is the Italian Peninsula, and the East is our Eastern Asian continent. China adopted the civilization of Mesopotamia and combined it with Indian civilization to form a unique system of Eastern culture. Its painting art is particularly radiant, and its artistic conception and purpose are completely different from the realism of Western painting. It truly possesses the unique style of our national spirit.

Moreover, the characters of our country began with pictographs, depicting the traces of birds and beasts and the images of mountains and rivers. Writing and painting were not separated! Later, as society gradually became more complex, the characters evolved, and painting separated and became independent. The antiquity and profoundness of painting during the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties can often be seen in the bronze and stone carvings unearthed today. The outlines, lines, and coloring of paintings before the Southern Qi Dynasty had the same style as the wall paintings of Indian temples. After the Jin and Tang Dynasties, calligraphy progressed, emphasizing brushwork and advocating style. Painting and calligraphy once again tended to be consistent, using the brushwork and spirit of calligraphy in painting. Therefore, although their forms are different, their meaning and spirit are consistently connected.

During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, painting presented a flourishing image, with figures, landscapes, and flowers progressing in various disciplines. The appreciation of painting was given equal importance with poetry and prose. Whether monarchs or scholars, all engaged in painting to express elegance, forming the golden age in our painting history. Since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, landscape painting has occupied a major position, and the painting style, although claiming to have many schools, was at its peak for a time, but in fact, there has not been much change. Only after Xianfeng and Tongzhi, the international and domestic situations changed suddenly, and academic culture underwent drastic changes. Painting also changed greatly as a result. Some adhered to the ancient methods, imitating ancient masterpieces to seek their skill, while others used Western methods, advocating the integration of Chinese and Western painting methods. People had different opinions and adhered to their own theories, which was different from the situation of respecting the South and belittling the North a century ago. Painting is a cultural product that reflects society, expresses thoughts, and expresses emotions, so today's painting after a century should have its historical value of the spirit of the times, which cannot be ignored. Therefore, if you want to study our paintings of past dynasties, you must start from the past century, and then follow this to explore gradually, which is the meaning of "going far starts from near" and "climbing high starts from low."

European and American countries have always attached great importance to art and culture. Even in remote rural areas, there are art museums established as places for people to cultivate their minds and bodies and cultivate their temperament. In our country, apart from the Palace Museum, art museums are still lacking. Shanghai is an international city and also occupies a leading position in the country. The Education Bureau, in response to the requirements of social figures and the cultural and art circles, established the Art Museum Preparatory Office, and first held a century-long painting exhibition. At the beginning of the founding of the country, culture and education are important. The century-long painting exhibition allows citizens to have the opportunity to appreciate and observe, and the effects of spiritual influence are immeasurable. This is the preface.

### Imitating Tang Yin's "Spring Mountain Companions"

Wu Dacheng, a native of Wu County, named Ziqing, with the aliases Hengxuan and Quzhai. He was skilled in appraisal and collection. He entered the Hanlin Academy as a Jinshi in the Wuchen year and became the governor of Hunan. In the Jiashen year of the Guangxu reign, he returned to his hometown and taught at the Longmen Academy. He was young and skilled in meticulous brushwork and calligraphy, and in middle age, he added ancient seal characters. He was also skilled in engraving and painting. His landscapes and flowers used elegant brushwork. The hills in this painting are winding, the mountains are embraced by clouds, the brushwork is smooth and the ink is deep, and the atmosphere is rich. The original inscription of Tang Yin is recorded above, and the calligraphy is well-rounded. It can be called a perfect combination. (Chen Yishi's knowledge)

### The Significance of the Near-Century Painting Exhibition

— Shi Chongpeng

The paintings of our country originally shared the same origin as calligraphy. Later, due to differences in complexity and differences in quality and writing, one tended towards symbols for recording events and had a fixed form, while the other tended towards natural shapes and had no fixed state. This is how calligraphy and painting diverged.

Since the Yellow Emperor painted vultures and elephants to quell chaos and drew Shen Tu to ward off ghosts, painting has been dependent on social practical use throughout the Tang Dynasty and beyond, meeting the needs of ancestral halls, drawing ceremonial clothes, and painting clothes and hats. From the Three Dynasties to the Qin and Han Dynasties, the power of the monarch was established and the Rites were formed. All the affairs of painting embodied the political and educational significance of "achieving education and assisting human relations." At the end of the Han Dynasty, the Three Kingdoms were divided, and the political and educational systems collapsed. Thoughts gradually became free. During the Wei, Jin, Southern, and Northern Dynasties, wars continued, and scholars escaped to pure talk to suppress the world. Buddhism took the opportunity to flow in, and religious painting flourished. Since the Tang and Five Dynasties, Buddhism has intermingled and infiltrated with the original Confucian and Taoist cultures, forming a new culture. Therefore, although the art production at that time was still centered on Buddhist paintings, it had broken away from the original imitation stereotypes of the Six Dynasties, creating a new and unique spirit of Chinese art. Only since Wang Wei brought poetry into painting did it become the beginning of literati painting. During the Song (Liao, Jin), Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, painters, writers, calligraphers, and epigraphers were closely linked. Freehand brushwork and light ink, writing intention and conveying spirit, painting and calligraphy presented a trend of complementing each other.

In the sixty years of the late Qing Dynasty, after the Opium War, it was no longer possible to close the country to self-sufficiency. Externally, there were the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion. Internally, there was the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Hundred Days' Reform. The fate of the country was in the midst of storms, and the old cultural tradition also shook its foundations. When the sea ban was lifted and the enlightenment movement rose, Western art gradually entered this land, and there was a confrontation between new and old painting schools. During the Republic of China, after the "May Fourth" Movement, which was praised as the Chinese Renaissance, and the "July 7th" War of Resistance, which launched the national restoration movement, China went from being weak to one of the five powers. The cultural topic also went from wholesale swallowing of Western culture and accepting the legacy of ancestors to the integration and exchange of ancient and modern Eastern and Western cultures, stepping into a new era of containing the essence and discarding the dross. Painting art corresponded to the spirit of the times and entered a new stage. In summary, from Xianfeng and Tongzhi to the present, it has been about a century. Chinese painting and Western painting began as incompatible as water and fire, confronting each other and governing each other, just like the beginning of the confrontation between new and old cultures. Then they induced each other, drew on each other, mediated each other, and improved each other, which was no different from the integration and reconstruction of new and old cultures. During this century, Chinese painting, like its country and its entire culture, has undergone enormous tests and has been baptized by fire. At present, it also carries the glorious mission of inheriting the past and opening up the future. There is no doubt about it. However, today's commentators often praise the paintings of the Jin and Tang dynasties, and everything after that is despicable and unworthy of discussion. They do not know that one era has the artistic tasks of one era and cannot be compared in this way. If what they say is true, then painters can lay down their brushes after the Jin and Tang dynasties. Therefore, if we want to correctly estimate the value of the paintings of the past century, we must first abandon this kind of antique-style prejudice and start from history before we can recognize that the national art of this era has indeed inherited the great cause of the predecessors and nurtured new embryos. Its acceptance of Western art is the same as the acceptance of Indian Buddhist art in the Han and Tang dynasties, and the development trends of the later period can be seen from this.

The Art Museum Preparatory Office is holding a painting exhibition, starting with the near-century painting exhibition. In the future, it should follow the flow to explore the source and successively hold exhibitions of the Four Wangs of the early Qing Dynasty, and even the Ming, Yuan, Song, Tang, Jin, and Han dynasties, exploring in stages, intending to start from near and far, knowing the present and learning from the past, facing the art and historical value of painting in the past century, and also correcting the antique concept of respecting only the ancient.

The Shanghai Art Museum Preparatory Office organized the centennial painting exhibition, which opened yesterday at the Cultural Association on Nanchang Road. The only thing is that this exhibition has a lot of reference value for the changes in modern Chinese calligraphy and painting. This publication has previously made some comments, and now it is specially compiled several related articles to prepare readers for reference. (Editor)

### Four Red Figures

— Ren Weichang

Ren Xi, a native of Xiaoshan, named Weichang, was skilled in flowers, birds, landscapes, and especially figures. His study of antiquity was profound, so he was able to get rid of all vulgarity. His brushwork was vigorous and could approach the seat of Zhanghou. His works include "The Sages of Yue," "Immortals," and "Wine Labels," which have been handed down to the world. The brushstrokes in this painting are firm and resolute, using only the central brush technique. The four beauties in the picture have curved eyebrows and full cheeks, approaching the style of the Tang Dynasty. It can be called Weichang's deliberate work. (Chen Yishi's knowledge)

### Preface to the Collection of the Centennial Painting Exhibition

— Gu Yuxiu

The painting of our country has a long history, beginning in the Tang and Yu dynasties and taking shape in the Three Dynasties. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, it has become even more magnificent. Buddhist solemnity, colorful paintings, and portraits of meritorious ministers in the Lin Pavilion all convey spirit. Talented people emerged in the Jin and Tang dynasties, and the Six Canons were fully prepared. The artistic conception and spirit of the Song and Yuan dynasties all reached the top grade. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, the subtleties and mysteries have reached their extremes. The spirit of the Chinese nation has been entrusted. In the past century, the world has changed, and culture has been exchanged. Painting has also been influenced by it. The Shanghai Art Museum Preparatory Office has collected more than 300 works by deceased masters of the past century and held an exhibition. It has also selected 24 masterpieces and reproduced them into a collection for viewing and observation. Is this also what the art-loving gentlemen like to allow? This is the preface.

### On Meng Xiaodong

— Drum King

Mr. Du Yuesheng's sixtieth birthday saw many famous Peking opera performers from Beiping come south to celebrate, the most notable being Meng Xiaodong, a female performer. Those in the south who had heard of her fame were eager to know the extent of her artistry. I have been traveling to Beiping for ten years recently, and I have listened to Meng's plays a total of six times. In terms of ten years, it should not be so few. However, the "Winter Emperor" (many who supported Meng in Beiping called her the Winter Emperor) lived a secluded life in Beiping and often suffered from minor illnesses. During these ten years, she performed less than ten times. I heard "Catch and Release" three times, "Scolding Cao" twice, and finally "Searching for Orphans and Saving Orphans." The last one, Cheng Yanqiu's famous play, is very difficult to perform well. These were all Uncle Yu Shuyan's signature plays. Meng performed them with mellow and rich singing, and her strength captured the essence of Yu's style. Listeners thought that Yu Shuyan had been ill for a long time and never performed publicly. Therefore, they were happy to buy a goat (something unexpected). It is not by chance that the reputation of the Winter Emperor has increased year by year.

Singing depends mainly on the voice. Those who do not have a unique gift cannot enjoy great fame. Twenty years ago, when the Winter Emperor performed in Shanghai, my old friend Mr. Ma Er (i.e., Feng Shuluan) praised her greatly, saying that this woman's voice was excellent, especially suitable for singing Tan school. Feng never easily praised anyone. I had heard her sing several times at that time, such as "Empty City Stratagem" and "Hongyang Cave," etc., but I felt that her voice was better than ordinary female performers, but her art was not particularly different from others. Later, her reputation rose sharply, and she performed "Visiting Mother" with Lanfang, one sheng and one dan, which can be said to be the ultimate in matching. Then, the two became a couple, and I thought that this song should only be available in heaven. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last long, and they soon parted, and we music lovers were able to enjoy our ears. This was not what we had originally hoped for.

The Winter Emperor's voice is broad, bright, and sweet, and she is especially good at using it appropriately. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, the Tan, Sun, and Wang schools stood side by side. Tan's voice was actually not as good as Wang's or Sun's, but Jiao Tian's cultivation was unique, and he was able to gather the great achievements of his predecessors. Therefore, his style was unique and crowned the times, and the theory was unanimous. The reason why Uncle Yu was able to succeed Xin Peifu was also because of his style. The Winter Emperor focused on learning from Yu. When Uncle Yu was ill, she often stayed at Yu's residence to take care of him. Yu's successor, Ms. Yao, often told people that the Winter Emperor's care for the patient was better than a filial daughter's care for her biological father. When Yu's illness improved slightly, he would definitely teach her all his heart. The Winter Emperor's ability to achieve today's achievements is also truly admirable for her dedication to research.

I was overjoyed when I first heard "Catch and Release" in Beiping. I thought that her singing and tone were actually in the style of Tan Yu. After three days of separation, how could you not look at her with new eyes? Today, in the male actors' circles, Tan Fuying is the best sheng (male role), Jin Shaoshan is the best heitau (painted face), and Zhang Junqiu is the best qingyi (female role). However, it is difficult to find someone who is good at both singing and acting. Is Meng Xiaodong close to it?

The Winter Emperor's voice cannot exceed Xiaotan's, but her style is far beyond Fuying's. Someone told me that in addition to personally studying with Uncle Yu, Xiaodong had been with Bao Jixiang for the longest time. Old Bao had a wealth of drama knowledge in his mind. He researched every gesture and movement in every play in great detail. He had performed with Old Tan, so he described in detail to the Winter Emperor all the movements in Jiao Tian's plays. Therefore, when Xiaodong came on stage, her attitude was calm and generous, and even male actors could not match it. We said that Su Liang's acting was poor, and Shi Sen's was sickly. Dang Ying's stage steps were especially casual and ridiculous. The Winter Emperor stood out from the crowd, and it cannot be said that she was not outstanding.

### News Clippings

— Compiled by Xiaozhu

At a meeting of the hiring committee of a university in Shenyang, a certain dean and the president had a dispute over something. The dean said to the president at the time: "What do you know? I have two doctoral degrees in Germany. Where is your degree? In Germany, seven students had more than 40 world-renowned professors. Have you ever heard of it? I fought in the Anti-Japanese War for eight years and have more than 120 books. Where are your achievements?" The audience was stunned.

Police officers in Fengrun County go out every day to inspect the cleanliness of the streets and households. If they find unclean families, they will fine the housewives and make them wear pointed paper hats and parade through the streets. Housewives throughout the county are panicked.

The three universities of National Peking, Tsinghua, and Nankai jointly recruit students this summer. One question in the history test was "What was discovered at Zhoukoudian?" A student answered: "The body of Zhang Shenfu was discovered"; also, in the Chinese test, please explain the phrase "Hu'er." A student answered that "it was the nickname that President Hu's mother called him in his childhood."

### The Spooky Phone Call

— Huai

After three years in the military camps of Africa and Italy, medical officer Qiu was finally on his way home. His wife, Marie, hearing this exciting news, prepared to plan what appropriate things to say when her husband made his first phone call ashore. This phone call must be perfect. But the more she thought about it, the more confused she became and the less she could find anything appropriate to say!

Later, she simply had no choice but to ask her cousin for advice. Her cousin was an army lieutenant who had just returned from overseas. He smiled at her and said, "What? There's nothing to it. When the phone comes, just say, 'Hello, dear!' He will say, 'Dear, how are the children?' Then you tell him that the children are fine. Wouldn't that open the conversation? That's too easy!"

One evening two days later, the phone rang as expected. After a long time, his voice was finally heard.

"Hello, dear!" Marie said happily.

"Hello, dear!" the medical officer replied loudly.

Then, he got stuck, and she got stuck, and they couldn't say anything. Marie was so anxious that she remembered the lieutenant's formula in a panic. She screamed, "How are the children?"

The father, who had been away from home for three years, said in confusion, "Huh, good! Good!"

### A Week in Film

— Li Zhen

"The Devil and Daniel Webster" is Worth Recommending

Just on the strength of Edward G. Robinson, Margaret O'Brien, and Walter Huston starring in a film, it's already worth watching. At the very least, it's much stronger than those colorful films.

The story of "The Devil and Daniel Webster" is similar to "National Velvet," set in a small American village, delicately and vividly depicting this group of kind villagers, their work, life, and some hopes. Through the life of the Stone family, the whole village's activities are brought out, and the two innocent and lovely children—Mary and Daniel—are the main thread connecting all the characters. The author, through humanistic descriptions, elegantly and gracefully completes this "The Devil and Daniel Webster." If we don't demand too much, then this film is worth recommending.

Obviously, the actors surpassed the director's achievements. Edward G. Robinson's Daniel Stone deeply carves out a kind and simple farmer. Margaret O'Brien's Mary and Walter Huston's Mr. Scratch are indeed a pair of gifted young actors. They naturally and intimately portray the characters' personalities. Especially Margaret O'Brien's scene when watching the circus is particularly impressive, making people applaud for her. In addition, James Craig's Jabe Stone and Anne Shirley's Belle also perform quite excellently.

Of course, the director's achievements should not be ignored either.

The Nonsensical "Keep 'Em Flying"

"Keep 'Em Flying" is an old film starring Jeanette MacDonald and Robert Young. The story depicts the love history of a news reporter and a singer, interspersed with an anti-Nazi spy story. If you want to find rationality in this spy story, that's simply illusory. Everything is like child's play in the playwright's depiction. Those many Nazi spies are just used to create excitement, in order to complete this farce. Therefore, the tone of this film is very low.

If you want to satisfy your desire to hear Jeanette MacDonald sing, then this film will also disappoint you. Robert Young's performance is also unremarkable.

The Unremarkable "Flight Command"

Hollywood films mostly depict the "King Kong" and "hero" types. So, after watching too many, it really feels a bit "tiresome." Even if we take a step back, the male protagonist Jamie Grayson in "Flight Command" is just a frivolous American youth who indulges in romance and casual love affairs in life. During combat, he displays personal heroism. Although he ultimately serves the country, such a character should still be negated.

In terms of performance, Robert Taylor's Jamie Grayson lacks any outstanding performance. Among the other actors, only James Stephenson is somewhat satisfactory.

The Still Watchable "I Met Him in Paris"

The director's achievement in this film is also very mediocre. This film depicts a young man who is physically and mentally damaged after returning from war. Therefore, he refuses to see his family and fiancée, and his life becomes lonely, isolated, and eccentric. Later, he falls in love with and marries a country girl due to their daily interactions, which restores his joy in life. Such a simple story emphasizes psychological portrayal, so it is called a "literary film," but it doesn't have any special features. However, under the direction of John Cromwell, the atmosphere and mood of this film are very good, especially the scenes at the factory and the seaside are exceptionally beautiful and moving.

Loretta Young's performance as the female lead is better in the first half of the film, but lacks brilliance in the second half. Robert Young, as the male lead, puts in considerable effort, and Herbert Marshall is competent as the musician.

"Buck Privates" and "The Gay Falcon"

"Buck Privates" is a slapstick comedy starring Abbott and Costello. The whole film is nonsensical, using the tension of racing to stimulate the audience, but it's actually an old trick. Another film, "The Gay Falcon," is a low-quality action film from a small company, with chaotic fighting and nothing to recommend it.
