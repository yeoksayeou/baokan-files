They will first go to Nanjing and are expected to arrive on the 22nd of this month. The journey will pass through San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy announced tonight: Lieutenant General Wedemeyer is expected to arrive here around noon on the 20th and will reside at Ambassador Stuart's official residence.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Our government has prepared to invite experts to thoroughly study the current national situation, draft concrete and feasible aid-to-China measures, and submit them to Wedemeyer for his return to Washington for U.S. reference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in frequent contact with the U.S. Embassy in recent days, preparing for his arrival.

### China Obtains Peace Early: Beneficial for Sino-American Commerce

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul General in New York, delivered a speech at the Rotary Club of New York City today, urging American friends to change their traditional view of China as a remote country. Zhang stated that due to the close friendship between China and the United States, their cooperation during the recent war, and the development of modern transportation, China has become one of America's closest neighbors. A "bystander policy" is bound to fail, as friendship is not only a responsibility but also a privilege. A peaceful and prosperous China will undoubtedly benefit the United States. The sooner China obtains peace and restores order, the more beneficial Chinese commerce will become. We have a shared vested interest in establishing an orderly world to resolve the threat of totalitarian policies.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] An editorial in the English-language "South China Morning Post" discusses Wedemeyer's visit to China, anticipating that China will eventually receive American aid. Wedemeyer may inherit the task relinquished by General Marshall and become the U.S. Special Envoy to China. The newspaper stated that Wedemeyer's mission is, in theory, to implement the Marshall Plan, rebuild war-torn areas, and promote the stability of the world economy. The newspaper believes that Wedemeyer's trip will have good results. The newspaper acknowledges that there are fundamental differences between Europe and Asia. However, the Marshall Plan is not superficially charitable but constructive. Therefore, when the Marshall Plan extends to Asia, China cannot be excluded.

### Zhang Jia'ao's Remarks in Tianjin: Efforts to Restore Northeast Lost to the Current; Serious Food Problem in North China, Urgent Solutions Sought

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 16th] Zhang Jia'ao left Tianjin by train at 4:00 PM on the 16th for Peiping and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 19th. The trip to the Northeast has not yet been decided. It is reported that Zhang discussed matters concerning material institutions in Tianjin and Shanghai with Mayor Du before his departure. Zhang, in a meeting with reporters, first described the situation in the Northeast, stating: The restoration work of the past year since last May has now been destroyed again, and the manpower and resources spent have been lost to the current. He will go to Pan in the coming days to inspect the situation in the Northeast, study the required funds, and then seek restoration again. Regarding the relationship between the government's cessation of subsidy policies and the reduction in issuance, Zhang said: The figures accounted for by subsidies are actually not very large. Zhang's main purpose of this trip is to solve the food problem in North China, and he has conducted specific research on the required difference. According to reports: The sources of grain in Peiping and Tianjin are none other than the Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, Bei-Ning, and Jin-Pu routes. Currently, only the Ping-Sui route can still provide assistance. However, North China is experiencing famine, so the food panic is not only in the cities but has also spread to the countryside, making this problem even more urgent. The solutions are none other than domestic and foreign purchases. The harvest in the Yangtze River basin is very good, and it is hoped that a portion can be used to assist North China. However, the required coarse grains are produced very little in South China and will be purchased from abroad. Regarding the impending resumption of Sino-Japanese trade, Zhang stated: The export of Japanese goods must be aimed at obtaining U.S. dollars or pounds, and our country has appropriate controls over import and export trade. It is expected that after the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade, it will not have any impact on our country's market. Regarding the specialization of the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank: It is said that currently, various loans are classified and separately lent by the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, and are gradually moving towards specialization.

### Election Headquarters Passes Election Regulations

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Election Headquarters held its fourth committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 16th, chaired by Zhang Lisheng. The cases discussed and passed included the following: (1) General Rules for Election Offices at All Levels and Election Committees; (2) Interpretation of whether "incumbent officials" listed in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law and Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law include central officials; (3) The list of candidates for election offices in various provinces and cities has been provisionally determined and submitted to the National Government for approval. The details are as follows: One. The General Rules for Election Committees stipulate that the committee will meet once every two weeks, and special meetings will be held when necessary. The matters decided by the Election Committee include: (1) The conduct of elections, important instructions to subordinate election units, and the nomination of committee candidates; (2) Matters related to elections; (3) Matters concerning the budget of each election office. Two. The "incumbent officials" referred to in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law and Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law should be subject to the restrictions of each article if they need to run for election. However, whether these officials include central officials, and whether the heads of various provincial departments are subject to the above restrictions throughout the province due to different responsibilities, various parties have repeatedly requested an interpretation. An explanation is proposed as follows: (1) The jurisdiction stipulated in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law refers to the administrative region. The legislative intent is to prevent local officials from using their power to manipulate elections. Therefore, officials who should be restricted in the provincial government and its subordinate agencies, if they want to participate in the Legislative Yuan election within the province, should resign within the statutory period. As for the officials of various ministries and departments of the central government, their duty is to promote the central government's decrees, and all areas within the scope of sovereignty are within the scope of their promotion of decrees. There is no regional division of jurisdiction, and there is no direct relationship with local voters. It is difficult to have the possibility of using power to manipulate elections. Therefore, except for running for the Legislative Yuan in the electoral district where they are stationed, they should resign early and are not subject to the restrictions of the jurisdiction. (2) According to the above explanation, the departments and offices of each province are all governed by the province and should be equally restricted, regardless of their business.

### The Circumstances of Coking Expert Yu Zailin Being Killed by Communist Bandits: Dong Xian Guang Announces at a Reception

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 16th] According to employees who fled from the Guanshan Mine Factory to Jinzhou when the Beipiao Coal Mine was lost, Yu Zailin, Director of the Engineering Department of the mine, was tragically killed when the Guanshan Mine Factory fell. Yang, a battalion commander of the bandit army, knew in advance that Yu was an engineering personnel with no weapons, but still brutally murdered him, and the bullets pierced his head. When Yu was shot, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and he fell into the mud. Afterwards, the bandit army strictly prohibited burial, resulting in the corpse being exposed for four days and nights before colleagues in the mine secretly buried him. At that time, the rain continued, and the body was washed out and devoured by wild men, leaving only a broken head, one hand, and two legs. The bones were scattered, which was extremely tragic. After the mine area was recovered, Yu's remains were transported from the mine to Jinzhou for burial. As of now, the personnel from the mine who were taken away by the Communist bandits have been identified as Zhang Qingchun, Director of the General Affairs Department, Xie Jiugao, Director of the Business Department, Ding Yaozhong, Director of the Staff Department, and Gu Zhengduan, Engineer Lu Zhao, and more than 20 others.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Director Dong Xianguang, during a press conference on the 16th, spoke about the circumstances of the Communist bandits killing the coking expert Yu Zailin, saying: Mr. Yu Zailin, Director of the Engineering Department of the Beipiao Coal Mine, was our country's coking expert. At the beginning of the month, the Beipiao Coal Mine was captured by Communist bandits, and Mr. Yu was tragically killed for protecting the mine's equipment. The whole country mourns and hates the cruelty of the Communist bandits, destroying talents, and carrying out their vicious attempt to sabotage nation-building. After the Soviet army withdrew from the Beipiao Coal Mine in January 35, it was recovered by the national army, and the Northeast Special Envoy's Office of the Ministry of Economy sent personnel to take over and reorganize the resumption of work. In May of the same year, it was again occupied by the Communist army. The substations of the Guanshan and Sanbao No. 2 mines affiliated to the Beipiao Coal Mine were bombed, and the Nanpiao Mine Factory was also severely damaged. In October 35, the National Resources Commission took over and actively increased production, with a daily output of more than 1,000 tons. The estimated output for 36 years was 500,000 tons for the whole year. In addition to being transported and sold to Shenyang and Jinzhou, part of it was exported from Huludao to Jinan, Qingdao, and Shanghai. However, the mine is located on the border of the Shuhua River and is often disturbed by Communist bandits, with almost no peaceful days. The mine workers still stood firm and continued production as usual. In mid-June of this year, the Communist army launched a large-scale invasion of the mine. On the 28th, the Taiji Mine Factory was captured, and they continued to attack the Guanshan Mine Factory. Although the mine's guard team and employees bravely resisted, they were outnumbered and completely lost on July 1. All the employees in the mine did not withdraw, and Mr. Yu died heroically. Mr. Yu was from Shengxian, Zhejiang, and was 39 years old. He graduated from the National Beiyang Institute of Technology in the 21st year of the Republic of China. He served as a technical officer and director of the Fuel Research Office of the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute of the Ministry of Economy. In the 31st year, he was sent by the National Resources Commission to the United States to investigate the coal industry. After returning to China in the 34th year, he served as a coal industry consultant and director of the Tianfu Coal Mine Washing and Coking Plant in the Wartime Production Bureau of the Ministry of Economy. After the victory, he was sent to assist in the takeover of the Wushun Coal Mine. On New Year's Day of the 36th year, he joined the Beipiao Coal Mine as the Director of the Engineering Department. He left behind a wife and five children, and his situation after his death was quite bleak.

Questions and Answers with Reporters

[Another Telegram] Dong Xianguang answered questions at the press conference as follows:

Question: What is the current status of the Central News Agency and various party newspapers previously run by the Central Party Headquarters, and how will their future status be decided? To which department will these institutions belong, and what are their sources of funding?

Answer: Currently, all party newspapers have been organized into companies, implementing commercialization, recruiting commercial shares, and electing directors by shareholders, who are responsible for operations. The Central News Agency is also preparing for commercialization.

Question: Can you tell us the important cities that are currently under martial law?

Answer: Currently, the martial law in Shanghai has not been lifted. The war zone department has the right to declare martial law in emergency situations and then report to the central government.

Question: What is the public's response to total mobilization?

Answer: The government's determination to quell the Communist armed rebellion is quite popular with the people. This sentiment is fully reflected in the telegrams the government has received from all over the country, in the newspaper reports, and in the speeches of fair-minded public leaders and social elites. Now, generally, people have recognized that the Communists will not stop unless they fulfill their conspiracy to completely subvert the government and forcibly impose their way of life on the people of the whole country. The Communist Party's past participation in negotiations was only a conspiracy to delay time, intending to strengthen its combat power, seize more weapons and materials, and occupy more strategic locations. This has become an open secret. There is no hope of order, security, or justice in the areas occupied by the Communist army, which is known to all. No government in the world can coexist with armed traitors who rely on violence and use conspiracies and cruel means to carry out their evil policies.

Question: When will the Outline for the Implementation of Total Mobilization be announced?

Answer: The Outline for the Implementation of Total Mobilization must wait for the approval of the State Council and may be announced before the end of this week.

Question: After the implementation of total mobilization, how long will it take to eliminate the main force of the Communist army?

Answer: This is a question of a speculative nature. I believe that the length of time it takes to suppress the Communist army will depend on the degree to which mobilization is implemented.

### Liu Fengkai, Magistrate of Qingxian County, Hebei Province, and Others Tragically Killed

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 16th] Liu Fengkai, Magistrate of Qingxian County, was captured when the Communist army suddenly entered Qingxian on June 14. It is learned that he was first escorted to Dacheng and Gao Po Village, where the pseudo Qingxian County Government was located, and then escorted back to Qingxian. On July 8, the Communist army held mass rallies for three consecutive days, parading Liu through the streets. Liu angrily scolded the Communist bandits for harming the country and the people. The Communist army once strangled Liu's mouth with a rope, causing his cheeks to swell. The public was moved to tears, and many Baojia chiefs jointly requested the Communist bandits to treat Liu leniently, but they were also severely beaten by the Communist bandits. Finally, on the 11th, Liu and Yang Pizhi, Chief Secretary of the Qingxian County Party Department, and Yang Wenbin, Chief of the Military Section of the County Government, were killed by the Communist bandits. Liu and others were stabbed to death by the Communist bandits with large knives on both sides of their ribs and legs, which was extremely tragic.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th] During the tense period in Changchun, 35 Soviet overseas Chinese came from Harbin, including 18 women.

### Zhu Bangwei's Troops Achieve Success; Chairman Sends Telegram of Commendation

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] Chairman Chiang commended Zhu Bangwei, Commander of the 54th Division of the 13th Army, for participating in the Battle of Sipingwei City and firmly defending the eastern front, laying the foundation for the victory of Siping.

### Fierce Battle at Yantong Mountain, Jilin Province

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 16th] (1) The battle in the Yantong Mountain area is fierce. The Communist bandits have suffered almost complete casualties.

### Security Situation in Guangdong Province Has Improved

[Report from this Newspaper] According to a certain provincial committee member from Guangdong who came to Shanghai, the security situation in Guangdong has recently improved, but the Southern Route is still not peaceful. The number of Communist bandits on Hainan Island is difficult to determine, but there are no more than 3,000 guns. If there are sufficient military forces, it will not be difficult to suppress them in one fell swoop. Also, the existence of Hong Kong is closely related to the unrest in Guangdong Province, because Communist elements often use Hong Kong as their base, using money to buy off unemployed military officers and instigate the destruction of security in Guangdong Province. At the same time, ships from a certain country often drop weapons into Hong Kong's territorial waters, which are then salvaged by the Communist Party and smuggled into Guangdong, or transport large quantities of medicines to Hong Kong, exchange them for cash, and use them as funds for instigation. In the cultural and educational sectors, Communist Party activities are also extremely active, sometimes the funds used in one month are more than 80 times the propaganda expenses of the Guangdong Provincial Party Department.

### Draft Sino-British Air Transport Agreement Initially Approved by the Legislative Yuan: National Government Appoints Foreign Minister Wang to Negotiate with Full Authority

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The draft Sino-British Air Transport Agreement was initially reviewed and passed by the Foreign Affairs and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 16th. However, whether to convene a special meeting of the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, or to approve it first and then have the Legislative Yuan ratify it retroactively, has not yet been decided. The content of the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement is largely the same as the Sino-US Air Transport Agreement. The agreement is valid for a period of four years, during which either party may notify the other party at any time to terminate it one year later. Regarding routes, China and Britain each designate seven routes. However, considering that the Nanyang region is a gathering place for overseas Chinese, for the sake of economic development and to facilitate overseas Chinese, air transport will mainly focus on the Nanyang routes. China enjoys transport rights in the British territory in eight places: London, Prestwick (Scotland), Singapore, Api, Labuan, Kuching (all in North Borneo), Penang, and Hong Kong. Britain enjoys transport rights in four places within our territory: Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Kunming. Hong Kong has a special status, and the number of seats on British flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai shall not exceed one hundred per week. The British will provide their own equipment for the seaplane airport set up by the British in Shanghai, and our side will send personnel to manage it.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The National Government issued an order on the 17th: Appointing Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as the plenipotentiary representative for negotiating the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement and exchange of letters.

### The National Army Re-Unites Between Xu and Ji; The Communist Army of Shandong Flees in Three Routes; The War Situation Can Be Fully Clarified in the Short Term

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, July 16th] The date of complete annihilation of the Communist bandits of Shandong is imminent. The war situation in Shandong can be fully clarified in the short term. The National Army has deployed several ingenious encirclements in the Xiangzhong mountainous area and the western Shandong plains, trapping about 180,000 of the remaining main forces of the Communist Army of Shandong in the encirclements. They are currently employing tactics of simultaneous advance, combined attacks, ambushes, and comprehensive suppression to annihilate the Communist forces. Although the Communist forces have been scurrying around like wolves, blindly fleeing in disorder in an attempt to break out of the encirclement and escape the battlefield, it is now absolutely impossible.

[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou, July 16th] The National Army on the Xu-Ji section of the Jinpu Railway once again completed its reunion on the 16th, north of Dagaikou and Tai'an. The main force of Chen Yi's seven columns has fled and gathered in the outer areas of Zichuan, Boshan, and Laiwu. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, July 16th] The Communist Army's 1st and 4th Columns and the 13th Division, with more than 20,000 men, launched a fierce attack on the east, west, and north gates of Teng County on the night of the 14th. The defending troops calmly counterattacked, and fierce fighting lasted all night. By the morning of the 15th, the Communist Army had suffered 700 to 800 casualties, and four mountain guns were destroyed. Unable to withstand the attacks, they collapsed and retreated. On the 16th, the defending troops continued to pursue and annihilate the Communist forces in the suburbs in the rain, expanding their victory. The Communist forces that attacked the area north of Yanzhou have been repelled.

[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou, July 16th] The focus of the war in western Shandong has shifted to the Jinxiang and Juye area. Liu Bocheng concentrated his main force to attack Yangshanji, 25 li north of Jinxiang, for as long as four days and nights. Two divisions of the National Army are stationed in that area and are currently launching a pincer attack with the National Army reinforcements advancing south from Jining and Jiaxiang. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented since Liu Bocheng's troops crossed the river this time.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xuzhou, July 16th] The Communist bandits of the East China Field Army, fleeing in three routes within the territory of Shandong, have encountered the National Army's Gu Luzhou and Qiu Guoguang's simultaneous advance and combined attacks. They are now at the end of their rope and facing imminent annihilation. The 1st, 4th, and 5th Columns in southern Shandong were driven out of Teng and Zao areas. Part of the force fled back to the mountainous areas of Feixian, and another part took Baobinzhuang as their nest and attacked Teng County. The 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns in central Shandong were driven out of Tai'an, and their main force scattered and retreated to the Laishan stronghold. The 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 9th Columns in the Yishan area were driven out of Yishui and Nanma, and their main force has fled to the southeast of the mountainous area. The National Army is now pursuing fiercely and holding firm, engaging in fierce battles with the various Communist bandit forces, all of which are taking the absolute offensive. According to prisoners captured on the battlefield, the Communist bandits are currently facing a desperate situation with food and ammunition exhausted. Each person can barely get one meal every three days, and each gun is equipped with less than ten bullets. In the past, they could still hope for supplies from underground warehouses in the Yishan mountainous area, but now the mountains have been lost and the warehouses are empty. Furthermore, their attempt to seek food locally by fleeing has been thwarted by the barren land and impoverished people, as well as the fierce pursuit by the National Army, resulting in nothing but death. The people have no fighting spirit, and morale is extremely low.

### Soviet Workers Mining in Xinjiang; Many Residents of Yili are of Soviet Nationality; Soviet Consul Refuses to Disclose the Number of People with Soviet Nationality

[United Press Dispatch from Dihua, July 11th] (Delayed) A certain important government official declared to the United Press reporter today that the Soviet Union is mining oil in the border areas of Xinjiang. Soviet miners are also accelerating the mining of tungsten in areas such as Yili, Altay, and Gulja. The largest oil-producing area is the small town of Usu, east of Dihua. These oil wells were opened during the reign of Sheng Shicai, a pro-Soviet warlord. In 1942, Mr. Sheng changed his policy and expelled the Soviet miners, but they had already surveyed the oil wells, dismantled them, and filled them in beforehand, numbering about fifteen to twenty. The Yili rebels, in opposition to the central government, allowed the Soviets to re-enter the oil fields and freely mine them. The extent of political activity among the people of Yili can be seen in the number of people who have obtained Soviet nationality. According to precise estimates, an average of seven out of ten applicants are approved. According to the Soviet authorities, the applicants were originally Soviet people. This time, they are simply restoring their nationality. When the reporter inquired with Soviet Consul General Savelyev about the report on the number of applicants for naturalization, he retorted angrily, "What is the reason for asking? How dare you ask a diplomatic representative of another country for this kind of report? If you want to check the number of Soviet expatriates, please ask the police station." Mr. Savelyev clearly did not want to answer questions of a "political" nature, and the interview ended abruptly.

Tense Situation in Dihua, Frequent Terrorist Activities

[United Press Dispatch from Dihua, July 9th] (Delayed) For months, terrorists from both sides vying for power in Xinjiang have been inciting violence and attacking sympathizers of the opposing side in the streets. The newspapers are filled with news of Han Chinese, Kazakhs, and Uyghurs being ambushed and subjected to cruel torture in broad daylight on the main thoroughfares of Dihua. These people are also forced to confess to malicious political activities. Such incidents have occurred at least ten times in recent weeks, often in the southern suburbs. A government official told the United Press reporter today that the instigators are radical elements from the Yili rebel youth league. Earlier this week, the Kazakh driver of the British Consulate was also beaten and wounded in the head. He staggered into the police station to report the incident. The consul was out at the time, so the police officer notified the neighboring American Consul Paxton to take him away. The conflict arose from the Chinese central government's appointment of Masud Sabri as the chairman of Xinjiang. Mr. Masud Sabri is a doctor who studied in Turkey and often resides abroad. The opposition believes that he cannot represent the people of Xinjiang. In addition to terrorist acts, there is also a widespread network of political espionage, eavesdropping on telephones and monitoring the actions of government military and political officials and foreign consuls.

A Heated Debate at a Banquet Hosted by Zhang Zhizhong for the Soviet Envoy

[United Press Dispatch from Dihua, July 7th] Regarding the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang, Soviet Consul General Savelyev told the United Press reporter today, "The whole incident is another example of American newspapers having headlines but no facts. If you want to know the situation, please ask the Chinese government." When Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov returned home to report on his work, he passed through here and attended a banquet hosted by Zhang Zhizhong, the former chairman of Xinjiang Province, on the same night. Achimjan, the leader of the Yili rebellion, was also present. After several rounds of drinks, Achimjan insisted on speaking, expressing his impatience with the Xinjiang Provincial Assembly's inability to exercise its functions (Achimjan was originally a school guard who had studied in Moscow). Mr. Zhang immediately refuted him, blaming the other party. Achimjan then replied fiercely in Russian, strongly stating that Yili had not received a benevolent guarantee from the Chinese government. Mr. Zhang then stood up in anger and criticized the Yili rebels for failing to fulfill the agreement to allow the National Army to enter the north. The Yili area is rich in resources such as oil, gold, and tungsten, which are rumored to be transported to the Soviet Union in a steady stream. The debate lasted for a long time, but gradually subsided due to a word from the Soviet Consul General. He said, "The war is over, please try to negotiate peace." Petrov nodded in agreement but did not express his opinion.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Dihua, July 15th] Soviet Consul General in Dihua, Savelyev, left Dihua this morning to return to his country to report on his work.

Therefore, it was decided to delete them.

### The United States Invites Member Countries of the Far Eastern Commission to Preliminary Discussions on the Japanese Peace Treaty; Meeting Scheduled for August 19th in Washington, D.C.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] A certain diplomatic authority stated: The United States originally intended to begin negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty only after the signing of the peace treaty with Germany and Austria. However, due to the numerous problems in the European situation and no hope for reconciliation in the foreseeable future, there is now a possibility of starting negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty ahead of schedule. Our country, as a major Far Eastern country with the most interaction with Japan, the longest war, and the deepest understanding, urgently needs officials with outstanding qualities to propose a plan to strive for a thorough peace in the Far East through this peace treaty. The relevant authorities will intensify their work on this matter.

[United Press Dispatch from Washington, July 16th] The State Department Press Office announced today that the United States has invited member countries of the Far Eastern Commission to convene an eleven-nation conference in Washington, D.C., on August 19th to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. This conference is of a "preliminary" nature and will focus on the "technical" aspects of drafting the treaty. Completing the draft will undoubtedly take months.

[Associated Press Dispatch from Washington, July 16th] The United States proposed on the 16th that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should convene a preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace conference in San Francisco or Washington on August 19th. The proposal has been submitted to the foreign ministers of various countries, including Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Before taking preliminary measures to resolve the Japanese peace treaty, a response from Moscow must first be obtained. MacArthur has previously believed that the Japanese peace treaty should be signed within a year to eighteen months. As for negotiations on the German treaty, they seem to be indefinitely postponed. American officials are extremely hopeful of concluding a treaty with Japan ahead of schedule.

The American proposal advocates holding a preliminary meeting of experts first, and then a formal meeting of full representatives from each country. The United States suggested San Francisco as the preferred venue, and Washington as the second choice if other countries object.

The countries participating in the meeting should include those that participated in the Far Eastern Commission under the agreement reached by the three great powers at the Moscow Conference in December 1945. However, these countries are not participating in the capacity of representatives of the Far Eastern Commission. These countries are China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union (these four countries have veto power in the Far Eastern Commission), as well as Australia, New Zealand, India, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and France. Secretary of State Marshall intends to have his subordinates handle the negotiations during the preparatory meeting, as Mr. Marshall will be attending the Pan-American Conference in the capital of Brazil and will not be able to participate in the meeting on the scheduled date. This time also conflicts with the Imperial Conference initiated by Australia, which is scheduled to be held in Canberra on August 22nd. The purpose of the conference is to establish a unified front among the British dominions for the Japanese peace treaty negotiations.

American officials are extremely concerned about Australia's efforts, fearing that the British dominions will form a group with a common policy that can veto any proposed plan with a two-thirds majority. However, it is expected that there will not be many difficulties with the Japanese peace treaty. The issue of Japan's borders has already been stipulated by the Potsdam Declaration, limited to the four islands of its mainland. It is expected that no one will advocate amending the Yalta Agreement, which allows the Soviet Union to annex the Kuril Islands and the southern half of Sakhalin Island. As for the issue of reparations, which is hindering the agreement on the German issue, it is not expected to cause any major difficulties in the Japanese issue. According to MacArthur's subordinates, the amount of reparations that China, the Soviet Union, and other countries have already obtained is approximately 40 billion US dollars, including the Japanese assets that the Soviet Union removed from Northeast China and Korea.

### Supervisory Committee Members Wan Can and Others Submit Emergency Proposal: Our Country Should Stop Considering Opening Trade with Japan and Terminate Sending Business Delegations to Japan

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] Supervisory Committee members Wan Can, Yu Shude, She Guangxun, Li Shijun, Wang Guanwu, and others submitted an emergency proposal on the 16th, requesting the government to stop considering opening trade with Japan under the current circumstances and to terminate sending business delegations to Japan. This emergency proposal has been reviewed by the President of the Legislative Yuan and has been formally submitted. It is also heard that the President of the Executive Yuan intends to suggest to the State Council that it conduct a comprehensive review of Sino-Japanese economic relations and establish a special agency to handle the matter. It is reported that the Supervisory Committee members Wan Can and others expressed much dissatisfaction in their proposal with the agencies responsible for handling trade with Japan, believing that they only paid attention to technical issues and failed to make proper plans for the overall policy. Wan Can and others pointed out that the Japanese government's proposed Sino-Japanese trade plan for 1947 stipulated that Japan would export 99.18 million US dollars worth of goods to China, while China would only export 47.68 million US dollars to Japan. It is extremely unreasonable that China would have a trade deficit of over 50 million US dollars. Secondly, the goods that Japan will export to China are mostly impractical items such as bicycles, watches, and cameras, while the goods that China will export are coal and other materials that are also extremely scarce in our own country. This should be difficult for our country to accept. The proposal also pointed out that Japan is a country that invaded China, and its future intentions are worth paying attention to. Therefore, before Japanese militarism is completely eradicated, the peace treaty with Japan is signed, Japan fulfills its international obligations, peace in the Far East and the world is ensured, and our internal situation is fully stabilized, it is recommended to stop considering opening trade with Japan and to terminate sending business delegations to Japan.

[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] With the resumption of private trade with Japan on August 15th, Chinese economic experts are deeply concerned that Japan will once again implement "economic aggression." Currently, there are almost no goods that China can export to Japan. On the other hand, since the end of the war, Japan's industry has not suffered any losses and is capable of dumping various manufactured goods on China. Moreover, the salt that China sends to Japan is sufficient to boost its chemical industry, while this industry is at a standstill in China. Furthermore, MacArthur's regulations require Japan's foreign trade to be calculated in US dollars, which is tantamount to a "one-way street."

### Lottery to Allocate Second Batch of Japanese Reparations Ships to Be Held Today

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, July 16th] The lottery for the second batch of 32 of the 93 Japanese reparations ships is scheduled for tomorrow morning, to be allocated to the four countries: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.

### Epiphyllum Blooming in Suzhou; Iron Tree Budding and Flowering

Recently, three of them suddenly bloomed white flowers from the edges of the leaves, with a light fragrance, which faded after two hours. Many people came to watch for a time. Furthermore, an iron tree in the garden also budded and flowered yesterday, which is truly auspicious.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Spokesperson Discusses Opening Private Trade with Japan; Clarifies Key Points Regarding Application Procedures, Etc.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently made a statement on the opening of private trade with Japan, stating that domestic industrial and commercial figures have attached great importance to the news of the opening of private trade with Japan, and it is predicted that after the method of selecting and dispatching business representatives is determined in the future, applications to go will be very enthusiastic. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is intensifying preparations for this matter with relevant agencies and has convened meetings to conduct preliminary discussions on issues such as the allocation of import and export trade quotas, the application qualifications and procedures for representatives to Japan, and the review procedures for representative qualifications. It will be officially announced after legalization. However, in principle, there are some points that need to be explained to promote the attention of all parties: (1) This opening of private trade with Japan is not a completely free trade nature. There are still considerable restrictions on the types of imports and exports, the factories, mines, companies, and firms applying to trade with Japan, and the selection of their representatives. The Allied Headquarters is also paying close attention to the above points, and our government must handle it carefully. (2) This dispatch of business representatives to Japan is of a trial nature. Although the quota is tentatively set at 64 people, it is still subject to change at any time depending on the actual trade situation in the future. Therefore, whether the future development of Sino-Japanese trade can truly reach the ideal level still depends on the efforts of the personnel going to Japan this time to make good use of the opportunity and strive for it. (3) The quota of 64 business representatives that our country sends to Japan means that no more than 64 people should exceed this number at the same time. The Allied Headquarters stipulates that the stay period for each person going to Japan is very short, and the task must be completed quickly. After this batch of personnel returns one after another, others can still be sent in rotation to fill the vacancies. Therefore, anyone applying to trade with Japan can have the hope of being invited as long as his business operations, qualifications, and experience meet the conditions for dispatch.

### MacArthur Subsidizes Japanese Export Policy; American Textile Industry Also Expresses Dissatisfaction

[Central News Agency Dispatch from New York, July 15th] Several international traders told a Central News Agency reporter today that they did not attack MacArthur's policy of subsidizing Japanese exports from August 15th. They all believe that the subsidy is indirect rather than direct. This subsidy will mainly be applied to American cotton exports to Japan. It is said that MacArthur's policy aims to have the American government subsidize American cotton exporters to ensure that they obtain fair prices, while also ensuring that Japanese textile merchants obtain cotton supplies. They all believe that from China's standpoint, this subsidy policy may cause the Japanese textile industry to defeat the Chinese textile industry. However, in the United States, this matter does not necessarily affect any particular country, because the Allied Headquarters' policy is to promote multilateral commerce between Japan and various countries (especially Far Eastern countries). However, some people believe that the United States is taking a subsidy policy to restore Japan's international trade. There are some areas that have been neglected, and at the same time, people in the American textile industry have also expressed dissatisfaction with the subsidy policy. The Japanese textile industry may hit the American textile industry. Behind the scenes of the American government's recovery of private trade in Japan is the goal of reducing its occupation costs. It is generally believed that Japanese industry must be restored to the following extent: that is, the proceeds from its exports must be sufficient to pay for all its imports, and this move may limit the outflow of American money. It is said that the United States has spent 3 billion US dollars in Japan since January last year. At the same time, American businessmen believe that the impact on American commerce in the early stages of restoring trade with Japan is minimal, and the first step in restoring Japanese trade is to investigate the situation and determine what kind of trade can be done.

### Strengthening Anti-Smuggling in the Kowloon Area; Plans and Budget Prepared

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] The government recently decided to strengthen anti-smuggling work in the Kowloon area of ​​South China. The plan and budget have been approved by the Political Affairs Conference on the 15th. The main points are: The smuggling of imports and exports in South China is too rampant. In December of last year, Bei Zuyi, former General Manager of the Central Bank, went to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Hong Kong government. An agreement on cooperative anti-smuggling measures was jointly formulated and approved by Song Meiling, the former president of the Executive Yuan. The Central Bank allocated 3 million Hong Kong dollars to the Kowloon Customs to handle the matter. However, the Hong Kong government has not yet signed the agreement, so the funds cannot be allocated as planned. Regarding financial and anti-smuggling issues, our government is actively consulting with the Hong Kong government. However, regardless of whether an agreement can be reached, it is necessary to strengthen the anti-smuggling work of the Kowloon Customs. The Customs Service has prepared a plan and budget: (1) Land anti-smuggling: re-repair and add branch checkpoints, requiring a total of 461,000 Hong Kong dollars. (2) Sea Patrol: Add sea branch checkpoints and lighters, requiring a total of 2,255,000 Hong Kong dollars. (3) Set up a radio station, requiring 241,000 Hong Kong dollars (4) Travel expenses for customs police to Kowloon for service, approximately 93,000 Hong Kong dollars. The total of the above four items is 3 million Hong Kong dollars.

### Yellow River Embankment Restoration Talks Yield No Results; Ye Nan Reports on the Process; Cleveland Orders UN Personnel to Withdraw

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] Major General Ye Nan of the Ministry of National Defense reported on the progress of the mixed committee organized to benefit the Yellow River repair and defense, and to accept the UN proposal at the press conference of the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan at 5 pm on the 16th. Ye said: The Communist representatives withdrew from the meeting on the pretext of not having received this suggestion, so if the Yellow River dike breaks in the future, the Communist side should be responsible. Ye first reported the composition process of the mixed committee and then said that when the canal representative government arrived in Kaifeng on June 30, they received the news that Liu Bocheng's troops had crossed the river. When the meeting was held in Dongming on July 1, the staff of the Ministry of Water Resources reported on the progress of the repair and defense work, saying that the workers had been driven away by the Communist side 23 times. If the truce problem could not be resolved, the embankment repair could not be carried out in fact. Representatives and government representatives explained the importance of embankment repair. Liu's department crossing the river was to hinder the embankment repair and destroy the embankment repair, but the Communist representatives withdrew from the meeting on the pretext that they had not received the UN proposal, and the negotiations were interrupted. After Mr. Hua returned to Beijing, he listened to the Communist broadcast, saying that Liu's troops crossed the river to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the Communist Army, but if the Yellow River dike breaches and floods, the lives of 3 to 4 million people will be threatened. Mr. Ye also said that the flood is approaching, and flooding may occur at any time. The current central work of the Ministry of Water Resources has shifted from embankment repair to rescuing dangerous projects.

[News from this newspaper] Cleveland of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration office in China, after receiving a memorandum from Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff of our Ministry of National Defense (original text in yesterday's newspaper), formally ordered UN personnel engaged in embankment restoration work in the Communist-held area along the Yellow River yesterday to immediately evacuate to Kaifeng and not to provoke any unnecessary danger.

It is reported that there are not many UN personnel working in the area, and a full list is currently being checked. At the same time, the Chinese government authorities were also asked to cancel the reasons for guaranteeing the safety of embankment restoration staff.

### National Trade Union Issues Solemn Declaration Opposing Absurd Resolution of World Federation of Trade Unions: Hong Kong Trade Union Absolutely Cannot Represent Chinese Trade Unions

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 16th] The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), at its general assembly held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in June of this year, passed a resolution recognizing and supporting the Hong Kong Trade Union as the official representative of Chinese trade unions.

They have unanimously issued a solemn declaration denying the Hong Kong Trade Union as the official representative of Chinese trade unions. The above declaration was issued by the trade unions of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, and others, as well as the Chinese Seamen's Union, the National Postal Workers' Union, and the Chinese Labor Association. Its main points are as follows: (1) Hong Kong is currently a region where China's administrative power cannot be exercised.

(2) Zhu Xuefan, who was removed from his position as Chairman of the Chinese Labor Association due to reorganization and re-election, and who is also suspected of embezzling funds donated by the United States for aid to China, was reported by the Chongqing General Labor Union.

Chinese workers sincerely hope to unite with workers from all countries who love freedom and democracy, recognize their goals, and work together.

### A Beautiful Corpse Outside Zhenjiang: Seven Orifices Show Bruising, Suggesting Strangulation; Body Has Been Stored for Three Days Without Identification

[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 16th] At 7 AM on the 13th, a female corpse, approximately 20 years old, with a perm, wearing a red and black polka-dot voile short-sleeved cheongsam, and purple rubber-soled strap shoes, was discovered near the shooting range on the left side of the Zhenjiang Southern Suburb Provincial Highway. Beside the body was a small canvas bag containing an old blue striped tie, a female garter belt, a National Theater ticket dated the 12th, half a Sullivan bread, four orange candies, and 11,700 Legal Tender. Li Zhengguang, the leader of the Provincial Council Guard, telegraphed the police station and reported to the District Court. After inspection and collection at 4 PM that afternoon, no relatives have claimed the body for three days. According to the police officer handling the case, the corpse's face was purplish-blue and swollen, with bruising in all seven orifices. The eyes were swollen and slightly drooping, the pupils were dilated and streaked with blood, the tongue was pressed against the teeth, and the front of the neck was purplish-blue and swollen. The skin was pale with slight swelling, except for the purple spots on the hands. The abdomen was slightly distended. According to the inspectors, she was not a virgin, and there was a small amount of purple stool outside the anus, suggesting death by strangulation. Based on the theater ticket found on the body, the time of death was after 9 PM. However, it is difficult to determine whether the killer was one person or several because several local farmers and vendors had passed by the body, leaving mixed footprints. Since no relatives have claimed the body after three days, it is suspected that she was from out of town and was premeditatedly murdered. After the incident, Provincial Police Chief [something is illegible] Ren paid close attention and personally ordered Criminal Police Captain Xia Xiangmin to intensify the investigation. This morning, Shao Guoguo, Chief of the Judicial Section of the Bureau, notified Liang Guanjun, Chief of the First Branch, to prepare another coffin for a shallow burial so that relatives could claim the body. The body was initially wrapped in reed mats when it was collected on the 13th, which would easily lead to decomposition. However, due to rain all day today, the re-burial could not be carried out and is planned for tomorrow morning. At that time, the relevant authorities also plan to take photos for investigation.

### Editorial: The Close of the European Economic Conference

As US Secretary of State General Marshall renewed his call for aid to Europe at the annual meeting of American governors in Salt Lake City, the European Economic Cooperation Conference, convened on the basis of the "Marshall Plan," was simultaneously completing the first phase of the European Recovery Program. The European Economic Cooperation Conference, convened due to the unsuccessful conclusion of the Big Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, has now come to a satisfactory close. Although this Paris Conference is called the European Economic Cooperation Conference, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the "Marshall Plan" has influenced the attitudes of some Eastern European countries. In essence, it only included Western European countries, and even Franco's Spain was not included. Turkey and Greece, although located in Eastern Europe, also participated in this historic meeting. According to news reports, the achievement of the Paris Conference was the decision to establish a reconstruction design agency, which will meet immediately in Paris and complete the entire report by September 1 to submit to the United States. A cooperation committee will also be established within this agency, with the full participation of sixteen countries. Even countries that currently resist the Marshall Plan can join in the future. In addition, this agency will establish an executive committee and four technical committees to handle food, electricity, steel, and transportation issues separately. From this, we can see how closely European countries, except for the Soviet Union and those aligned with it, are cooperating to propose their recovery plans in order to obtain US assistance. In view of the recent trends in the international situation, the US government and public, having heard calls from responsible leaders such as President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to step up aid to traditional allies, will surely unite to support them. After Congress reopens in the autumn, the "Marshall Plan" will undoubtedly see more concrete developments.

European countries suffered enormous losses after the war, and US assistance should be welcomed. However, the Soviet Union believes that US assistance has the potential for political interference and refuses to accept it. Countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary, in general, do the people, even the governments, not also want to participate in the Marshall Plan in order to achieve their own economic recovery? Only because the Soviet Union's attitude is so firm, they have no choice but to abandon their original intentions and refuse to participate in the European Economic Cooperation Conference held in Paris. The attitude of the Czech government, which initially expressed willingness to participate and then refused, is particularly striking to the world. The Marshall Plan is indeed an economic plan that uses the economic power of the United States to assist in the recovery of Europe. After rejecting this Marshall Plan, there must be a plan to replace it, so that these countries are not too disappointed. This is why we hear about the so-called "Molotov Plan," which is proposed to counter the Marshall Plan.

According to news from London, the Soviet Union has proposed and is implementing the "Molotov Plan" to counter the Marshall Plan and assist the economic recovery of Eastern European countries. It is said that nine Eastern European countries will join this plan: the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Yugoslavia, and Albania. German regions occupied by the Soviet Union may also join the plan. The core of this plan is to reject US dollar aid in order to avoid accepting any political conditions. Countries joining the Molotov Plan will implement economic unification, share resources, engage in planned production under a common plan, and establish a customs union. To implement this plan, the Soviet Union has signed various economic agreements with Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. According to this, the Soviet Union is pursuing its economic policy in Eastern European countries.

We hope that this Molotov Plan can truly help the economic recovery of Eastern European countries. However, considering the so-called unification, resource sharing, and planned production, the results may not be as ideal as the general public hopes. The "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" still leaves fresh wounds on the world, especially on the people of the Far East. After the war, the general public hopes to avoid a repetition of the "encirclement" situation. However, the current international situation has undoubtedly entered a situation of "encirclement" again. Although this confrontation between the Marshall Plan and the Molotov Plan is perhaps unavoidable given the current international situation, we always hope that if there is a confrontational situation, the conflict can be minimized or even eliminated. Only by eliminating conflict can the hope for lasting international peace be ensured.

The current moment is indeed a critical juncture in human history. Current signs have caused the "one world" concept that emerged during World War II to become illusory. "One world" will belong to two camps, two "encirclements." The proposal of the so-called Molotov Plan in addition to the Marshall Plan further bankrupts the concept of "one world." The convening and closing of the Paris European Economic Cooperation Conference can be said to have ended an era and unfolded a new chapter in the world's post-war history. The road ahead is not necessarily smooth. We sincerely hope that the political leaders of the great powers can save humanity from future catastrophes and cooperate sincerely to ensure lasting world peace.

### U.S. Military Delegation Decides to Assist Greece in Suppressing Rebellion; Secretary of State Marshall Expresses Directly

Greek Government Forces Launch Offensive, Guerrillas Encircled

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 16th (Radio): Secretary of State Marshall stated today that the U.S. military delegation to Greece will instruct Greek forces on how to fight against the guerrillas. Marshall said the main objective of the U.S. military delegation is to determine what kind of equipment the government forces need to deal with the guerrillas. As for whether the U.S. military representatives will go to northwestern Greece, Marshall did not comment. When a reporter asked if the U.S. representatives would instruct the Greek government forces to fight the guerrillas, Marshall replied that he believed such instructions were very possible.

[United Press, London, 16th (Dispatch)] TASS, from the capital of Yugoslavia: Greek guerrilla leader Markos accused the British and Americans of interfering in the Greek civil war. He also, "in his capacity as Senior Commander of the Greek Democratic Army," condemned the British and American authorities for supporting the Greek fascist elements and instigating a large-scale civil war. According to reports from the Albanian News Agency carried in local newspapers, the British and Americans are aiding the Greek government, and it is alleged that U.S. military officers are participating in Greek military planning conferences, and that the British Air Force is participating in airstrikes against the guerrillas.

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 16th (Radio): According to sources close to the Greek General Staff, the situation on the Greek front has taken a sharp turn for the worse today. At dawn, the 23rd Brigade of the Greek government's fresh forces joined the battle, launching a fierce attack on 2,000 guerrillas who had suddenly appeared near Albania. The 23rd Brigade is well-equipped and has bomber support. It is said that with the help of aircraft, the 23rd Brigade has blocked the guerrillas trying to break through, nine miles from Albania.

[United Press, Athens, 16th (Dispatch)] A spokesman for the Greek General Staff stated on the 16th: "Forty-five thousand Greek troops have encircled the invading guerrillas, most of whom are trapped in the Karpathian region, attempting to escape back to Albania. Details are still awaited from the front lines." Meanwhile, according to a TASS dispatch from Jena on the 16th: the official Albanian News Agency denies that any international legions have been sent from Albania to fight in Greece.

[Reuters, Athens, 15th (Dispatch)] Greek military sources say that large numbers of guerrillas and supplies are concentrated in three locations in Albania near the Greek border, and in three locations within Yugoslavia near the Greek border. The exact locations of these concentrations have not been revealed. At the same time, arrests of conspirators continue throughout Greece. It is rumored here today that the government will announce a list of suspected persons, but this has not yet been confirmed.

[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] The British Foreign Office announced on the 15th that, according to British investigations, there is no evidence to date to confirm the participation of international brigades in the so-called Greek border incidents.

[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] Rumors that the British Foreign Office had stated that if international legions participated in the Greek war, Britain would protest to the United Nations have been denied by a Foreign Office spokesperson. He stated briefly: "We have made no such statement, nor is it necessary for us to state our position."

### Security Council to Convene Special Sessions Today and Tomorrow to Discuss Balkan Situation; U.S. Representative Johnson's Request Finally Approved

[United Press, Lake Success, 15th (Dispatch)] The United Nations Security Council has rejected a U.S. proposal to convene an emergency meeting on the 16th to discuss the Greek situation. The Soviet Union initially opposed it, believing there was no need to convene an emergency meeting. France also issued a warning, stating that the United Nations should not act hastily regarding the increasingly tense situation in Greece. The U.S. proposal to convene an emergency meeting on the 16th received only six votes in favor, including the U.S. itself, but seven votes are required to pass a procedural resolution in the Security Council. China, Poland, and Colombia all supported France and the Soviet Union and opposed the U.S. proposal. U.S. Representative Johnson then warned that the situation brewing in Greece over the past 48 hours could erupt at any moment. The Security Council finally passed the U.S. request, scheduling two special meetings for the 17th and another special meeting for the 18th.

### British Fleet Commander Jago to Visit Greek Territorial Waters

[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] The British Admiralty has announced that the British cruiser HMS "Liverpool" will visit Athens on the 18th, and three warships from the Mediterranean Fleet, including the aircraft carrier HMS "Victorious," will also enter Greek territorial waters during their summer cruise next week. An Admiralty spokesman insisted that this trip has no political purpose and was planned long before the current crisis in Greece.

[United Press, Washington, 15th (Dispatch)] Rumors from Athens that the U.S. fleet might sail to Greek ports under the current circumstances have been denied by the U.S. Navy Department, which said that no ships are sailing to Greece.

### Soviet Union Still Dissents on International Police Force Issue

[United Press, Lake Success, 15th (Dispatch)] The Security Council met today to discuss the issue of an international security police force. The U.S. representative believes that the Soviet Union seems unwilling and unable to contribute its share. Representatives immediately proposed consulting the Soviet Union on the size and organization of the security police force. The Soviet Union consistently dissented, resulting in no agreement being reached. Earlier, the British representative proposed that the five-power military staff committee should agree on an estimate of the strength of this force by August 5, which was supported by most. The Australian and French proposals were more complex, hoping that the Soviet Union would express its views. At this point, Soviet Representative Molotov insisted that he did not intend to discuss the size of this force before the allocation of the five powers' contributions between East and West was resolved.

### British Cabinet to be Reorganized

[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] It is rumored in British political circles today that there may be another reorganization of the Attlee Cabinet, and the trend is either to form a coalition government or to hold a general election. It can now be considered certain that the India Office will be abolished, and the current Secretary of State for India, Lord Listowel, will be transferred to another position. Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council Herbert Morrison will resign. Foreign Secretary Bevin is in poor health and is believed to be resigning after the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in November. Talk of a general election revived after Morrison frankly announced that the British economic crisis would materialize in the autumn. However, the government has not publicly acknowledged the matter of a general election or the formation of a coalition government.

### Commemorating the Atomic Bomb, U.S. Scientists Speak Earnestly

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th (Dispatch)] On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was successfully tested at Alamogordo, New Mexico, thus opening a new page in human history.

The Federation of American Scientists, led by Einstein and others, issued a statement to the press, stating briefly: "As long as the world cannot avoid the threat of the atomic bomb, the safety of mankind will be illusory. Only by organizing a world government that transcends all nations can peace be achieved and maintained. We should use all the resources of the United Nations to move towards world unity."

### European Economic Conference Concludes Successfully, Each Committee Begins Work

Germany Will Also Participate in European Reconstruction Work in the Future

[United Press, Paris, 16th (Dispatch)] The Committee on European Economic Cooperation, which is drafting a plan for European economic recovery, held its first meeting at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 16th.

[United Press, Paris, 15th (Dispatch)] Sixteen European countries formed a group tonight, rapidly drafting a blueprint for a joint recovery plan within a six-week deadline, in order to avoid the threat of economic collapse that will be encountered this winter with the help of the United States. The European Economic Conference, which discussed European economic cooperation issues, ended tonight after four days. Important representatives from each country will leave here tomorrow to return home, but a new institution has been established in Paris, composed of representatives from sixteen countries, responsible for drafting the most ambitious international plan in history, to be completed by September 1 for submission to the United States for study.

The group composed of representatives from sixteen countries has now been named the "Committee on European Economic Cooperation," which includes an Executive Committee chaired by the United Kingdom, composed of representatives from France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway, and four technical subcommittees on food and agriculture, fuel and power, steel and transportation. Each committee will be formally established tomorrow, and its main tasks are as follows: (1) To study the production development of major industrial countries in Europe, so as to increase the strength of each country and promote trade relations between European countries. (2) To study the needs of various important items, so as to request assistance from foreign countries, especially the Western Hemisphere. This report will in fact be the blueprint for a four-year recovery plan. The Paris Economic Conference, at the insistence of small countries, will remain open, awaiting the Soviet Union and its eight affiliated countries to join.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 15th (Dispatch)] The German News Agency of the U.S. military zone stated: The Deputy Director of the U.S. military government in Germany, Brigadier General Keating, said that a delegation from western Germany might participate in the discussions on the Marshall Plan held in Paris at a later date. The U.S. military government did not send a delegation from the U.S. military zone to participate, because the initial negotiations did not involve U.S. officials, and the attendance of a delegation from the U.S. military zone would cause misunderstanding.

### Investigating Resources, Clues Are Complicated

[Reuters, Paris, 16th (Dispatch)] The first phase of the European Economic Cooperation Conference has been successful, but the participating representatives and observers all feel that this four-day conference only represents the beginning of the task. The real work will begin today and will continue for several weeks before it can be completed. Observers almost all believe that in the technical committees, the representatives will not only face the economic realities of the survey, but also the political issues that are intertwined with the economic issues. The German question is a clear example. The subcommittees on fuel and steel will inevitably have to consider the role of the Ruhr industrial area in any European recovery plan, which will inevitably involve how the Paris Conference will affect the basic issues of the Four Power Committee established by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The task of this Four Power Committee is to study the economic problems related to the unification of the German economy. Furthermore, the negotiations that Britain and the United States are about to begin in Washington on the Ruhr industry and the industrial standards of the British and American zones in Germany will also have a direct impact on the work of the Sixteen Nation Cooperation Committee. The task of the Food Subcommittee is also not as simple as imagined, because the food issue will inevitably involve the possibility of purchasing from the U.S. dollar zone and supplementing it by purchasing from outside the dollar zone.

### Bevin Returns to London

### Soviet Union Unilaterally Uses Veto, Seoul Conference Reaches Impasse; Brown Accuses Soviet Side of Violating Agreement

[Reuters, Seoul, 15th (Dispatch)] U.S. Director of Civilian Affairs in Korea, Major General Brown, stated today that the first question in the U.S.-Soviet joint discussion on establishing a temporary Korean government is "whether one country can unilaterally decide to exercise a veto and refuse any party or organization it opposes to present its views." The Soviet delegation wants to use this veto power today. The U.S. delegation has repeatedly suggested systematically reviewing the list of Korean parties and organizations applying to present their views and considering the objections raised by the two delegations, but the Soviet Union has repeatedly refused. Although the Soviet delegation did not make specific accusations against any Korean party, it arbitrarily accused the Korean parties of lacking trust. The U.S. delegation firmly insisted on fully implementing the Marshall-Molotov Agreement established at the beginning of this year, which stipulates that all Korean democratic parties and organizations should be guaranteed the right to present their views to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 16th (Dispatch)] Major General Brown released a statement today on the proceedings of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission meeting, stating: "The U.S. and the Soviet Union have very different opinions on the identification of Korean parties and social organizations participating in the Joint Commission. The Soviet side believes that the number of parties and organizations should be reduced to a minimum, and parties and organizations should be distinguished. Organizations with central structures should have their local branches' right to participate canceled. At the same time, groups that oppose trusteeship and groups that are incompatible with the Moscow Agreement are also refused to participate in the meeting. The U.S. side argues that all parties and organizations that have signed in Statements No. 5 and No. 11 can be initially included in the groups that can attend the meeting, that they can be dismissed if they do not change their attitude after the meeting has formally opened, and that wide participation of parties and organizations in the Joint Commission is in complete accord with the spirit of the Moscow Agreement."

### U.S. Import and Export Controls Extended to February Next Year

[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th (Special Dispatch)] President Truman today signed a new bill stipulating that import and export controls on scarce goods, including kerosene, tin, fats, and oils, should be extended to February next year. This decree empowers the government to designate priority for goods, and the State Department can promote U.S. foreign policy by issuing visas for the export of goods. Export controls will be applied to 400 types of goods, and import controls on fats, oils, fertilizer materials, and rice will continue. President Truman believes that U.S. control over foreign trade should continue to be supervised after it is lifted on March 1, 1948, but his goal is to eliminate interference with world commerce.

### British Pound Foreign Exchange Restored as International Currency

[Reuters, Washington, 15th (Dispatch)] U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder announced that the U.S. government has agreed that the United Kingdom should, by September 15, allow China, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Paraguay, Portugal, Romania, Siam, Turkey, Argentina, and Yugoslavia to fully convert all British pound foreign exchange earned from trade with the pound sterling area into foreign exchange of other currencies. The Anglo-American Financial Agreement originally stipulated that the United Kingdom should complete this procedure by July 15. The British government requested an extension because it could not complete the administrative procedures for the aforementioned 14 countries as scheduled. Snyder said that apart from the aforementioned 14 countries, the British government has fully fulfilled its obligations under the Financial Agreement and, since yesterday, has allowed British pound foreign exchange earned from trade with third countries or obtained by other means to be used freely to pay for trade in any currency area.

### Indian Independence Bill Progresses Smoothly, Passed on Third Reading in British House of Commons; British Prime Minister Hopes Partition Can Evolve into a Federal System

[Reuters, London, 15th (Dispatch)] The House of Commons held the third reading debate on the Indian Independence Bill today, lasting three hours and forty-five minutes, and did not require a vote. Prime Minister Attlee, in closing the debate, said that the Indians could trust the full sympathy and assistance of the United Kingdom without the danger of dependence. He also expressed the hope that the partition of India could evolve into a federal system, so that the two parts of India could maintain unity and exercise full power. The Prime Minister expressed his gratitude to the House of Commons for the rapid passage of the bill, saying: "The British government sincerely hopes that the new government of India can carry out its mission."

The Earl of Winterton, representing the Conservative Party, concluded the debate by calling for friendship between Britain and India. At the beginning of the debate, Minister of Trade Cripps declared that Britain did not believe that it had completed its task by passing this Independence Bill. Since Pakistan and India are still part of the British Commonwealth, Britain still has a responsibility to promote their progress and prosperity. Butler of the opposition party expressed concern about the future status of the Indian princely states, hoping that the British government would handle any demands for independence from the princely states with sympathy and understanding.

Indian Provincial Constitutions Will Model Themselves on the United States

At the same time, according to House Speaker Martin, a special investigating committee will soon be established to review the needs of the sixteen European countries, with the assistance of three committees established by the President.

### Inside Story of the Japanese Communist Party

Special Translation by Our Editorial Department

The Japanese Communist Party frequently consults with "Mitsubishi No. 21." "Mitsubishi No. 21" is the twenty-first building constructed on the property of the Mitsubishi Trading Company. Currently, it houses high-ranking cadres of the Soviet delegation to Japan.

On Meiji Street in Tokyo, near the famous Meiji Shrine, stands a gray, two-story cement building with a sign at the entrance that reads "Communist Party Headquarters." This "Red Shrine" is adjacent to a wooden house, which houses the untidy offices of the Communist Party newspaper, and a bookstore filled with Marxist books and newspapers.

Near the Tokyo Central Press Club, there is a five-story red building with the address "Mitsubishi No. 21" on its doorplate, the twenty-first building constructed on the property of the Mitsubishi Trading Company. Currently, it houses high-ranking cadres, numbering 218 people, of the Soviet delegation to Japan.

A strong red line connects the Communist Party Headquarters and Mitsubishi No. 21. The Japanese Communist Party frequently seeks instructions and consultations from Mitsubishi No. 21. The Soviet Union lacks personnel to undertake this task. Only nine people in the Soviet delegation can speak fluent Japanese. Therefore, old White Russian émigrés living in Japan are compelled to work for the Soviets. Orders are transmitted to Meiji Street and then transformed into action.

Communist Party members imprisoned by the Japanese authorities in Japan were released by the occupying forces in October 1945. Later, Japanese Communist Party members residing in China were also permitted to return to Japan. All these measures were based on the Potsdam Declaration and followed the orders of the American government, at a time when the twilight of the wartime alliance between democratic nations and the Soviet Union had not yet completely faded.

Since then, the Japanese Communist Party has gradually become the main tool of the Soviet Union to oppose and obstruct American policy toward Japan.

This group, which challenges the United States, has an organization that completely inherits the Soviet system. First, party members elect the National Communist Party Congress, and then the Congress elects a Central Committee of twenty members. They are the leaders of the Communist Party, but the real power is held by the Politburo. Three leaders control the Politburo, implement the party's resolutions, and determine the path of Japanese communism. These three leaders are:

(1) Kyuichi Tokuda—56 years old, born in Okinawa, a graduate of law school, and one of the founders of the Japanese Communist Party. He went to Moscow in 1922, 1926, and 1927, and was arrested three times, imprisoned from 1928 until 1945, when he was released by the American occupation forces. He was soon elected Secretary-General of the Communist Party and elected as a member of parliament in 1946. Tokuda is good at public speaking, is a radical anti-American, advocates violent revolution, and distrusts the masses. He might be regarded as a Trotskyist in the Soviet Union, but because of his loyalty to the cause, strong personality, and long period of imprisonment, he was eventually elected as the leader of the Communist Party.

(2) Tetsu Nozaka—55 years old, an economist, and the leader of the modern faction of the Japanese Communist Party, competing with Tokuda. He joined the Communist Party in his youth, went into exile in the Soviet Union in 1931, and has closer ties with the Soviet Union than any other Japanese Communist Party member. He served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Third International. In 1943, he went to Yan'an and returned to Japan in January 1946. Nozaka is highly respected by Japanese intellectuals, is familiar with foreign affairs, and also has close ties with the Soviet Union.

(3) Yoshio Shiga—46 years old, between the Tokuda and Nozaka factions, and imprisoned at the same time as Tokuda, but closer to Nozaka. He is good at public speaking and propaganda, and may be the most intellectually powerful person in the Japanese Communist Party. Those familiar with the inside story of the Japanese Communist Party all regard Shiga as the most dangerous figure in the party. (Translated from Newsweek, June 16, 1947)

### Sjahrir Returns to Yogyakarta Quickly; Indonesian Cabinet Meeting Still Yields No Result; Reportedly, Provisional Agreement to be Formed in Batavia Meeting

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 16th] With the tense situation in the Dutch East Indies, overseas Chinese are restless. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office here has reported the situation by telegram to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so that effective action can be taken promptly to prevent the 2 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies from suffering collateral damage.

[United Press, Batavia, 16th] The Indonesian Republic cabinet meeting held in Yogyakarta on the 16th to discuss Van Mook's joint gendarmerie and cease-fire proposals yielded no results. Another cabinet meeting will be convened tonight, with the Executive Committee of the Parliament attending, and a decision is expected. Prime Minister Sjahrir may take a special plane to Batavia tomorrow with the decision. Senior officials of the Republic have denied reports that foreign property in West Java has been demolished by the Indonesian army, stating that all houses are intact, and that only a few Dutch houses near Bandung have been damaged by the conflict between the two armies. Vice Prime Minister Gani of the Republic said that he will soon inspect the Sumatra front, while other officials will inspect Java. The Netherlands now needs to resolve the issue of ceasefires on all fronts immediately.

[Reuters, Batavia, 16th] Authoritative sources declared today that Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir has reached a provisional agreement with key officials of the Dutch East Indies government on a compromise plan for the future gendarmerie deployment of the Indonesian Republic, whereby Indonesian gendarmerie will be responsible for maintaining public order, but if the local situation exceeds the scope of Indonesian control, a joint Dutch-Indonesian gendarmerie will be organized to take over the task. This point was the last major obstacle in the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations to establish a provisional government of the Indonesian federation, which had recently reached a stalemate and threatened to cause war. Sjahrir himself expressed his approval of the Dutch compromise plan when he consulted with acting Governor-General Van Mook of the Dutch East Indies yesterday, but it is still subject to the final decision of the Indonesian cabinet. Sjahrir has already flown back to Yogyakarta today. According to neutral sources, everything depends on whether Yogyakarta supports Sjahrir's proposal.

### Large Quantities of Surplus U.S. Military Supplies to be Sold to Japan at Low Prices; Over 70,000 Tons Already Sold

[United Press, Miyanoshita, 16th] U.S. Eighth Army Supply Officer Hodges told newspaper publishers and editors visiting Japan from overseas that when the U.S. military withdraws, all U.S. military equipment, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, will be sold to the Japanese government or private individuals. Weapons and other purely military supplies will be destroyed, and some military supplies have already been destroyed. He also mentioned the Japanese military supplies handled by the Eighth Army, saying that purely military supplies, such as 26,000 tons of poison, have been destroyed. Items that can be used for civilian purposes, such as 16,000 vehicles, have been transferred to the civilian economy. A large quantity of surplus supplies from the Eighth Army (approximately 73,000 tons) has been sold to Japan at a price that is less than one-third of the original price. In general, the Japanese people cooperate very well with the occupying forces. American women can walk around Japan without any problems, and safety is guaranteed. The Japanese people like and respect the American army. When the U.S. military withdraws from some towns, residents request that troops be sent again.

### Romanian Government Arrests More Opposition Party Members Nationwide; Peasant Party Chairman Maniu Also Among Those Arrested

[Reuters, Bucharest, Romania, 16th] News this morning indicates that in the past 24 hours, over 300 members of the Romanian opposition party have been arrested in Bucharest and the provinces.

[Reuters, Bucharest, Romania, 15th] In the past 24 hours, approximately 100 more opposition party members have been arrested in the Romanian capital and the provinces, most of whom are members of the National Peasant Party, including the party chairman, Maniu.

Maniu, 74 years old, is the co-founder and leader of the Romanian Peasant Party, serving as party chairman from 1922 to 1930, and twice as prime minister from 1928 to 1930 and from 1933 to 1933. He withdrew from politics in 1933 due to disagreements with the government, but rejoined the Senate in 1924 and served as deputy prime minister. He made a statement last Tuesday, saying that since the Romanian government seized power against the will of the people, it has done nothing but harm public opinion and the interests of the people. Those arrested include National Peasant Party Vice Chairman Mihăilescu, Secretary General Banascu and his wife, former cabinet ministers Lascăr and his wife, Carandino and his wife, and Maniu's secretary, Caposu, and Mihăilescu's secretary, Holeso. The National Peasant Party headquarters and its newspaper have been occupied by the police, and another newspaper has been suspended for several days.

### U.S. Navy Admiral Advocates Permanent Control of Yokosuka

[United Press, Yokosuka, 16th] Colonel Glenn T. Graham, Commander of the U.S. Fleet Activities in Yokosuka, told a group of American journalists visiting Japan on the 16th that the United States should continue to control the Yokosuka naval base after signing a peace treaty with Japan. Yokosuka should be a permanent base for the U.S. Navy in this area, as Yokosuka has all the characteristics of a powerful naval base, which is sufficient for the U.S. Navy to maintain control of the Western Pacific.

### Japan's Workers' Compensation Insurance to be Under the Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor; Katayama Cabinet Temporarily Overcomes Difficulty

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The issue of workers' compensation insurance, caused by the establishment of the Ministry of Labor by the Japanese cabinet, was on the verge of a stalemate due to the conflicting opinions of Minister of Health Ichimatsu and State Minister Yonekura. On the 16th, Prime Minister Katayama convened six representatives from labor and management to hold a forum to hear their opinions. They unanimously advocated that it should be under the jurisdiction of the newly established Ministry of Labor in the future. As a result, Prime Minister Katayama and Foreign Minister Shidehara re-negotiated and finally decided that it would be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor, and immediately informed Ichimatsu and Yonekura. It is also learned that the bill regarding the establishment of the Ministry of Labor may be submitted to the Diet at the end of July.

### Standard Rent Measures Determined; Resolution Prohibits Unilateral Increases; Agreement Requires Consultation Based on Actual Expenses Plus Reasonable Profit; Collecting Tips Subject to Fines Up to Three Times

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The issue of standard rents in this city has been debated for a long time without resolution. At the third meeting of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Government drafted a temporary measure for standard rents in this city for discussion. The temporary measure stipulated that the maximum amount of standard rent should not exceed 1,800 times the base figure of 1937. The seventh meeting of the third congress of the Municipal Council decided to retain the rule, and the municipal government revised the standard of rental according to the factual situation. The Municipal Council has already sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting the implementation of the resolution. Subsequently, the Municipal Government received a letter from the National Economic Commission requesting that it draft concrete measures to stabilize rents in Shanghai and Nanjing for discussion by the commission. The 84th municipal meeting decided to convene a meeting of relevant agencies in this city for discussion in order to gather opinions.

Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the municipal government convened a meeting in the conference room. Mayor Wu sent Secretary-General Shen Zonglian to preside over the meeting because he was presiding over another meeting. The attendees included Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping, Specialist Wu Zunyi, Secretary Yang Zhu, Chief Judge of the Civil Division of the Local Court Xu Fuji, Chairman of the Real Estate Association Ma Shaoquan, Municipal Councilors Ma Junshuo and Shao Yongsheng, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, totaling more than 40 people. After heated discussions, the opinions of all parties were summarized, and the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Management Measures were drafted, which will soon be promulgated and implemented by the municipal government. The measures are as follows:

(1) The rental amount of houses in this city should be maintained as much as possible and should not be unilaterally increased arbitrarily. If an adjustment is necessary, it should be determined through consultation based on the landlord's actual expenses for the house (including housing tax, land value tax, rental income tax, insurance premiums, alleyway streetlights, fire hydrants, and watchman's wages, etc.), and a reasonable profit (10% of the total of the above-mentioned actual expenses).

Mediation May Be Requested If Agreement Cannot Be Reached

(2) If the landlord and tenant cannot reach an agreement, they may apply to the competent authorities for mediation in accordance with the provisions of Article 101 of the Land Law. Those who disagree with the mediation should file a lawsuit in the judicial organs. However, before the judicial organs make a ruling, the results of the mediation should be temporarily followed.

(3) For houses rented by schools, charitable organizations, autonomous agencies, cultural groups, or occupied by public school teachers, the standard rent should not exceed 80% of the multiple of the salaries of public school teachers based on pre-war base figures.

(4) Lessees may not sublet the entire leased premises to others. Those who sublet a portion of the premises in accordance with the provisions of the proviso of Article 443, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, whether for residential or commercial use, the rent should be calculated in proportion to the portion of the house sublet and the original rental amount, but should not exceed one times the original rent. The same applies to those with existing security deposits.

(5) The lease term of a fixed-term lease should not be less than one year. A term of less than one year is considered one year.

Foreign Currency Prohibited - Rent Must Be Paid

(6) Rent is paid monthly and must not be calculated in foreign currency or in kind. If it was originally calculated in foreign currency or in kind, it should be converted into legal tender at the exchange rate and market price of the item on the date the lease was signed, and subsequent rental payments should be made in legal tender.

(7) In addition to rent, a security deposit may be collected for house rentals, and the maximum amount must not exceed the total amount of two months' rent. Those who violate the provisions of the preceding paragraph must return the excess to the lessee.

(8) Lessors must not collect tips or any other fees in any name other than rent and security deposits. Violators must return the entire amount and be fined up to three times the amount by the competent authorities.

(9) These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.

Landlords Vigorously Argue for Breaking the Status Quo

The debate was very heated during yesterday's discussion. Zhou Zhongjie, a representative of the Real Estate Association, insisted that management expenses, depreciation, and legitimate profits should be added to the actual expenses of the house. He also advocated breaking the status quo to seek fairness and reasonableness. Municipal Councilor Shao Yongsheng appealed to landlords to consider the current extraordinary period and the instability of the social economy. While the sympathy and the landlords' demand for profits is understood, the affordability of the citizens must also be considered. Zhou Zhongjie believed that there is no need to worry about the affordability of the citizens. When formulating rules, they always assume that the citizens cannot afford rent, but in fact, even if the rent is raised again, the citizens will be able to afford it. He cited the example that the monthly rent for each room in the HSBC Building is 8 million, and some even use the cost of living as the standard for calculating rent, but there are still many people seeking to rent. However, after discussion by the congress, it was ultimately rejected, and the original measures were determined as above.

### Expanded Investigation of the Gold Rush Case; Decision Made Not to Prosecute

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Since the Gold Rush case was exposed by Councilor Luo Heng, the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the Municipal High Prosecutor's Office to forward it to the Local Prosecutor's Office for expanded investigation. Ding Chuanen, the prosecutor in charge of the case, has repeatedly summoned the defendants Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, etc., for questioning. Yesterday, he announced the results of the investigation and decided not to prosecute them. The original text of the decision not to prosecute is recorded below: "The defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren are the former director and deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. They were ordered to handle the distribution of gold from March of last year. The distribution method was divided into two types: open distribution and covert distribution. Open distribution was applied for and issued by the Gold and Silver Industry Association, while covert distribution was resold through five designated companies, including Tongfengyu. The quantity and price of daily distribution were jointly determined by the defendants. However, since the implementation of the distribution, the market price of gold has been chaotic and volatile, and has even soared. In February of this year, Councilors Luo Chong and others claimed that the defendants had not made careful plans in advance and could not suppress the price of gold afterwards, and were suspected of using their powers, colluding with officials and businessmen, undermining national policy, and illegally seeking profits. After deliberation by the Standing Committee of the Councilors' Council, the investigation was forwarded to the court. According to the Special Criminal Cases Law, cases sent directly to the court for trial by judicial police organs in a transfer letter are considered to be filed for public prosecution, as stipulated in Article 3 of the Special Criminal Cases Law. It is found that the defendants' criminal acts had been previously exposed, and the Songhu Garrison Command had prepared a transfer letter, together with relevant case files, and sent it directly to the Criminal Court of this court for trial. The criminal circumstances alleged by the councilors are the same case. According to the provisions of the aforementioned laws, regardless of whether the defendants are criminally liable, it should be determined by the Criminal Court, and this office has no room for comment. Except for Bei Zuyi, who has been disciplined because he has no criminal acts, the decision not to prosecute is made in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law and Article 234, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."

### Lin Fengbao Found Not Guilty; Prosecutor Disagrees

[Reported by Our Newspaper] After the local court acquitted Lin Fengbao on July 12 in the Gold Rush case, sentenced Yang Anren to seven years in prison, and sentenced Zhan Liansheng to four years in prison, the judgment was delivered to the Local Prosecutor's Office yesterday. According to the prosecutor yesterday, the Business Bureau's distribution of gold was fraudulent and had been confirmed by the Criminal Court. How could Lin Fengbao, as the director, not know about it? Therefore, the judgment is unfair and he disagrees with it and will consider appealing to the High Court within the statutory period of ten days.

### New Measures Determined by Tax Bureau for 1947 Profit Tax

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The standard tax calculation for the 1947 profit tax has been determined by the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau. According to the figures declared by the Gu Gongshang firms, those with a turnover of more than 400 million yuan and earnings of more than 200 million yuan will be taxed based on account checking as a general principle. There are approximately 2,000 such businesses in the city, accounting for one-thirtieth of the total. Those with a turnover of less than 400 million yuan and earnings of less than 200 million yuan will still have their tax standards determined by spot-checking the books of each industry.

[Another Report] For the 1947 profit tax, since the principle of account checking should still be followed as approved by the Ministry of Finance, in order to save tax collection time, the scope of standard tax calculation has been expanded according to the actual situation of Shanghai's industrial and commercial units. In principle, 5% of each industry will be spot-checked. After receiving approval, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has informed each industry. Recently, the units to be checked in the wool, hardware, import and export, and paint industries have sent their books to the Tax Bureau for verification as scheduled. Representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and persons in charge of industry associations are also assisting during the account checking, and the process is very good. According to the Tax Bureau, if taxpayers believe that the assessed tax amount is doubtful, they should first pay half of the tax amount to the national treasury within ten days of receiving the payment notice, and then apply for a review. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline. If they do not apply for a review in accordance with the legal procedures within the deadline and do not pay the tax, they will be transferred to the court for punishment.

### Strengthening Vehicle Inspection, Improving Traffic Control

Methods Agreed Upon by the Traffic Research Association

The committee has been established for nearly a month. Concrete measures have been agreed upon regarding the maintenance of public vehicles. They are as follows for vehicle inspection: (1) Class A Inspection: Inspect once every day in the afternoon and repair it that evening. (2) Class B Inspection: Inspect once every fifty days. (3) Class C Inspection: A major inspection every one hundred and fifty days, such as disassembling and inspecting all steel plates. (4) Class D Inspection: A general inspection every four hundred and fifty days, that is, send the vehicle to the repair shop for thorough repair when it is due.

In addition, various issues such as vehicle speed, vehicle U-turns, violations of prohibitions, and accounting and personnel of transportation companies will be gradually studied in detail. According to Director Zhao, he told reporters yesterday: "All efforts to strengthen the management of public vehicles and improve the public transportation system, as well as all opinions and plans, are expected to be completed by the end of August, so as to make the public transportation in the city more modern and more perfect."

### Families of Arrested Students Petition the President of the High Court; Stating There is No Reason to Apply Martial Law

[Reported by Our Newspaper] After learning that the Songhu Garrison Command replied to the High Court that the reason for arresting the students was the application of Article 14 of the Martial Law, the families of the arrested students visited President Guo Yunguan of the High Court yesterday. President Guo sent someone to meet with them. According to the families of the students, Shanghai is not a terror zone and has not been declared under martial law, so there is no reason to apply martial law. They were promised that their opinions would be conveyed to President Guo, and they also expressed that they will continue to handle the review in accordance with the law recently.

### First North Pacific Passenger Plane, "Shanghai," Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon; Scheduled to Stop for Two Hours Before Flying to Manila; Passengers Include Mrs. Dong Xianguang and Son

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The first passenger plane on Northwest Airlines' North Pacific route, "Shanghai," which flew from the United States via Alaska and Japan to Shanghai and Manila, is scheduled to arrive at Longhua Airport in the city at 11:50 a.m. today. Passengers include Mrs. Dong Xianguang, director of the News Bureau, and her son. The plane also brought documents of respect to our President Chiang Kai-shek, Premier Zhang Qun, and Mayor Wu from celebrities from all walks of life in the United States. Those who signed the documents include Washington State Governor Wallgren, Seattle Mayor Devin, University of Washington President Dr. Allen, and leaders from all walks of life in Seattle. The plane will stay in Shanghai for two hours before continuing its flight to Manila. Then, it will return to the United States from Manila along the original route. Therefore, the maiden passenger flight on the Shanghai-to-United States North Pacific route will depart at 7:00 a.m. this Saturday.

### US Permit for China National Aviation Corporation Still Not Issued; Passenger Plane to US Cancelled Yesterday

[Our Report] The China National Aviation Corporation's US-China route has been open for only a little over a month, but yesterday it was suddenly suspended. The reason is that the flights on this route were originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 1st and 16th of each month, but yesterday's flight did not take off. It is understood that the reason is that the operating permit applied for by the company to the US Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has not been issued due to various required bureaucratic procedures. In the past, the flights were operated with the consent of the US CAA under the nature of domestic government charter flights, but this time there were no government charter flights, so even if there were other passengers, it had to be cancelled in accordance with the regulations of the US CAA. The slowness of the US CAA in issuing permits is in stark contrast to the speed with which our Civil Aeronautics Administration approves permits for US airlines. Currently, our Civil Aeronautics Administration has sent a telegram to the US CAA urging them to expedite the process, and once approved, China National Aviation Corporation's US flights can resume as usual, it is said.

### Decision to Raise 200 Million to Comfort Righteous Soldiers Passing Through Shanghai

There are still more than 2,000 people scattered in various parts of Xinjiang. Subsequently, the committee discussed the comfort measures, and because the Righteous Soldiers will be passing through Shanghai in batches, it was decided to raise 200 million yuan for comfort funds to be used to comfort the Righteous Soldiers passing through in batches. The comfort funds will be donated by various industries. Also, because the Righteous Soldiers may stay in Shanghai for a short period of time, it was decided that the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Central Film Studio will arrange for the transportation and temporary accommodation of the Righteous Soldiers at Jiaotong University to screen movies.

### 10,000 Yuan Troop慰勞 Begins on the 25th

### Resolution to Establish Fundraising Committee for Relief of the Great Floods in Guangdong and Guangxi; Proposal to Request Issuance of Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Bai Chongxi, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Huang Shaohong, Wu Guozhen, and Huang Xuchu jointly invited leaders from all sectors of the city for consultation on the relief of the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi. They approved a request by the Guangdong and Guangxi Disaster Relief Committee to the Central Government to allow the issuance of "Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets." Once approved, the financial sector will purchase a portion of the tickets to meet urgent needs. It was also decided to establish a fundraising committee to ensure a unified command and make every effort to raise funds. Song Ziwen was elected as the chairman, and Wu Guobai, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, and Xu Ji were elected as the vice-chairmen, with Wang Xianqing as the secretary-general. The fundraising committee members include Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Kaixian, Li Shuming, Li Yizhi, Xi Yanshu, Xu Xueyu, Wu Yunxu, Chen Bozhuang, Zhao Dihua, Cheng Cangbo, Yang Xiaotian, Qin Runqing, and others, totaling sixty-one people, and can be increased at any time if needed. The fundraising target for Shanghai is set at 50 billion yuan for Guangdong and 30 billion yuan for Guangxi. The detailed implementation methods will be determined after consultation between Song Ziwen and Du Yuesheng. The main points of yesterday's meeting are recorded below:

The reception was held at the Imperial Palace on the 9th floor of the Jinmen Hotel at 3:00 PM, with more than 200 leaders from all walks of life attending. Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, and Wu Guozhen represented the chairmen. Minister Bai first delivered a speech, hoping that leaders from all walks of life would study disaster relief measures to alleviate the suffering of the disaster victims in Guangdong and Guangxi, and thanked Mayor Wu for his assistance.

Mayor Encourages Generosity

Mayor Wu then spoke, saying that he had a feeling that although Shanghai's economy is depressed and life is difficult today, the citizens are actually living in a blessed land compared to the rest of the country. In the War of Resistance, Shanghai had its losses, but compared to the major cities in the rear that were bombed, it cannot be compared. In terms of wartime burden, Sichuan province alone had 1.6 million Sichuan soldiers, with an annual grain output of 20 million dan, which cannot be said to be light. In terms of the current situation, North China is a major battlefield, and Tianjin and Beijing are deeply affected, and their plight is even worse than Shanghai. South China has suffered the worst flood in thirty years. Based on the principles of disaster relief and neighborly assistance, Shanghai should be generous. Moreover, the floods in South China are also closely related to the economy of this city. Therefore, from a practical point of view, this city should also make every effort to help Guangdong and Guangxi.

Speaker of Guangdong Province Details Disaster Situation

After the mayor's speech, the presidium invited Lin Jizhong, the speaker of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, who arrived in Shanghai the day before, to report on the disaster situation. Lin listed the numbers of losses and said that repairing the embankments is a matter of urgency, otherwise the coastal areas of Guangdong will be submerged again when the tide comes. The estimated repair cost is 30,000 tons of rice (labor relief) and 40 billion yuan (material costs). As for emergency relief, an Emergency Disaster Relief Committee has been established and has already distributed 80,000 dan of relief rice. In the future, when purchasing rice from Southeast Asia, it is hoped that the government will provide convenience in terms of foreign exchange. At the same time, in order to eradicate the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, constructive water conservancy projects should be carried out, and this point still needs to be discussed with the Ministry of Water Conservancy.

Female Senator Reports on Disaster Relief

Wu Zhimei, a female senator from Guangdong, then reported on the disaster relief situation in Guangdong, saying that between June 21 and July 10, a total of about 14 billion yuan worth of in-kind donations and cash were received, and have been distributed to the disaster areas in Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Zhujiang. Currently, in addition to raising rice funds on their own in various counties and cities in Guangdong, representatives have also gone to Beijing to negotiate with the Central Government on the following matters: (1) The Executive Yuan should allocate 10 billion yuan for emergency relief, but only 3 billion yuan has been approved so far. (2) The 200,000 dan of grain requisitioned from Guangdong in 1946 should not be used for the time being in order to ensure emergency accounts. (3) Purchase 10,000 tons of grain from the United States, and ask the Central Government to approve the allocation of official price foreign exchange to save the victims. (4) Petition the Ministry of Food to reduce and exempt the land tax in the disaster areas. (5) Petition the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to allocate farming tools and fertilizers to the disaster areas. In terms of the disaster situation in Guangdong, emergency relief still requires 30,000 tons of food, otherwise 90 billion yuan will be needed.

Applause Passes List of Committee Members

After the two representatives from Guangdong reported on the disaster situation, Du Yuesheng immediately proposed the establishment of a fundraising committee, and the list of sixty-one committee members, including Song Ziwen, was passed by applause. Du also asked leaders from all walks of life to contribute fundraising methods. Luo Qinghua advocated issuing "Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets" to achieve long-term and widespread relief. He said: If 10 billion yuan is raised in one period, with 20% used as bonuses and expenses, 8 billion yuan can still be obtained. If this is done for five or six consecutive periods, it will not be difficult to achieve the goal. At the same time, this move can freeze the floating capital that is causing trouble and benefit the people of this city. Wang Xiaolai said: Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and speed and timeliness are important. He advocated that the banking sector should advance funds first, and the funds raised in the future will be used to repay the loans. Based on past examples, this method is very feasible. Whether this move is successful depends entirely on the degree of effort.

The Two Provinces Need 800 Billion for Emergency Accounts

Wang Xianqing and Zhang Kanglong spoke, saying that they had visited Song Ziwen to discuss this matter, and Guangdong needs 500 billion yuan for emergency relief, hoping to raise 50 billion yuan in Shanghai; Guangxi needs 300 billion yuan for emergency relief, hoping to raise 30 billion yuan in Shanghai. At this time, Du Yuesheng said: With Song Ziwen as the chairman, things will be easy to handle. The Yangtze River flood in 1931 was more difficult than today, but because Mr. Song was responsible for disaster relief, the problem was solved. Today, Mr. Song is willing to take responsibility, and there will be no problem with bank loans. Detailed methods will be decided after consultation with him. The suggestions of Mr. Du were supported by all attendees. Finally, Mayor Wu, on behalf of the presidium, spoke, saying that he agreed with the method of issuing "Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets," but this matter must be approved by the Central Government. Once approved, the banking sector will be asked to purchase a portion of the tickets first to meet the urgent needs of the disaster areas. He hoped that people from all walks of life would promote this matter with all their strength based on the principles of disaster relief and neighborly assistance. The meeting ended in an atmosphere of excitement, exceeding six hours.

### Scalpers Buying Up Sugar Ration Coupons: Social Affairs Bureau Considers Raising Sugar Prices

[Our Paper's Report] Because of the large number of customers applying for sugar rations, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently extended the ration period to once every two weeks, instead of weekly, to simplify procedures, with the ration quantity equaling the total amount rationed in two periods.

### Education Symposium Opens Yesterday: Elects Zheng Xiaocang and Six Others to Form Basic Education Design Committee; Approves Five Points of Mr. Slev's Proposed Social Education Plan

[Our Paper's Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Education's Education Issues Symposium held a general meeting on the morning of the 16th, chaired by Zhu Jiahua, and gathered reports from various review groups. Common opinions were reached as follows: (1) The high school graduation uniform examination system seems to have more advantages than disadvantages. The system itself has its value, but due to current transportation obstacles, economic difficulties, and schools not yet returning to normal, it seems appropriate to postpone implementation temporarily. In the future, strict enforcement of invigilation and spot-check methods should be implemented to improve the performance of schools and students, and the assessment of physical education and conduct should be strengthened. (2) It is reasonable for normal school students to be trained by the state and to serve the state for a certain number of years after graduation, but it seems inappropriate to restrict young people with excellent performance and a desire to pursue further education after serving their term. (3) Improve the organization of student self-government associations, strengthen the spirit of democracy, and emphasize the training of young people's character in the guidance work of teachers. Excellent students should be rewarded to encourage leadership, and individual guidance should be given to mischievous students to promote their correction. In addition to possessing the qualifications stipulated by law, the selection of principals must involve selecting people with rich teaching or administrative experience, excellent character, and a reputation in the local education field. Grade-level teachers must recognize the personalities of all students and manage and train students separately, with heavy responsibilities. Their teaching time should be reduced by six to eight hours to allow time for guidance work. Full-time teachers should work in the school for no less than seven hours to fully exert the spirit of professionalism and the responsibility of guiding young people. (4) Regarding basic education issues, Zheng Xiaocang, Luo Tingguang, and six others were elected to form a Basic Education Design Committee. After the end of the Education Symposium, experts will continue to be invited to discuss a basic education plan suitable for China's national conditions. The conference fully agreed to the following five points of the "China Social Education Plan" proposed by American Mr. Slev: (1) To make China a modern democratic country in a very short time, it is necessary to start with the implementation of adult education and the elimination of illiteracy. (2) The implementation of this education requires national mobilization. (3) Seek as much international material and technical assistance as possible. (4) The implementation of social education should be in line with the national political, social, and economic situation and needs. (5) Establish a committee to be responsible for planning and promoting this education. The conference finally opened in a harmonious atmosphere.

### Tight Money Supply and Shifting Market Sentiment - General Price Decline in This City - Business and Industrial Circles Concerned About the Export of National Products

[Reported by this Newspaper] The general market conditions for commodities in this city have recently seen a widespread downward trend due to (1) a tight money supply, (2) the visit of U.S. envoy Wedemeyer to China, and (3) the U.S. State Department's plan to open up trade with Japan. Yesterday, the trend was more pronounced across the board. Among the most significant examples: stock prices generally declined. 20-count Double Horse yarn was at 10 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan from before. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at 17.2 million yuan, a decrease of 1.5 million yuan from before. Fine-count yarn has largely fallen into the range of negotiated prices. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was at 428,000 yuan, a decrease of 17,000 yuan from before. White Jing rice was at 390,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan from before. Qingdao raw peanut oil was at 770,000 yuan, a decrease of 40,000 yuan from before. 120-count Tianqiao rayon was at 26.7 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan from before. Grade 78D factory silk was at 31.5 million, lacking buyers. Apart from cigarettes, which have stopped declining and are trending upwards due to the passing of the foggy season and the adjustment of commodity taxes on July 26, other commodities are generally declining, which is a welcome phenomenon amid the continuous price increases of recent months.

The tight money supply is due to the large deficits of national banks. On Monday, the deficit was 50.3 billion yuan, on Tuesday, it was 38.2 billion yuan, and only yesterday did it show a surplus of 17.7 billion yuan. The money supply remained tight yesterday morning, but the Bank of China's surplus of over 36 billion yuan in the afternoon gradually eased the situation. However, national banks still had a deficit of 16.9 billion yuan, foreign banks had a deficit of 10.9 billion yuan, clearing houses before No. 50 had a deficit of 21.8 billion yuan, and those after No. 50 had a surplus of 15 billion yuan. When the money supply was extremely tight a few days ago, some clearing houses had to balance their accounts late into the night. As a result, the preparatory committee of the money and banking industry also had a deficit of over 7 billion yuan a few days ago, but yesterday it was only over 1 billion yuan. The black market interest rate was between 22% and 23%.

In addition, the general impression of Wedemeyer's visit to China is one of optimism regarding future loans. It is believed that Wedemeyer's trip will facilitate loan progress. Furthermore, after the opening of trade with Japan, MacArthur's headquarters will adopt export subsidy policies, and the general labor costs in Japan are much lower than in China. Therefore, business and industrial circles in this city are concerned about the future of national product exports. As a result, they are selling off the goods they hold. This is also a major reason for the recent decline in commodity prices.

### Tight Money Supply, Decline in Hua Shares - Xinhe's Capital Increase Revealed, Market First Hit Limit Down

Except for Jinglun, which rose slightly, and Xinya National Products, which remained flat, all other popular Hua shares and miscellaneous brands fell sharply yesterday. The more popular shares fell more, due to the tight money supply and accumulated selling pressure, making it difficult for those shorting to obtain supplies. Xinhe's capital increase plan, which involved giving 11 bonus shares (two of which were allocated from interest) and requiring the purchase of 12 shares, shattered many dreams and first hit the limit down. On the last day of trading, buyers also showed no interest in Shuisazhi, and it also fell near the close, showing a bearish outlook.

The market opened lower in the morning due to the large deficits of national banks during the previous day's clearing. After opening, Luyong Yarn fell from 10,100 yuan to 9,600 yuan. No. 97, No. 220, No. 226, No. 180, and No. 177 advanced to 9,880 yuan, while No. 197, No. 154, and No. 54 were sold again to 9,650 yuan.

After 10:45 AM, buying interest recovered, and No. 224, No. 2, No. 157, No. 35, No. 97, No. 4, No. 85, No. 56, No. 152, No. 220, and others came in, briefly pushing Luyong Yarn up to 9,970 yuan. No. 35, No. 171, No. 89, No. 91, and No. 235 were sold, retreating to 9,700 yuan, while No. 219 and No. 218 advanced to outside 9,800 yuan. The Xinhe shareholders' meeting ended, and the disappointing bonus shares caused a collapse, indirectly affecting the entire stock market. Luyong Yarn was liquidated by No. 76, No. 217, No. 213, No. 155, No. 23, No. 17, No. 213, No. 155, No. 23, No. 180, No. 183, and No. 226, while No. 171 also sold Luyong Yarn, and Xinhe was heavily shorted. No. 181 and No. 45 also appeared on the market. At 12:15 PM, Xinhe first hit the limit down, and Yong Yarn entered 9,400 yuan, while now Yong Yarn also reached a low price of 9,350 yuan. No. 85 and No. 104 took advantage of the low price to advance to outside 5,500 yuan, but due to the consistent decline in various commodity prices and rumors of short selling, No. 85, No. 235, No. 181, No. 102, and No. 65 sold again, and No. 15 bought the current Yong Yarn on a broad scale. At 12:25 PM, Yong Yarn was forced to the limit down, and the current Yong Yarn also fell to within 9,300 yuan. No. 68, No. 91, and No. 16 still had to make up positions, rising to 9,380 yuan. No. 65, No. 54, and No. 215 sold off, and the market closed at 9,320 yuan. After the close, No. 157, No. 50, No. 69, No. 154, and No. 116 advanced, bidding up to outside 9,400 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, both traded shares of Xinguang, Yonggong, Dongxing, Zhongfa fell by a little over 5%, while Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, and Xinhua fell by about 10%, and Huafeng fell by a little over 10%. Only Jinglun rose slightly, while underwear was slightly weak, and Xinya National Products and Lian remained flat. Wuhe Matches, Datong Business, and Zhongsi fell by 5%, while Tongyi, Rongfeng, and Yongni each fell by 10%. In traded shares, Hua continued to fall by 5%, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Meiya each fell by a little over 5%, Yonggong and Qinxing fell by a little less than 10%, and Yong Yarn and Xinhe fell to the limit down and then recovered, falling by a little less than 10% and 15%. In old shares traded over the counter, Zhonghua, Zhabei, Nanyang, and Wuzhou declined slightly, while the rest were flat and weak.

### Government Bonds Stable, Foreign Shares Continue to Decline

Government bonds were slightly stable yesterday, with Class C and E bonds rising slightly, while miscellaneous brands fell slightly. Unified Class C opened at 6,900 yuan, reached 6,600 yuan, and closed at 7,000 yuan. Room 555 came in, while Room 503 and Runde sold. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds fell by 100 yuan, Unified Class D fell by 200 yuan, Unified Class C rose by 200 yuan, and Unified Class E also rose by 300 yuan. The trading volume was about 1 million yuan.

Foreign shares continued to decline yesterday due to reduced stimulation and a decline in off-site materials, showing a weak trend. Yisza opened at 69,000 yuan and closed at 67,000 yuan. Retail investors and money changers accepted the decline, while securities firms and banks provided supply. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yeguang was still flat, while Yipi, Yinglian, Steel Industry, and Aviation each fell by a little over 5%, the Paper Industry fell by a little less than 10%, and the remaining shares fell by anywhere from a slight decline to a little less than 5%.

### Three District Silk Industry Association Holds Fifth Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors - Discusses Requesting Cash Allotments for Raw Silk

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Fifth Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Third District Raw Silk Industry Association was held yesterday afternoon starting at 3:00 PM at the Bank Club. Over 20 people attended, including Chu Zhuan-cheng, Wang Hua-nan, Ge Jing-zhong, and Cai Xin-tao, chaired by Chu Zhuan-cheng. Mr. Chu first reported on the general situation of the association's affairs over the past year, with key points including: (1) 112 current members. (2) The purchase of raw silk during the spring and autumn rainy seasons of the 35th year of the Republic [1946]. (3) The spring loan work of the 36th year of the Republic [1947]. (4) The request to the government regarding the Japanese, Dutch, and Mixed China cases. (5) Tax issues. (6) The association's financial situation. (7) Reports of silk factory losses.

Following this, six proposals were discussed, of which the two most important are recorded below: (1) The association previously submitted requests to the Executive Yuan and the four joint offices, strongly arguing that each factory should be allowed to allocate raw silk in proportion to its own 10% capital and 10% profit, or to only pay 80% and retain 20% of the raw silk to regulate the market. Now it is known that the four joint offices have telegraphed the Guidance Association, stating that the government should buy all of the raw silk and not retain part for self-sale, requesting discussion. After discussion, it was resolved: to form another small group of eight people, including Zhou Yuan-xun, Wang Hua-nan, Gu Su-ming, Yuan Da-yi, Lu Zhong-lie, Gao Jing-yue, Du Lian-fu, and Zhang En-sheng, to discuss the solution at the afternoon of the 18th, and to represent the association at the Sericulture Production and Marketing Guidance Committee meeting on the 19th for discussion. All of the attending directors and supervisors considered that the 10% capital of each factory at that time was mostly raised by selling raw silk. The legal profit of 10% should also be given in goods in order to provide working capital. Otherwise, each silk factory's silk needs will be difficult to meet. (2) The Lianyuan Silk Factory proposal: Spring spinning has been completed for a month, and factories are hoping to start production soon, and the prerequisite is: (A) Requesting the Guidance Association to adopt a generous and flexible approach to the payment of spinning fees for half a month to provide working capital. (B) Fuel allocation is feared to be difficult, requesting the Guidance Association to negotiate with the Agricultural Bank of China to allocate funds to purchase all of the coal and fuel oil needed by the silk factories for one month at market prices, and instruct the Agricultural Bank of China branches in the localities of each factory to issue them for use by the factories, requesting discussion. The resolution was passed, to be submitted to the Guidance Association for adoption and implementation.

The oil market is wildly volatile, moving like fire, both the Guangdong and Yong gangs have completely stopped, and all oils have suffered a drastic and sharp fall of 345,000 yuan each.

### Sellers Depreciating and Selling - Rayon Falls Again - Factory Management is Silent, Silk Merchants are Very Apprehensive

The rayon market was extremely quiet yesterday due to the tight money supply, and those who needed working capital had no choice but to depreciate and sell, resulting in another fall. 120-count Gaoshan glossy rayon opened at 27.3 million yuan, hovering around 7.2 million yuan as the noon closing price, and continued to fall in the afternoon, from 6.9 million yuan to the final closing price of 7 million yuan. Tianqiao was at 7.8 million yuan, and Dongyang was at 7.9 million yuan, both more than 1 million yuan less than the previous day.

The factory management market has been quiet for days, and yesterday's price was reported to be low, with the asking price for high uniformity 500,000 yuan less than the previous day, but there were still few buyers and no transactions. Retail transaction prices were about 1 million yuan less than the previous day, with medium-grade goods between 29 million and 30 million yuan, and high-grade retail goods between 30.5 million and 100 million yuan, with very little business being done. The asking price for dried silk was also down by 500,000 yuan yesterday.

Silk merchants are very apprehensive due to the continued weakness of raw materials, so prices have fallen across the board. Dachen quilted fabric was first offered at 1.4 million yuan, but after large households sold off, the transaction price was 340,000 and 330,000 yuan. The final price fell to 300,000 yuan. Huaqiang quilted fabric fell from 350,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and finally someone wanted it at 250,000 yuan. Dachen checkered crepe opened at 36,4500 yuan, and finally traded at 6,200 yuan, with a delayed date of 6,500 yuan. The afternoon market price of Hua Jin crepe fell by 1,000 yuan, with the transaction price for high-end goods at 24,000 yuan.

### More Supply Than Demand in the Market - Yarn and Cloth Continue to Plummet

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a surge in supply from the Shenxin Factory and the opening of sales by the Textile Construction Company. The money supply in the market remained tight, and a bearish sentiment permeated the market. With rumors of the imminent success of US loans, people's hearts were extremely distracted, new buyers hesitated, and the closing price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was as low as 17.2 million, which was tens of thousands lower than the opening price of the Textile Construction Company, a huge drop of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day.

The closing price for 20-count Special Double Horse yarn also fell to 11.2 million, a gradual decline of 800,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was at 10 million yuan, down 900,000 yuan. The remaining 42-count Water Moon Treasure Light, 40-count Jincheng, 32-count Blue Phoenix Silver Moon, 20-count Tiannv Renzhong, 16-count Guangming, and 10-count Boy Scout and other coarse and fine yarns all fell by 340,000 to 1.1 million yuan each.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a gradual tightening of credit loans by banks, and traders' positions were tight. A bearish sentiment enveloped the market, and prices fell gradually. The resulting price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was as low as 418,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 27,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths of various grades, such as Five Blessings Color Ball, Blue Chicken, and Yanghe, also fell by 22,000 to 30,000 yuan across the board. The remaining bleached cloth, fine cloth, and dyed cloth Shilin cloth also fell by 5,000 to 25,000 yuan each, while grey cloth and coarse cloth fell very little.

### Cotton Textile Industry Joint Venture Company Holds First Deliberation Meeting Yesterday

[Reported by this Newspaper] The China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture Company, in order to export cotton textiles to Southeast Asia and secure foreign exchange revenue, had its chairman, Mr. Xu Wenzhao, send Deputy Chairman Fu Liangjun, General Manager Qian Chengxu, and Deputy Manager Lu Baoqing to Beijing three times. With the special permission of the authorities, they attended the National Economic Conference held on the 12th of this month. With the strong support of the attending committee members, it was approved in principle, opening the first sound of government assistance to national industries. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the company held its first deliberation meeting, chaired by Fu Liangjun. The attending participants included the chief committee members of six units, including shirts, undershirts, knitwear, handkerchiefs, bedsheets, and towels: Mr. Wang [missing character], Yao Siwei, Luo Qingfan, Xu Zhaohou, and over 20 people including the company's executive director Li Daofa. Chairman Fu reported in great detail on the experience of attending the National Economic Conference in Beijing and expressed his gratitude to the government's leadership and assistance. He mentioned that although the authorities had approved it in principle, technical issues still needed to be carefully studied. The authorities' opinion was that "standard products come first," and he hoped that everyone would work hard to increase production in order to fulfill the government's premise of revitalizing industry and conforming to the new economic direction.

The content of the deliberation meeting reportedly focused on recognizing "seizing the opportunity," "determining costs," "quantity allocation," "inventory reporting," "profit," and "production and sales contracts," with lengthy discussions, especially on the production and sales cooperation contract, which was thoroughly reviewed and unanimously passed. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM, and Fu will convene another important meeting within days.

A certain authoritative person in the city's economic circles commented on this matter, saying: "If China's cotton textile industry can receive the full support of the government, the benefits will be immeasurable, and the national economy's prosperity will be promising. If the government can provide all conveniences in the technical aspects, early exports will be as easy as turning one's hand."

### Taiwan Sugar Allocation Period Extended - Changed to Once Every Two Weeks - Each Allocation Increased by One Fold Compared to Before

The Taiwan Sugar Company, due to the large number of customers for the allocation and sale of sugar, previously allocated and sold sugar once a week, which caused many difficulties in the procedures. Therefore, the original plan to apply for sugar allocation today has now decided to extend the allocation period and change it to once every two weeks. Each allocation will be increased by one fold compared to before, and the 24th period will be changed to applying for allocation and sale next Thursday.

Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian stated yesterday: "Recently, the bureau received a report from the Taiwan Sugar Company stating that the difference between the household sugar allocation price and the market price has reached 5,000 yuan per catty, resulting in active scalper parties. The sugar ticket already has a market price, and the bureau is requested to consider this. However, the bureau believes that it would be too demanding to require the sugar to be shown the citizens' identity card in addition to the sugar ticket. It is now planned to increase the allocation price for August to about 5,000 yuan per catty in order to prevent market scalpers from profiting. Although suppressing the sugar price is the most thorough solution, it cannot be implemented due to the fluctuating Taiwan dollar exchange rate."

Sugar Prices Continue to Fall

The sugar market continued to decline yesterday due to the tight money supply. The association's price quotes, Taiwan sugar three grades with extra, the initial price was 65,000 yuan, then fell to 60,000 and 50,000 yuan. 20 Medium sand white 634,000 yuan, Taiwan red 565,000 yuan. Peruvian sand 680,000 yuan, each falling by about 20,000 yuan. In the afternoon, each grade fell by another 10,000 yuan. Native sugar was also generally weak, Shantou Green 460,000 yuan to 456,000 yuan, Cotton Red 510,000 yuan, Xinghua White high-grade goods 610,000 yuan, second-grade 590,000 yuan. Xing red 465,000 yuan, second-grade 434,000 yuan, Hainan red 460,000 yuan, totaling over 500 transactions.

### Cigarette Tax Rate Adjusted - Changed to 100 Percent

The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement an adjustment to the cigarette tax rate, generally increasing it to 100 percent, starting from the 26th. It is said that the collection method will adopt a rounding system of fifty, in order to uniformly align with units of ten yuan. For example, if the original tax rate was 210,000 yuan, an increase of 100 percent would be 420,000 yuan, but only 400,000 yuan will be paid. And those above 450,000 yuan will be calculated as 500,000 yuan. The tax bureau has officially notified the above method to all cigarette factories for their information.

Cigarettes Rebound

Yesterday's cigarette market saw a lively increase in activity from the door and broker gangs, coupled with a sharp drop in prices on the previous day, leading to buying to cover short positions, and the market trend remained firm. Trading in the noon market was still good, but the money supply remained tight, and the Huacheng Company dispatched sales of Beauty brand cigarettes: A card one box, B card forty packs, C card twenty packs, allocation price 47,500 yuan per pack.

The China Company will also dispatch (17th) A-grade Tongxing Double Axe brand cigarettes one box, Quanlu one box, B-grade 150 packs each, C-grade 100 packs. The allocation price for Double Axe is 24,000 yuan per pack, and Quanlu is 13,200 yuan, so the resulting price rise was thwarted.

Both Ten Branches British Old Knife cigarettes only rose by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day, with British at 8,520,000 and Old Knife at 7,380,000 yuan. The remaining Chinese manufacturer's Golden Mouse, Million Gold, Brandy Red Gold medal, and other packaged cigarettes also increased by 4500 to 1200 yuan. However, the market for American goods Camel, Mars packaged cigarettes, and canned tobacco remained stable.

### Measures to Participate in Trade with Japan to be Announced Soon

[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the US State Department announced that it would restore the opening of trade with Japan in mid-August of this year, various countries have been contacting each other to establish trade relations with Japan. Our country has been approved by the Southeast Committee to have 64 import and export merchants send representatives to Japan to handle commercial affairs. The central authorities, in order to discuss the promotion of private trade relations between our country and Japan, requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to preside over the matter at the National Economic Committee meeting. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has convened various related parties to discuss it once, and detailed measures are expected to be announced within days.

[Another News] In the barter trade with Japan handled by the Central Trust Bureau, the quota for food exports to Japan from our country this year has reached 500,000 tons. It is now learned that to date, 200,000 tons of food have already been shipped, and whether the remaining 300,000 tons can be fully shipped will depend on future transportation conditions.

### "Industry and Commerce World" Seventh Issue Published

The seventh issue of "Industry and Commerce World," published by Pan Shizao and edited by Yuan Bili, was published yesterday. In addition to the special issue "Is the Recent Employee Living Index Reasonable?", this issue also includes several important papers such as Li Zongwen's "Re-discussing Import and Export Interlocking Measures" and Pan Shihao's "New Voices on Textile Allocation."

### Yarn Business Association Representatives Petition for Resumption of Yarn Allocation to Silk Weavers

[Our Newspaper] Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Shanghai Yarn Business Association, along with directors Shen Boqin and Xi Shaozun, visited Liu Siying, acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, at around 3 p.m. yesterday.  Mr. Liu was busy with official duties, so Yuan Cuda, director of the secretariat of the committee, received them.  Since the cessation of yarn allocation by the company, the silk weavers have relied on yarn supplied by various private factories.  Now, because 75% of the yarn produced by the private factories is to be turned over to the government, the yarn available for sale is even scarcer, making it impossible for yarn merchants to maintain their businesses.  There are more than 800 yarn businesses in this city, employing over 10,000 people, whose livelihoods are at risk.  Furthermore, small industries in other cities have always relied on yarn merchants for supply and distribution, and now have nowhere to turn.  Therefore, in order to regulate yarn market surpluses and deficits, and to sustain the yarn merchants' businesses, they request the resumption of yarn allocation.  Mr. Yuan stated that the issue of yarn allocation to yarn merchants is already stipulated in the Textile Adjustment Committee's implementation plan, which is awaiting approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs before it can be implemented. Currently, yarn merchants are advised to temporarily maintain their businesses by relying on the limited yarn allocated by private factories.

### Cotton Market Continues to Decline

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was weak due to the decline in yarn and cloth prices and tight credit conditions, leading to a further drop in prices. Trading of opened and delivered bales was recorded at 2.15 million for Lingshi, 2.05 million for Shanghai City, 1.7 million for Huoji, and 320,000 per bundle for Zhoupu Zihua cotton.

### Revised Measures for the Purchase of Hog Bristles and Tung Oil

[Our Newspaper] According to information from the China National Trust and Investment Corporation (CNTIC), the implementation measures for the purchase of hog bristles and tung oil have been newly revised and are currently under review by the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Council. It is expected to be announced soon. Furthermore, the CNTIC's purchase of aged tea from the 35th year of the Republic has not yet commenced because tea merchants are still in negotiations with the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank regarding unresolved matters.

### Edible Oil Smuggled South Reaches Thousands of Large Barrels

It has recently been discovered that edible oil is being smuggled from this city to Guangzhou and Hong Kong, with the quantity reaching over 3,000 large barrels (53 gallons per barrel). The Bureau of Social Affairs has conducted extensive investigations, but has not yet made any arrests. The bureau has requested the City Government to inquire with the Customs, but Customs has not issued any permits for such shipments as the matter is under control, leading to speculation of smuggling. The Bureau of Social Affairs has requested assistance from relevant authorities to investigate the matter.

### Temporary Allocation of 20,000 Bales, Allocation Price Unlikely to Change; Cotton Provided by Private Factories to be Settled at Negotiated Price First, then Allocated to Reproduction Industry by Textile Adjustment Committee

[Our Newspaper] The sixth regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee will be held at the committee at 4 p.m. today. At the meeting, the final wording of the implementation plan for developing the textile industry and adjusting the yarn and cloth market, which was passed at the fifth regular meeting, will be revised before being submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. It is reported that since the government issued the general mobilization order, the coordination of this plan has been complicated, requiring the Ministry to submit it to the National Overall Planning Committee of the Executive Yuan for joint discussion before a proper solution can be determined.

Furthermore, regarding the temporary joint allocation handled by the committee, state-owned and private yarn factories are each to provide 10,000 bales of cotton yarn for allocation before the 15th of this month. The 10,000 bales provided by the state-owned factories are almost fully allocated. However, the private factories have not yet delivered the full amount, with only over 8,000 bales delivered so far. It is reported that relevant parties intend to allocate these 20,000 bales of cotton yarn within this week to avoid changes in negotiated prices affecting the fairness of the joint allocation system for each factory. Factories that deliver yarn late will have their yarn settled at the current negotiated price and sold to the Textile Adjustment Committee, which will then allocate it to the reproduction industry at the current negotiated price. Therefore, the allocation price of the 20,000 bales of temporarily allocated yarn is expected to remain unchanged.

### Battle Flags Flutter on Taiping Ridge, North Suburb of Siping

— Yu Juren

Changchun, 11th (Air Mail)

In the northern suburbs of Siping, there are two adjacent high grounds marked on the map as "Liuping Ridge." Some people call them "Sister Mountains." It is a strategically important location, as it controls the entire Siping, which is extremely critical. No wonder General Du Yuming, even on his sickbed, constantly thinks about the construction there and repeatedly tells his chief of staff, Zhao Jia, to call and inquire about the defense situation. The fortifications there were built strongly by the defending army. The Communist army made several probing attacks, but always retreated when they realized the difficulty.

This is a factual article written by a military personnel participating in the defense war in that area (Reader).

A Pleasant Dream

At the end of May, the wind warms the lake and the earth, and everything in the north begins to regenerate. The flood tide of the Songhua River, stirred by the Arctic currents, begins to flood again. Look! Like the high tide of the Qiantang River, it moves from north of the river southward, southward… The northern embankment has lost its resistance. People living in this gentle land begin to feel depressed. The train station is filled with refugees, and the streets have lost their order. The retreating soldiers and refugees from the south are like a tide, and everyone's heart is shaken!

It was on the morning of May 25th that an express train came from the west. The whistle joyfully told the people in their troubled dreams the good news: "Reinforcements from the west have arrived!" This is the vanguard of the 261st Regiment of the 87th Division. They are the mainstay of the defense of Siping, leading thousands of brave men. The commander of this valiant force is Colonel Zhou Junping, with Lieutenant Colonel Wang Yubai as the deputy commander. The name "261st Regiment" is no longer unfamiliar to the people of Northeast China.

With neat ranks, they marched through the streets. Who wouldn't cast a joyful and admiring glance at this solemn and orderly procession? They marched from the station, group by group, to their defensive positions. This built an impregnable wall of stability for the people of Siping, who were in turmoil.

On Full Alert

No matter who judged the situation in Siping at the time, the north was more important than the south. Therefore, this important area was taken over by the 261st Regiment of the 87th Division. They occupied a total of approximately 5,500 meters of defensive positions from the source of the northeast water supply to Xiaobeigou in the northwest. In this area, they used the undulating ridges of Beishan as outposts, and created resistance lines around the city's perimeter. They also used the [omission] as the third line of defense. Behind the third line of defense, the command posts formed strong strongholds. Thus, in this vast area, a complex and intricate "Eight Trigrams Formation" was created, integrating points, lines, and surfaces. Due to their consistent efforts from top to bottom, they built an incredibly strong defensive work in a very short period.

When you stand on Beishan and look south, the high and long walls, the winding trenches, the star-studded fortresses, the layers of barbed wire, the barricades, and the honeycomb-like triangular pits… it evokes a sense of impossibility to enter. Furthermore, the energetic soldiers with guns and the new-style weapons with bright bayonets are truly indescribably majestic and solemnly awe-inspiring. They are waiting in full battle array.

A Prelude to Victory

The curtain of the great battle was raised, accompanied by the Communist army’s lightning attack on the third stronghold of Beishan in the south, which fired the first shot! This was the westernmost outpost battle of the 261st Regiment, defended by the thirty-seven brave men led by Platoon Leader Wang Zhenshan of the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion, guarding the northern gate of Siping.

Everyone worried about the battle at this isolated outpost. The first battle passed, and the next day was the same. On the third day, the Communist army attacked most fiercely. They used a battalion-sized force, and as a result, the Communist battalion was completely defeated. More than 1,500 people were wiped out, creating this prelude to victory!

Lightning Attacks

The Communist army's lightning attacks in the southern urban area had clearly broken through some positions, infiltrated the urban area, and reached near Yuming Road, with a momentum like the "Yellow River flood," seemingly unstoppable.

Deputy Commander Lieutenant Colonel Wang Yubai was ordered to command in this precarious situation. He led two and a half companies of his unit, along with an attached platoon of infantry and engineers, using this limited force to block the Communist army's advance on Yuming Road. They captured two strongholds with one stroke. Although the Communist army approached with ten times the strength, they launched fierce attacks day and night. The street battles lasted three days and nights, but they never crossed the boundary by even one step.

A Good Beating

After the 261st Regiment moved its position, the entire deployment formed a "U" shape, with the 2nd Battalion at the railway repair factory as the protruding point on the right wing of the "U," and the 3rd Battalion at Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) as the protruding point on the left. In such a position, attackers who do not first attack both wings, or break one wing, before attacking the central concave part of the "U," are absolutely not allowed. The Communist army recklessly attempted to use extremely superior forces to cross the railway from the west side and attack the concave part of the "U" shape, attempting a central breakthrough. Therefore, on the third night (June 21st) after their attack on the railway repair factory failed, the entire 1st Brigade, approximately 4,000 men, attacked the 1st Battalion guarding the concave part of the "U" formation at Dechang Industrial Company. The Communist army was certainly taking a pre-requisitve calculated risk by attempting a central breakthrough. The so-called pre-conditions were nothing more than having absolute superiority in strength and firepower compared to the defenders.

Undeniably, the battle was truly intense. The Communist army used the wheel warfare tactic, charging repeatedly. If one attack failed, they would launch another. "Charge! Kill! Crash! Dudu!" The shouts, artillery fire, and bugle calls were deafening. Fireballs, fire clusters, and fire lines were colorful and dazzling. It was truly a tragic scene. At the fiercest moment of the battle, the brave Deputy Commander Wang Yubai personally led a platoon of infantry to Dechang Company to supervise the battle, vowing not to let the Communist army break into the position. The resourceful Commander Zhou Junping also telegraphed orders to the units on both wings of the "U" formation to preemptively create a "fire pocket" for the Communist army, and ordered the 2nd Battalion to be ready to strike from the right wing to annihilate the attacking Communist army in front of the position in one fell swoop.

The Communist army's misfortune finally descended upon them. The attack was unsuccessful, and before dawn, they had to retreat quickly. Who knew that a "only allow them to advance but not retreat" interlocking fire was waiting for them. As they prepared to cross the railway, more than a dozen light and heavy machine guns on both wings of the "U" formation sealed off a corridor more than 20 meters wide on both sides of the railway, making it impenetrable. Forward? It was a steel wall-like position. Stop? It was a nest of arrows focused in one place. They had to rush back, braving the rain of bullets. They ran backward in dense ball formation. Our side used intense artillery fire to pour down, and the bullets washed over like a river collapsing. People fell down row by row like sand embankments, followed by the appearance of armored vehicles. It was truly "a good beating!" The complete annihilation of the Communist army's 1st Brigade truly manifested a new destiny.

Smoke-Shrouded Sky Bridge

The Sky Bridge (Tianqiao) is the left protruding part of the "U" formation of the 261st Regiment and is the traffic artery connecting east and west Daodong. Located high and protruding, it naturally forms the outpost of the entire stronghold in Daodong. Whether it is to the south or to the north, it can exert flanking firepower and suppress the activities of the Communist army in Daoxi. No wonder the Communist army regarded it as a "thorn in their side" and wanted to dislodge this "thorn."

The Communist army once launched a decisive attack on it with the main force of the entire 7th Brigade (16th Division). The style of attack was nothing more than "fierce." Almost every officer and soldier of the 261st Regiment knew these three movements: "Fierce attack" (artillery bombardment) at dusk, "Charge" at night, and "Fierce retreat" at dawn. Therefore, their countermeasure was "strict alert," "short and fierce shooting," and "relentless pursuit of firepower." As a result, every time the Communist army attacked, they enriched their victory with more content. The Communist army's attack on the bridge was, of course, another failure.

Sky Bridge, great goddess, although your true face is shrouded in smoke and your jade body is bathed in a rain of bullets, you remain safe and sound in this storm. As the wind blows away the smoke from all directions, your image reappears greatly and majestic.

The Highest Peak of Jigong Mountain: Profile of Jigongtou (Sent by Our Correspondent Zhou Hanxun)

### Jigong Mountain, a Summer Resort in Central China

— Our Correspondent Zhou Handong

Hankou, 11th (Air Mail)

Invited by the Pinghan Railway Bureau, the reporter unintentionally visited Jigong Mountain, a famous summer resort! The development of this famous mountain only began around the 30th year of Guangxu (1904). It has no historical sites and lacks clear streams. In terms of history, scenery, landscape, and coolness, it cannot compare with Guling. However, from the perspective of the current geographical environment and future transportation construction, it has unique and majestic qualities, making it a summer resort most worthy of creation.

Magnificent Terrain and a Must-Contend Military Location

Jigong Mountain is located about 30 li north of Wusheng Pass and belongs to the branch of the Dabie Mountain Range. It is about 2,500 meters above sea level. If Wusheng Pass is an iron gate on the Pinghan Line protecting Wuhan, then Jigong Mountain is the outpost of this iron gate. Therefore, it has become a must-contend military location in the past. General Wu Peifu's success or failure was greatly influenced by its blessings or abandonments!

The highest peak of the mountain is regarded as the rooster's head and comb. It raises its neck and stands as the watershed between Henan and Hubei provinces, as if it is surveying the surroundings and detecting everything. On the rooster's back, tail, and feet, secluded and winding mountain streams are interspersed with several solid bunkers, further showing its majestic posture, which is overlooking and inviolable!

The rooster is male, and Jigong Mountain also has its magnificence!

Enjoying a Ride and Climbing the Mountain with Flying Delight

"Traveling and escaping the summer heat requires a leisurely mood. Perhaps we cannot fully appreciate the beauty of the mountain scenery!" An industry colleague once had such feelings.

When we walked out of the station and ascended along the small mountain path, we naturally felt a refreshing and hopeful longing when we saw the plaque "A Separate World" inscribed by Mr. He Xuezhu. However, in a hurry, we climbed the mountain on chairs, and seemed to have lost some sensitivity to the appreciation of every plant and tree. We only saw the winding and undulating mountain road, with mountains stacked on both sides. In the danger and steepness, there was still tranquility and beauty!

We roamed the mountain for about a day, from the rooster's head to the south slope to the north slope. Our eyes only swept over a corner of the entire mountain! Here, there are streams with gurgling sounds, lotus ponds covered with duckweed, desolate and solemn Living Buddha Temples, and shallow red tides similar to damp cloth. Although some of them are artificial embellishments, they cannot erase its natural tranquility!

Railway Hotel Stands Majestically on the Top of the Mountain

There are three parks arranged in the mountain villa. One is Zhongzheng Park, which contains the President's temporary residence and air-raid shelter, which was built in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Now the trees and flowers are still green and vibrant! The other two are Wuqiao Park and Shulin Park, which are also being actively cultivated and watered.

The houses here are all Western-style houses built of rocks, tall and magnificent, just like urban buildings. In particular, the railway hotel where we stayed stands majestically on the top of the mountain, with a vast view. Looking around from here, one can see the rising sun in the east, or overlook the setting sun and hear the sounds of returning [birds], or glimpse the looming mountains, all full of poetry, making people reluctant to leave! Liu Sui, the author of Jigong Mountain Bamboo Branch Words, wrote such a poem: "A wisp of green smoke is like opening a cooking pot, gradually entering the woods and reaching the upper level. I am already tired of floating in the sea of people, and the building windows are open to watch the clouds rise!" Perhaps Liu's poem was not made up out of thin air!

No, an old man who has worked for the Pinghan Railway Bureau for 20 years said: "The spring scenery here is even more lovely. Azaleas and peach blossoms compete with each other in red, and orchids and unknown herbs fight for fragrance. It is a red mountain, and also a fragrant mountain!" These beautiful spring colors are certainly unattainable to the reporter at this time, but the cool atmosphere, set off by the quiet mountain scenery, is indeed worthy of being a summer resort.

The Grave of the Rebel Han Stains the Mountain's Scenery

Although the sparrow is small, it has all its internal organs. There are also noteworthy features among the mountain's cultural relics: On the hillside of Nangang, there is the tomb of Han Fuqu. It is generally believed that this matter has damaged the glory of the famous mountain, and people have expressed resentful sarcasm. Former students of Northeast Middle School even pulled out his original gravestone, intending to replace it with an epitaph that said "Traitor Han Mou." Later, it was opposed by Han Mou's colleagues, and no gravestone has been erected. Now, weeds grow wildly beside the desolate tomb, and the fate of a traitor is also tragic enough.

Registering Households and Obeying Foreigners

The total area of this mountain is only 100 square li, and the area of the church district accounts for a quarter. The total population is only 1,238, while foreign missionaries account for 147. There are only 293 buildings in total, while church buildings account for 123. In the past, they did not pay taxes or register their households, and seemed to live in "extraterritoriality"! Recently, the Jigong Mountain Administration sent personnel to register and check households, and they slightly complied. It is not known whether this phenomenon is due to our own [omission] or our laissez-faire! The Chinese people living on the mountain seem to be very [omission]!

The Boundary Issue Has Not Yet Been Resolved

The jurisdiction of Jigong Mountain has always been twisted. The people of Henan want to manage it, and the people of Hubei also want to manage it. Although it was assigned to the provincial government by the central government last year, the dispute over the northern and southern boundaries has still not been resolved. The current Jigong Mountain Administration of the Hubei Provincial Government is said to be adhering to the ten major and five major policies, encouraging people to raise bees, chickens, plant trees, and grow vegetables, and run one elementary school and one middle school. The general style is practical, but due to the lack of funds, neither provincial government has truly supported it, so it is at a loss and its achievements cannot be demonstrated!

Transportation Leads the Way

Jigong Mountain's magnificence has been devastated by the enemy and puppets for ten years, leaving it full of scars. One hundred and twenty-four houses with walls but no roofs are waiting for people to rebuild!

Transportation led the way, and electric lights and telephones followed the sound and light from the railway hotel! Weeds were removed, and roads were leveled. Schools were established, and materials were enriched. It not only guided political construction, but also established an economic foundation. The reporter looked remotely at the ridges of Jigong Mountain and could not help but be awed by the power of transportation!

Transportation has made Jigong Mountain prosperous, and I hope it will continue to prosper gradually!

### Two-Year Review of United Nations Work (Part 2)

July 8th, Shanghai Associated Translation

The Investigation Committee was composed of representatives from each member state of the Security Council and commenced meetings in the disputed area on January 30, 1947. It concluded its meetings on April 2nd, submitting a report to the Security Council.

Regarding the situation in Greece, the Security Council held six meetings in March and April to discuss the proposed U.S. aid plan for Greece and Turkey. Pending new decisions by the Security Council, it resolved that an auxiliary team from the Balkan Investigation Committee should be stationed in the disputed area. Another suggestion was made to establish a special committee to ensure, through appropriate supervision, that foreign aid received by Greece was solely used to improve the welfare of the Greek people, but this suggestion was rejected by the Security Council.

On January 21, 1946, Ukraine urged the Security Council to pay attention to the military actions taken by British and Japanese troops against local residents in Indonesia. Ukraine felt this situation threatened the maintenance of international peace and security. On February 13th, a suggestion to send a committee to Indonesia and to issue a statement regarding the presence of British troops there was not adopted, and this issue was concluded. In March 1947, the Secretary-General received notification that the Dutch government and the Indonesian government had signed an agreement in Batavia on March 25th.

On February 4, 1946, Syria and Lebanon brought to the Security Council's attention the presence of French and British troops in Syria and Lebanon, and complained that the conditions for the withdrawal of French and British troops did not conform to the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter. Subsequently, a suggestion was made, declaring that both parties would engage in negotiations without delay, and it was believed that French and British troops would withdraw as soon as possible depending on the progress of the negotiations. This suggestion was not adopted, but France and Britain indicated that they would implement this suggestion regardless, and it was finally approved by a majority in the Security Council, though the Soviet Union, one of the permanent members, did not agree. In May 1946, Lebanon reported to the Security Council that it was satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations, and Syria also reported that foreign troops had withdrawn from its territory.

On October 26, 1946, two British warships were damaged by mines in the Corfu Channel, resulting in the deaths of forty-four sailors. Such an incident might have led to war in the past. After an exchange of notes between Britain and Albania, the dispute was submitted to the Security Council in January.

Britain requested the Security Council to:

Ascertain the fact that the Albanian authorities were aware of the mines in the Corfu Channel, and proposed that Britain and Albania should resolve the dispute based on the ascertained facts, and if they failed, it should be submitted to the Security Council for discussion. This proposal received seven votes in favor, but the Soviet Union did not agree, and because the Soviet Union was a permanent member of the Security Council, this proposal was not passed. Later, Britain re-proposed that the dispute be immediately submitted to the International Court of Justice for resolution. The Security Council then passed this proposal on April 9th. On May 23rd, the Secretary-General of the United Nations received a report informing him that Britain had filed a lawsuit against Albania in the International Court of Justice.

According to the peace treaty to be concluded with Italy, Trieste should be designated as a free zone, and the United Nations should ensure the complete freedom and independence of the zone. Currently, the Security Council must protect the basic human rights of the residents of the zone, and must maintain public order and security. The Security Council passed the above plan on January 10, 1947, and accepted the responsibilities it should bear. One of the responsibilities is to appoint the administrator of the zone after consultation with Italy and Yugoslavia.

In the second year after the signing of the Charter in San Francisco, that is, this spring, the United Nations encountered the most intense dispute of the present day: the Palestine problem. A special session of the General Assembly was convened, and a special committee was established to investigate the Palestine problem and to make recommendations on what kind of government should be established there in the future.

This meeting was held at the request of Britain, which was administering Palestine under mandate, on April 28th at Flushing Meadow. After three weeks of intense discussions, the General Assembly heard presentations from both Arab and Jewish representatives, and finally decided to establish an investigation committee composed of representatives from eleven countries: Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia. The "Five Great Powers" did not participate.

Three weeks after the General Assembly made this decision, the investigation committee met in New York, completed its organizational plan, and then set off for Jerusalem. The powers of the investigation committee were very broad, including the power to listen to the opinions of anyone at will and to go to any location for investigation.

The investigation committee must complete its investigation report before September 1st, so that the member states of the United Nations can have the opportunity to study the recommendations made by the committee before the General Assembly convenes its next regular session.

The General Assembly unanimously continued to request the people concerned, especially the people of Palestine, to avoid any actions that would hinder the early resolution of this issue.

In April 1946, Poland requested the Security Council to consider the situation in Spain caused by the existence and activities of the Franco regime, and to take measures prescribed by the Charter. The Security Council then sent a subcommittee to study the situation, and on June 28, 1946, resolved to promote the facts that the Potsdam Conference, the San Francisco Conference, the United Nations General Assembly, and the Security Council had condemned the Franco regime. These facts had been confirmed by the subcommittee's investigation, so it decided to continue to pay attention to this situation, so as to be prepared to take necessary steps to maintain international peace and security at any time.

On November 4, 1946, the Security Council removed the Spanish situation issue from its agenda and transferred all relevant records and documents to the General Assembly for disposal. The General Assembly then passed a resolution on December 21st, declaring that the Franco regime could not represent the Spanish people, and recommending that the Spanish government should not be a member state of international organizations established by or related to the United Nations. Similarly, meetings or activities of the United Nations and the above-mentioned international organizations should not be allowed to be attended by Franco's Spain. The General Assembly also recommended that if a government representing the will of the people had not been established in Spain within a reasonable period, the Security Council should consider appropriate measures. In addition, all member states of the United Nations should recall their ambassadors or ministers from Spain.

Disarmament and Atomic Control

If large and small countries can agree on disarmament, then the world will know that the world has finally embarked on the road to lasting security. What achievements has the United Nations made on this key issue of peace? On December 14, 1946, the General Assembly convened a meeting in New York and passed a resolution. This resolution was originally proposed by the Soviet Union, requesting the Security Council to immediately consider effective measures: (1) to adjust and reduce military forces and armaments, (2) to ensure that all countries implement these measures in their entirety. The plan to be formulated should be submitted to the member states of the United Nations and presented for discussion at a special session of the General Assembly. On the same day, the General Assembly requested the Security Council to decide, to the extent possible, on information regarding the military forces of the United Nations. This military force should be supplied by the member states, so as to implement the first resolution.

The Security Council therefore established the Arms Regulation Committee on February 13, 1947, composed of representatives from each member state of the Security Council. It was ordered to prepare and submit recommendations to the General Assembly within three months in order to implement the General Assembly's resolution. The committee convened a meeting on March 24th and is still in progress. Among its tasks:

The General Assembly faces a problem, the survival of human culture, all depends on the solution of this problem, so the General Assembly promptly set up the Atomic Energy Commission when it convened a meeting in London. According to the French representative, this is a choice between chaos and peace. The General Assembly ultimately unanimously chose the path of peace. The Atomic Energy Commission was ordered to explore all aspects of the atomic energy control issue as soon as possible, and to put forward special recommendations to expand the exchange of information on basic science between countries for peaceful purposes, to control atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure the peaceful application of atomic energy, to eliminate atomic weapons and all other heavy weapons capable of collective destruction from the armaments of various countries, and to provide effective guarantees through supervision and other means to protect countries that abide by the agreement from the danger of being destroyed or evading the agreement by other countries. The committee was composed of one representative from each member state of the Security Council and Canada (at that time, Canada was not yet a member of the Security Council). The first meeting was convened in New York on June 14, 1946. On December 14th of the same year, the General Assembly passed a disarmament resolution, urging the committee to quickly fulfill its mission requirements, and also requested the Security Council to quickly review the committee's report and the draft treaty for establishing an international control and supervision system.

On December 31st, the Atomic Energy Commission submitted its first report to the Security Council, containing research results and recommendations. On March 10, 1947, after discussing this report, the Security Council instructed the committee to continue to explore all aspects of the international control of atomic energy and to prepare a draft treaty or agreement within a reasonable period, and include it in its final recommendations for submission to the Security Council, and to submit a second report before the next session of the General Assembly on September 16th. The Atomic Energy Commission studied the Security Council's resolution and decided to refer the relevant issues to its subordinate executive subcommittee and second subcommittee for discussion. In order to enable the Security Council to maintain——

International Peace and Security

Article 43 of the Charter stipulates that member states of the United Nations should provide military force, assistance, and facilitation to the Security Council for dispatch. Therefore, on February 16, 1946, the Security Council instructed the Military Staff Committee to study the provisions of Article 43 of the Charter from a military perspective as the committee's first task, and to submit the results of the study and any recommendations to the Security Council. A year later, in accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly, the Security Council urged the Military Staff Committee to submit the previously requested recommendations as soon as possible, and to submit recommendations on the basic principles of the composition of the United Nations army no later than April 30, 1947. The Military Staff Committee submitted a report on these basic principles as scheduled, and the Security Council reviewed it on June 4th.

Reconstruction and Post-War Issues

As a result of the war, many parts of the world are still in ruins. The war-stricken countries are doing their best to rebuild their destroyed houses, farms, factories, and transportation. From its initial sessions, the United Nations General Assembly realized that without international action, reconstruction would be neither adequate nor rapid. (To be continued)

Publishing Industry

### The Melancholy of Critics

— Hu Shanyuan

Last autumn, I wrote "Ode to Melancholy" in the "Chunqiu" section of this newspaper, and came up with five melancholies, namely: "the melancholy of readers", "the melancholy of authors", "the melancholy of editors", "the melancholy of publishers", and "the melancholy of the current situation". Now that I think about it, I was actually missing "the melancholy of critics", whose position is similar to "the melancholy of authors", and should be located between "readers" and "editors".

What is the melancholy of critics? The melancholy of critics is great, at least not less than that of authors or editors.

When we see a good book, we cannot help but think: why doesn't the critic introduce it? When we see a bad book, we also want to think: why doesn't the critic point it out? What is someone's style like, what is their thought like, we hope the critic tells us; what kind of thought is popular, whether a certain technique is correct or not, we also hope the critic tells us. We hope that critics fulfill their responsibilities, improve the level of writing, and promote academic progress and cultural development. Our hope for them is great, and it is urgent.

But what about the critics now? Most of them are "silent as a mute", not saying a word. Occasionally, criticisms that appear in newspapers and magazines, although not entirely uniform, mostly cannot avoid only praise and no criticism. Especially bad is that if the writer is someone of unknown name, the critics always simply ignore it, not even a glance. Conversely, if it is the work of a famous scholar, then they all flock to praise it. Not only is the work of critics unsatisfactory, but their motives and personalities have also become a problem. The critics have not fulfilled their responsibilities, and we should condemn them!

But should the critics receive this condemnation? Although I am not a critic, I can depict the melancholy they suffer from injustice.

First of all, at present, critics have nowhere to publish their criticisms. General culture is declining, and the publishing industry has reached the point of lingering on its last breath. If what is published is not for political propaganda, it is for economic profit. Who has the space to publish your criticism? At the same time, precisely because of the poverty and fragility of the publishing industry, it seems that there is nothing that is worth reviewing, or can withstand a single comment. What's the use of a hero when there is nowhere to use his skills? Why blame the hero? Critics cannot but have their melancholy, and should not but have their forgiveness.

Secondly, critics cannot publish their correct criticisms. This kind of criticism, especially about pointing out problems, cannot be published. If the editor or author asks you to write a criticism, you can only praise, no longer point out problems. Sometimes they even want you to make excessive praise, far exceeding the facts. If you want to point out problems, the editor is always afraid of taking on the responsibility of scolding people. They always want to discuss it with you tactfully, suggesting that modification is best. If modification continues, they will make you completely unrecognizable, losing the original meaning.

Finally, critics also do not dare to publish their correct criticisms. This is also about pointing out problems. If you lightly point out the problems of a writer with a bad nature, it will quickly cause chaos, disturbing your family's peace. They will defend themselves, argue forcefully, and chatter endlessly, making you feel a headache. But this is still considered good. Even worse, they attack you, attacking not only your work, but also your personal life. When attacking you, they carefully choose their words, not choosing facts, not choosing any means. It seems that they must eat your flesh and sleep on your skin! As for their own work, they have long put it aside and do not care about it. What critic can bear the consequences of this kind of criticism? But these consequences often come with your criticism. When you think of this, do you still have the leisure to write and ink, implement correct criticism, and put yourself in the quagmire?

Critics, if they are qualified critics, are willing to do their best to promote scholarship and culture, just as every intellectual expects them to do. But is it possible for them? Especially now? Since it is impossible for them, they already feel melancholy. If they still have to feel condemned for the impossibility of fulfilling their responsibilities, then isn't their melancholy even greater?

The melancholy of others can still be attributed to the environment. As long as the environment improves, their melancholy will be relieved. Only the melancholy of critics cannot be completely relieved by improving the environment. Because the first item of their melancholy is about the environment, as long as culture develops and publishing flourishes, it can be smoothly relieved. But the second and third items, especially the third item, will occur in any environment, and there is simply no way to prevent it from happening. Therefore, in my opinion, a critic is destined to be a melancholic person, and their melancholy is even greater than that of authors and editors.

"Hard work but no reward" is an accurate portrayal of this kind of critic who distinguishes right from wrong.

There are also some creators who will learn Chekhov's argument and say: "Critics are parasites of creators". If so, then they, the critics, will truly be in a position of eternal suffering, more than just melancholy!

### Sociology of Education

— Zhang Yongzeng

Author: Chen Kemei

Publication Date: May, Year 34

Publisher: World Book Company

This is a book providing a general discussion of the sociology of education, synthesizing various schools of thought and research materials on the subject. While the interpretations may not be profoundly original, they grasp the essentials, allowing readers to gain a clear understanding from the book. Additionally, it selectively introduces the historical background and research methods of the sociology of education, enabling us to grasp the core of the subject's inquiry.

The book is divided into ten lectures. Lecture 1: Explains the importance of the development of the sociology of education, the close relationship between education and society, and the reasons for the recent progress in sociology.

Lecture 2: Introduces two major schools of thought in the sociology of education: the educational school, whose founder is Dr. Su Zheluo, and the sociological school, represented by Professors Ellwood and Finney.

Lecture 3: Outlines the content and scope of the sociology of education.

Lectures 4 and 5: Describe the relationship between education and society. The relationships between education and social organization, social sanctions, social inheritance, and social progress are also discussed in great detail.

Lecture 6: Discusses the importance of social principles and presents the interconnectedness and application of three major principles: education and democracy, social efficiency, and cultural concepts. The author emphasizes that realizing democratic, efficient, and cultural social life requires adherence to these three social principles.

Lecture 7: Discusses educational surveys. This scientific method is the starting point and basis for educational implementation, as well as the endpoint and verification of implementation. Its contribution is to guide educators to generate emotions about improving schools, making educational administration academic and practical.

Lecture 8: Divides school administration into two aspects: external, including the public and the school, and internal, detailing the responsibilities, training, qualifications, and characteristics of administrative personnel.

The last two lectures describe the key points of curriculum research, the goals of education, and teaching methods, and point out the mistakes made by people in general in teaching in the past.

After reading this book, I have some feelings. The relationship between education and society is so close that society will not progress if socialized education does not flourish. The current chaos in Chinese society, the backwardness of education, the high percentage of illiteracy in the total population, and the distance of national basic education from the ideal make it ridiculous to talk about the socialization of education?

I believe that to save China's education from its plight, it is necessary to reform the current traditional formal education in schools, remove the barriers between schools and society, implement democratic education, and universalize education throughout society, so that educational opportunities are completely equal. On the one hand, adapt to social needs, and on the other hand, adapt to individual differences. In this way, education can become the driving force for transforming society, and an equal, free, progressive, and rational society can promote the continued development of education.

### Geography of Hainan Island

— Lu Yuan

Written by Chen Zhengxiang, published by Zhengzhong Book Company

Hainan Island is the second largest island in our country, slightly smaller than Taiwan. It faces Taiwan across the sea. If Taiwan is the barrier of our country in the Eastern Pacific, then Hainan Island is the outpost of the South Pacific. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the attention of the Chinese people has shifted to Taiwan, which was developed by Japan, and many specialized works have been written, but the importance of Hainan Island has been neglected, and there are very few specialized works. Although the government recently set up a provincial administrative office in Hainan Island to develop the area, few domestic people have gone to develop it, probably because the Chinese people are not familiar with the island's geography. Chen's book "Geography of Hainan Island" can be said to be an analysis of Hainan Island in front of the Chinese people.

Hainan Island has no less advantageous geographical environment than Taiwan, but Taiwan has become a place with developed industry and prosperous economy after the efforts of the Japanese, while Hainan Island is still in its original state. The author specifically and alarmingly points out the reasons in the book, and discusses the geographical environment of the island in detail, and also makes a correct comparison between the island and Taiwan in numbers, indicating that the development hope of Hainan Island is very great, which is not fabricated by the author out of thin air.

The book is divided into fourteen chapters, with about 60,000 words. First, it gives a general description of the island's geography, and then divides the chapters by terrain, climate, residents, products, industry, trade, transportation, and cities, and analyzes and discusses them so that readers can understand it at a glance. In the final chapter, the author points out that the three islands of the South China Sea near Hainan Island are coveted by foreign countries, which can especially arouse the attention of the Chinese people.

### Straight Line Figures

— Zhong Zhi

Many friends who are new to geometry come to me and ask me what good reference books are available? I always introduce them to the Commercial Press to buy a copy of Straight Line Figures to take a look at. Many friends who have read this book, although they don't praise the book, can naturally develop a great interest in geometry. The reason why I am keen to introduce this book is also here.

Hayashi Tsuruichi is a Japanese mathematician who not only has a high status in Japan, but also has a considerable reputation throughout the world. This book is full of Japanese atmosphere.

Mr. Shi Xianyan is still very promising in the domestic mathematics community. The translation of the book Straight Line Figures is quite fluent and also retains some of the original style.

Straight line figures are the simplest part of geometry, but they are extremely important and also quite interesting. This book introduces the properties of straight line figures to the reader in great detail, laying a very solid foundation for the reader. With a good foundation, learning about circles, areas, etc. will naturally be easy and full of fun.

The content of the book is very ordinary, but the structure is very unique - which is what I call the - Japanese atmosphere.

In the book, example problems and almost all straight line theorems are included. There are also solution pointers, which can stimulate people's thinking and arouse people's research mind. After each theorem, there is an appendix on usage, which is especially beneficial to our students.

As for the practical application of this book in learning, there is also one point, that is, the application of the theorem "The line connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the base and equal to half the base" makes it easy to solve many difficult problems.

I dare to say boldly! "If you can read this book in detail, it will definitely make you have a great interest in geometry!" (The book is written by Hayashi Tsuruichi, published by the Commercial Press)

### From Schopenhauer to Nietzsche

— Shangguan Meibo

Written by Chen Quan, published by Datong Book Company

This book was published by Datong Book Company in November of last year. Although the title of the book is "From Schopenhauer to Nietzsche," the content is entirely about Nietzsche. Schopenhauer is only discussed in passing when describing Nietzsche's early thought. It would probably be difficult to find a more suitable person than the author, Chen Quan, a scholar of German philosophy and literature in our country, to introduce this great German thinker.

Nietzsche's philosophy has been introduced by many people in our country, and many of Nietzsche's own works have also been translated into Chinese. Unfortunately, to this day, Nietzsche is still the most misunderstood thinker in our country. Many intellectuals regard him as the ancestor of fascism, believing that his philosophy is the blueprint for fascist theory, which is a very regrettable mistake. Although Nietzsche's philosophy and fascism have many similarities on the surface, they are completely different in essence. The term "superman" in Nietzsche's original intention was only a symbol of a creator with vigorous vitality, but in the hands of militaristic fascists, it was transformed into a destroyer who killed and set fires.

On the eve of this war, Mussolini and Hitler did use a passionate, Nietzschean "kiss" to sing the praises of war and aggression, and successively set off prairie fires in Africa and Europe, attempting to realize their dream of a superhuman empire, which ultimately caused the tragic destruction and chaos in Western European countries today. After the world has suffered from the disaster of war, and after painful reflection, they unanimously began to criticize Nietzsche, blaming the responsibility for this catastrophe on the philosophy of the superman, as if the philosophy of the superman was the inducement that led to this war. Could this irrelevant misunderstanding be what Nietzsche expected when he created the philosophy of the superman? If Nietzsche knew in the underworld, could he not feel heartbroken?

If we want to analyze the reasons for this misunderstanding now, we certainly want to know the truth about Nietzsche. Nietzsche's writing is full of symbolism and lyricism, and it is not easy to understand his true meaning. Although there are many books that have introduced Nietzsche in the past, it can be said that none of them can truly explain his true meaning by penetrating his symbolic and lyrical artistic atmosphere. Now, Chen Quan's book introducing Nietzsche has successfully completed this difficult task. I hope that people who misunderstand Nietzsche can read this book. People who have read this book do not necessarily completely agree with Nietzsche or believe in Nietzsche, but they can avoid misunderstanding Nietzsche, which I dare to assert.

This book is divided into two parts. The first part discusses the formation and development of Nietzsche's thought, detailing the process of Nietzsche's transformation from agreeing with Schopenhauer to opposing Schopenhauer. Among them, the discussion of the mystical inspiration that Wagner's music gave to Nietzsche is quite unique and insightful, and is well worth reading. The second part introduces the system of Nietzsche's philosophy, and systematically explains Nietzsche's thought in terms of politics, religion, morality, love, etc., so that readers can have a detailed and clear understanding of Nietzsche's thought. What is especially commendable is that this book is not purely introductory in nature, but a semi-creative work. The author frequently elaborates on the essence of Nietzsche's philosophy with his own insights. Although there are some places that seem to need further discussion and debate, such as the author's claim that Nietzsche's advocacy of the "will to power" in his later years returned to his early Greek tragic thought, my opinion is not entirely the same as the author's. However, in today's widespread misunderstanding of Nietzsche, it is always a fortunate thing that such a book has appeared, and I especially recommend this rare good book to everyone with a gratified mood. As for the lively narration and beautiful writing throughout the book, they are all trivial matters.

### Nietzsche's Biography

— Shi Pei

(Written by an anonymous author, published by Reader's Friend Society, first edition in Year 35)

In Sun Fuyuan's "Lu Xun and Nietzsche's Doctrine," he mentioned that Mr. Lu Xun said of Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra": "The writing is vigorous, and it sounds like gold and stone when reading it. And the essence of his doctrine lies in encouraging human life, thought, and culture to gradually move upward, not to stop in trivial, despicable, and only material lives." These words are not only a very thorough and insightful criticism of Nietzsche's doctrine, but even of Nietzsche's person. As early as 1869, when Nietzsche was teaching at the University of Basel, his colleague Jacob Burckhardt said: "It is better to call Nietzsche an artist than a scholar." This comment echoes Mr. Lu Xun's words.

The author of this book takes the same perspective to look at Nietzsche. He said, "Nietzsche's life is not the life and death of an ordinary person, it is a work of art, a tragedy! There is no difference between understanding Nietzsche's work and understanding his 'person,' and at the same time, Nietzsche can only be seen from an artistic point of view. ..." In the postscript of this book, Qiu wrote a rather interesting and meaningful metaphor: "It is said that 'Cinnabar' is a kind of poison, and feudal times silly and loyal to the emperor's ministers often licked it to commit suicide. I don't know what the toxicity of this plant is, but from what I see in the paintings, it is a big spot of blood red. I really like that kind of red. I love this kind of red very much. Therefore, I think toxic things also have their beauty. 'Cinnabar' can kill people, but 'red' gives us beautiful stimulation." Nietzsche's philosophy of the superman is like this "Cinnabar."

Today, we live in a turbulent and uneasy era in which totalitarian forces have re-emerged, and I feel that it is quite necessary to have a more correct and progressive understanding of Nietzsche. During World War II, Hitler's brutality and violence were rooted in Nietzsche's philosophy of the superman as the fascist ideology. In mid-month, I accidentally read in an English newspaper about the news that fascist forces are still lurking in various European countries and are active in Argentina. From these reports, we can know that although Hitler has been defeated miserably, the remaining troubles still exist and there is a tendency to regroup. In such days, we should have a new estimate of Nietzsche, who is touted as the "ancestor" of fascism. "Nietzsche's Biography" is a biography that gives us a understanding of and vigilance against Nietzsche. The author has a long-term study of Nietzsche's thought. The motivation that aroused him to write this biography came from talking about Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" and Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid."

The book is divided into twelve chapters: 1. "Little Pastor" - Son of Christianity; 2. Facing Schopenhauer's Mirror; 3. Young Professor; 4. "The Birth of Tragedy"; 5. Friendship with Wagner; 6. Love and Women; 7. Creation, Creation; 8. Abandoning Schopenhauer; 9. An Atheist? 10. Superman, Superman; 11. He's Crazy; 12. The Completion of the Tragedy; Postscript. The descriptions in each chapter are very meaningful and fluent. With a rich literary and artistic brush, he portrays the deep layers of Nietzsche's life and thought. He maintains a purely objective and rational position with a calm artist's attitude. Praising good and criticizing evil, daring to speak and daring to say, this is the most basic and important spirit of biographical literature, and this book has already achieved this point.

Nietzsche's father was a devout Protestant pastor, and his mother was the daughter of a pastor, so he grew up in a family full of religious atmosphere. He was deeply influenced by his parents in his childhood. In addition to faithfully promoting the teachings, his father also loved poetry and music, and especially admired Emerson (R.W. Emerson). Emerson's works were often placed on his desk and at hand. Emerson's profound and sincere tone penetrated into the soul of Nietzsche's father. Nietzsche's mother was beautiful and healthy, full of vitality. It can be said that Nietzsche's praise of vitality was obtained from his mother. But Nietzsche was not even two years old when his father passed away. At this time, the family moved once, and the mother became depressed and taciturn. Later, Nietzsche became taciturn, perhaps all influenced by this. When he was a child, he hardly made a sound all day long. He did not participate in intense competitive games. He silently thought about something by himself. When he grew up a little, he went to school. He was a good student in school and his character was very good, but he was not used to playing with his classmates. He loved poetry and music, and shut himself in a lonely house all day long. This kind of personality development became his loneliness when he grew up. He was lonely all his life, pondered and meditated all his life, and finally went mad and died.

Nietzsche's entire thought can be said to be a collection of contradictions: from writing to Schopenhauer to opposing Schopenhauer; from denying life to affirming life; from Hellenism to Romanism; from loving women to scolding women; from being madly in love with life to blindly believing in life; and finally reaching the extreme "superman" philosophy. This is the peak of his thought, but the reason why he erected such an all-out and transcendent doctrine was entirely caused by his strong opposition to Schopenhauer's pessimistic view of the world. The difference between him and Schopenhauer is that he used "work" and "struggle" as the criterion of life; Schopenhauer advocated "world-weariness" and "selflessness"; they both admitted that life is painful, but one advocated selflessly ignoring the pain, and the other believed that one should face the pain and overcome it with struggle and work. The former is Schopenhauer, and the latter is Nietzsche.

As for how Hitler used Nietzsche? This is because Nietzsche praised war, believing that war is a good medicine for an aging nation. He compared the aging of a nation to a person suffering from lung disease. It needs a cruel and sharp leaf to cure it, and this medicine is war. Thus, war also became a part of the philosophy of the superman, and was indulged by Hitler, becoming the culprit for the massacre of mankind. However, if Nietzsche knew in death, perhaps he would also condemn Hitler's rampant behavior? Because Nietzsche once said such a thing: "Everyone should judge others by his own reasons." Therefore, Nietzsche is not necessarily a thorough warmonger, and his words are worth savoring.

In short, from the teachings of history, we have determined that the most basic conditions for human survival are the inevitable existence of emotion and mutual assistance. This is the truth of all ages that cannot be obtained without labor. Therefore, Nietzsche's search is abandoned by us. Now let us look at Nietzsche from another aspect. After 1875, when Nietzsche was thirty years old, his health deteriorated greatly. Weakness and mental and physical loneliness and pain began from then until he was close to madness and death (died at the age of fifty-six). But he still held the pen tightly and wrote out his profound thoughts. His strong and unyielding will enabled him to still think and create while lying in bed. His love of life and the eternally burning fire of his spirit made him immortal. From this scene, we see Nietzsche, and we will see infinite vitality, so that our own humble and shrinking souls are invigorated and our courage to live is enhanced! This is the main spirit of Lu Xun and Jacob Burckhardt's evaluation of Nietzsche. When I despise Nietzsche's doctrine, whether this spirit, the sharpness of its vigor, is worth learning and emulating, I think readers will understand.

Finally, let me quote Havelock Ellis's words as the end of this article: "If we look back at the end of the 19th century and the 30 years before and after, we can know that the trend of thought in that era was completely dominated by two people with completely opposite consciousness and ideals: Tolstoy and Nietzsche. Tolstoy represents the Christian socialist and humanitarian ideals, which are even more excessive than Christian doctrine. Nietzsche represents the rationalist, heretical, and individualist ideals, which are also excessive compared with ordinary rationalism. They are all artists who have completed themselves in their own ways, keen psychologists, forwarders who are struggling on the path of life, and workers who are selflessly and painstakingly seeking something."

These words can be said to be pertinent, and I hope that everyone will read Nietzsche's Biography with a calm eye.

### "The Anchor" is Back!

— Shilang

In the Sino-Japanese Naval War of 1894, the Beiyang Navy, known as the Chinese pillar, suffered two defeats in the Yellow Sea and Weihaiwei, with the entire army annihilated.

Among them, my Far East's largest flagship, the "Zhenyuan," was captured by Japan. The two large iron anchors on the Zhenyuan ship have been displayed in Tokyo's Hibiya Park as war victory souvenirs of the Sino-Japanese War.

The warships that were sunk or destroyed by artillery fire in the two naval battles are not included in the calculation.

The "Anchor," which was labeled with the mark of "humiliation" and displayed in Japan, has been there for a full forty-three years. Now that the "Anchor" can return to the motherland in "triumph," how can we, as Chinese descendants, not sincerely rejoice!

But in historical significance, the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War can be explained by the corruption and incompetence of the Qing Dynasty, which explained the reasons for its inevitable defeat.

The reason why the navy at that time was completely defeated was not without reason. The so-called Beiyang Fleet, not only the tonnage, but even the power and the power of the artillery were far inferior to Japan. The sailors and soldiers rarely trained on weekdays. How could they not be completely annihilated when they faced the enemy in battle?

It is said that Empress Dowager Cixi misappropriated a large sum of public funds to add to the Summer Palace to celebrate her own birthday, but turned a blind eye to the funding for navy training. With such an Empress Dowager Cixi, who had no opinion and no vision, presiding over the government, how could she not allow the Japanese to be unscrupulous, occupy Korea, cede the Liaodong Peninsula, seize Taiwan and Penghu, and continue to attack Dalian and capture Lushun! Leaving the most shameful bloodstain in Chinese history.

Now, this "Anchor," which has been weathered and battered, has returned to the motherland with the glory of victory. The lessons she gives us are all worth pondering.

### Profile of Palestine

— Pu Lun

Editor's Note: Palestine has always been a land of contention and clamor, with Jews and Arabs unable to resolve their respective prejudices. Recently, a proposal was made to the Palestine Investigation Committee to have British troops withdraw from Palestine and form a democratic state jointly by Jews and Arabs. Now, let us briefly introduce this "Holy Land" of the world, so that everyone can have a concise outline.

When a modern traveler journeys to the ancient land of Palestine, the relics recorded in the Bible vividly unfold before his eyes, page by page. In every corner he visits, these relics have faded with time. He will be amazed to find that places like Hebron have lost their names in time, for that place was the city ruled by King David; similarly, he will also be amazed to find Bethlehem, the city where Jesus was born in a manger. Also, in the area of Jericho, the city walls are in utter disrepair. And in these places, people live in stone houses or brick rooms, defending their descendants, working with crude tools, passing down through generations, eating leavened and unleavened bread, and then dying.

Since the Hebrew prophets, Jesus Christ, and his twelve disciples first established the great religious precepts of the world, this holy land has changed very little, although time has passed so long. From Phoenicia (now Lebanon) to Egypt, and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea and the Jordan River, the surrounding area totals 10,000 square miles, equivalent to the size of Maryland. In terms of topography, it can be divided into three parts: the coastal plain, which runs parallel to the sea, includes ancient Philistia and Sharon, and is the most abundant grain-producing area in the Middle East. The central part is a mountainous region, which includes historical centers such as Bethlehem, Hebron, and Jerusalem. Another part is the Dead Sea and the Jordan River. Although Palestine has a large sandy desert, it has become a prosperous place through skillful management.

Initially, the ancient Hebrews were a nomadic people. They lived in "wool houses," which meant relying on wool for protection. The Apostle Paul was the most famous preacher of the Bible. His hometown, Tarsus, still retains the custom of wearing woolen sweaters; because Paul learned to weave wool as a child. Several cities in the Holy Land remain intact to this day. In other places in the Bible, archaeologists have not yet discovered them, but they continue to excavate. Each of the discovered cities, covering an area of six to ten acres, has been built into a solid defense. Outside each city, there are several affiliated small towns. The people living in the lowlands, as recorded in the Old Testament, lived in mud-brick houses and led a laborious and arduous life. Those living in the highlands lived in stone houses and lived a relatively better life.

The stories of biblical Palestine are permeated with inherited customs and mixed with legends and events. From the time when Abraham, the ancestor of the Jewish nation, led his people away from Ur of the Chaldees near the Persian Gulf, until the time of Jesus, Palestine was a prosperous province of Rome; and now, two thousand years have passed. But Palestine has changed many rulers: Egyptians, Syrians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Romans. By the seventeenth century, Arabs made up the largest number of people in Palestine. Every ruler who came to this place burned temples and brought their own religion and culture.

But the green mountains still remain in this historical land of the Bible.

### Implementing the High School Subject System

— Yang Pingzhang

For the sake of countless middle school students' futures and their precious time, I cannot help but shout out this slogan—implement the high school subject system—to plead for them.

Judging from the economic capabilities of ordinary people today, most are preparing to work after graduating from middle school, and not many can enter university. However, most middle school graduates, after leaving school, cannot find suitable work; the reasons are of course many, but the main one is that the knowledge they have gained in school is incompatible with the reality of society. In other words, the school's curriculum cannot be rationally aligned with the needs of society.

I believe that in six years of elementary school education, ordinary knowledge has already been acquired to some extent, and with the addition of three years of junior high school education, more advanced general knowledge is obtained; therefore, in high school, one can indeed enter a specialized path, that is, subject specialization, allowing them to choose a subject to specialize in according to their interests. This will allow them to concentrate on the subjects they choose. In this way, not only is it unnecessary to force students to study subjects they do not like, but it can also shorten the learning process. For example, those who want to achieve something in literature in the future do not seem to need to study too much mathematics and physics; those preparing to study electrical engineering can also spend most of their time on mathematics and physics related to that subject. In the learning process, the goal is to understand everything thoroughly, without any confusion. If they study hard during these three years, the results will certainly be remarkable.

This is a rather serious educational problem, especially in our country, which is in need of young people. We must reform the unreasonable educational system to cultivate talents. I hope that those who care about education will pay special attention to this issue, express their opinions more often, and guide the old middle school system onto a new path!

### Political Changes in Xinjiang

— Zhao Ji

During the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Xinjiang was divided into two regions: the Southern Route of the Tianshan Mountains and the Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. The Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains was further divided into four parts: the Khoshut, the Dzungar, the Derbet, and the Torghut. Among them, the Dzungar tribe was the strongest. In the twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing dynasty, Galdan, the Khan of the Dzungars, conquered the Khoshut tribe, unified the Oirat tribes, and occupied most of the Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. After Galdan's death, his nephew, Tsewang Arabtan, succeeded him and surrendered to the Qing court. However, the Dzungar tribe was fickle and repeatedly sent troops to invade other tribes, but they were always pacified by the Qing court. Although the Dzungar tribe declined later, the Khoit tribe, a subordinate of the Derbet, rose up and occupied the entire Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. Emperor Gaozong of the Qing dynasty ordered Zhao Hui to lead troops to attack and unify the Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. The Qing court then sent troops to garrison in Yili, Urumqi, and Tarbahatai, and the General of Yili governed the area.

The Southern Route of the Tianshan Mountains has always been occupied by the Hui people. In the early Qing dynasty, the Islam of the Southern Route was divided into two factions: the White Mountain Sect and the Black Mountain Sect. The two factions were irreconcilable and attacked each other. At this time, the Khan of the Dzungars was Galdan, who helped the White Mountain Sect and destroyed the Black Mountain Sect, and the Dzungars governed the area. However, when Tsewang was the leader of the Dzungar tribe, he rejected the White Mountain Sect and replaced it with the Black Mountain Sect. He also captured the two sons of the leader of the White Mountain Sect, the Elder Khoja and the Younger Khoja. Later, Amursana, the leader of the Khoit tribe, wanted to obtain the support of the four tribes, so he released the Elder Khoja and lent him troops to stabilize the Southern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. In the twenty-second year of the reign of Emperor Qianlong, the Qing army pacified the Khoit tribe, so the Elder and Younger Khojas became independent in Kashgar. The Qing court sent Zhao Hui and Fude to suppress them.

In the first year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi, the Hui people in the Southern Route rebelled. Khoja Buzurg, the son of Zhang Ge'er, a Hui chieftain, led the soldiers of Kokand from Mongolia to invade. Yaqub Beg Pasha, a general of Kokand, occupied the Northern and Southern Routes of the Tianshan Mountains. At this time, Pasha's power was very strong, and some Qing officials even suggested abandoning the Northern and Southern Routes of the Tianshan Mountains. Zuo Zongtang insisted that they should not be abandoned. In the first year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, Zuo Zongtang led troops to attack, and the area was pacified in the fourth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu. In the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, the Northern and Southern Routes of the Tianshan Mountains were merged into one Xinjiang Province.

### Wen Tianxiang's Righteous Death

— Ji Ming

The Grand Historian said: "The brave do not necessarily die for righteousness, and even ordinary people can be encouraged by admiration for righteousness." She Manshu also said: "It is easy to die generously, but it is difficult to die calmly for righteousness." Therefore, it is known that Wen Tianxiang's ultimate loyalty in Yanjing was even more difficult than that of loyal ministers and martyrs throughout history. Why? Because when Tianxiang was executed, the Southern Song Dynasty had been destroyed for a long time. The Yuan Prime Minister Boyan persuaded him, saying: "Now the world has returned to our dynasty, the country is at peace, and people have forgotten the Song Dynasty. Even if you die calmly for righteousness, future generations may not know." The young emperor also persuaded him, saying: "Your loyalty to the Song Dynasty is known to the world, but the fate of the country cannot be reversed. Why not submit and face north, and jointly seek wealth and honor?" For Tianxiang, at this time, a moment of hesitation could have led him to become a continuation of a second minister. However, he was finally able to suppress himself and achieve a positive result, relying on the "righteous spirit" in his heart.

The History of Yuan records that on the day Tianxiang was executed, Yanjing was covered in wind and sand, and nothing could be seen within a few feet. Later, his posthumous writings were found in his belt, which read: "Confucius said, 'Achieve benevolence'; Mencius said, 'Take righteousness.' Only with righteousness can benevolence be achieved. Reading the books of sages and worthies, what have I learned? From now on, I can be almost without shame." These thirty-two characters still have vitality today. Wang Pan, a scholar at the time (who served the Yuan Dynasty after the fall of the Song Dynasty), wrote a poem mourning him, saying: "The Great Yuan did not kill Minister Wen, both loyalty and righteousness were obtained. His righteousness was like when King Han sealed his teeth, and his loyalty was like when the Shu general beheaded Yan Shi. ×××××××, ×××××××, I am afraid that the historians will not write it down, so the old man writes a new poem with tears." Wang was originally a second minister, and he could not help but feel moved when he saw Tianxiang's death. This shows that justice is in the hearts of the people, regardless of whether it is recorded in history.

### Four Knows

— Chen Dexin

Yang Zhen of the Han Dynasty served as the Inspector of Jingzhou and recommended Wang Mi to be the Magistrate of a county. At night, Mi visited Zhen and presented him with ten catties of gold as a thank you gift. Zhen was furious and said, "An old friend knows you, but why don't you know your old friend?" Mi said, "No one knows at night." Zhen said, "Heaven knows, the gods know, I know, and you know. What do you mean by 'no one knows'?" Mi left in shame.

If the officials of today's officialdom could all have Zhen's noble character and integrity, then the stability of the country and the prosperity of society would be readily achievable.

### American Miscellany

— Xu Shu

The Broadcasting Industry in America

In America, broadcasting has become a large educational and commercial enterprise. The broadcasting industry comes with radio. Many American broadcasting companies broadcast twenty-four hours a day. On average, each town has three to four broadcasting companies broadcasting, so a five-tube radio can receive at least a hundred stations, which depends entirely on the frequency. When I lived in Texas, I could receive stations from Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, but not programs from New York and Washington. Chinese and London programs rebroadcasted from San Francisco can also be received. American broadcasting programs in the morning are mostly about religion and current affairs, in the afternoon about current affairs and records, and in the evening are special programs. There are singing programs sponsored by tobacco companies, and Hollywood stars' comedies, among which the crosstalk of female star Ann Southern and male star Bob Hope is especially wonderful. Almost every sentence is funny, and sometimes it can really make you laugh until your stomach hurts. The scripts are all written in advance by experts and read on the spot. Some novels are also adapted for broadcast on the radio. Many Hollywood film scripts are transformed from radio scripts. Sports news also has a large audience, because American games are mostly held at night, and temporary broadcasting stations are set up in the stadiums. Many American universities also have broadcasting courses. From this point, we can see why the American broadcasting industry is so developed and does not fall into the lower class. Broadcasters are mostly specially trained experts. For example, current affairs commentaries are always given by experts on international issues. Many newspaper editorial writers are recruited by broadcasting companies to work as broadcasters. University broadcasting courses, in addition to experts in pronunciation and teaching techniques, also have a complete set of broadcasting equipment. Each student must practice on the spot, and the professors and classmates become his audience. Movie stars regard broadcasting as a way to make money, because the remuneration for filming is calculated per film or per week, while broadcasting companies calculate per show, and the time spent is very short, only about fifteen minutes. They are not as intimate and interesting on the screen as they are on the radio. Broadcasting has the power to attract listeners to become moviegoers, so movie stars often use broadcasting to promote themselves. Everyone admits that Bob Hope can't act at all, he just fools around, but he has a large audience, which is actually his radio audience. Chinese universities should quickly set up broadcasting courses to cultivate high-quality broadcasting talents, so that there will be no terms such as "chu na" on the radio. (Twenty-one)

Scientific Essay

### Epiphyllum (Part 2)

— Jia Zuzhang

Our interest in the Epiphyllum is because we all know the idiom "昙花一现" (tán huā yī xiàn), which means "epiphyllum blooms once," referring to something that is rare and fleeting. Epiphyllum is a simplified name, its full name is called 優曇缽華 (yōu tán bō huá) or 優曇華 (yōu tán huá), found in the Lotus Sutra: "The Buddha told Sariputra, such wonderful Dharma, is like the 優曇缽華 (udumbara flower), appearing once in a while." This so-called "once" not only refers to the extremely short time it blooms, but also refers to its rarity to bloom, "appearing once in a while" means "blooming occasionally." Therefore, the History of the Southern Dynasties says: "The udumbara flower is a Buddha's auspicious sign, appearing once every three thousand years, and when it appears, the Golden Wheel King is born."

The Lotus Sutra does not specify the form of the Epiphyllum. It is not easy to investigate what kind of plant it is. According to what is said in the General Records: "The udumbara grows in Zhaoqing Prefecture, with no flowers but fruit," then it belongs to the fig genus. The Dictionary of Chinese Terms follows this statement: "Udumbara is the name of a flower in Sanskrit, also known as 優曇缽華 (udumbara flower), and belongs to the fig genus. It is produced in the foothills of the Himalayas and the Deccan Plateau, Sri Lanka, etc. The trunk is more than ten feet high, and the leaves are of two kinds, one smooth and one rough, both four or five inches long, with pointed ends. The flowers are dioecious, very small, and hidden in the 　-shaped concave receptacle. The receptacle is as large as a fist or a thumb, with more than ten leaves, edible but of poor taste." If this statement is true, then the Epiphyllum also blooms every year, just because it is a 　 head inflorescence, the ancient Indians could not observe it. According to the Biography of the Persian Kingdom in the Book of Liang, "In December, there is the 優鉢曇花 (upala flower), which is fresh and lovely." That is a plant with beautiful flowers, which is completely different from what is said in Yitongyun. The Yunnan Records follows this statement, saying: "The 優曇花 (udumbara flower) is located on a stone in Cao Creek Temple, ten miles northwest of Anning Prefecture, shaped like a lotus, with twelve petals. There is one more in a leap month. It is white and fragrant. It was planted from the Western Regions and is also a species of the Sala flower. Later, it was cut down due to war, and there was no longer that species. Now, a branch suddenly sprouts from the root, and it is already as big as an embrace." The same book also has records of the He Mountain Flower and the Sala Flower, which seem to refer to the same plant:

"The He Mountain Flower tree is six or seven feet high, its texture is similar to osmanthus, its flowers are white, each with twelve petals, corresponding to the twelve months, and there is always one more petal in a leap year. It is popularly believed to be a species left by immortals, at the foot of He Mountain in Shangguan, Dali Prefecture, and the locals named the place after it."

"The Sala flower is in the Local God Temple in the provincial capital. Its stem is similar to the He Mountain Flower in Dali Prefecture. The Buddha blooms vigorously, its color is white, slightly yellow. The strange fragrance is fragrant, not the smelly taste of ordinary flowers. A stamen protrudes from the center, like a millet spike, hanging out of the petal, each with twelve braids, always one more petal in a leap year. It is said that a high monk put two rosary beads into the soil, and one bead came out of this tree." From the textual research of these three texts, it is a magnolia family plant. The Japanese once regarded the American-native American magnolia as the auspicious flower, which is a mistake. Because it should be a plant native to China or India.

There is also a saying that the 　 flower is also called 優　羅花 (upala flower), probably a different transliteration. Cen Shen has a song of the 優缽羅花 (upala flower), which explains its origin and form, but refers to another kind of herbaceous cabinet: "Shen once talked about Buddhist scriptures and heard of the 優缽羅花 (upala flower), which he had not seen with his own eyes. In the year of Gengshen in the Tianbao era, Shen was honored to be the prefectural judge of Dali and took charge of the censor's Yushi, leading the deputy envoy of the Northwest Court's branch. Since I had plenty of time in office, I planted trees and medicinal herbs in the mansion court, made mountains and ponds, and wandered among them, enough to send pride to Jiaohe. A small official offered this flower, saying that he got it from the south of the Tianshan Mountains, its shape is different from all grasses, its momentum is like a crown, and it rises sharply, not extending to the sides, the flowers are folded in the middle, and the leaves are wrapped outside, the strange fragrance rises in the wind, and the beautiful color matches the scenery. The green stems and green leaves are beautiful in color, □ leaves six petals, flowers nine rooms, night closed, early opening, more strange fragrance." The Chengyuan Sketches compiled by Wu Changyuan of the Qing Dynasty also mentions 優　羅 (upala), saying: It blooms on April 8th, and bears fruit in winter, like a ghost building a peng, shedding its clothes, very similar to a golden Buddha statue. The etiquette system of the Li Yi Zhi Si used to have this flower, but now it is gone." This is based on the assumptions of "Golden Wheel King is born" and "Buddha blooms vigorously," which are extremely unreliable.

Combining the above old records, there are three types of plants that can be called Epiphyllum: one is a type of fig, one is a type of magnolia, and one is a herbaceous flower of an unknown type. But none of these three types of plants are the cactus plants we see today. To recognize the cactus plants we see today as Epiphyllum, there are no old records to verify, it must be a very recent matter.

To determine what the original Epiphyllum plant was, the most appropriate way is to directly visit India to seek it. I wonder if Sanskrit scholars have seen any more detailed records about the Epiphyllum?
