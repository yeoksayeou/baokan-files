[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The rumor that the government will issue a general amnesty on New Year's Day of the 37th year of the Republic, reducing the sentences of traitors and allowing bail, has been circulating. According to authoritative sources in the judicial circles here, this news is not yet a fact.

The proposal was submitted by Zhang Lisheng, Yang Yongjun, Jiang Yuntian, Xu Shiying, and others, with the reason being: "Please expand the scope of the Victory Amnesty, supplement it with an order, to show extraordinary grace and aim for self-renewal." The Executive Yuan decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for study. The Ministry is currently considering it and may submit it at the Executive Yuan meeting next week. However, according to authoritative sources, the proposal has too many drawbacks, and the Ministry is unlikely to agree, so the expansion of the scope of the general amnesty is unlikely to be implemented.

### State Council Passes Important Cases; Election of Supervisors and Legislators Postponed; Provisional Councils Should Be Established in Provinces and Cities of Pacification Zones

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The election dates for legislators and supervisors have been postponed due to various practical difficulties. This was approved by the State Council meeting held on the morning of the 28th. Both cases were submitted by the Chairman for discussion. Regarding the election of supervisors, the Chairman received letters from Zeng Qi of the Youth Party and Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party. The election date for supervisors was scheduled from November 16th to December 10th. Although the Legislative Yuan passed the method for the participation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties in the provincial councils, the list of names has not yet been formally submitted, and the number of supervisors has not been decided through consultations between the three parties. How to coordinate in the future will require considerable time for agreement, so please postpone the election date for supervisors from December 16th to January 10th of the 37th year of the Republic to complete the joint constitutional implementation of the three parties. The meeting believed that the first Supervisory Yuan would be convened by the President after the closing of the National Assembly, and the postponement of the election date for supervisors would not hinder the facts, so it was approved. Regarding the election procedures for legislators, the original registration period for candidates was 30 days, from October 22nd to November 20th of this year. On November 21st, the election authorities would handle the review and public announcement of candidates. According to Article 14 of the Implementing Regulations of the Legislator Election and Recall Law, the list of candidates nominated by political parties should be submitted to the Election Headquarters and forwarded to the election authorities before the candidate registration begins. The Election Headquarters stated that the deadline for the public announcement of candidates has passed, and the list of candidates nominated by various parties has not yet been sent. If it is sent now, after being forwarded to the provincial election offices, there are still procedures such as registration, public announcement, printing ballots, and forwarding them to counties and cities. The date for voting (December 21st to 23rd) is very close, and it is impossible to complete the procedures in time. If the candidates who are nominated are allowed to be announced, printed, and elected, then the candidates nominated by various political parties will not be able to participate in the election. This is a major matter, so the Election Headquarters requested that the voting date for the legislator election be postponed by one month, as was done for the election of National Assembly delegates, while the candidate registration deadline would not be changed. This was approved.

[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 28th dispatch] The supervisory committee members of Yu Province were elected at the provincial council at 9:00 a.m. on the 28th. Guo Zhongchen, Li Mingzhong, Liu Yantao, Yu Zhenzhou, and Zheng Xiaolan (female) were elected.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The case for the establishment of provisional councils in provinces and cities of pacification zones that have not yet established them was approved by the State Council meeting on the morning of the 28th. The case was submitted by Mo Dehui, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen, Zhang Ji, Wang Yunwu, and two other people, requesting the establishment of temporary parliamentary councils in the provinces and cities of the pacification zone in order to show respect for public opinion and strengthen the recovery of people's hearts. The purpose was to establish the provisional councils of the eight northeastern provinces. The original proposal stated: "The councils of all provinces and cities across the country have been established one after another, but the councils of the provinces and cities of the Pacification Zone are still lacking. Now, during a time of chaos, the mobilization of manpower and material resources depends on the local people and public opinion organs, which is extremely important. Temporary councils should be established in the temporary locations of the provincial and municipal governments, similar to the temporary councils established in the provinces during the War of Resistance, to assist the government in promoting recovery work. Furthermore, with the upcoming re-election of supervisors, it is even more necessary to quickly establish provincial and municipal councils to strengthen the implementation of constitutional government." The generation of councilors should adopt the method of selection, to expedite. It was proposed at the State Council meeting on the 28th, after a brief discussion, it was approved.

### National Government Orders Supplementary Regulations to Support Candidates of Political Parties

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] Supplementary election regulations to ensure the regular election of candidates nominated by political parties were submitted for discussion at the State Council meeting on the morning of the 28th. The case was submitted by Zou Lu and nine other people because, as a result of the National Assembly elections, some party members who were not nominated by the parties were nominated by joint signatures and participated in the elections. The number of nominated and fewer candidates of political parties was greatly reduced. Zou and others proposed the enactment of two supplementary articles to show restrictions, which were approved. It is stipulated in the regulations that all party members who are nominated by joint signatures are invalid. The method of joint signature nomination is only limited to non-partisan social elites participating in the election. These provisions will be officially announced soon, and all legislators and National Assembly representatives, regardless of whether they have been nominated or elected, are subject to these regulations. Nominations that have been made are invalid, and those who have been elected will also have their elected qualifications canceled.

### Signing of International Agreements; Executive Yuan May Approve First, Then Complete Legislative Procedures; The Proposal to Adjust Postage Fees Independently Was Rejected

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The State Council discussed two important cases on the morning of the 28th, both related to the expansion of the powers of the Executive Yuan. One was that the conclusion of international agreements, which must be implemented through legislative procedures first, according to law. In order to facilitate rapid implementation, the Executive Yuan intends to request that in the future, when concluding international agreements, the Executive Yuan may first approve and sign them, and then complete legislative procedures. If any impropriety is found when the agreement is submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative formalities, the Executive Yuan may be informed to negotiate amendments. This case was approved. The other case was that the increase in postage fees should be amended by the Legislative Yuan by amending the Postal Law. The Executive Yuan intends to request that it be approved by the Executive Yuan to independently decide on adjustments based on factual needs, without the need to first discuss it by the Legislative Yuan. This case was rejected. During the discussion, Xu Chuanlin, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, strongly opposed it. He said: "This matter concerns the burden of the people of the whole country and must be discussed by the Legislative Yuan." It is reported that the case had been rejected when it was previously submitted to the Legislative Yuan.

### Losses of Mines and Minerals in the Northeast: Our Country Has Not Filed a Complaint with the United Nations

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Yeh Kung-chao, recently denied a Reuters report from Nanjing which stated: "According to diplomatic circles, our government will have Ambassador Gu Weijun file a complaint with the United Nations regarding the Soviet Union's removal of mining and industrial equipment from the Northeast."

It is understood that our government's current focus and efforts are directed towards the early convening of a peace conference with Japan.

However, there is no doubt that our country will eventually receive compensation for the enormous losses in the Northeast.

### The Soviet Union Proposes a Special Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers in China: Responding to Our Country's Proposal for a Japanese Peace Conference

[United Press, London, 28th] Radio Moscow broadcast on the 28th that Foreign Minister Molotov has responded to China's previous proposal, which compromised between the American and Soviet positions on the procedures for a Japanese peace treaty. He proposed holding a special meeting of the four foreign ministers in January next year to discuss preparations for the Japanese peace treaty. The Soviet Union also suggested that the meeting be held in China. The dispatch added that Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Feitelenko, has submitted the reply to China. (Continued on page 2, column 1)

[Central News Agency, London, 27th, United Press] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov declared at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 27th that a peace treaty with Japan is as important as a peace treaty with Germany in order to guarantee world peace. This was the first time Mr. Molotov mentioned the issue of Japan at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is believed that the current conference will not formally consider Far Eastern issues because the conference was originally scheduled to discuss only European issues.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After news of Mr. Molotov mentioning how the Japanese peace treaty should be conducted at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in London reached here, concerned parties stated: "This may be just a casual remark made by Mr. Molotov after a general discussion of world affairs. If a discussion on the Japanese peace treaty were to take place in any setting without China's participation, it would be difficult to obtain our approval. They believe that Mr. Molotov and the other three foreign ministers would not take futile actions.

### We Have Not Yet Expressed Our Attitude; the United States and Britain Will Reject It

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Regarding the Soviet government's proposal to hold a special meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in China in January next year to prepare for the Japanese peace treaty, a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared on the evening of the 20th: "The Ministry has not yet received detailed information about this proposal and cannot immediately express its position. However, we have no objection to the location of the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace conference. What we are requesting is that the formal peace conference should be held in our country." It seems that this new Soviet proposal is not significantly different from its previously stated and insisted position, which advocates that the Council of Foreign Ministers handle the preparatory issues for the Japanese peace treaty. However, it is a big question whether this can resolve the current stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union. As for whether the Soviet Union is indirectly rejecting our country's compromise proposal of the 17th regarding convening a preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace conference through this proposal, it will further increase the difficulty in resolving the stalemate.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The United States has expressed a cool attitude towards the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a special meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in China in January next year. The US diplomatic authorities believe that this is the Soviet Union reverting to its old ways, trying to have the major powers monopolize the Pacific peace treaty, just like monopolizing the German peace treaty. The United States originally wanted the eleven countries that actively fought against Japan to jointly draft the Japanese peace treaty. The Soviet Union did not agree and proposed a scheme presided over by the major powers, which the United States rejected in September.

[United Press, London, 28th] External sources say that Britain plans to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers in China in January next year to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. They say that the note from the Soviet Union proposing the meeting has not yet been received here, but the Soviet Union's proposal is clearly contrary to Britain's views on the procedures for the Japanese peace conference. Officials at the Foreign Office say that the Potsdam Agreement established the Council of Foreign Ministers and clearly restricted it. The British Foreign Office is studying China's proposal to start the Japanese peace treaty discussion in the Far Eastern Commission, and will discuss it with the various Dominions.

Since the US Congress convened a special session to discuss aid to Europe and aid to China, the attention of the US government and public has been focused on the issue of aid to China. In addition to various US newspapers writing articles commenting on the issue of aid to China, Republican leaders Vandenberg, Dewey, Martin, and Judd have also successively delivered public speeches, all advocating that the United States should immediately provide comprehensive assistance to China. Among them, Dewey's six proposals for aid to China, delivered at Columbia University on the 24th, are particularly noteworthy. These six concrete proposals are: 1. Allocate $75 million to $100 million for emergency aid to China; 2. Provide $250 million annually in aid to China for a period of three or four years; 3. Provide additional small loans to purchase military equipment and other military supplies from the United States; 4. Immediately provide all surplus materials in the US Pacific region for the use of the Chinese National Army; 5. The United States should immediately send military personnel to China to serve as technical advisors to the Chinese Army; 6. Appoint "personnel" to manage aid to China. The selection of these personnel must not only have a thorough understanding of the actual situation in China but also have extensive training in politics, economics, and society.

The six proposals of the Governor of New York are not only unanimously welcomed by the government and the public in our country, but also have generated a positive response in American public opinion. For example, Brian Doherty, Chairman of the Fundraising Campaign Committee of the United China Relief, also expressed his strong support, pointing out that China's population is larger than that of Europe, and the suffering from the war is even deeper than that of the European people. Therefore, China's need for American aid is even more urgent than that of the European countries. The New York Times, which has always advocated aid to Europe first, also attaches great importance to Dewey's speech. In addition to publishing the full text of his speech of 5,000 words at once, it also believes that Dewey's speech was drafted after consultation with Republican leaders. From this, it can be seen that Dewey's six proposals can be regarded as the China policy of the American Republican Party.

Since the war, the US foreign policy has "always adopted a bipartisan (Democratic and Republican) policy." Not only are Republican leaders often included in the US delegations attending international conferences, but the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, which have been implemented in Europe, have also been supported by the Republican Party. However, based on the current US Far East policy, no matter from which angle it is observed, there are still some differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Taking the Truman Doctrine as an example, it has been implemented in Europe, but it has not yet been extended to the Far East; taking the Marshall Plan as an example, the US government is currently focusing on the implementation of the aid to Europe plan, but it still feels not enthusiastic enough for the Far East. For example, the aid to China plan proposed by Marshall at the session of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the 11th of this month mainly consists of two points: 1. The United States will allocate $60 million to aid China before July 1 next year; 2. The United States will provide $20 million per month in aid to China from July 30 next year to July 1, 1949, for a total of $300 million. Even if we stand in the position of a third party, from the two perspectives of "timely" and "appropriate amount," we feel that Marshall's aid to China plan may not be effective. Because everyone believes that American aid to China is like a doctor's prescription, it must not only be timely, but also the dosage of the medicine must be "just right." If it is too late, the medicine will lose its effectiveness; if the amount is insufficient, it will be equal to zero. Therefore, to this day, the US government and the authorities should pay special attention to the opinions of Republican leaders on the issue of aid to China and find ways to coordinate and adopt a bipartisan policy towards China. Otherwise, by the next presidential election, the China policy will become campaign material for the Democratic and Republican parties. However, if we examine the opinions of American public opinion on the issue of aid to China, it is not difficult to prove that the American people today all want to maintain close wartime alliance with China and jointly maintain peace in the Pacific; and they all want to help suffering China to become a peaceful, unified, and strong China as soon as possible. Therefore, I predict that in the future, if the two parties use the issue of aid to China as campaign material, the Republican Party will surely gain the support of more voters, which is beyond doubt.

We only need to open a world map. China and the United States are separated by a Pacific Ocean. With the most modern transportation tools, it takes at least five days to travel back and forth once. The United States has never had territorial ambitions for China. Powerful proof can be found everywhere in modern history. However, China has a vast territory, abundant resources, a large population, and a long history of culture, which not only makes the United States extremely willing to be friends with China, but also makes the United States extremely eager to trade with China. Both countries stand on the basis of mutual benefit and equality and jointly promote economic and cultural cooperation between China and the United States. The slogan shouted by the United States in the era of the Boxer Protocol was "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity." At the Washington Conference, the United States asked the powers to respect China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence. During the War of Resistance, the United States further formed an alliance with China, working together to ensure the victory of the war. After the victory, the United States assisted our country in its recovery. Therefore, in recent years, the American side has added a new understanding, that is, recognizing the importance of China in the Far East. In other words, in the future, whether the United States is dealing with Japan or the Soviet Union, if it does not have China as an ally, then from a strategic point of view, the United States will find it difficult to reverse the situation and turn the disadvantage into an advantage. Therefore, the United States wants China to become a peaceful, unified, strong, and democratic country.

Therefore, we firmly believe that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall will not ignore the importance of China in the Far East and make a big mistake. Secretary of State Marshall is particularly enthusiastic about China. When he was ordered by President Truman to come to China to mediate, he made the greatest efforts for China's peaceful reunification. Although the mission was not completed, his enthusiasm is deeply imprinted on the hearts of our nation and will never be forgotten. His recently proposed aid to China plan seems too late in terms of timing and too light in terms of quantity. However, his concern for the situation in China and his willingness to help China achieve peaceful reunification have been consistent throughout. A few days ago, he sent a letter to a reporter from the Central Daily News, expressing his concern for the difficulties encountered by China and stating that his $300 million aid to China plan is only a preliminary step in aiding China. Therefore, we really have sufficient reasons to believe that although there is still a considerable distance between the American Democratic Party and the Republican Party on the issue of aid to China at present, with differences in urgency and importance, it is not difficult to coordinate and obtain a bipartisan policy towards China. It can be said that it is currently in the brewing stage.

### Content of the Soviet Proposal

(Continued from page 1) The full text of the Radio Moscow broadcast is as follows: "It is generally known that the four major powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union bear the main responsibility for the war against Japan. When the war was still in progress, an agreement on the issue of post-war peace conditions was clearly reached. The Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Declaration also reflect this point. Furthermore, according to the Potsdam Resolution, the issue of the Far East peace settlement is the responsibility of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and China should participate in this meeting. After the end of the war, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, with the participation of China, concluded an agreement in Moscow in December 1945, resolving that the four member states should participate in the Allied Control Council for Japan and deciding that the Far Eastern Commission in Washington should adopt the resolutions of the above-mentioned four-nation representative agreements. This point is also recognized by all countries in the special interests related to the post-war status of Japan."

"The various items of the procedure for the Japanese peace treaty proposed in your country's note are also based on the recognition of the above-mentioned four special interests. Your country's proposal indicates the adoption of the various decisions of the agreement on the Japanese peace treaty by the representatives of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. However, your country's note proposes convening a preliminary peace conference for Japan. There is no provision for this in the previous resolutions of the above-mentioned four countries, and it conflicts with the Potsdam Resolution establishing the Council of Foreign Ministers and hinders the restoration of peace in the Far East."

"Therefore, in order to restore peace in the Far East as soon as possible and to enable Japan and its people to enjoy the conditions for peaceful development, the Soviet government will convene a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in January 1948, with the participation of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, to discuss preparations for the Japanese peace treaty."

"If the Chinese government deems it necessary, the Soviet Union suggests that a special meeting be held in China. If your country can reply to this as soon as possible, I will be deeply grateful. If the Chinese government and the other two governments agree, I will also convey the same suggestion to the British and American governments so that preparations can be completed as soon as possible."

### The General Relief Administration's Water Transport Brigade Illegally Carries Commercial Goods; Shipping Industry in Fuzhou Calls for Sanctions

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th] The transportation boats belonging to the General Relief Administration's Water Transport Brigade have previously violated regulations by sailing to Fuzhou and loading commercial goods. Recently, another boat, the "Wan Heng," arrived from Shanghai empty to load commercial goods and transport them to Tianjin at a low price. Upon hearing the news, the shipping industry in Fuzhou expressed extreme dissatisfaction and sent telegrams to the Ministry of Communications, the Provincial Government, and the national shipping industry, calling for strict sanctions. It is said that according to the regulations of the Ministry of Communications, the transportation boats belonging to the General Relief Administration's Water Transport Brigade are only allowed to transport relief materials from Shanghai to various ports. However, for safety reasons, they can transport government agency materials as ballast when returning to Shanghai. The "Wan Gang," "Wan Xiang," and other boats belonging to the team have previously loaded a large number of commercial goods and returned to Shanghai, which was reported to the Ministry of Communications and expressly prohibited. Recently, the General Relief Administration was dissolved and the transportation work has also been suspended. The authorities are considering disbanding or selling the transportation boats belonging to the Water Transport Brigade to the shipping industry. The "Wan Heng" boat still disregards the prohibition and seizes the opportunity to arrive from Shanghai empty to load commercial goods for profit. Moreover, almost all of the crew members of the team's boats are foreign. This illegal action not only damages the interests of the shipping industry, but also undermines our country's shipping rights. It is hoped that the authorities will promptly impose effective sanctions.

### Huang Yuanbin Discusses US Aid to China: Assisting Our Currency Reform is a Matter of Utmost Urgency

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Mr. Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Economic Council, recently issued a statement on the issue of US aid to China, as follows: US aid to China is now gradually beginning. Including food relief and cotton loans, it includes the following items: Food relief: According to the Sino-American relief funds, US$30 million will be used to purchase food overseas. This batch of food will be distributed in major coastal cities after it is shipped to China, in order to stabilize prices. The proceeds from the sale will then be used to purchase food inland to provide relief to refugees. Cotton loan: US$70 million. The Marshall Plan originally allocated 300 million yuan for aid to China. The US House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved an interim aid package of US$60 million, which is intended as a supplement to the previous item for emergency relief.

Considering the overall aid to China issue, these four items of relief and assistance are quite small. However, with the initial start of aid to China, the integrated relief, loans, and assistance are being carried out simultaneously. While it is difficult to overcome our country's current economic and military crises, it will make a considerable contribution to temporarily stabilizing the economic situation. In the future, for import trade quotas, the government will not have to bear the foreign exchange burden for importing cotton, food, and other aid goods. It can expand the import quotas for essential raw materials and production equipment to meet the needs of domestic factories, which will gradually reduce smuggling. The demand in the black market for foreign exchange will also be greatly reduced, and it is hoped that it will suppress the prices in the foreign exchange black market. In addition, with a reasonable supply of materials, it is hoped that prices will also stabilize to a considerable extent.

However, with this initial action on the issue of US aid to China, in addition to military assistance, the most urgent matter is assistance in currency reform. If the currency problem is not resolved, the actual purchasing power of fiscal revenue will only continue to decrease, which will only exacerbate currency inflation. Furthermore, under the current economic pathologies, speculation in gold and US dollars and the hoarding of goods are unavoidable, and productive construction is out of the question. Furthermore, due to irrational foreign exchange rates, exports and remittances from overseas Chinese are not as smooth as they could be. Only by reforming the currency system can we change the people's confidence in the currency. Only then can the aforementioned pathologies be fundamentally eliminated. Whether currency reform is successful depends entirely on whether it can restore price levels to those before the War of Resistance. During the currency reform process, any factors that could hinder the restoration of pre-war price levels must be carefully eliminated. The fundamental problem lies in whether there is a substantial foreign exchange reserve. The government currently holds a foreign exchange reserve of US$400 million. If it can be supplemented with another US$500 million, it can start currency reform and achieve the aforementioned goals. However, this kind of credit is just credit. If it can be implemented in accordance with the currency reform plan approved by the Chairman and submitted to the Ministry of Finance, I guarantee that this credit will not be used within two years.

Mr. Huang also stated: I originally planned to go to Guangdong at the end of the month to inspect the economy of South China. However, because there are still some matters pending resolution, I am afraid that the trip to Guangdong will have to be postponed.

### Zhou Yide Speaks: The United States Should Provide Immediate and Substantial Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Congressman Zhou Yide declared today: If the Communist threat in China is not eliminated, the Marshall Plan for long-term aid to Europe will surely fail. If we do not provide immediate and substantial assistance, China will surely be controlled by the Communists. If this situation occurs, the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe will not be successful. The recovery of Britain and other countries in Western Europe depends on trade with the Far East. If the Soviet Union controls the Far East, European recovery will inevitably encounter obstacles. This theory is extremely simple. I completely oppose Secretary of State Marshall's policy toward China. This policy is that we should stop aid to China and wait for it to resolve the issue of the Communists on its own. However, the Communists are determined to control all of China and do not want to compromise with the National Government. If we do not help the National Government, the Communists cannot be defeated. US aid to China is less than aid to Europe. Once the Communist threat in China is eliminated, the Chinese economic structure is still sound, and financial assistance does not have to be very large.

### Principles for Establishing a German Central Government: Britain and the US Support Soviet Proposal; France Requests Establishment of a Border Commission

[Reuters, London, 28th] The four foreign ministers held their fourth meeting today. At yesterday's meeting, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Marshall simultaneously supported Bidault's request to establish two expert committees to review the eastern and western borders of Germany, as well as Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal regarding the future central government of Germany. Molotov was willing to discuss Bidault's proposal immediately. Although Bevin and Marshall supported the establishment of a German central government, they stated that the government must be based on a constitution that protects true democratic freedom. Bevin also strongly argued that if the nature of the government is not clearly defined, it could become a puppet government and ultimately lead to the danger of dictatorship again.

[Reuters, London, 27th] The third day of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has still made no progress. When French Foreign Minister Bidault requested the establishment of a German Border Commission, he expounded on the threat posed by Germany's overpopulation to the world. He argued that before discussing the German peace treaty, the German border must first be determined; otherwise, discussing the treaty in a state where the border has not been set is useless. He pointed out that resolutions must be made on two main issues at present: one is to stop the continued migration of people into Germany, and the other is to ensure the safety of Germany's neighbors and establish favorable conditions for their economic recovery. When referring to the Saar issue, Bidault explained that Germany's incorporation of the Saar into the French economic system was motivated by fulfilling the wishes of the local residents. Regarding the Ruhr and Rhine regions, because they are related to security, he will explain them in detail at the next meeting. Bidault then put forward two specific proposals: Regarding the border issue, land claims that are likely to reach an agreement in principle should be handed over to experts for study, and other land claims should be reviewed by representatives of the foreign ministers. Regarding the population issue, no further immigration should be allowed except for those already approved. The emigration of Germans should be decided in consultation with international organizations.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated that although the Soviet Union knew the importance of the border issue and France's intention to raise this issue at this time, it believed that the border issue should be part of the entire treaty and related issues. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is discussing the German peace treaty, not the establishment of a border commission. Molotov then put forward the Soviet delegation's proposal, saying that it was based on the previous agreement on the following three points: Organize a democratic government for all of Germany; Discuss the draft peace treaty with Germany at the conference; and Prepare basic instructions for the German peace treaty. The Soviet delegation made the following recommendations: Recognize that the establishment of a democratic government for all of Germany is in accordance with the Potsdam Conference resolution; Decide that the German government should state its views on the peace treaty when the German peace conference is convened; The German peace treaty should be signed by a German government and submitted to the German parliament for ratification; The countries participating in the German peace conference should be the five major powers of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, as well as Germany's neighboring allied countries, and allied countries that sent troops to participate in the war against Germany (Molotov listed a total of nineteen countries, including Albania but not including Iran and Pakistan); Recognize the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions as the basis for the German peace treaty.

### The US Concerned About the Situation in France: Marshall and Bidault Talk at Length; Foreign Ministers' Representatives Discuss the Issue of German Assets in Austria

[Report from our newspaper] London, 28th broadcast: The fourth meeting of the Foreign Ministers was held today. The chaotic situation created by the Communist parties in France and Italy may prevent the four foreign ministers from reaching any compromise. Marshall and Bidault held lengthy talks, listening to the French Foreign Minister's direct information on the pessimistic situation in France. The United States will take a tough stance on the German issue after confirming the true intentions of Communism, especially in France. Secretary Marshall told Bidault that the United States is willing to provide all possible assistance to France to prevent the rise of extreme forces, as the United States is dissatisfied with both the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction. However, Secretary Marshall may have informed Bidault that if the United States has to choose between the two, it would rather support de Gaulle than see France controlled by the Communist Party.

The troupe is composed mainly of Uyghur members. Two months ago, Zhang Zhizhong toured the area and saw the songs and dances performed by the Uyghur people in various places, which he believed could represent the local culture of Xinjiang. In order to promote understanding between the ethnic groups of Xinjiang and the Han Chinese, he selected dozens of the most outstanding song and dance talents from the north and south and hastily formed the visiting troupe one week before departure. Therefore, their performance in Nanjing was the first collective performance of Xinjiang's biggest song and dance stars. Most of them live more than 1,000 li from Dihua. Since hearing the news of forming a troupe to visit the interior, they have been extremely excited. They have rented out their houses, pawned their clothes, and exchanged them for money.

### Uyghur Flower Refuses Soviet Invitation to Perform

The Uyghur people have a very strong personality. The troupe members are all confident that their song and dance art is not below the level of world-class song and dance art. Therefore, they insist that if they are to perform in Shanghai, they will either not charge for tickets or the ticket prices must exceed those of Mei Lanfang. They are scheduled to give public performances at the Queen's Theatre for a week starting December 6th, and then select a plaza for a public performance with prices reduced as much as possible to make it accessible to the general public. Miss Kang Bola Han, a female actress of the troupe, is known as the "Uyghur Flower." The Soviet Union has repeatedly invited her to perform abroad, but she has refused. Critics in Nanjing believe that her singing and dancing skills are indeed unique and outstanding.

After the troupe arrives, they are scheduled to stay at the Youth Hostel on Huashan Road. During their stay in Shanghai, they will also use Shanghai as the backdrop to invite He Feiguang to write and direct a song and dance drama, which will be filmed by the Northwest Film Company as a souvenir.

However, the Fuel Group of the Price Evaluation Committee adjusted the price of kerosene at the 14th meeting, setting it at 3.2 million yuan per barrel of 53 gallons and 10,000 yuan per can retail, and implementing it from November 24. Now, the kerosene merchants have set their own price at 3,923,000 yuan per barrel. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau will take appropriate action.

### Customs Officers Colluding with Merchants in Fraud of 100 Million; Thirteen Perpetrators Apprehended and Under Interrogation; Relevant Import and Export Firm Voluntarily Suspends Business

The Ministry of National Defense recently received a confidential report from the highest authorities regarding the collusion of several middle-level officials of the Jianghai Customs with merchants in fraud amounting to 100 billion yuan. Chief Li was dispatched to Shanghai to investigate and confirm the report. On the 22nd, he, together with the Investigation Department of the Garrison Command, arrested the relevant perpetrators. As of the 26th, a total of thirteen people had been arrested. Chief Li returned to Beijing that night to report. The case may have major developments. It is learned that the thirteen perpetrators are currently detained in a certain place in the Nanshi area and are under interrogation. In addition to some who fraudulently claim to be customs officials, the rest are import and export merchants and "customs brokers." A person named Mao, the person in charge of a certain import and export firm located in the Citibank Building on Jiujiang Road, is one of the key perpetrators. Mao and several employees of the firm have been arrested, and the firm has therefore voluntarily suspended business.

[Report from Our Newspaper] With the arrival of winter, all sectors are very concerned about the safety of air travel.

### People's Food Allocation Committee Meeting Decides on Prices for Five Types of Rice

[Report from Our Newspaper] The People's Food Allocation Committee held its eighth committee meeting yesterday to discuss proposals. (1) The per capita allocation of oil, starting in November, is 10,000 yuan per catty, one catty for a large allocation and half a catty for a small allocation (the cost is about 16,000 yuan). (2) The Central Trust Bureau transported 2,700 metric tons of rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, equivalent to more than 34,000 market stones. Among them, No. 1 rice (5% broken rice) is about 7,300 stones, No. 2 rice (10% broken rice) is about 6,700 stones, No. 3 rice (15% broken rice) is about 3,000 stones, No. 4 rice (20% broken rice) is about 5,000 stones, and No. 5 rice (all broken rice) is about 12,000 stones.

### Unexpected Revenue for Relief Funds; A Wartime Sum in U.S. Dollars and British Pounds Available for Return by the British Bank at Any Time; Municipal Government Decides to Use it to Build Shelters

[Report from Our Newspaper] Amidst the emergency fundraising for winter relief funds in this city, the Municipal Government suddenly received an unexpected sum, which is quite considerable: US$8,850 and £308. The funds were deposited in the British-owned HSBC Bank in 1938. After the outbreak of war, refugees from various places flocked to Shanghai, and relief was urgently needed. Various charitable organizations in this city organized a committee to send refugees back to their hometowns and launched fundraising efforts, which were quite successful, but not all of the funds were used. The following year, the National Revolutionary Army withdrew, and the funds were deposited in HSBC Bank for safekeeping and have been there for ten years. As the winter relief funds have not yet been secured, the person in charge of HSBC Bank has fully informed Mayor Wu, stating that the funds can be returned to the Municipal Government at any time. After learning about this, Mayor Wu immediately invited Yan Huiqing, Wu Kaixian, Shen Zonglian, and others to form a five-person group to discuss the use of the funds. The group, with Yan Huiqing as the convener, decided to use the funds for winter relief. Secretary-General Shen of the Municipal Government told reporters yesterday that the Municipal Government has decided to use the funds to build a shelter of a larger scale, planning to build a shed capable of accommodating 300 people. All items such as cotton clothing, cotton quilts, shoes, hats, and meals will be provided free of charge. Those admitted must work every day, and wages will be paid accordingly. The daily wage has been decided to be 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per day so that they can accumulate a small amount of money, which can be used as a means of livelihood after the winter is over. Secretary-General Shen also hopes that it can become a social model, and hopes that various charitable organizations can follow suit and set up shelters separately, so that the winter relief problem in this city can be solved.

### Red Cross Society Raises Funds by Holding Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Paintings and Calligraphy

The works are displayed in two venues: the West Venue is held at the China Painting Academy on Chengdu Road, exhibiting more than 100 pieces of calligraphy and painting by painters of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The East Venue is held at the China Art Academy on the upper floor of the China Goods Company on Nanjing Road, exhibiting more than 200 pieces of calligraphy and painting by contemporary famous writers such as Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Qicai, Shen Yinmo, and Xu Shiqi. The exhibition will close on the third of next month.

### A Strike by Aristocrats: Jianghai Customs Firmly Rejects Demands of Pilots; Licenses Revoked and New Staff Recruited; Two Russians Apply for Jobs

[Report from our Newspaper] The strike by Jianghai Customs pilots over their rejected demand for increased pilotage fees remained unresolved yesterday. Customs authorities maintained a firm stance against the pilots' demands. The Harbour Master, Seibert, ordered the revocation of the striking pilots' licenses and forbade them from entering the Customs office. Two foreign pilots who were still sitting and waiting in the office yesterday morning were "persuaded" to leave by the port police.

Meanwhile, Customs issued a public notice recruiting pilots. Yesterday, two Russians, formerly employed by the U.S. military and then transferred to Customs before being dismissed at the end of May, called "C-Pilot," applied and have already begun working. One guided the Jebsen & Co.'s Max Kremer out of port, while the other guided the Gogol to a different berth. According to the pilots' office, five or six Chinese pilots also registered, but their qualifications are still under review.

### Demanding Actual Monthly Income of Approximately US$3,000

At the same time, the Maritime Administration has decided to do its utmost to assist in maintaining operations and will assign Chinese pilots to work within days. According to a Customs official, regardless of whether the striking pilots are permanently dismissed or reinstated, the entry and exit of foreign ships should continue as normal within a day or two.

The pilots' association has only 22 members, including two Chinese pilots. The association is tightly organized, making it extremely difficult for outsiders to join. Before the war, each membership quota was worth as much as US$3,000 to US$4,000. They perform an average of about 11 pilotage jobs per day. Forty-five percent of the income goes to the association for expenses, and the rest is divided equally among the 22 members, resulting in very high incomes. Pilotage fees are calculated based on the ship's draft and tonnage. According to pilotage fees for November, each pilot's actual monthly income is approximately 60 million yuan, of which 6 million yuan is specially authorized by our government to be exchanged for US$500 at the official rate of 12,000 yuan per US$1. Therefore, the pilots' strike is generally described as "a strike by aristocrats." According to the person in charge of the pilots' association, they have requested an additional amount from the Customs authorities that would amount to approximately US$3,000 per person per month in actual income.

### Current Income Exceeds That of England and America

Pilot salaries are very high in all ports around the world, but the current income of pilots in this city is already about a quarter higher than in ports such as London and New York.

It is reported that the two ships, the Gordon General and the Jefferson President, were delayed in Shanghai for a day due to the unresolved pilot strike issue, costing an additional US$9,000. Therefore, they were exported yesterday with water led by barges.

### Xinhua Trading Company Suspected of Illegally Obtaining Foreign Exchange; Datongxing Hoards Nearly 1,000 Reams of Paper

In addition to confiscating secret codes and account books on the spot, a check for 900 million yuan from Chen Dashou, an employee of Xieyuan Firm at 7 Yongan Lane, Yongan Street, who went to settle the payment, was also intercepted. However, the company's manager, Huang Shitian, has not returned from Hong Kong, so Yu Zhang, the person in charge of the import and export department, went to the bureau for questioning. The bureau also seized 992 reams of hoarded paper yesterday from Datongxing Paper Store at 5 Beijing West Road and its warehouse at 22 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road.

### Thief Spotted in Yue Opera Theatre; Red-Clad Woman Steals Ring

[Report from our Newspaper] At the evening performance at the Cathay Yue Opera Theatre on Tibet Road on the 26th, a middle-aged woman from Hangzhou surnamed Xiang bought a ticket and took a seat. She was wearing a seven-carat diamond ring on her hand, which was dazzling. Soon, a woman in red leading a four- or five-year-old girl sat next to her and struck up a conversation. Later, seeing that Ms. Xiang had taken off the diamond ring on her hand and put it in a red oval-shaped leather bag, which she placed next to her seat, the woman pretended to go outside to buy a ticket. Before leaving, she told Ms. Xiang to please take care of the child for her. About five minutes later, the woman returned to her seat and hurriedly took the child and left. Later, Ms. Xiang opened her bag to take out a cigarette to relieve her boredom and discovered that the ring was gone. She realized that it had been stolen by the woman and immediately reported it to the Xincheng Precinct for investigation.

### Visit to Xixi

Autumn is deep. Some colleagues in Hangzhou took a trip to Xixi. I took half a day off and joined this short trip. To go to Xixi, you need to take a bus from the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau to Liuxia first. Liuxia is where Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty intended to build a palace by the side of Xixi when he was forced to move south. Later, he found that Phoenix Mountain in ancient Lin'an (now Hangzhou) was even better. The Song Emperor then told his entourage: "Xixi should be left behind!" Hence the name. The current Liuxia is a town in Hangzhou County, where rice, tea, silkworms, persimmons, and reeds are produced.

Three Shi per Mu

I asked the locals and learned that this year's harvest is very good. One mu of land can yield three shi of grain. Usually, when milling grain into rice, it is halved. This year, the grains are larger and can be milled at a discount of 16%. Originally, the rent was one shi of grain, but in recent years, due to the 25% rent reduction, only three dou of rice need to be returned. Eleven workdays are spent on one mu of land, with each workday yielding five sheng of rice, totaling eight and a half dou, earning nine dou and five sheng, which is better than in previous years. There are many tourists in Hangzhou this year, and there is not enough tea to sell in the city. The tea in Liuxia has also improved with the trend. The persimmon production is also very good, the silkworm farming is not bad, and the reed grass is in harvest season.

Hiring a Boat to Go to Xixi

Hire a boat from Liuxia to go to Xixi. This type of boat is completely different from the yachts of Xuanwu Lake or West Lake, and the foot-rowing boats of Shaoxing. It is a small and exquisite flat-bottomed boat with a pointed bottom. With a little carelessness, it is easy to capsize. However, on this nearly 20-li stream, the boats coming and going are all these boats. Moreover, old ladies in their fifties and sixties, and little girls of eight or nine years old, are all calmly and leisurely rowing a small boat to Liuxia to go to the market.

Turning Dry Soil to Sow Bean Seeds

Following the stream, the banks are planted with mulberry and persimmon trees. Several farmers are stepping on waterwheels to fan water. It turns out that the weather has been clear for a long time, and water is needed to moisten the dry land so that it can be loosened to sow bean seeds. According to the boatman, "This year's vegetables and next year's soybeans may be affected."

Autumn Snow Temple, Lyricist Shrine

As the boat moves forward, the stream is lovably tender green. The boats rowing towards us are reflected in the stream. In the green waves, you can make out the girl rowing the boat with her white teeth and red lips. Clusters of thin bamboo and clumps of reeds, with reed flowers fluttering in the wind, are very beautiful. Twisting and turning, we arrive at the Autumn Snow Temple. We climb a few steps to the temple gate, which is always closed despite being there. We change direction and enter through the shrine of past lyricists. In the shrine, there are five altars for "Lyricists of Zhejiang," "Lyricists of Zhejiang Who Served as Officials," "Lyricists Who Lived Away from Home," "Lyricists of the Pavilion," and "Lyricists Beyond the World." Inspecting the temple, it is nothing more than four or five single-story houses. There is a two-story building. Climbing the building, we see the three characters "Fingertip Tower." Looking out from the railing, a piece of autumn snow is now in front of us. A gentle breeze blows, and the reed flowers dance in the air, just like catkins flying in the clear autumn.

Grass Worth 50,000

The monk told us, "If it is under the bright moon, and the wind is a little stronger, the reed flowers will be flying all over the sky, wandering aimlessly. It is truly a wonderful sight!"

These ten li of reeds are all born through wind pollination. The reeds can be used to make reed mats, weave baskets, or weave straw sandals with reed flowers. Wearing them in winter is as warm as spring. This type of reed grass does not require artificial cultivation, and each dan can be sold for about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Families with reed grass often make a lot of profit.

There is also Jiaolu Temple, deep in the reeds. The reed flowers and scenery of Xixi have been famous since the ancient Tang Dynasty. Unfortunately, most people only seek quick success and instant benefits, neglecting the place for purifying the mind and nourishing the nature. Therefore, Xixi appears desolate and deserted today.

Visiting Flower Dock, Appreciating Pine and Bamboo

We picked a few reed grasses and returned to Liuxia by boat, and then took a car back to Huawu. Huawu was also a place frequented by poets and writers in the past. The modern poet Xu Zhimo stayed here for a long time. There is a small mountain path paved with cobblestones. Climbing up the slope, the pine and bamboo are lush, and the mountains rise and fall. Houses appear on the left side of the road from time to time. Some of them are new-style buildings. Next to the bamboo forest is a house named "Youzhu Residence." Passing this, there is a small stream flowing down from the mountain, named "Liuxiang Stream." Unfortunately, it has been clear for a long time, and we cannot hear the sound of the stream. My fellow travelers Huang Hangtian and Shao Yue had originally visited Master ××× Lvfa. Today, we also visited the temple, but no one answered for a long time. We wandered around the side.

An Old Woman Tells Her Life Story

Later, a passerby told us that there was also a cloister-style structure next to the adjacent ××× Temple. So we knocked on the temple gate again, and an old maid opened the door to welcome us in. We saw an old lady holding prayer beads and chanting the Buddha's name. She told us, "The master next door has gone to Mount Fahua. Just sit here!" This old lady entertained us and poured out her life story to us.

It turned out that her surname was ×. She only had two daughters: the eldest daughter married the fourth young master of ×××, who was prominent in the early Republic of China. Unfortunately, the eldest daughter died young. The second daughter also married him.

Daughter Builds a Thatched Cottage for Filial Piety

The daughter was moved by filial piety, so she built several thatched cottages as a place for her mother to cultivate her nature. The fourth young master now has another wife outside and has children. Her daughter is living alone. It is said that the × family is now also in decline. In Shanghai, they don't even have their own house. For more than ten years, this young master has not paid attention to her daughter. Now, prices are high, and life is difficult to maintain. This old lady is already over seventy years old. She also told us that the cloister next door belongs to the × family of Shanghai. This × old lady has not been here for a long time. Mr. × has also died. She often cherishes the past glory. We are vigilant about the era like flying arrows! I never thought that in this idyllic and tranquil environment, there would be such a societal story of rise and fall, prosperity and decline. Yes, we love these natural landscapes today, not to live in seclusion and practice self-cultivation, but to make ourselves sober and not be contaminated by the vulgarity of greed, delusion, hypocrisy, and extravagance!

### Director of Suzhou Provincial Field and Grain Office Arrives in Changzhou to Expedite Grain Collection

[Report from Wujin, 27th] More than a month has passed since the collection of field tax in this county began, but the amount collected is still very small and has failed to meet the scheduled target. The reasons are: 1. Poor local security. 2. Personnel are separated from the local situation. 3. Last year, the government promised to pay the Yi Tu handlers the full amount of their bonuses, but not a penny was paid, which greatly disappointed the people. It is generally estimated that it will be very difficult to collect grain this year. He Yushu, Director of the Provincial Field and Grain Office, came to the county in person on the 28th with his secretary to expedite the collection. County Magistrate Weng visited the Field and Grain Office to inspect and inquired in detail about the various departments. He decided to leave Changzhou on the 27th.

### Red Worm Disease on Red Head Island; Lin Bingheng Sacrificed His Life, He Shuiquan Was Rescued After Being Chopped

[Special Dispatch from Taipei, 24th] A very tragic story happened not long ago on Red Head Island (now called Orchid Island), the easternmost outpost of our country, which was surveyed by scientists from this province. The director of the Meteorological Bureau's weather station contracted "red worm disease," and suffered from high fever and delirium. He chopped open the head of an employee in the station with a knife. As a result, the director died, and the employee was finally transported to Taipei for treatment.

Orchid Island (which some propaganda calls a "Paradise"), is inhabited by the Ami tribe, the second most uncivilized ethnic group in the world, and is also home to man-eating red worms and epidemics. When the Meteorological Bureau decided to restore the weather station here, which has strategic value for typhoon forecasting, Lin Bingheng, a 27-year-old youth from Fujian and the leader of the wind-measuring balloon section, was the first to agree to this mission and volunteered to go to this remote and desolate place. On May 31, Director Lin led his staff and the scientific survey team to the island. The original weather station was destroyed, leaving only a wind tower with all the doors and windows destroyed. Director Lin and the workers endured the wind and rain day and night in this tower, buried themselves in sorting things out. Within three months, they did not get a bit of warmth from the world. When they ran out of rice, they took off their clothes and exchanged them with the natives for taro to fill their stomachs. What they were covering with was forever damp quilts that could never dry. They wanted to repair the house, but they could not get money or buy materials. As a result, he fell ill from being bitten by red worms. Telegrams came like snowflakes, trying all kinds of methods, but they could not get even a minimum boat to rescue him. On September 15, the fever increased sharply. In the midst of anxiety, pain, and coma, he desperately chopped the station employee He Shuiquan with a knife, splitting his forehead, nose, and chest. When the knife was taken away by other employees in the station, he could not support himself and died quietly on the 16th. A promising young man who sacrificed everything for scientific work fell silently on this barren island. He Shuiquan was rescued after treatment, but left a deep scar on his face. Lin Bingheng's death is clearly seen in this scar. He died in a state of utter despair.

Orchid Island is also a national defense outpost. Ships sailing between Shanghai, the Philippines, and Hong Kong often dock here. They take many foreign goods ashore to please the primitive tribes, and gradually the natives look down on the Chinese and Chinese officials because the Chinese exchange clothes for taro with them. From this point of view, and for the protection of a scientific worker, we cannot forget its outpost status on the map of the Republic of China, even though the call for transportation and communication is so weak!

### Wuxi Security Team Mutiny Case: Four More Key Criminals Apprehended, Detailed Confessions of Abduction and Brutal Murder

[Our Newspaper Wuxi 27th Dispatch] On the night of the 28th of last month, a mutiny occurred in the 3rd Squad of the 3rd Company of the County Security Team stationed in Nanfangquan. Machine gunner Huang Shaohua, squad leader Lü Rongguang, and his wife and three members of their family were thrown into the lake and brutally murdered. Wu Jun, a key criminal, had already been apprehended and sentenced to death. A request for execution has been submitted to the higher authorities. On the 23rd of this month, the Criminal Police Team cracked down on a gambling case in Tonghanli, Beicangmen, and arrested more than ten gamblers. Among them were Zhang Guozhang (also known as Zhang Xiaohouzi) and Fu Hengsheng (also known as Lei Gensheng and Xiaogezi), who were criminals involved in the Security Team's mutiny plot. Zhang Guozhang confessed: "I am 32 years old, a resident of the city, and during the enemy puppet regime, I served as a soldier in the 21st Division of the puppet Subei Peace Army. On the 28th of last month, I was invited to Nanfangquan by fellow villagers Gao Dehong (also known as Gao Xiaofuzi), Fu Hengsheng, Lao Sichuan, Wu Jun, and others to join the Security Team as a soldier. Led by Security Team soldiers Shen Yousong, Wu Jun, and a person surnamed Chen, we mutinied, seized firearms, and took them to a boat on Taihu Lake, intending to become lake bandits. Squad leader Lü and his wife and daughter were pushed into the lake by Zhang Fengchi, Shen Yousong, Wu Jun, Gao Xiaofuzi, and others. Then, the boat was sailed to Yixing, transferred to Changzhou, gathered at Baijiaqiao, and then went to Fenshuidun for a meeting, intending to join the lake bandit Jin Asan's forces. Because we did not know anyone, we did not go. At that time, Shen Yousong gave each person a reward of 30,000 yuan. Currently, the person surnamed Chen has been killed in Fenshuidun, and Gao Dehong currently lives near the Sanxing Bathhouse on Weide Road in Shanghai." Fu Hengsheng confessed that he was a resident of the city, lived in Nancangmen, and during the enemy puppet regime, he specialized in robbery in the lake under Cheng Wanjun. He currently makes a living selling rice cakes. He was summoned to the countryside by Gao Dehong and set off that night, boarding two boats. One boat was headed by Gao Dehong, and the other was headed by Shen Yousong." After the team obtained the confessions, they immediately dispatched personnel to Shanghai to investigate and arrest Gao Dehong, who was captured and escorted to Wuxi. On the 27th, he was transferred to the county government for interrogation. At the same time, a suspect named Lü Guangyu was apprehended, and eight machine gun parts of various sizes, one magazine, ten rifle firing pins, nine large lead wires, and five Arisaka rifle bullets were recovered near Shanggaocun at the foot of the mountain in Panjiaqiao, District 8, Wujin County.

### Basketball Friendly Match: China United Beats U.S. Navy, Sixty to Fifty-Seven, a Close Contest with Tense Situation

The 10,000-yuan tickets upstairs sold 420 tickets, totaling 4.2 million yuan. The total income of 21.06 million yuan will be used as part of the funds for building an activity grandstand. Li Zhenzhong of China United was unfortunately forced to leave the field after only three minutes due to an eye injury that caused bleeding. The battle was quite tense. China United took the lead with 36 to 24 in the first half, ultimately winning by only three points with a score of 60 to 57.

U.S. Troops Take the Lead

Referees were Liu Hesheng and Jin Botao. China United fielded Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Ren Xiangcheng, and Chen Xuechong as the starting five. The U.S. troops deployed Meyer, Weber, Bowser, Beahan, and Kemeny. After the kickoff, Kemeny scored first, followed by Meyer, who made both free throws. Kemeny added another point, giving the U.S. troops a 7-0 lead. China United called a timeout, and Li Zhenzhong left the field due to a recurrence of his eye injury. Liu Mashan substituted.

China United Takes the Lead

Weber and Kemeny continued to be active. China United quickly caught up. Wu Chengzhang dragged the ball into the basket, Xiangcheng broke through from the baseline, and Xuechong made a long shot, closing the gap to 10 to 14. The U.S. troops called a timeout for the second time to adjust their formation, but it was still ineffective. Brother A, Lao Bao, and Fushan successively scored, and China United took a 16-14 lead by two points. Topeka called a timeout for the third time. After resuming play to 22-19, with China United leading by three points, the visiting team stopped again to substitute players. Wu Chengzhang scored a free throw, Weber scored a point, Fushan followed up, and soon Chengzhang made a series of beautiful shots, scoring six points in one breath. The first half ended with China United leading 36-24.

Maximum Distance

After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed the game. Brother A scored the first point, and Zukemeny responded. Lao Bao broke through with one hand, and Meyer scored a free throw, forming a seesaw battle. Later, U.S. soldiers Weber and Meyer became increasingly fierce, while China United also held on tightly, with the score at 52-39, Topeka was still at a disadvantage. The U.S. troops then fought back with reserve forces, and Brother A shot from the baseline, making it 54-39, with China United leading by 15 points, the largest score difference.

Winning by Three Points

Before long, the U.S. troops used a double formation again, showing some improvement, while China United gradually became lax, bringing the score to 53-56. When China United was only ahead by three points, Xuechong broke through, Beahan was dismissed for his fifth foul, and Vanderliet substituted. Xuechong scored another two points, and Kemeny made two free throws. The U.S. troops still had to fight back against the wall, but unfortunately the time had run out. When the bell rang, China United defeated Topeka by 60-57, avenging their previous defeat.

### Peking University's "College of Engineering": Binbin Certifies Its Forty Years of Historical Origins and Final Resting Place in the City of Culture

— Binbin

The Duan Wang Mansion inside Xizhimen in the old capital, a pioneering industrial education institution, truly has a unique history in this "city of culture." No wonder some old professors and alumni insisted on protecting the school during last summer's merger with Beiyang University and this summer's transfer to Peking University. However, this school's renaming, reform, and transfer have been full of vicissitudes for forty years, and now that it has become the College of Engineering of the highest institution, Peking University, it can be called a good resting place. Looking at it from a purely objective point of view, it may not necessarily be a misfortune.

Now, let's give a concise review of the school's evolution:

"Higher Industrial School" was the earliest name. In 1903, the former Qing Ministry of Commerce (renamed the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce in 1905) founded it to promote industry and cultivate talent. It was founded by Shangshu (Minister) Zai Zhen, and the person who supported and planned it was Tang Wenzhi from Taicang (a Jinshi graduate who served as a special envoy of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce and as the supervisor of the Jiangnan Higher Industrial School at the end of the Qing Dynasty. I heard a few years ago that this person was still alive and nearing his nineties). Although it was "ministerially established," everything followed the regulations for industrial schools set by Minister of Education Zhang Baixi. Zhang allocated 20,000 taels of silver from the funds of "University Hall" (the predecessor of Peking University) because Peking University's engineering department had not yet been established at the time, so there was surplus funds to be transferred. This school has historical origins with "Peking University" in terms of economics and foundation, which is by no means a matter of one day or two. The school site was initially in Zujia Street and later moved to Duan Wang Mansion. Remedial classes (what are now called preparatory classes) were held for two years, and undergraduate courses were opened in 1907. From the initial establishment to the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, the school's age in this stage was eight years.

At the beginning of the Republic of China, all "schools" were uniformly renamed "schools," and this "Higher Industrial School" was renamed "Industrial Vocational School," affiliated to the Ministry of Education, from "ministerially established" to "nationally established." The system was clear, and the position was also stable. After the "May Fourth" Movement, the New Culture Movement trend brought about a craze for "university" names. The number of private universities increased like mushrooms after rain. National vocational schools such as normal schools and communication schools also called for "changing to universities" and "upgrading to universities." Therefore, this school was unwilling to fall behind. After several petitions in 1924, the Ministry of Education approved the promotion to "National Peking Industrial University." After four years, Zhang Zuolin arrived.

First Affiliation with Peking University

Zhang Zuolin called himself "Grand Marshal" in the old capital and established a "military government." His Ministry of Education changed "Peking" to "Capital" for Peking University and changed the departments to "sections," all following the old style of the "Capital University Hall" at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and merged other universities. Therefore, this four-year-old industrial institution was reduced from a university to a department of the university, called the "Capital University Engineering Department." Although that was Zhang Zuolin's trick, the so-called "Capital University" was actually a variant of "Peking University," which can be regarded as the prelude to the current affiliation with "Peking University," which was the first time.

Zhang Zuolin's self-acting "military government" had a short fate. After only a year, he was driven out of the pass by the revolutionary army, and the old capital was unified under the national government. The atmosphere was new, and the school system was also renewed. There was an innovative university district and a "Peiping University" to govern the schools. This industrial school became the "First College of Engineering of Peiping University," and Beiyang University became the "Second College of Engineering." Although Beiyang was a university and had older qualifications, it was listed as the second because its school site was in Tianjin. The "elder brother" became the "younger brother." Twenty years ago, the two schools, which were in different places and unrelated, suddenly became "connected branches," which was also a matter of luck and beyond imagination. The following year, the university district system encountered difficulties, and Peiping University's method of "unifying the heroes" was difficult to convince the public. Peking University, with its seniority and reputation, was the first to stand alone. Beiyang also restored the university. Since there was no so-called "Second College of Engineering," the word "First" was also useless, so it was called "Peiping University College of Engineering." This lasted for eight years from 1929 to the "July 7th" Incident in 1937. (To be continued)

### Dissection of the Course of the China United vs. Topeka Battle

[Our Newspaper Special] China United defeated the Topeka team last night. The process was tight and uneven. The China team once led by a score of 54 to 39, leading by as many as 15 points, but ultimately only won by three points. The evolution of the situation exposed the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.

Da Li left the field a few minutes after entering the game due to a recurrence of his injury. Lao Bao, Brother A, Xuechong, Fushan, and Xiangcheng cooperated seamlessly, maintaining a balance of power at the beginning. Brother A and Wu Chengcheng showed excellent shooting skills, and China United took the lead, maintaining a lead of about five goals for a long period.

U.S. Military's Long Men Wheel Battle

The U.S. military frequently changed people, performing a wheel battle. In fact, there were four more valuable talents: center Meyer, who had a good grasp of near-basket shots and was six feet five inches tall, still maintained a rate of quick running and lively bouncing. Webb and black man Bowser were good at being steady, and Kemeny's dribbling and rushing shots also showed extraordinary skill. However, due to unfamiliarity with the field, it seemed that they could not fully exert their strength.

Compared with China United, the Topeka team seemed to have more skilled passing techniques. Between the black man Bowser and the tall Meyer, there was a brilliant and skillful pass. The black man had a calm mind and was good at taking advantage of opportunities. Meyer took advantage of his height, so the two often cooperated to score points last night.

China United Almost Turned Victory into Defeat

China lacked Da Li, and its mobility was still great, but it lost its composure. Under extreme advantage, the U.S. military took away as many as ten points in one breath. The reason was that Ren Xiangcheng indiscriminately used long shots, without gaining anything. Lao Bao exhausted his strength in the first half, so he had to be lazy in the second half, plus psychological factors, almost causing the situation to turn from victory to defeat. Xiangcheng is currently the weakest shooter on China United, and can only be used as a buffer and pause point for passing the ball. He had the opportunity to shoot but did not shoot, and he dared not shoot when he should have shot last night. If China United wants to compete for the championship with teams such as "Dagong" and "Qingbai" in the future, the above weaknesses should be improved in the short term. (Changnian)

### Next Year's World Games Will Adopt Electric Timing, Technical Problems Assisted by Science

[British News Agency London 8th Dispatch] Many technical problems in the 14th World Games, scheduled to be held in London next year, are currently being handled with the assistance of researchers from the British National Physical Laboratory. Electric timing, photography at the end of the track race, accurate measuring instruments, duplex telephones and telegrams, radio control of road races, and signaling devices used by referees are all included in the plan. Although it is not often seen for referees to seek help from photos in World Games competitions, it has happened several years ago. The organizing committee for the 1948 Games is considering installing special mirror boxes 60 feet above the ground on the running track of the Wembley Empire Stadium to capture photos of the finish line. All track events may use electric timing. The pistol used by the starter is connected to a circuit, and when the trigger is pulled, the clock at the finish line starts running. This timing system is different for cycling, equestrianism, and rowing competitions. In cycling competitions, the winner will pass a horizontal bar placed on the road at the finish line. In equestrian competitions, the top horse breaks a line. In rowing competitions, the clock is operated by a photoelectric money transfer.

[British News Agency London 28th Dispatch] The 14th World Games are scheduled to be held in London from July 29th to August 14th next year. There are the following seventeen competitive events: athletics, football, basketball, hockey, gymnastics, modern pentathlon, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, cycling, equestrianism, fencing, shooting, swimming, canoeing, rowing, and sailing.

### Japan to Hold National Games Next Year, Prince Chichibu Appointed President

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo 28th Dispatch] The Japanese Sports Association Council Committee held a meeting on the 26th and decided to hold the 3rd National Games in Fukuoka from the end of September to the middle of October next year. It was also decided to publicly recommend Emperor's brother Prince Chichibu as the honorary president of the conference. This matter has aroused the political attention of ordinary Japanese people, because at the time of war, Quan Ren was virtually confined by Hirohito due to disagreement of intention. After Japan surrendered, he was not seen in activity. Although he was promoted as the president of the sports conference this time, it seems that he is also regarded as the beginning of Quan Ren's contact with the outside world.

### Chairman Yuan of the Textile Control Committee Convenes a Discussion Meeting; Private Factory Representatives Offer Four Suggestions; Both Sides Approach Agreement on Trial Implementation of Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation

(Our Dispatch) Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Textile and Silk Control Committee, convened a meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM with several leading figures from private cotton mills at the committee's offices. Those in attendance included Wang Qizi, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, Liu Piji, and Rong Yixin. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM. Following the meeting, both Chairman Yuan and the representatives of the private cotton mills expressed that their respective opinions on the trial implementation of joint cotton yarn allocation had become very close. The principles are no longer in question, but the technical implementation issues still require active efforts to find reasonable solutions.

Leading figures from the cotton textile associations of the six districts gathered yesterday at noon to further study the joint allocation trial implementation plan. They decided to contribute four points for consideration to the Textile Control Committee: All jointly allocated cotton yarn should include commissioned spinning cotton yarn to enrich the allocated yarn amounts. Cotton yarn pricing should quickly establish a reasonable calculation formula, based on the principle of taking full account of production costs. The implementation of joint allocation should be based on nationwide standards and equal treatment for all yarn factories, both Chinese and foreign. Concrete measures must be in place to address the issues of raw material shortfalls and capital turnover. The private representatives presented these four points for discussion at the Textile Control Committee meeting, and the results indicate that their opinions are approaching agreement.

After the meeting, Chairman Yuan, in an interview with reporters, stated that the first of the four points raised by the private factories was quite fair. The second point, the pricing issue, may be changed to calculate based on actual material value in the future. The third point was considered to be in line with the original intention of joint allocation, which was intended to be nationwide, but will first be piloted in the Shanghai area, and then gradually extended to the entire country based on the circumstances. The fourth point, raw materials, is a fundamental issue that must be resolved. Funding will also be made available to facilitate financing. In short, the opinions raised by the private factories will be forwarded to the central authorities for discussion and resolution, he said.

In other news: Chairman Yuan of the Textile Control Committee received a telegram from Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan yesterday and is scheduled to fly to the capital this morning. It is reported that the four points regarding joint allocation raised by the private factories will also be presented to the authorities for discussion in order to reach a reasonable solution.

Textile Construction Company Resumes Allotment of Yarn by Yarn Number

[Our Dispatch] The Textile Control Committee yesterday ordered the Textile Construction Company to resume allotting yarn according to yarn number. The allotment method has been changed as follows: All yarn numbers registered with the Textile Construction Company may apply to purchase yarn. The allotment will only announce the count and brand of the yarn. Applicants will fill in the quantity and price they wish to purchase, referencing market prices. Purchase applications must be submitted before 1:30 PM daily. The Textile Construction Company will then determine a reasonable allotment price from the prices offered by the applicants, taking into account the actual market trading prices of the day. This reasonable allotment price will be slightly lower than the market price. If the price filled in by the applicant is lower than this price, there will be no allotment; if it is higher, the yarn will still be allotted at this price. After the quantity and price of the yarn allotted to each yarn number are determined, payment must be made the next day; otherwise, it will be considered a forfeiture, and their yarn allocation qualification will be permanently revoked. Allotments will continue to be made on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with payments made on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. An additional flood relief donation of 250,000 yuan per bale will be added.

Eight Types of Cotton Yarn Offered for Sale Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Recent fluctuations in the black market for cotton yarn are reportedly due to increased raw cotton costs and depleted market inventory. To regulate supply and demand and suppress the black market, the Textile Control Committee has decided to allocate raw cotton to each yarn factory, as reported yesterday. Furthermore, in response to requests from various yarn and cloth merchants, the committee has begun selling cotton yarn in the cotton yarn market, starting yesterday. The sales target is limited to qualified merchants originally registered with the Textile Construction Company. Up to eight types of cotton yarn trademarks are being sold. The quantity and price to be sold are to be reported by the manufacturers themselves.

According to statistics, only 1,400 pieces of 20-count yarn were voluntarily purchased at prices ranging from 30 million to 31 million yuan, which is far from the amount of cotton yarn the Textile Control Committee prepared to allocate that day. As a result, general sentiment is weak, and the black market price of 20-count Jincheng yarn has plummeted by about 2 million yuan. The market outlook for today is expected to decline further.

20-Count Negotiated Price Sees Another Increase

The cotton yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company to various reproduction industries continued to be sold at negotiated prices yesterday. The negotiated price for 20-count yarn was also adjusted to 28.11 million yuan yesterday. It is reported that the authorities will employ flexible techniques and adopt dynamic methods to maintain the supply of cotton yarn to reproduction industries and the cotton yarn market in the future, in order to combat the black market and ensure that speculators reap what they sow. Also, in order to allocate the 30,000 bales of raw cotton allocated by the National Bank, the Textile Control Committee has issued the following public notice: This committee plans to continue allocating a batch of raw cotton to various yarn factories for commissioned spinning. Any yarn factory that has previously undertaken commissioned spinning with this committee, has a good credit rating, and is indeed short of cotton may come to this committee to apply for procedures from today. This is a special announcement.

Zhongni fell to the daily limit of 40 yuan, and Yong Yarn stepped down to 403 yuan and 413 yuan. No. 155, etc., made up for losses, and the National Bank’s poor performance was very small, and there was a slight rebound.

Spring and Autumn

### Spring Willows on the Long Embankment

— Hong Weifa

Yangzhou Continued Dreams Twenty-Six

Willows and Yangzhou seem to be quite related, probably because of the old Sui Embankment. The Yangzhou Prefecture Chronicle says: "The Sui Dynasty dug canals into the river, and built imperial rivers on the side, planted with willows, which is now called the Sui Embankment." The Emperor Yang of Sui's record of opening the river says: "The decree states that if a commoner has a willow tree, they will be rewarded with a . The common people competed to offer them. He also ordered them to plant them personally, and the emperor planted one himself, and the ministers planted them in order, until the common people. At that time, there was a rumor saying: The emperor plants first, then the common people plant. After planting, the emperor wrote with his imperial brush and bestowed the weeping willow with the surname Yang, saying, It is also the willow." Because there were many willows on the Sui Embankment, and Emperor Yang died in Yangzhou, talking about Yangzhou also meant talking about the Sui Embankment and willows. By the time Wang Yuyang's Yechun Ci, which said, "A stream flows along the northern suburb, the scenery of the Red Bridge is in sight in autumn, the green willow city is Yangzhou," became popular, the green willow city became a different name for Yangzhou, and the willows seemed to be a unique decoration of Yangzhou.

In the past, there were undoubtedly many willows in Yangzhou, and there were even more on the long embankment of Slender West Lake in the northern suburbs. Therefore, one of the eight scenic spots of Yangzhou was called "Spring Willows on the Long Embankment." This Long Embankment Spring Willow, according to the Painted Boat Record, said: "It is on the west bank of the Rainbow Bridge, the gate of Wu's other , opposite to the Yechun Poetry Society." It also said: "Yangzhou is suitable for Yang, and the ones on the embankment are even bigger. They are inserted in winter and live in spring. In three or four years, they will grow two or three feet. Cut off their branches, the middle is hollow, and after the rain, they produce many bacteria like bowls, and the embrace becomes a garden. Clumsy, fat and bloated, without any decoration, or one plant every five steps, two trees every ten steps, in groups of three or five, standing in the garden. The hall is inscribed with Nongyin Caotang, and the couplet says: Autumn water has just added four or five feet, (Du Fu) green shade is separated by two or three families. (Si Kongtu)" In addition, when the Painted Boat Record wrote about "West Garden Meandering Water," it mentioned that there were many willows southwest of the Shangying Building in the West Garden, "the structure pierces through the trees, with long and short lines, drooping eaves and covering the ridge, spring swallows and autumn crows, sunset and drizzle, everything is suitable. There is a Fuliu Pavilion in the middle, and the couplet says: A winding path leads to a secluded place, (Gao Shi) weeping willows caress the fine waves. (Wen Tingyun) The willows in the northern suburbs have reached their full potential here." It can be seen that the willows in the northern suburbs of Yangzhou are very famous, and the spring suburbs of the Long Embankment are the representative works of the willows in the northern suburbs.

Regarding the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment, the Painted Boat Record further said that it was built by the Huang family for Pu, and that Wang Yuanlin was also famous for painting the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment. I don't know if this picture is still in the world today, and the circumstances of Huang's construction of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment at that time cannot be known. In the current situation, the Long Embankment is still there. In a very dilapidated pavilion on the Long Embankment, there is still a horizontal plaque written by Chen Chongqing, "Spring Willows on the Long Embankment," but only three or five scattered willows remain. In the pavilion's jacket, there is a stone carving of "Record of Restoration of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment" written by Chen, which says: "The Long Embankment Spring Willow has been included in the eight scenic spots on the lake. Its land starts from the Rainbow Bridge as a dam, and the western part belongs to the Situ Temple. Cui Boting's flower garden in the Yuan Dynasty directly covers half of the dam. Wang Lu Yechun's spring festival has been held here one after another. It is Hong's Yihong Garden, and the current Xu Garden is its location. In the year of Bingchen, Yang Jun Bingyan revitalized Xu, and after doing so, he used private funds to increase and broaden the original dam from the garden to the Rainbow Bridge, planting peaches and willows, forming a shade. A total of silver dollars were used to repair one mile of the dam and plant more than 500 trees. The old traces and the records in the map can be seen by examination." From this, it can be known that the most recent period of restoration of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment was in the fifth year of the Republic of China, and the person in charge was Yang Bingyan. Yang's name is Yao. This matter is also recorded in the New Chronicle of Jiangdu County: "After Xu Baoshan's death, the people of the country built a garden on the lake to worship Baoshan in it. At first, Wu Ce was in charge of the construction, and when Ce died, Yao succeeded him. It was in the midst of the hot summer days. At that time, Yao was nearly seventy years old and did not fear hard work. After more than a year, he heard that it was completed, and he planted hundreds of willows along the embankment west of the Red Bridge to reach the country, and built a pavilion in the middle for tourists to rest. Today, the trees planted are all lush and drooping. In spring and summer, looking from the east of the Red Bridge, they look like paintings, but it is a pity that Yao did not see it." The New Chronicle only says "plant willows," while the Record of Restoration of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment says "plant peach and willow trees." As far as the author saw in the past, it was indeed one willow and one peach. In just thirty years, the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment restored by Yang has been destroyed again. There are only three or five scattered spring willows, and not even one peach tree can be seen again. The so-called one-mile-long "Long Embankment" is left exposed. Tourists passing through it feel rugged and dusty, so how can they say, as the New Chronicle says, "In spring and summer, looking from the east of Hongqi, it is like a painting!"

However, looking at the present and thinking about the past, the author was still able to be a person in the picture during the good days of spring and autumn in this Long Embankment Spring Willow more than ten years ago. Three or five close friends, stepping over the Red Bridge, slowly walked from the Long Embankment to Xu Garden. The tin willows on both sides depended on each other, and thousands of strands played with the sleeves of the tourists. For a while, the sleeves of the tourists also seemed to be dyed with a lot of green. In addition, the spring peach blossoms were beautiful, and the cicadas sang in summer and autumn, which made people feel that the dust was gone and the mundane worries were washed away. The pace was unconsciously slowed down a lot, so as to savor the poetry and painting in it. Sometimes, I would personally hold a fishing rod and sit leisurely in the Huai shade, fishing. At this time, whether or not I caught a fish did not seem to be of great concern. I was just appreciating the dancing willow shadows in the water and the floating flowers. In addition to walking, I often traveled back and forth on the Long Embankment by boat. I always wanted the boat to drive close to the shore so that I could easily fold the willow branches. Not to earn anything from this, but I wanted to take them back to mark my travels on the lake. But these scenes have become old dreams for the author. The Long Embankment has long been no longer what it used to be, and the pleasure boats seem to be unable to bear the vicissitudes of life anymore, and they no longer travel along the Long Embankment. I don't know when someone will come to repair the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment like Yang Bingyan again. The author can only have unlimited expectations!

### Miss Shi's Actions

— Zheng Wuchang

The thirteenth day of the month is the anniversary of Ms. Shi Jianqiao's assassination of Sun Chuanfang to avenge her father's murder. Gathered at Gu Salon, composed this and presented it to her.

She who gave me life died, but I did not die; my not dying was to await the complete avenging of the hatred. With fingers pointing at the Yellow River, a dagger hidden in her waist, not taking a certain head was like water flowing away. A grand plan could not bear to be child's play; circling the pillar was merely a tragic act of a brave man; swallowing hatred, she secretly tracked and waited, using the opportunity to unleash her concealed gnashing of teeth. Years passed, but her resolve did not waver; suddenly, she met her target, almost within arm's reach; her eyes bursting open, her hair pointing upwards, she raised her arm without looking left or right, a loud sound like thunder came from her sleeve, blood splattered in Pu County, and our Buddha rejoiced. The hatred has been completely avenged, what more can she hope for in life? She surrendered herself, seeking death, but the officials did not heed her. How many people throughout history can compare to her filial piety and righteousness? The world is spreading the story of this legendary woman. The Shi family is virtuous, like those of ancient times; the soul of the man who killed her father should be stripped bare; who among those who are sons of men would not be ashamed!

### Fish Paradise (Oil Painting)

— Hu Yaguang

### Yu Dafu's Poetry and Lyrics

— Lu Danlin

The bad news of Yu Dafu's disappearance from the world has been confirmed over the past two years, based on factual reports from various sources, and there is no doubt about it. The ending of a literary figure with a tragedy is filled with endless sadness and sorrow. At the same time, it makes people feel an indescribable sense of mourning whenever they think of him, and perhaps that is the point.

Dafu's year of birth, according to the lunar calendar, was the year of Bing Shen, the day of Geng Zi, the day of Jia Wu, and the hour of Jia Zi. This was the third day of the eleventh month of the twenty-second year of Guangxu. According to the Gregorian calendar, it was 1896, fifteen years before the Republic of China. He disappeared (was murdered) in the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, after the surrender of Japan, at the age of only forty-nine. A generation of literary figures sacrificed to the great era, to borrow a phrase, truly "alas, only this mortal world."

In his later years, the old-style poetry and lyrics he composed as a pastime were deeply accomplished. Although filled with melancholy, they had his own unique style, different from the usual complaining about old age and poverty. Many of them have not yet been published. Now, I will extract some in a miscellaneous manner for everyone's appreciation.

When Dafu moved to Hangzhou, he wrote more travelogues and essays, and fewer novels. In his "West Lake Poetry Collection," such as:

Landscape on the Lin'an Road: "Four or five thatched cottages by the mud wall, two or three camellia buds just sprouting; when the sky clears, men and women are busy farming, leaving a tree of flowers idle in front of the door."

Reading the Lin'an County Chronicle in front of Qin Cao's tomb at Linglong Mountain Temple, I did not find any record of Qin Cao's deeds, but it said that the tomb was east of the temple: "The mountain is exquisite, and the water is clear, Dongpo once visited Yunying here (see the inscription). How can the ten volumes of Lin'an Chronicle not record the story of Qin Cao!"

Leaving Yuling Pass and passing Sanyang坑, the scenery of the winding mountain road is excellent: "How many turns and twists on the winding path, traversing thousands of mountains and ten thousand mountains. Beyond this, there are no three nights of change, coming from the west, and passing another pass. It is said that the streams compete to emerge from Zhushui, and the customs are close to Jianghuai, with a slightly barbaric language. I only regret that the traveling carriage cannot linger, letting the peaches and plums speak of spring idleness."

These are all scenes along the Hangzhou-Anhui Highway. When the highway was first opened, I once traveled along the road. Dafu's descriptions are truly paintings in poetry, especially the winding curves near Yuling Pass, vividly depicted.

On March 9th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, passing by Yue Fei's tomb, I revised an old work: "Leaning on the lake and mountains, the sun is setting again, turning back the carriage to pay respects to the great king's tomb. The worms and sand have long lost the three towns, and the apes and cranes can now set up an army - the extraordinary merits of Hebei belong to Wei Jiang, and the Jiangnan memorials are thin like Liu Kun. Pitiful are the five hundred sons' blood, which is emptied into clouds on Tianheng Island!"

This was three years after the September 18th Incident, and the Japanese were pressing us step by step. The situation in North China was becoming increasingly urgent, and the central government's countermeasures had not yet been made public. Dafu's poem is filled with endless sighs. He also has a poem "Feeling the Times Passing Yue Fei's Tomb," which contains: "The children of the Northland indulge in ease and pleasure, and there is a reigning emperor who loves romance. The powerful ministers themselves want to make peace, when will the Jin soldiers want Bianzhou!" And a poem presented to colleagues of the Fujian Newspaper: "The elegance of Fujian depends on support, and integrity should be a teacher to the weak; if the country is destroyed and the family broken, facing the flowers! Tears will not become poetry!" His patriotic spirit overflows in his words.

A few days before his fortieth birthday, he wrote two poems with Zhao Longwen: "Building a house at the east gate is accidental, daring to sing the Yinglong chapter about planting melons? I only ask for a full meal and a warm ox coat, and to barely live in the world for another ten years." "Yesterday was Dong Zhou, today is Qin, how can the fish in the pond distinguish Geng Zu? A few points of winter green trees in front of the door, are considered the spring in the Peach Blossom Spring cave."

This can be said to be his poem expressing his aspirations at forty. It is truly a coincidence that he disappeared from the world exactly ten years later, and "barely live in the world for another ten years" became a prophecy!

He has a "Jinlvqu" lyric, which is modeled after Gu Liangfen's lyric sent to Wu Jizi. It is filled with sounds of missing, worry, resentment, and regret. Those who read it should be able to understand his state of mind at that time. The lyric says: "Are you all safe, brothers? Remember when we parted, striking the zither at the capital gate, betting on wine at Han Gao. After parting, time flies like a steed passing a gap, and another year is about to end. I am afraid to tell you about my recent illness and thinness. I am incompetent and accept my fate, but I am most saddened by my old mother and young children. My affairs after death depend on good friends. Half a lifetime of savings, both sleeves filled with wind. I regret that I used to buy laughter with thousands of gold, measuring pearls and discussing buckets. I am too lazy to express my past complaints now, and I am worried that there will be ugliness if I express them. Don't ask if there are any articles! Even if I continue to write the Autumn Willow Draft, the language is absurd, and I will be cursed by ten thousand people. I cannot express everything, your brother bows."

From the saying "poetry expresses aspirations," these poems and lyrics can be said to fully express Dafu's state of mind. We still feel endless sympathy when we read them today.

### Record of Visiting the Teacher and Listening to Instructions

— Lu Songyin

On January 9th of the 36th year of the Republic of China, together with Jiaotong University classmates Zhu Youneng, Shen Zhikai, Cao Boquan, Lu Runyu, Wang Zhenqun, Zhou Jifang, and Pu Jiufeng, I visited Teacher Tang Weizhi at his Shanghai residence on Jing'an Temple Road. It has been thirty years since we left school. Recalling the late spring of the 26th year, we classmates once traveled to Yixing and Wuxi, paying homage to the relics of Wu and Yue, and ascending to the Hall of Rujing, as if we were standing in the snow at Cheng's gate again, making us reluctant to leave. That evening, we held a public banquet for our teacher at his residence, and we discussed the gains and losses of ancient and modern times. The teacher recited aloud Du Gongbu's "Autumn Hopes" poem, especially the two lines "Kuang Heng presented memorials but his merit book was rejected, Liu Xiang transmitted scriptures but his lifelong wishes were violated," the tone was passionate, like the sound of gold and stone, and the classmates were deeply moved. When we returned to our residence late at night, we were still overjoyed, and the spring breeze of Yi River was no exaggeration. However, in less than a few months, the Japanese invaders acted wildly, like a wild boar and a long snake, devouring the upper country. Shanghai was occupied, and the capital was lost. Many classmates were displaced, and our teacher also fled to Hunan and Guangxi. Those who stayed here temporarily were all cramped like foals under a carriage, seeking to preserve their lives in the chaotic world, but it was not possible, let alone be able to gather together as teachers and students in one room to recount the old days. Heaven pitied us, and the powerful enemy obeyed orders. Classmates scattered and reunited, and recently nearly twenty people have been dancing in various places in Beijing and Shanghai. Although the world situation is bad, it is not hopeless, and the mountains and rivers are fortunately incomplete but restored. Therefore, we planned a way to commemorate this, and everyone said that encountering difficulties is righteousness, like Jizi's Mingyi; speaking out to awaken the deaf, like Ni Shan's wooden bell; we are living in a troubled world, entering and leaving the market of goods and profits, personal desires are growing daily, and heavenly principles are gradually disappearing. If we do not seek correction from those who have the Way, how can we save ourselves in this troubled world! Therefore, we decided to follow the example of Confucius and ask for advice, and Shen Zhikai first went to ask for a time. The teacher heard of this and did not think it was impossible to teach us, but was happy. After giving us the date of the visit, he prepared lectures in advance, and when we arrived, he gave us seats and explained them to us. The teacher said: "The most important thing today is integrity and moral courage! I recently wrote a couplet: 'Life values integrity and moral courage, the world must rely on backbone to support it.' I hope you deeply understand this meaning. If you drift with the tide, like feathers melting in a furnace, you are not my students. People must be determined to be honest and upright, so that their conscience is not obscured, and then they can make progress. Therefore, in today's world, advocating Yangming's philosophy to implement scriptures and teachings is the most urgent task. Nowadays, people are talking about construction, but things have a root and a branch, and things have a beginning and an end. If we abandon the root and pursue the branch, things will not succeed. We must think from the root before we can talk about construction; otherwise, if we forget righteousness for profit in our hearts, and our original intentions are already blurred, how can we handle the great affairs of the world? Su Shi said, 'Those who handle the great affairs of the world, establish the great integrity of the world.' I hope you all encourage each other." From beginning to end, the instruction was diligent and thorough, and it ended after more than an hour. Then we took a group photo to commemorate it, and then thanked him and left. Recalling when we first entered the classroom, the teacher was just over forty, and the students were all in their twenties. How many years have passed, and the teacher is already approaching old age, and the students are also gradually graying. We have not achieved academic success, and we have not established a reputation. Looking back on the past, how can we not feel touched! Although a great person must appear every five hundred years, more than five hundred years have passed since Yangming. Who will follow him but our teacher? The poem says, "The kind and gentle gentleman receives blessings without fail": it also says, "Bless you with your duties and prosperity, bless you with your development and health." I record this in pursuit, to celebrate my teacher's birthday, to encourage my classmates, and also to encourage myself!

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood

— Hua Jingfeng

Tsurumi and Pingzi parted ways in Tianjin. However, the first phone call Tsurumi received upon arriving in Tokyo was from Pingzi. Tsurumi asked her, "How did you get back so quickly?" Pingzi did not answer, but all that could be heard on the phone was a series of silver bell-like laughter; "Ge ge ge."

"Big brother, your residence has already been arranged for you; it's not far from Ueno Park, on the top floor - the seventh floor - of that 'New Silk Building'; the scenery outside the window is very beautiful; it can greatly inspire your poetic mood... Big brother, if you have good lines of poetry, be sure to write them down; you know, someone is waiting to see them... But regarding your work, you must also plan it early, your comrades may come to see you tonight... Goodbye, goodbye!..."

"Hey, why do I have to live in that so-called building?" Tsurumi's voice was obviously very rough. But Pingzi did not answer, and after a burst of laughter, there was a "Cha" sound, and the other party had already hung up the phone.

"This girl is really a 'mystery of the devil'! She simply makes people hate and detest her, but there's nothing you can do about her!" Tsurumi inserted this sentence in the midst of our conversation.

"That's called 'coffin bottom - wooden clog feet'..." I couldn't help but laugh.

"What 'feet'?" Tsurumi became interested in the language.

"Wooden clog feet."

"How do you explain it?"

"The wronged soul won't disperse!" I was once again teaching Tsurumi the national language.

"I don't understand," Tsurumi scratched his head, looked up, and stared at the ceiling with his eyes slanted; "...Oh, I understand!" He laughed: "I remember that's not how they say it outside the pass... it seems to be ..., ..., fire kang?"... That means, a ghost has found you, right? Why is it 'Dou'?"

"I'm afraid it's 'coffin board installed on a fire kang', anyway, the two sayings mean the same thing. This 'Guan' is not the meaning of combat, it's the 'Dou bamboo shoot head', the meaning of installing it. This is how it's said in the Yangtze River area; a wronged soul is a kind of 'ghost', but more ferocious than ordinary ghosts, once it finds its 'enemy' it will never let go; just like Miss Pingzi's situation with you now!"

"Humph, the wronged soul won't disperse; but I haven't wronged her, nor do I owe her anything." Tsurumi was a little resentful.

The place where Tsurumi received Pingzi's call was the "Military Friend's Reception Center." In name, it was a reception, but in reality, it was surveillance; without orders from above, without explaining public affairs clearly, you could absolutely not be free.

### Severe Punishment for Corruption in the Ming Dynasty

— Liuyun

To govern a chaotic world, use severe laws. In today's world where people's hearts are decadent and corruption is rampant, if we can reward the deserving and punish the guilty, without leniency or injustice, we may be able to guide people's hearts and change the world's destiny.

According to Zhao Yi's "Notes on the Twenty-Four Histories": "In the eighteenth year of Hongwu, the emperor ordered the arrest of all officials in the world who harmed the people and sent them to the capital to build the city. When the emperor first ascended the throne, he punished the laxity of the Yuan government and used the law too strictly. Those who carried out the orders stood on tiptoe, and officials who committed crimes were all demoted to Fengyang to cultivate land, numbering more than 10,000 people. According to the "Grass and Wood Zi," the Ming ancestor was strict in governing officials, and allowed the people to go to the capital to report officials who were greedy and cruel. Those who embezzled more than sixty taels of silver were beheaded and their heads displayed to the public, and their skin was peeled and stuffed with grass. A temple was specially built to the left of the prefecture, state, and county government offices to worship the land god as a place for skinning, called the Skinning Temple. A bag of skinned and grass-stuffed corpses was hung in front of the official seats to remind them to be vigilant!" The laws were strict, and all duties were carried out. Ancestor Kai called it reforming the lenient policies of the former Yuan and governing the contaminated followers of old customs.

The Ming Dynasty believed that the Yuan government was lax, so it used strict laws and harsh punishments to make officials vigilant! Thus, all duties were carried out. Beheading and displaying the heads of cruel officials, and then peeling their skin and stuffing it with grass, inevitably makes people feel that the despotism and cruelty of the old era was excessive and inhumane; however, it can be seen from this that the Ming ancestor deeply hated corruption and believed that death was not enough to atone for it. Officials who harmed the people were all arrested and sent to the capital to build the city, and officials who committed crimes were all demoted to Fengyang to cultivate land. This not only reversed the ancient example of "punishments do not extend to high officials," but also showed the Ming ancestor's determination to clean up officialdom and not be lenient.

### Wartime Homing Pigeons

— Lun

Homing pigeons are one of the oldest forms of military communication, but in this era of such advanced science, they still occupy a high position. These silent messengers have made great contributions in many battles of World War II.

Once, a detachment of Allied troops on the border of Burma and Siam was surrounded by the Japanese army, and a blue-beaked pigeon named Empress of the Jungle carried the intelligence and set off, flying over many high mountains, a distance of 320 miles, and ultimately saved a thousand lives.

Another pigeon named Gyse also saved the lives of a thousand Allied soldiers in Italy. This pigeon later received the Dickin Medal from the Mayor of London. It was the first time that a non-British animal had received this honor.

Also, a male pigeon in the U.S. Army named Bolenie Haliiz was released with a message tied to one of its legs amidst Japanese artillery fire. It fell to the ground covered in thorns after being struck by shrapnel. The message should have arrived in twenty minutes, but it was delayed. However, five hours later, this loyal pigeon, its body covered in blood, finally reached its destination, and the message on its leg was intact.

In French Morocco, a blue-beaked pigeon named "Mrs. Astor" flew ninety miles and delivered important tactical information; during the journey, both of its feet were hit twice, and one wing was also pierced by a bullet. When it completed its mission, it was exhausted.

Pigeon post communication is not only trusted by military personnel, but war reporters also use this bird when they lack other means of communication.

Pigeons in the army are like clerks in the army; they have undergone changes very different from peacetime. Its "home" has changed places, and its habits have also changed. Its duties are new and strange, and it must receive special training to be suitable for a special job, all of which depends on the command of the team to which it belongs.

When carrier pigeons first learn to serve, they either set off with people in jeeps, or are placed on warships or airplanes, or are carried on people's backs, or placed on the shoulders of military dogs, or fly out on secret missions, the secrets of which have not yet been revealed.

The use of pigeons for communication in war began in 43 BC, when the Roman governor Brutus was besieged by Mark Antony in Mutina. The Roman government official Hirtius led a large army to rescue him, and used pigeons to carry secret messages to Brutus.

The use of carrier pigeons for military purposes has made this bird attract international attention. Germany was the first country to build military pigeon houses.

### "Tokyo Rose" and "Axis Sally"

— Baoqing

"Tokyo Rose," who is still at large and living in Yokohama, recently used her Portuguese husband's family name to apply for a passport to the United States. The State Department has already handed the application over to the Department of Justice for review. However, the American Legion has asked the State Department to quickly try her for her crimes and not allow her to enter the United States and reside there permanently.

American soldiers who fought in the Pacific Theater will not forget this broadcasting hostess from the enemy's side. "Tokyo Rose" claimed in her broadcasts that she was from Los Angeles, USA, and her name was Davis. She had a round face, big eyes, and was five feet two inches tall. She went to Japan with her husband. She worked as a telephone operator at Domei News Agency. After the war started, she applied to be a broadcaster for the Japanese army targeting the United States and was accepted. Every evening from eight to nine o'clock, she broadcast in American English, either telling stories, singing songs, or talking about war matters, to promote propaganda for the Japanese army. Although American soldiers were forbidden to listen to her broadcasts, her sweet words, laughter, and songs would make some American soldiers intoxicated, as if hearing their homeland and loved ones speaking. After the war, an American reporter discovered her whereabouts, and she was arrested shortly thereafter, and has now been released.

And in Germany, Allied soldiers in Europe also heard the voices of American girls coming from there, like sister flowers of "Tokyo Rose." This girl called herself "Axis Sally," and had lived in Porter City in Maine for a long time. Her real name was Mildred Gillars. During the war, she worked hard for the Nazis at the Berlin Broadcasting Station, asking Allied soldiers to leave their troops and return to the "glorious homeland." Naturally, her sweet voice was not as charming and famous as "Tokyo Rose." She entered Germany in 1934. She was detained after the war, and it is unknown whether she has been released.

In the propaganda war, one part of the war, using enemy girls, with their native accents, broadcasting tender sweet words, can have some psychological effect in confusing the enemy's morale.

### Afraid of Having the Same Name as Hitler

— Chaifei

"Hitler" is a very common name in Austria, as common as Smith in England, Chiron in France, and Ah Mao Ah Gou in China. When the Nazis dominated Europe, those with the same name as Hitler were willing to take advantage of the situation and gain some small benefits, but now still bearing the name "Hitler" is an unbearable burden. In Vienna, there are now 1,500 people who want to change the nickname that symbolizes dictatorship. When the municipal authorities accept applications, they usually conduct an oral examination. As long as the testimony states that they have never been a member of the National Socialist Party, the application can be approved immediately. Recently, when a widow named Frau Franz Hitler applied to change her name, the registration official, seeing the card, said:

"Madam, from now on, you will change your name to Frau Müller, please sign here.

The young wife signed her name, received her identity card, and then naturally gave a Hitler-style salute and shouted:

"Long live Müller!"

The official was stunned, thinking that she must have been a National Socialist Party member before.

### I Love Wang Jinggong

— Yifeng

"Coming and going alone" is a noble attitude towards life. This attitude is by no means a blind or narrow prejudice, but a spirit of being responsible for the truth. Only those with the character of coming and going alone can be a true warrior and a complete person. (Although often a failed hero.) When they are in troubled times and facing dangerous situations, they will never drift with the tide or forget righteousness for profit; on the contrary, they can show their noble character and awe-inspiring righteousness. The ancient saying "crazy and generous scholars" is close to this.

In history, this kind of independent person should be a lovely and respectable typical character. But most of our historians have a mind that judges heroes by success or failure, so for this kind of independent and failed hero, they are either erased or deliberately suppressed, so that there are not many biographies or the facts are distorted. I personally believe that among the independent figures in history, the great politician of the Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi, should be the most worthy of respect. Although Tao Yuanming of the Jin Dynasty is the most praised, he can only achieve the retirement of being alone and good, and does not have the great ambition to advance and benefit the world, and the active thinking of entering the world. Wang Jinggong is different. He has vision, ambition, and is absolutely responsible for the truth, without the slightest hesitation. In order to express his ambition, he implemented new policies, wanting to revive the Song Dynasty from its accumulation of weakness, regardless of the opposition of important ministers and general scholars such as Fu Bi, Han Qi, and Sima Guang. Moreover, he knew that he could not realize his ideas without being a prime minister or important minister, so he submitted a ten-thousand-word letter to Emperor Renzong, expressing his great ambition to save the country, but Emperor Renzong repeatedly offered him unimportant positions such as judge and recorder of daily life, which he refused to accept. Even if the imperial edict was sent to his home to invite him to serve, he would not sell his face. It was not until Emperor Shenzong appointed him as Jiangning Prefecture, and then granted him the title of Hanlin Academician, that he could carry out his ideas. He would rather live in the wild than be an official. What a lovely spirit this is! Although the result was the failure of the new policies due to improper employment, and he was left with the crime of "greedy prime minister," the opposing veteran ministers should be held largely responsible for this failure. If the veteran ministers at that time could cooperate with him, or at least not obstruct the implementation of his new policies, then the disaster of the Southern Crossing of the Song Dynasty might have been avoided.

When Jinggong was young, his famous line when chanting about pomegranate flowers was: "A touch of red on the thick green flower branches, the moving spring colors should not be too much." This shows that his style is not vulgar, and his accumulation of a mad and generous spirit. When the new policies were implemented and suppressed in many ways, he not only did not shrink back, but also compared himself to auspicious snow, saying; "The great power almost buries the earth, success is only seen when spring returns; the villagers do not know the benevolent intentions, only hope for a clear sky of thousands of miles." What a mind this is! Causing the opponents to retreat. When his new policies failed and he retired, he may have been pained by the failure of his hard-earned new policies, but he was never depressed by his own gains and losses. He lived in a pleasant mood of "sitting by the green mountain and touching the wind, the yellow birds hold books and sleep," which also shows that his heart is open and free of vulgarity. This is worlds apart from the general politicians who are unwilling to be lonely and are trying to make a comeback!

### Appreciation

— Wang Baili

Appreciation is about distinguishing the quality of things, not about commenting on the nobility or baseness of people, this is the rule. However, without a profound and perceptive person, few are not bound by their eyes and ears. As the saying goes, only when there is a Bole in the world, then there are horses that can travel a thousand miles. But relying on ears instead of eyes has been the case since ancient times, not starting from today. Here are a few examples for ridicule.

Zhang Shuai of the Liang Dynasty was intelligent from a young age and loved to write poetry. At the age of sixteen, he had accumulated more than two thousand poems. Yu Na, upon seeing them, criticized them severely. Therefore, he burned them all one day, and wrote more poems to show Na, claiming that they were written by Shen Yue. Na read them and shook his head, praising each sentence, and Shuai then slowly said: "These are also my works." Na was greatly ashamed. Sun Guoting, a famous calligrapher (or said master) of the Tang Dynasty, used to present his proud works to the contemporary dukes and ministers. The dukes and ministers did not know his name and lightly criticized them. Sun then pretended to use a general label and titled them with ancient names, and then the wise and the foolish changed their attitudes, following each other and competing for appreciation. Quality depends on the importance of the person, and this is largely the case. What is appreciation! However, those who can truly appreciate are not lacking in ancient times, such as Xue Zhu who recognized the Qingping sword, Bian He who distinguished the jade, and Cai Yong who did not appreciate and Sun Yang who did not look back casually. This is especially true. As for Gu Kuang of the Tang Dynasty, appreciating Bai Juyi's poems is even more rare: According to Bai Juyi, he once visited Duke Gu with his works. Duke Gu looked at his name and said, "The price of rice in the capital is expensive, and it is not easy to live in." When he read his work, he said, "If you get the meaning of it, living here is not difficult, the previous words were just a joke!" Therefore, he praised him, and his name was greatly shaken. What I mean by rare is that Duke Gu was arrogant at first and then respectful, and he could truly value quality over people. The world is full of chaos, all because they do not know their mistakes, but there are many who clearly know their mistakes but do not change themselves, but continue to act against their hearts. As for Duke Gu, he can be sarcastic.

Miss America

### The Self-Promotion of Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

"There are none who do not love fame after three generations," this saying can be universally applied, both in China and abroad, in ancient and modern times. And Miss America's popularity is unmatched among her peers. "Loving fame" is not necessarily a bad thing, it is valuable to "love fame without falsehood," and Miss America is almost qualified to be said to "love fame without falsehood." To give an example, a famous Shanghai dancer appearing at the Paramount Ballroom made 20,000 yuan on the first day, actually a 30% discount, only making 6,000 yuan. And even this 6,000 yuan was not the actual amount received, which is somewhat close to "loving fame with falsehood." Americans hate deception the most, so they only "love fame" but can definitely achieve a degree of "no falsehood." They have various methods of self-promotion, especially good at borrowing external forces, but they do not forcibly create situations. Their versatility allows them to participate in and delve into various groups and occasions, and to stand out. It can almost be said that most Miss America contestants are proficient in poetry, literature, music, oil painting, swimming, skating, equestrianism, dancing, ball sports, poker, and drinking. They can attend all diplomatic banquets or social parties and are sure to have a performance appropriate to their status.

One Miss jumped with a foreign envoy or soldier in a dance, and the next day a photo was published in the newspaper, and that Miss was also dragged along for a while. I went to the University of San Francisco to find Martha. She accompanied me on a tour of the school and introduced many female students. The next day, the local newspaper published a news item in the school scene column saying that Miss Martha of the University of San Francisco and a Chinese Air Force major were on good terms. Obviously, that news was Martha's self-promotion. She was able to gain the favor of a Chinese Air Force major, and her status naturally improved.

An old lady in Washington invited me to tea at her apartment, and invited more than a dozen local writers to accompany us. The newspaper published news saying that female writer Mrs. So-and-so held a grand garden party, with Chinese writer Major So-and-so in attendance. In reality, her home had no garden at all. A dozen or so people crammed into a living room. Everyone enjoyed a cup of coffee and two cookies, and she used it as publicity material.

In a pharmacy in San Marcos, I happened to meet a woman named Freddie Onas. There was basically no friendship between us, but she took the opportunity to publicize that a Chinese major loved her very much. Therefore, her friends gave her a nickname, called "Chinese Doll," meaning that she was a toy of the Chinese, and she became known as a Chinese doll.

At one time, the Chinese were quite popular in the United States, and making Chinese friends became a trend. The Chinese were quite generous with money, and of course it was easy to win the favor of Miss America. There were even many Miss America contestants who got engaged and married to Chinese men. The newspaper published this news with fancy borders, believing it to be a special report on promoting diplomatic relations and promoting peace. In fact, those news reports were all published by Miss America, who asked acquaintances in the newspaper office to publish them. At least her name could be exposed in the newspaper, and she could show off. At that time, marrying a Chinese man was a fashionable thing to do. (18)

Reader Consultation　Legal Explanation

### Wife Leaves Home and Doesn't Return, Husband Fears Criminal Charges - A Domestic Dispute

Editor: Mr. Jia married Ms. Yi last spring. Up to now, it has been over a year, and the couple's relationship is still considered harmonious. However, Yi is naturally arrogant and prone to stirring up trouble. Whenever there is a disagreement between husband and wife, she often attempts suicide. If she dies, it will be difficult to distinguish right from wrong, and she will inevitably be falsely accused by Yi's family. Half a month ago, Yi left home again due to a quarrel. Now there are several questions I would like you to answer in detail. Yi is naive in knowledge and action and has repeatedly threatened suicide. If she is made to write a letter of repentance and asked someone to act as a witness, can this be used as strong evidence in the future that Yi is habitually suicidal in the event of an accident? Yi has now left without informing and has taken jewelry with her. Can she be charged with desertion? If Yi lives in her parents' home for a long time, and Jia does not send anyone to urge her to return, can Yi's family accuse him of abandonment or falsely accuse him of abuse? Is there a time limit for the establishment of the crime of abandonment? If Yi lives in her parents' home for a long time, can Yi's family report Yi's disappearance to the court and accuse Jia?

[Lawyer Fu Kuang's Answer] Yi's letter of repentance and her suicide are two separate matters. If Jia has no incitement or bullying, there is no causal relationship with her suicide, and he is not guilty. Yi taking her own jewelry elsewhere does not constitute the crime of theft. This is because the law on husband and wife property clearly stipulates it. Yi lives in her parents' home for a long time, and Jia has no abuse or other acts. If there is positive proof, he is not guilty. Refer to Article 294 of the Criminal Law for the regulations, there is no time limit. Yi's mother's family groundlessly accusing Jia is not allowed by law.

Lost Items Notice: Our newspaper's reader, Mr. Xu Faxing, took the express train from Beijing at 10:00 PM on October 9th and arrived at the North Station on the 10th. Because he had to rush to catch the Hangzhou train, he entrusted a classmate to take care of his luggage. On November 3rd, the person returned home from Hangzhou and found that the bedding was missing, including a cotton quilt (the quilt cover is green printed silk), a cotton mattress, a new cotton wadding, and an old gray floral military blanket wrapped outside. If any kind-hearted person or station worker finds it, please write to Xu at No. 94 Longmen Road, Baxianqiao, Shanghai. Mr. Xu is willing to give generous rewards and will definitely keep his word.
