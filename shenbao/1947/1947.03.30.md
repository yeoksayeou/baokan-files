[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The first standing committee meeting of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee was held at 3:00 PM on the 29th. 178 people attended. Chairman Sun Ke reported on the Legislative Yuan's review of various laws and regulations related to the implementation of constitutionalism, focusing on three points: (1) The government has decided to promulgate various laws and regulations on April 1st. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan must complete the legislative procedures within three months. Also, because this committee has not yet been established, various laws and regulations have not been submitted to this committee for study. (2) Regarding personnel matters, the original chairman of this committee was designated to be Chairman Chiang, but because Chairman Chiang was unable to handle both positions, he designated me to serve. The position of Secretary-General will be held by Hong Lanyou. (3) The Standing Committee was established today, and the Research Committee, Review Committee, and Publicity Committee will also be established today.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The first meeting of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee was held at 3:40 PM on the 29th in the conference room on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. Chairman Sun Ke delivered a speech, reporting on the establishment of various committees of the association, the process of preparation, and, in his capacity as President of the Legislative Yuan, reported on the Legislative Yuan's recent review of various laws and regulations related to the implementation of the constitution. Subsequently, four vice-chairmen, Zeng Qi, Xu Chuanlin, Mo Dehui, and Zhang Ji, delivered speeches separately. Following this, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou announced Chairman Chiang's telegram to the committee and reported on important documents of the committee. Immediately after, the draft of the committee's procedural rules was discussed. More than 20 committee members spoke. After discussion, the following was resolved: (1) The chairman will designate three people from each of the four committees to form a review committee to review the committee's procedural rules, and then submit it to the general meeting for discussion. The designated members are Zhang Yuanfa, Huang Boya, Xi Yuhua, He Yangling, Liu Tianchu, Zhang Zhongyou, Chen Yixiu, Su Xianyang, Xu Tianzong, Zhou Shusheng, Wang Landan, and Zheng Tianshi, totaling twelve committee members. Vice-Chairman Mo Dehui will be the convener. (2) The committee will write to the National Government requesting that relevant constitutional laws and regulations be submitted to the committee for review. (3) The session is tentatively scheduled for three days, with review meetings held every day at 9:00 AM and general meetings at 3:00 PM, adjourning at 6:00 PM.

[Another telegram] The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association held its first meeting on the 29th. Chairman Chiang's telegram to the association reads as follows: "To the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee: Implementing constitutionalism and realizing democracy is the final goal to which the Founding Father devoted his entire life, and it is also the aspiration that the Chinese Kuomintang has pursued together with the people of the whole country for decades. Although there have been difficulties, the convening of the National Assembly has suffered setbacks, but those who have worked hard and strived to implement constitutionalism have persevered despite repeated setbacks. Finally, in November of the year following the victory of the War of Resistance, the National Assembly was convened and the Constitution was enacted. This is all thanks to the spirit of the Founding Father and the sacrifice of the blood of countless revolutionary and anti-Japanese martyrs. It is a matter of common gratification for the government and the people. However, the preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism is complex and time is short. The government urges all responsible departments to step up their efforts, and it relies on your committee to pool your wisdom and efforts to advance together in order to complete this great undertaking as scheduled. Recalling that in November of the 32nd year, when the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association was established, Zhongzheng once said: "We should not only pay attention to constitution-making, but also pay attention to constitutional implementation, so that after the constitution is promulgated, especially in the first decade or decade, it can be implemented effectively and smoothly, without obstacles or disputes." This kind of expectation is even more relevant today. Although a complete constitution has been made, how to ensure its effective, smooth, unobstructed, and dispute-free implementation in the future is the most important preparatory work at present, and it is also the most noble task of your committee. It is hoped that all members will remember the hardships of the Founding Father and the martyrs and the people of the whole country in building the country, the people's earnest expectations for constitutionalism, and the importance of their own tasks. Strive together and provide as much assistance as possible, so that the great cause of national reconstruction can be completed as scheduled. I am extremely hopeful. Now, as your committee is established and holds its first meeting, I express my sincere wishes. Please be aware. Chiang Kai-shek, Government Document of March 29th."

[Central News Agency, Our City News] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning.

He is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight.

### The Authorities' Approach to Reorganizing the Government; Purely Based on Meritocracy; The Youth Party is Discussing and Drafting a List of Government Committee Members Today

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Diplomatic circles report: US Secretary of State Marshall is currently meeting in Moscow. There has been no recent urging of the National Government to reorganize. His statement when he left China was that he hoped that the National Government would accommodate various parties and non-partisan free individuals in addition to Kuomintang personnel, intending to allow leaders from all sectors of society who are inclined to freedom to join the government and cooperate with the Kuomintang to work together for the preparatory work of China's constitutionalism and to overcome this difficult period. This time, the authorities are reorganizing the government entirely voluntarily. The hope is to cooperate with the Kuomintang, so it will not be absolutely limited to parties, and will be purely based on meritocracy. This is the latest trend in the government reorganization issue.

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The Youth Party's specific demands for participating in the government focus on personnel aspects. From the central government to the local governments, from government agencies to public opinion organs and educational and financial institutions, they hope to have some allocation. A certain central committee member of the Youth Party has called for a "thousand-person movement," meaning that the number of participants will reach as many as 1,000. The government side focuses on discussing the reorganization of the central political institutions first. Other matters cannot be discussed yet, so it is difficult for all parties to reach an agreement at this time.

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Zeng Qi, Liu Siying, Liu Dongyan, Xie Chengping, Lin Li, and Zhang Bolun of the Youth Party took the night train to Shanghai on the 29th to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting of the Youth Party in Shanghai on the 30th to discuss issues related to participating in the reorganization of the government. The list may be decided after the meeting. Today, Zeng told reporters: The policy guidelines jointly discussed by all parties have been approved by the party's Central Committee and are awaiting timely announcement. As for the Youth Party's participation in the reorganization of the government, it is still hoped that the government can open up comprehensive local political power so that people from all parties can participate. Zeng also said: The announcement of the list of government reorganization members is expected to be realized in early April.

[Central News Agency, Our City News] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing last night and is expected to arrive this morning. Chen Qitian returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. The Central Standing Committee meeting of the party is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM today to discuss and draft a list of government committee members.

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Xu Chuanlin, Yang Junming, and seven others from the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th. Xu and Yang then visited Hong Lanyou and attended the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association in the afternoon. In the evening, they visited Wu Tiecheng for a long talk. Yang Junming told reporters: The Central Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party has already passed the policy guidelines, but these guidelines cannot be confused with the reorganization of the government. Therefore, it is solemnly stated that the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet discussed the nomination list and participation in the government, and it cannot be said that there is any decision. The words that have been spread outside are merely speculation.

[Our News] Secretary-General Lei Zhen told reporters yesterday that the main reason why the Democratic Socialist Party's list of government committee members has not been submitted is the consideration of candidates. He denied the rumors that the party demanded a thorough reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the opening of local political power. He also believes that the list may be submitted in the shortest possible time. Jiang Yuntian did not go to Beijing the night before. Yesterday, he visited Lei to discuss the matter and also said that the delay in submitting the list was entirely due to the candidate issue. Once the list is decided, he will go to Beijing with Lei.

### Central Youth Corps Secretary-General Chen Delivers a Broadcast Speech to the Nation's Youth

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Secretary-General Chen Cheng of the Central Youth Corps broadcast to the nation's youth from the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 4th Youth Day (29th). The original speech is as follows:

"Today is our first Youth Day and Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs since our victorious return to the capital. Recalling today thirty-six years ago, the martyrs of Huanghuagang, at the cost of shedding their blood, fought against the autocratic government of the Qing Dynasty. Although this battle was not successful, the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, who did not care about success or failure, disregarded their own interests, and pressed forward courageously, has shaken the world and awakened the compatriots of the whole country. Therefore, the Battle of Huanghuagang was the starting point for the success of the revolution and the harbinger of the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. Today, as we face this great memorial day, admiring the偉縝 of the martyrs of the past, we should encourage each other to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the martyrs and continue to work hard to complete the great cause of national reconstruction.

First of all, we should have a clear understanding of the current situation. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist Party has actively expanded its territory and carried out armed rebellion. The consistent policy of the central government has been to seek peaceful unification and active construction in order to relieve the suffering of the people. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference and the Military Three-Person Group were established to engage in peace talks. However, the CCP used the cover of political consultation to expand its strength, attempting to seize power by force. Recently, not only did it refuse peace talks, but it also abandoned the constitution legally formulated by the National Assembly, refused to recognize the central government and all treaties it had signed with foreign countries, and even implemented total mobilization and launched a full-scale rebellion, such as the previous attack on Xuzhou, the threat to the capital, the invasion of Changchun, and the obstruction of the government's takeover of the Northeast, which are the more obvious examples. Under these circumstances, the central government's hope for a political solution has been shattered, and the government can no longer tolerate delays. Therefore, it cannot口　　　　　　the Chinese Communist Party is actually a violent and treasonous group, and can no longer be regarded as an ordinary and legal political party like those of other countries. Unless the CCP can repent, voluntarily stop the violent rebellion, and disarm, it must be thoroughly resolved. Only in this way can the obstacles to peace be removed and the mission of national reconstruction be completed. This is the first point that I hope the youth of the whole country will especially recognize clearly.

Secondly, with a clear understanding, we must further study whether the central government has confidence in suppressing the rebellion. This is easy to see by looking at the fact that the CCP is increasingly heading towards self-destruction. What the CCP is doing is not only an act that violates the interests of the country and the nation, but also a betrayal of the country and the nation. The result will inevitably be abandoned by the people of the whole country. This is beyond doubt. Moreover, the CCP's cruel and tyrannical behavior has aroused the people's unusual disgust and hatred, and it has become detached from the people of the whole country. We know that no force can survive without the people. This is a universal principle throughout history, both in China and abroad. The CCP specializes in threatening with killing, engaging in "struggle" and "liquidation" everywhere. The people have long been in extreme pain and wish to die together. Therefore, the people welcome the national army everywhere, assist the national army, and the vast number of youth voluntarily participate in the army to kill the bandits is also increasing. The recent rapid recovery of Yan'an, the old nest of the CCP, is the result of military-civilian cooperation. On the other hand, the demoralization of the Communist Party's military is also one of the reasons for its failure. Many young people were willing to join the Eighth Route Army in the past for the sake of resistance. The motive was originally pure, but now they have discovered that they have been forced to become bandits and regret it. Therefore, as long as there is an opportunity, they all rush to surrender to the national army. Even the power of the Communist bandits cannot stop this. This shows that the Communist bandits have become universally abandoned today and will soon collapse. Therefore, there is really no question about our ability to suppress the rebellion of the CCP.

Third, the direction of our current efforts, in addition to actively suppressing the rebellion and saving the people, is to earnestly strive to implement the Three Principles of the People and complete the task of national reconstruction. The purpose of the national revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People, namely, to realize a national social system, a democratic political system, and a people's livelihood economic system, in order to establish a new China that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we believe that the implementation of nationalism has already achieved considerable success. As for democracy, since the successful conclusion of the National Assembly last year and the promulgation of the constitution, we believe that the implementation of democracy has a good foundation, but it still needs our efforts to realize it. As for the Principle of People's Livelihood, in addition to following the teachings of the Founding Father and implementing equal land rights and regulation of capital, the most important thing at present is to engage in productive construction. The youth of the whole country should pay attention to the improvement of production technology and strive for scientific research in order to change the old-fashioned thinking of scholars who "excel in learning and then become officials" and eliminate the bad phenomenon of the separation of knowledge and production, and the separation of hands and brains in the past. We must cultivate well-rounded knowledge youth who can use both their hands and brains, so that they can devote themselves to all departments of national production and construction, become pilots, engineers, primary school teachers, border reclamation workers, and village self-government members, taking on the darkest, most basic, most arduous, and most dangerous work. Only then can a new China based on the Three Principles of the People be quickly realized in our hands.

Youths across the nation, the road of revolution is tortuous and difficult, but it cannot stop us from moving forward. The cause of national reconstruction is arduous and complex, but it must not depress our spirit. As long as we recognize the revolutionary environment, hold firm to our revolutionary faith, and give full play to the revolutionary spirit, the era mission of revolutionary national reconstruction can be successfully completed in our hands."

### Hundreds of Representatives of Vocational Groups Petition the Legislative Yuan Yesterday; Continued Discussion of the Draft Law on Election and Recall of Legislative Yuan Members

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The Legislative Yuan continued to discuss the draft law on election and recall of Legislative Yuan members on the morning of the 29th. President Sun Ke said that the most intense dispute today was still over the issue of quotas. Fu Tongxian suggested increasing a clause for special national living habits in the inland according to the constitution. President Sun did not agree, believing that if all kinds of religious people participated, "the Legislative Yuan would become a religious convention." In order to establish a modern country, it is necessary to break this concept. Sun Jiulu also believed that if everyone was fighting for quotas for themselves, the issue of quotas would never be resolved. He hoped that everyone could adopt an objective attitude and discuss it calmly. Then, a vote was held, and it was resolved to increase the number of Mongolian representatives from the original 15 to 28, the number of Tibetan representatives from 8 to 10, the number of ethnic minority representatives from 5 to 6, and the number of overseas Chinese representatives from 16 to 19. When discussing the number of vocational representatives, Liu Butong pointed out that the implementation of constitutionalism is "returning power to the people, not returning power to the professions." Eight million vocational representatives can elect 56 people, which is not too few. Zhong Tianxin said that since vocational representatives call themselves "outstanding elements," they can compete in the regions. When discussing the proportion of women representatives, President Sun's wife arrived at this time, and the female legislators took the opportunity to speak up. Several male legislators argued on the basis of reason, and President Sun waved to signal that they could come forward to help. It was resolved to maintain the original plan, that is, for each quota of legislators with less than 10 seats, the quota for women to be elected is one, and for those exceeding 10 seats, there should be one woman elected for every 10 seats. At this point in the discussion, more than 200 vocational representatives held flags and came to the Legislative Yuan to petition. Liu Kejun and Lin Bin met with the representatives and persuaded them with polite words. The discussion continued in the Legislative Yuan. Chen Guyuan proposed a large electoral district method. Sun Ke and others believed that the method agreed upon the other day was only a technical district division that was inappropriate, and there was no problem in principle. If a large electoral district system is adopted, it will be difficult to recall legislators in the future. It was resolved to adjourn the meeting in the afternoon so that the Constitutional and Legal Committee could review this issue and submit it to the meeting on the 30th.

### Xie Zhigang is in Xi'an; Discussing Emergency Relief in Northern Shaanxi

[Our Xi'an Office, 29th] Xie Zhigang, the supervisor sent by the Ministry of Social Affairs to Shaanxi, arrived here yesterday. Today, he is consulting with relevant parties to organize an emergency relief team to distribute 1.5 billion relief funds in the recovered areas of northern Shaanxi. Another meeting will be held on the 31st. After determining the detailed plan, the team will coordinate the handling.

### The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East; Temporary Headquarters Set Up in Shanghai; Approved by the United Nations Economic and Social Council

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today approved a resolution in the final batch of proposals to establish the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, composed of member states Australia, China, France, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Siam, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US. The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East enjoys the same powers as the Economic Commission for Europe. Both committees have the authority to take concerted action on economic recovery and development and to make recommendations to governments under the general scope of the Economic and Social Council. Its geographical scope includes British North Borneo, Sarawak, Burma, Ceylon, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Siam. However, the UK representative opposed the proposal by Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun to make Shanghai the temporary headquarters of the committee. The final resolution was that the first meeting of the committee should be held in Shanghai in the near future and a report on the investigation of facts in the Far East should be submitted to the first general meeting of the council in 1948. The aforementioned resolution to establish the Far East Economic Commission was approved surprisingly easily because the Soviet representative did not attend today's final meeting.

[Another telegram] The United Nations Economic and Social Council voted today to approve Shanghai as the location of the temporary headquarters of the newly established Far East Economic Commission. Only the United Kingdom expressed opposition, citing the high cost of living in Shanghai. However, the UK's opposition was defeated by a vote of eleven to one in the council vote.

### Zhao Jiaxiang Summoned to Beijing to Report Dalian Situation to the Chairman

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command Headquarters, was summoned by the Chairman and arrived in Beijing by plane at 5 p.m. on the 29th. He reported and requested instructions on the Dalian situation and takeover work. According to Zhao, "Dalian is not a local problem of the Northeast, but an overall problem of China. As for the various preparatory works before the takeover, Huang, the Chief Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Government Office stationed in Shenyang, has been actively preparing and everything is ready. However, the current situation in Dalian is still not as simple as it is rumored. Although the Soviet side has agreed to withdraw its troops from Dalian, there are still illegal armed forces entrenched there, engaging in sabotage. This is the biggest obstacle to the takeover work." Zhao is still very concerned about the takeover of Dalian. He will visit the Chairman and General Chen on the 30th, and also visit Foreign Minister Wang and Mayor Gong separately.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 29th] Zhao Jiaxiang and Zhang Tingmeng, Commander of the First Air Force District, flew to Beijing by special plane at 10:30 a.m. on the 29th and will return in four days.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 29th] As the takeover of Dalian approaches, Tai Shihui has convened meetings again in the past two days. Those who participated on the 28th included Zhao Jiaxiang, Zhang Jianfei, etc. Zhao's trip to Beijing is related to resolving the communist issue in the Lushun-Dalian area. In addition, Wang Zhimin has been appointed as the Deputy Director of the Datong Unified Takeover Branch.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 20th] Most of the Soviet troops in Jinzhou and Dalian have withdrawn south. There are only more than 200 Soviet troops left at Shihe Station, with one field gun. About 600 Soviet troops and more than 20 trucks are located at San Shili Pu south of Shihe. Twenty miles further south at Taitou, there is a Soviet baggage train, with an unknown number of soldiers. At Dafangshen Station south of Jinzhou, there are 1,200 Soviet troops, including a battalion of artillery, with more than ten artillery pieces. More than 10,000 Soviet troops are gathered at Xiajiahe southwest of Jinzhou, and about 1,000 Soviet troops are at Yingchengzi. The Datong materials and machinery, and locomotives, have been looted by the Soviets. Cotton, firewood and grain are now being shipped to Lushun all night long. Only three locomotives remain in Datong.

[Our Andong Dispatch, 29th] The joint management negotiations of the Andong Shuifeng Power Plant have not made any progress. The Soviet side sent a note to our side on the 27th, stating: This issue should be negotiated with the Korean side after the establishment of the Korean Joint Government. The Andong Police Bureau, which is responsible for the negotiations, is seeking instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to Major General Leikefu, who went to Korea last year to negotiate with the Soviet side, he hopes to agree on temporary management measures with the Soviet side.

### National Army in Northern Shaanxi Recovers Yanchuan, the Communist Remnants in the Suburbs of Yan'an Are Completely Eliminated, and the Communist Security Regiment North of Dazhai Is Annihilated

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] The National Army, which advanced to the outskirts of Yanchuan, defeated the stubborn Communist army ten miles away from the city at 10 a.m. on the 29th, and entered the city at noon, immediately recovering the city.

[Another Dispatch] According to people from Yan'an, the Communist remnants in the suburbs of Yan'an have been completely eliminated by the National Army, and local order has been restored. Residents who were forced to leave by the Communist army are returning one after another, about 1,000 to 2,000 people every day. In addition, daily necessities in the city, which the Communist army did not have time to take away when they fled, were mostly buried underground and are now being searched for.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] War News from Northern Shaanxi: (1) The Central Route National Army, with Wayaobao as its target, encountered the Communist Security Regiment at Xiaojiahe, north of Dazhai, on the morning of the 28th. The entire regiment of more than 1,000 men of the Communist 8th Army was annihilated. In the afternoon, more than 20 heavy artillery shells were fired at Wayaobao, and the left and right wings jointly launched an encirclement of Wayaobao. (2) The National Army under Yulin, taking Wujiapo in Mizhi County as the starting point, divided its troops to search for Renyicun and Hanjiacha in the east. The north and south National Army are now 180 li apart and will inevitably have a fierce battle in Suide before they can join forces. He Long, Lin Boqu, and others are all in Suide. More than 30,000 Communist troops continue to cross the river at the Wubu Ferry to Shanxi. (3) It is rumored that the city route National Army recovered Bao'an County on the 28th. The Communist army in the Sanbian area is facing pressure from the west, south, and north and has a tendency to withdraw east. Its "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Government" moved to Qingyangcha on the border of Anding Station on the 27th.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 28th] News from Yuxian, Mao Zedong and Zhu De arrived in Yuxian with cadres on the 17th. People fleeing from various military regions in the occupied area unanimously stated that the morale of the Communist cadres was extremely low after the National Army recovered Yan'an. Central Communist cadres in Mount Wutai called Xu Xiangqian "Xu the Traitor," for unknown reasons. A large number of wooden boats are concentrated between Yongheguan and Wubu. The Communist army in Suide Qingjian is collecting a large number of carpenters to build ships. A large number of wounded Communist soldiers in northern Shaanxi were transported eastward from the army ferry before the 26th, scattered in various villages in Lishi. On the afternoon of the 28th, an airplane reconnaissance revealed that there were more than 5,000 Communist troops and more than 200 donkeys between the army ferry and Kehuzhai, advancing along the north bank of the river. According to military authorities, judging from the recent war situation in northern Shaanxi, it is increasingly evident that the Communist Party lacks military talent. After the complete collapse of northern Shaanxi, the Communist army will inevitably retreat to northwestern Shanxi. However, northwestern Shanxi is sparsely populated and cannot be relied upon to fulfill its "entrepreneurial" ambitions. Escaping north to Inner Mongolia is tantamount to self-destruction, and advancing east to northeastern Shanxi will lead to easier annihilation. Although southeastern Shanxi is surrounded on the west side, it has a large area and population, and the output of coal, iron, and grain is abundant, making it more supportive to resist. It is also convenient to connect with the Communist army in Hebei and Shandong. In short, northwestern and northeastern Shanxi are both old nests of the Communist army, and even if the headquarters is moved to southeastern Shanxi, it will not be easily abandoned. The serious situation in Shanxi Province is on the eve of arrival.

[Central News Agency, Guihua, 29th] (1) Tu Wang, the League Chief of Yikezhao League, sent Chizhongyi, a named Zhasak of the Junwang Banner, to Zhangjiakou on the 28th to visit Director General Fu, and reported on the recent situation of Yikezhao League. (2) Qi Yushan's troops recovered the western stronghold of Wushen Banner and are advancing south across the Hongliuliu River. (3) Ma Hongkui's troops have advanced to Huamachi and Sanduandi (within the territory of Duozake Banner), and the Communist army in Dingbian has been threatened.

### Communist Army in Shandong Is at the End of Its Rope, Frequent Mobilizations Are Still Plotting to Invade Qingdao, National Army on the Jinpu Railway Is Conducting Extensive Sweeps

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 29th] The National Army on the left side of the Xu-Ji section of the Jinpu Line has been actively sweeping eastward since the two routes joined forces. As of the evening of the 29th, the remaining Communist army in the triangular area of Changqing, Feicheng, and Pingyin has been mostly eliminated. It is now echoing the National Army advancing north on the front of Dawenkou, actively advancing towards Zhangxia, Jieshou, Taian, and Dongbeibu. According to qualified estimators, the Jinpu front of Dawenkou Zhangxia can be cleared within half a month.

[Another Dispatch] On the Jinpu Line passing through Taian and south of Jinan, the Communist army's front line is shaken and reinforcements are being sent to resist at Qiweitou. The Communist army surrounding Jinan launched a fierce attack on the area east of Licheng on the night of the 27th. After a bloody battle all night, they were repelled by the National Army on the morning of the 28th. The periphery of Qingdao is becoming tense, and the Communist army is mobilizing frequently. The 5th and 6th Divisions and the 4th Brigade of the Jie were transferred east from the east of Huaixian, seemingly to increase the surrounding of Qingdao and prepare to attack Qingdao. The National Army has taken strict precautions.

[Another Dispatch] From here through Changqing, Pingyin, Dong'e, Wenshang to the Jinning Line, since the National Army cleared it, Jinan is no longer an isolated city, and has gained another corridor area to connect with the outside world on land. According to the above-mentioned line, there was an original highway that could connect to Xuzhou. Cars on the Ji-Mi section have been running smoothly for a long time. According to Director Zhou Fuqi of the Highway Bureau of this province, he will send personnel to inspect the above-mentioned section within days in order to repair it. It is estimated that it should be possible to repair and open to traffic before the end of April, barring accidents.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] After the three routes of the National Army advancing north along the Jinpu Railway joined forces with the Jinan National Army, they launched extensive sweeps against the Communist army on the line of Jinan, Feicheng, Dawenkou, Sishui, and Feixian on the 29th.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 29th] The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng, the Communist army of more than 20,000 men north of the Yellow River in northern Shandong, have recently fled from Xinxian Xinggu to Puyang area on the border of Hebei and Henan, attempting to threaten the Pinghan Railway. In addition, about 6,000 men from two regiments of the Communist 1st Division fled to Changcun, north of Huixian, west of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan on the morning of the 28th. That night, they launched a fierce attack on Huixian. The defending troops fought bravely to resist, and fierce battles were still underway as of 3 p.m. on the 29th. The Communist army in the mountainous area of Xuliang Baishan, northwest of Bo'ai in northern Henan, has been mobilizing frequently in recent days, plotting to move.

Another Communist army brigade is also rushing to build a long embankment along the Baoding-Tianjin Canal, attempting to form a natural defense line in central Hebei. It is also heard that they plan to set up a gate in Tongkou Town and release water westward to flood Baoding during the flood season. The National Army is now preparing to mobilize 250,000 civilians to build a pincer-shaped embankment from Rongcheng to the east of Baoding by providing work relief. The water embankments on both sides face each other, and heavy troops are stationed to guard them.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Related sources said: Recently, the Communist troops in eastern Shanxi and Hebei are successively concentrating in the Fuping mountainous area in western Hebei. The Wangsongzhen Airport, east of Fuping, is being rushed to be repaired.

### Shang Zhen's Talk in Tokyo: American Public Opinion Believes That Greater Assistance Should Be Given to Us; Feng Yuxiang Has Indeed Purchased a House in San Francisco

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] This morning, General Shang Zhen met with reporters here and said: American public opinion believes that greater assistance should be given to China at this time. He is returning to China via the United States. He said: Truman's recent call for full support for Greece and Turkey was criticized as conflicting with the US policy towards China, not only a few people pointed out its favoritism towards the Chinese Communist Party, but also the inappropriateness of expelling the Greek Communist Party. Shang said he had met with Marshall before Marshall went to Moscow, and Marshall said that the Moscow conference would not have any secret decisions affecting China's welfare. Shang discussed overseas Chinese in the United States, saying that there is an urgent need for a broad and comprehensive policy. He said that the current overseas Chinese are like lost sheep, and there is no doubt that they have patriotic enthusiasm. During the war, many overseas Chinese donated 80% of their savings to the government of their motherland. Their education has been seriously neglected. Their ignorance has led to actions that damage China's reputation. The biggest bad habits of ignorant overseas Chinese are opium smoking and gambling. When asked about Feng Yuxiang's recent activities, Shang Zhen confirmed the previous reports, that is, General Feng, who was ordered by the government to study river management in the United States, has purchased a house in San Francisco. Shang said that he was summoned back to China by Chairman Chiang and did not know if he would be able to return to the United States. Shang will take a boat to Shanghai this afternoon, along with more than a thousand overseas Chinese returning to their country.

[Central News Agency, Keelung, 29th] The ten-thousand-ton dry dock in Keelung Port was originally scheduled to hold a completion ceremony on March 2, but it was repeatedly postponed due to the "February 28th" incident. A simple ceremony was finally held. The ten-thousand-ton dry dock in Keelung Port was built by the Transportation Bureau of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office before the restoration. It officially started construction in April of the Republic of China Year 32 (1943) and was scheduled to be completed within two years. However, due to the intensification of the war, it was suspended in April of Year 34 (1945). A total of two years were spent, costing 2.1 million Japanese yen, but only three-quarters of the project was completed.

### Full Text of Economic Reform Plan

(8) Transportation 1. The central government should formally announce which railways are trunk lines and which are branch lines. The central government should fully operate the trunk lines, while the branch lines, under the management system of the central government, should be permitted and encouraged for local and private operation. 2. Highway construction, except for the national highways between provincial capitals, which should be built by the central government, the rest should be encouraged for construction by the provinces under the standards of the central government, with the central government assisting with financial and human resources. Certain branch lines should be encouraged by the provinces for construction by the counties. Highway transportation should be encouraged for private operation. 3. Airports should be operated by the government, and the aviation industry should be vigorously encouraged for private operation. 4. The central government should dredge the trunk waterways, the provinces should dredge the branch waterways, and the counties should dredge the smallest branch waterways. The central government should operate important ports, and the cities should operate secondary ports. All waterways and ports operated by the provinces and cities should be assisted by the central government with financial and human resources. The shipping industry should be encouraged for private operation as much as possible. 5. Telegraphs should be operated by the central government. Wireless stations for special needs in the sea and air, such as aviation and shipping, should be allowed to be set up by themselves under the management of the central government. 6. Long-distance telephone trunk lines should be laid by the central government, and provincial branch lines should be laid by the provinces, with the central government assisting. County and township branch lines should be laid by the counties, with the provinces assisting. 7. City telephones should be encouraged for private operation under the management that coordinates with long-distance calls.

(9) Finance 1. The government should quickly guarantee and support agricultural production to increase land tax revenue, guarantee and support industrial production to increase direct goods and consumption tax revenue, guarantee and support trade to increase customs revenue, and guarantee and support the salt industry to increase salt tax revenue. The financial strength of the entire nation should be supported by the production capacity and total income of hundreds of millions of people. 2. The central and local financial revenue and expenditure system revised last year has made county (city) level finances more ample than before, but provincial level finances, with less revenue and vast expenditures, are out of balance. The central competent authorities should consult with the provincial governments to revise the system to ensure that local financial resources are sufficient to meet the needs of self-reliance. 3. The current tax rates for direct goods, customs, and salt taxes are not suitable for the current economic environment, which is why tax sources cannot be fully grasped and the burden on the people is uneven. Adjustments should be made. 4. The tax collection agencies should be adjusted, current sources should be tightly controlled, and tax collection procedures should be simplified to eliminate long-standing malpractices and increase tax revenue. 5. Enemy and puppet properties and surplus materials that have not yet been sold should be sold off as quickly as possible. Production and transportation enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to the people or have their shares sold to increase revenue. 6. In addition to consolidating tax revenue, the national treasury should seek funds from the people by issuing securities and ensure that those with financial resources bear a greater burden. 7. The survival or abolition of agencies should be determined based on the needs of national construction. Overly large agencies must be streamlined, and overlapping agencies must be merged. 8. Expenditures that are not urgently needed by the country and that are not conducive to production and construction must be saved and stopped.

(10) Grain Administration 1. Starting from the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the collection and borrowing of grain from provinces and cities should be stopped to reduce the burden on the people. The principal and interest of grain borrowed in previous years should be repaid. The central government should refer to the local grain prices at the time of maturity to determine the discount rate and allocate legal tender for repayment, instead of offsetting it against land tax, so as to facilitate repayment. 2. In the 36th year of the Republic (1947), provinces and cities should continue to temporarily collect actual objects for land tax to meet the needs of the country, but in areas where grain production is poor and transportation is inconvenient, legal tender should be collected instead. The areas where legal tender is collected and the standards for collecting legal tender should be investigated and determined separately by the Ministry of Food based on the circumstances. 3. The actual objects obtained from land tax collection should be allocated by the central government to purchase the portion belonging to the provinces, cities, and counties according to the standards for collecting legal tender in nearby areas collecting legal tender. The public grain from provinces and counties collecting legal tender nearby should still be used locally and should not be purchased to facilitate the overall planning of military food and to take into account local needs. 4. The grain agencies in counties and cities collecting legal tender should be abolished, and their affairs should be handled by the county and city governments. The county and city agencies collecting actual objects and the provincial-level grain agencies should be retained, and their expenses should be fully borne by the central government. 5. The Changping granary system urgently needs to be established. The preliminary plans for building warehouses and storing grain in important locations in the Yangtze River basin must be completed within this year. Local grain storage should also be strengthened, promoted, and universally implemented to increase reserves. 6. The Farmers Bank of China should actively promote agricultural warehouse pledge, agricultural product storage, and agricultural product transportation and sales businesses in order to use financial strength to assist the government in supporting production, controlling grain sources, and regulating surpluses and deficits.

(11) Guiding Floating Capital into the Right Track The biggest problem in the current economy is that floating capital is concentrated in one place, competing for speculation. The direction of floating capital is driven by speculation. To bring the economy into a normal state, on the one hand, fundamental policies are needed. On the other hand, it is first necessary to overcome the dominance of floating capital. Therefore, guiding floating capital to participate in production is the current important plan. The methods are: 1. The national bank should coordinate with the production and construction plan, give low-interest loans and guarantees to legitimate enterprises, quickly and reliably, so that legitimate enterprises

(12) Absorbing Foreign Capital to Strengthen Production and Construction 1. The government should welcome foreign capital in a preferential manner to help the development of domestic industry. 2. Certain types of industries can be jointly operated with foreign capital. 3. Facilitate overseas remittances, give preferential and fair exchange rates, and encourage and protect overseas Chinese investment, providing convenience for them to establish various domestic industries. 4. Register the foreign exchange assets of nationals deposited abroad and use them for domestic production and construction.

(13) Reasonably Solving the Treatment of Officers, Soldiers, Public Education Employees 1. Implement a rationing system so that officers, soldiers, and public education employees can maintain the minimum necessary life. 2. The government is responsible for solving the education problems of the children of officers, soldiers, and public education employees. 3. Strictly implement the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same place to reduce the phenomenon of disparate treatment of employees in various agencies.

(14) Severely Punishing Behaviors That Use Political Power to Facilitate Private Enterprises If officials and businessmen are not separated and public interests are used for private gain, good economic policies can be distorted. If some private enterprises receive special treatment, legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises will be destroyed. This is a prerequisite for the effective implementation of economic policies and must be strictly enforced.

(15) Improving Economic Organizations In order to promote cooperation between the government and the people and make the implementation of economic policies as beneficial as possible, it is necessary to take care of the overall situation and make overall plans to prevent the financial and economic situations from being separated and being one whole. In the past, the various ministries of the Executive Yuan each acted on their own, and the Economic Committee and others were only nominally set up. The private sector had no way to communicate and express their responses to economic policies. To remedy this, the methods are: 1. The government should improve the organization of the National Economic Committee and be responsible for designing, supervising, and implementing economic policies. 2. On the social side, a broad economic construction movement should be launched to improve the public's understanding and interest in economic construction, and to eliminate the difficulties of economic construction with the power of official-private cooperation.

Editorial

### Price Review Council at the Current Stage

The organization of the Price Review Council has been approved by the Municipal Council meeting and will be established soon. Since the victory, this is the third change to this organization. The first time was in the winter of the year before last, the second time was in the summer of last year, and this is the third time. Examining its organization and verifying its powers, it appears to be increasingly strict.

Because the first and second organizations had no legal basis, especially the first time, even the disposal methods for violating the negotiated prices had no legal recourse. Of course, it was very difficult to implement them. Therefore, after one or two meetings, nothing happened.

The second time, which has been implemented continuously until now, although it has not achieved remarkable success, it cannot be said that it has no effect. This is because (1) when the municipal government suppressed rice prices last summer, it did its best to take emergency measures, trying its best to equalize prices and constantly implementing sales, rather than just making empty promises. (2) The regulations on cracking down on violations of price limits and negotiated prices were repeatedly invoked. (3) Important industries such as food, oil, sugar, and coal were organized separately and negotiated prices separately, which was more practical. Therefore, when price fluctuations and rising winds were gradually intensifying, this method was applied in a timely manner and achieved a considerable effect in alleviating the situation.

The reorganization this time is based on the Economic Emergency Measures Program (4) on prices and wages, and on the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations and the Price Review Implementation Program. The legal basis is very strong, and there are many differences from the above two resolutions, as follows:

(1) This time, it is a national affair, which cannot be compared with the current local temporary measures. (2) The items for price negotiation are determined to be "main daily necessities," and others are not considered. The types are designated and announced by the local government in light of local conditions. (3) The procedures are strict, with provisions for preliminary review and review. (4) The disposal methods are clearly defined in accordance with the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations. (5) The composition of the members, in addition to the competent authorities and industry and commerce associations, also includes representatives of public opinion and security agencies, making the lineup relatively strong. (6) In addition to price evaluation, the powers of the Review Council also include "assisting in the behavior of violating negotiated prices," so that in addition to sitting and talking, it also has the responsibility to get up and act.

In short, the powers and scope of this new organization are clearer, and its content is richer. Therefore, it is expected to be more progressive than the present and the past when implemented. However, there are still a few issues that deserve to be reviewed beforehand, which are listed below:

1. Shanghai is the first industrial and commercial port in our country, and the situation is more complicated. Therefore, in terms of power, it is often difficult to achieve a unified effect because policies come from many sources. Merchants and people have to deal with them separately, and they often feel at a loss. For example, the Social Affairs Bureau also tried to negotiate prices for yarn and cloth in the past. However, in this port, the organization in charge of this matter is also the Textile Management Committee, and rayon is sold by the Central Trust Bureau. According to the actual situation, it seems that the price of yarn and cloth has been directly approved by the National Price Review Council. And gasoline, kerosene, etc., also have special circumstances. This state of divergence and complexity should be unified, and how to unify it should be studied.

2. Investigation and evidence collection Article 5 of the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations stipulates: "Regarding whether there are violations of price limits and negotiated prices, the police agency shall be responsible for the investigation in places where there is a police agency." This is not entirely consistent with the clause that the Review Council assists in reporting. Moreover, Article 5 of the Price Review Implementation Program and Article 3 of the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations stipulate that the competent authority is the Social Affairs Bureau in municipalities directly under the central government, but the Social Affairs Bureau has no clear provision for investigating alone or jointly. At the same time, the agencies responsible for investigation in Shanghai are not limited to the police bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, and sometimes they are not limited to local agencies. In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of the investigation and to reduce the doubts and troubles of merchants and people, this issue needs to be thoroughly clarified.

3. Re-negotiation Article 13 of the Price Review Implementation Program: When the cost of an item fluctuates sharply, and it is necessary to evaluate a new price, the price may be re-negotiated. However, the price shall not be increased before the negotiation and approval. This provision is of course very reasonable. However, the cost of items is now very easy to fluctuate sharply, and according to past practices, the evaluation of new prices often cannot keep up with market prices, resulting in black markets, disrupting the market, and making some of the so-called profiteers, hoarders, and speculators victims. At the same time, does the negotiated price follow the black market, or does the black market lead the negotiated price? It also loses the dignity of the negotiated price. This fact is commonly seen and heard, and it is really regrettable. After the implementation of the new price negotiation system, we do not want to see this kind of repeated mistakes being staged again and again. The key is that when the cost of the item does fluctuate sharply, the relevant merchants, especially the leaders of each industry, may as well collect all the documents and report honestly to the Review Council, applying for re-evaluation, and do not do it secretly and create a black market first. And the Review Council should also give sympathetic and reasonable consideration based on the facts. Do not put on a serious face and only talk official language, which will help promote the open black market.

4. Reporting according to law Anyone can report those who violate the approved negotiated price. This is clearly defined by law, but according to Article 4 of the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations, "Any informer who reports violations of price limits and negotiated prices listed in Article 2 shall have sufficient evidence to prove the violation, or other documents." Then, all kinds of empty talk or anonymous accusations can be ignored according to law. The intention of the legislation is of course to protect the good people and prevent them from being wronged or suffering unwarranted losses. The consideration is extremely thoughtful. This point is extremely important to the security of order and the spirit of the rule of law, and we hope that everyone will respect it. Fortunately, the Review Council is responsible for assisting in the reporting. If there is incomplete evidence! Or in the case of reports that are still doubtful, it may be handed over to the review committee for review first, in order to avoid wrongful or lenient handling and obtain a fair disposition.

The implementation of the Economic Emergency Measures Program takes stabilizing prices as its core, and stabilizing prices is achieved through the implementation of reviews. The task of the new Review Council this time is particularly important, which cannot be compared with the past and the present. Therefore, I have expressed my views briefly for public discussion. There is no need to rely on high-interest loans. 2. Stipulate the maximum amount of interest rates. High-interest loans exceeding the regulations will not be protected and will be punished. 3. During the transition period, national banks may as well absorb floating capital with the highest interest and transfer it to production. The government will subsidize the difference between the interest paid and received. 4. Allow people to purchase foreign exchange from the Central Bank at the listed price in gold for the purpose of purchasing approved imported goods, and allow gold to be used to preferentially purchase state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet properties sold by the government. 5. The government designates national banks to conduct gold savings deposits or issue gold bonds, all of which are given preferential interest and guaranteed, and a supervisory committee is specially formed to supervise them. 6. Crack down on speculation and manipulation and establish a sound and reasonable securities market.

### Marshall Suggests to the Council of Foreign Ministers That the Three Major Problems Should Be Resolved Quickly, and Minor Matters Should Be Submitted to a Special Committee for Research

[United Press, Moscow, 29th] Authoritative sources learned today that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall has decided to force the Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers to make an early showdown on the German problem, so that it can be known on what basis the Soviet Union is willing to reach an agreement. This is the strategy behind Marshall's proposal last night, to ensure that future discussions are limited to what he calls the main issues, and to set April 2 as the "deadline" for resolving the stalemates on German economic unification, provisional government, and industrial reparations levels. According to Marshall's strategy, he is expected to continue to propose other deadlines as the meeting progresses. If there is still no success, Marshall may take action to suspend the negotiations and return home in mid-April. If its future is bright and there can be positive progress, he is willing to stay for a considerable period of time.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] The Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers today discussed the report submitted by the Adjustment Committee on the points that the Council of Foreign Ministers has reached an agreement and the points that have not been agreed upon. Marshall proposed that the report raise three categories of basic issues, and that other decisive issues be temporarily put aside. The so-called three categories of basic issues are (1) German economic unification; (2) the issue of reparations and the revision of German industrial levels; (3) the form and scope of the German provisional government. As for other decisive issues (such as the disarmament of Germany, the elimination of Nazis, and the issue of refugees), they should be handed over to a special committee for discussion, ordering it to submit a report on April 2 and to draft the instructions that should be given to the Allied Control Council. The British representative, Molotov, agreed with Marshall's proposal, but argued that the issue of reparations should be included in the first category, and that the decisive issue of disarmament should be included in the fourth category. The Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers finally decided to carry out the following four tasks at tomorrow's meeting: (1) to determine the points to be discussed in the Adjustment Committee's report; (2) to determine the points in the Adjustment Committee's report to be handed over to the expert committee for discussion; (3) to stipulate the deadline for the expert committee to discuss the points; (4) to discuss any one of the three categories of issues, which is probably the issue of German economic unification or the issue of reparations.

### The Soviet Union Attaches Importance to the Issue of Reparations, Which Is the Key to the Success or Failure of the Council of Foreign Ministers

[Associated Press, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union has formally warned at the Council of Foreign Ministers that unless the Soviet Union's demands for reparations from Germany are met, there can be no agreement in the meeting based on any other basis, but the Soviet Union also revealed that it is willing to make some concessions on its demands for reparations. This was revealed in the report of the Adjustment Committee, which was submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers on Friday and will be discussed this afternoon or on Monday. Obviously, the issue of reparations is the focus of the entire German problem, not only whether the meeting can be successful, but also whether an agreement on the German problem can be reached as soon as possible will depend on this.

The main documents of the Soviet Union on the issue of reparations are: (1) The Soviet Union's statement in the adjustment report, "Part of the reparations should be paid by the current production." (2) The statement made by the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky in the Adjustment Committee on Thursday and Friday, in which he said that the Soviet Union believes that the issue of reparations is "extremely important," and the Soviet representative believes that the relationship between the economic problems and the issue of reparations is the closest.

Another Soviet document related to the issue of reparations stated that the Soviet Union believes that the profits obtained from German export trade, in addition to purchasing imported goods that can make Germany self-sufficient, should also be used to purchase imported goods for the production of reparations materials. The Soviet Union resolutely opposed the British and American proposal to use part of the export profits to make up for the previous deficits in western Germany. At the same time, it is reported that Marshall will reject the Soviet Union's proposal regarding reparations because the definition of German property in Austria has not been agreed upon.

### Five Minor Points of Economic Terms of Austrian Peace Treaty Agreed Upon

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Foreign Minister representatives today reached an agreement on five minor points of the economic terms of the Peace Treaty, but no agreement has been reached on the remaining four points, including the return of Austrian property within the territory of the United Nations. The Foreign Minister representatives have also listened to the report of the Political Committee on the issue of refugees in Austria.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] The group of Foreign Minister representatives responsible for dealing with the German problem is scheduled to hear the opinions of Roof, Chairman of the Allied Commission on German Reparations, tomorrow. If necessary, the Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers will also listen to his opinions.

[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] Australia had previously suggested that the United States should not begin trusteeship of the Japanese islands in the Pacific until after the signing of the Peace Treaty with Japan. This suggestion has been automatically withdrawn by Australia at today's meeting of the Security Council. It is also learned that the Security Council is scheduled to reconvene on April 2.

### Molotov Speaks Out Against Turkey

[Associated Press, Moscow, 28th] At today's meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the organization of the Peace Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov condemned Turkey for declaring war on Germany only after it was certain that Germany would be defeated. He said that Turkey had assisted Germany during the war and profited from it. This is Molotov's first speech attacking Turkey after President Truman announced his plan to aid Greece and Turkey to resist Communism.

### The Soviet Union is Willing to Provide Economic Aid to Britain

Stalin Expressed to Bevin

[Associated Press, Moscow, 28th] It is said that Stalin expressed to British Foreign Minister Bevin during their meeting at the Kremlin yesterday that the Soviet Union is willing to provide economic assistance to Britain.

### British House of Commons Passes Second Reading of Peace Treaty with Five Countries including Italy and Romania

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] The British House of Commons today passed the second reading of the Peace Treaty with the five Axis satellite countries, including Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland. Secretary of State McNeil declared that the approval of the Peace Treaty with the Axis satellites symbolizes the initial step towards restoring normal international relations between European countries.

### Halsey's Speech: Emphasizes Maintaining a Strong Navy

[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 29th (Radio): U.S. Navy Admiral Halsey delivered an important speech today, stating that disarmament has failed in the past, and the United States must maintain the strongest navy in the world. Future wars may come with lightning speed, and we know this very well. The tragic lessons of Pearl Harbor have been forgotten by many, and following old ways will lead to a repeat of the Pearl Harbor incident.

### 100,000 Germans in the Ruhr Region Hold a Famine Demonstration; British Side Claims it Clearly Has Political Undertones

[Reuters, Dusseldorf, 28th] 100,000 men, women, old, and young, held the largest famine demonstration in the Ruhr region since the end of the war in this park today, holding slogans such as "No food, no work" and "Don't let our children starve." During the march, the crowds overturned several British military vehicles, and the military vehicle carrying British journalists was also pelted with stones. The local labor union issued a general strike order for one day, paralyzing all transportation in the city and shutting down all factories. From early morning, large numbers of workers, housewives, and children appeared on the streets. Around 11:00 AM, more continued to arrive, and they shouted abuse at any British soldiers they encountered. Demonstrators also parked several trucks at the entrance of the park to prevent British military vehicles from passing. Horses and carriages also participated in the demonstration. The chairman of the Dusseldorf Labor Union Committee broadcast to the crowd in the park, saying that the union would not stop until the current tragedy was overcome and the conscience of the world was aroused. Another speaker shouted, "No work until more food is obtained," which drew cheers from the entire crowd. There was also a smaller demonstration in Essen this morning, and there were also instances of work slowdowns and demonstrations in other cities in the Ruhr region, but all demonstrations were orderly.

[Reuters, Dusseldorf, 28th] A senior British official said that the famine demonstration and strike in the Ruhr region have political undertones, intending to influence the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. If there were no food crisis, such events would not have occurred. However, the initiators are using this situation to draw more attention to the Moscow Conference. The current events in the Ruhr region are clearly not orchestrated by Nazis.

### Bollaert's Arrival Speech Indicates Determination to Make Vietnam Join the Federation

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The new French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Bollaert, is about to depart for Vietnam to take office. Before his departure, he sent a letter to Prime Minister Ramadier, stating: "I will work hard in Vietnam to lay the foundation for the French Federation and allow the Vietnamese people to freely join the French Federation. Its sole purpose is to develop their respective cultures, improve happiness, and obtain security." Ramadier immediately replied with a letter wishing him success.

### At the UN General Disarmament Committee Meeting, Guo Taiqi Delivers a Speech, Emphasizing that Building Peace Should Be Pursued on Two Fronts

[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] Chinese representative Guo Taiqi warned the United Nations today at the UN General Assembly's subcommittee on conventional armaments that the United Nations' efforts to build peace should not be done gradually. He advocated that world disarmament and world security should go hand in hand to achieve complementary effects. He stated: The United Nations should immediately complete the efforts of its Military Committee to build peace, so that atomic energy can be used for peaceful purposes and conventional armaments can be abolished. The disarmament agency should establish two main subcommittees, one responsible for preventing violations of armament reduction, and the other dedicated to reducing land, sea, and air forces or military expenditures. Due to the differing opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament, Guo Taiqi specifically put forward this proposal to fulfill his mediation mission. Western countries advocate that armament reduction should only be implemented after the UN security forces are developed and their ability to maintain peace is strengthened, while the Soviet Union advocates that world armaments should be abolished first.

### Austin Explains the True Meaning of US Aid to Greece; Soviet Representative Temporarily Does Not Respond, Saying He Needs Sufficient Time to Consider

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 28th] Just as US representative Austin was about to present the US's views on the Greek issue to the Security Council, Soviet representative Gromyko suddenly stood up to oppose the US issuing a statement, pointing out that the statement was not within the scope of the Greek issue on the Security Council's agenda and should be regarded as a new proposal to be discussed on another date. After briefly discussing the procedure with the chairman, Austin still stood up and spoke, formally requesting the UN agencies to approve the US's aid to Greece and Turkey and take active steps to protect any country from the threat of aggression, and to establish a permanent border "monitoring group" on the northern border of Greece. When Austin finished his speech, the entire hall was silent and tense, and everyone's eyes were on Gromyko, waiting to see how he would respond. However, Gromyko only said: "I have just heard the important statement made by the United States on an important issue and need to study it thoroughly. I will present my views at the next meeting." The next meeting was scheduled for April 7. Thereupon, the representatives resumed discussion of the US's request to administer the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. India, Australia, the Philippines, Canada, and Norway agreed with the US proposal, while New Zealand indicated that it still wanted to wait for the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Finally, it was decided to adjourn the meeting until next Wednesday for further discussion.

Soviet Union May Adopt New Tough Policy

[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] The Soviet Union's current use of the veto in the Security Council is seen by some as a sign that the Soviet Union is adopting a new tough policy and will not allow the Council to bully countries within the Soviet sphere of influence. The Soviet Union's veto of the British complaint against Albania for laying mines in the Corfu Channel was the tenth time it had used its veto power, but the first time in more than six months. At the same time, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in important meetings of the Trusteeship Council, and Soviet representative Gromyko's unwavering insistence on considering Soviet proposals supported by the minority in the Atomic Energy Control Commission, further reinforce the impression of a tough Soviet policy.

### US Aid to Greece and Turkey: Some Congressmen Oppose

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Members of Congress who criticize President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey today concentrated their attacks, seeking to eliminate or reduce the portion of the $400 million allocated to Turkey. Democratic Senator Johnson told reporters: "Supporting the anti-communist cause in the Mediterranean region may lead to war. I plan to fully oppose giving any aid to Turkey. I strongly favor completely excluding Turkey. According to the proposal, Greece is just a sweet bait to induce Congress to aid Turkey in preventing Soviet invasion of the Dardanelles. I support helping the Greek people, but I do not support military aid to the current Greek government or Turkey." According to Assistant Secretary of State Clayton, $150 million has been allocated to Turkey to strengthen and maintain its military.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The head of the US economic delegation to Greece, Pender, recently requested the House Foreign Affairs Committee to approve the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey, as Greece is currently living on borrowed money.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg announced: The Senate will debate the US aid to Greece and Turkey bill on April 7.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Congress is currently planning to recess for Easter, so the $400 million aid bill for Greece and Turkey may not be finalized until after April 15. The $350 million aid bill for China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Austria, and Poland will also be temporarily shelved. In addition, the $550 million aid bill for US occupied areas may also have difficulty reaching a quorum when the House of Representatives votes on it next week.

### US House Approves $300 Million for Relief in US Occupied Areas; Hodge Fiercely Criticizes Soviet Troops in North Korea

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The House Appropriations Committee today approved $300 million in emergency relief funds for US occupied areas, including $144 million for Japan, $68 million for Korea, $67 million for Germany, and the remainder for Austria and Italy. During the committee's hearings, US military commander in southern Korea, Hodge, strongly condemned North Korea, claiming that the US and Soviet occupied zones in Korea are now separated by an "absolute curtain," and reports indicate that the Soviets have 500,000 "strong" troops in North Korea. Republican Congressman Keefe asked: "Once the work of improving and building South Korea is completed, will the 500,000 Korean troops trained by the Soviet Union march south and occupy the entire country?" Hodge replied: "This could happen. I share your concerns." Undersecretary of the Army Patterson outlined the relief process for each occupied area, stating, "If we do not support these people, they will inevitably fall into chaos and become the best breeding ground for communism. Please note that we are competing with communism all over the world, and it is a very real competition."

### Mountbatten Convenes New Delhi Conference

Gandhi and Provincial Governors Will Participate

[United Press, New Delhi, 28th] It is reported that Indian Viceroy Mountbatten has invited all Indian provincial governors, including H.E. Sir Hugh Dow, to attend the New Delhi Conference in mid-April. Gandhi has also accepted Mountbatten's invitation and will arrive here on the 31st, returning to Patna on the 4th of next month.

[United Press, Gihanabad, 28th] Mahatma Gandhi recently elaborated on Mountbatten's remarks on the withdrawal of British troops from India upon taking office, saying: "I believe that Britain is sincere about withdrawing from India."

### Polish Deputy Minister of Defense Assassinated

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 29th] It has been learned that the Polish Deputy Minister of Defense, General Świerczewski, who was the commander of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, was assassinated yesterday by Ukrainian terrorists near the Polish-Soviet border.

### US Communist Party Obeys Moscow and Attempts to Overthrow the US Government: Report from the House Un-American Activities Committee

[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 29th (Radio): The House Un-American Activities Committee has submitted a report of over 20,000 words to Congress, formally accusing the US Communist Party of directly obeying orders from Moscow, attempting to overthrow the US government, and stating that the activities of the US Communist Party are only one of the sixty-seven groups worldwide that carry out orders from the Moscow Communist Party Executive Committee. Committee Chairman Thomas said: "The purpose of this report is to make Congress and the public aware that the US Communist Party is Moscow's fifth column." The committee has held consecutive meetings to discuss laws to stop Communist Party activities or deny the party's legal status. The report did not suggest any methods for dealing with the Communist Party, but reliable sources said: "The committee has abandoned the idea of denying the Communist Party's legal status, as this would make Communist Party activities go underground, making them more difficult to detect, and it is questionable whether this move is in line with the spirit of the Constitution."

[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 29th (Radio): Canadian Minister of National Defence Claxton made a speech, accusing the Canadian Communist Party of carrying out Soviet orders, "disloyal to Canada," and saying, "Since the Soviet Union does not allow us to enter its borders to investigate and report on the country's situation, and does not allow its people to know the real situation here, it is because the situation in that country cannot be compared with the situation in our country."

### House Un-American Activities Committee to Investigate Hollywood

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Chairman Thomas of the House Un-American Activities Committee announced today: "The committee will undertake an 'investigation of Hollywood'." However, Committee member Nixon said that there are many important areas that need immediate investigation. First is the list of government officials, and second are the labor unions. From the perspective of US defense, these two places are extremely important. In addition, Johnston, president of the Motion Picture Association, testified to the committee yesterday, saying that although there are Communist Party members in Hollywood, "if they launched a plot to occupy the film city, they would be doomed to failure." The film industry is trying to rectify its internal affairs, but he strongly opposes the idea that male and female actors should be dismissed simply because they are Communist Party members. "They are indeed acting in conspiracy scripts, but in the United States, they can only be reported, not persecuted."

### Last Minute News

### Mayor and Speaker Encourage Youth to Commemorate Revolutionary Martyrs and Celebrate Youth Day, Completing the Task of National Reconstruction and Maintaining World Peace

[Our Own Report] Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang and the 4th Youth Day. All sectors of the city, in addition to hanging the county flag in commemoration, all institutions and schools were closed for one day. A grand commemorative ceremony was held at the City Stadium at 10:00 AM, attended by more than 2,000 representatives from all walks of life. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Youth League Secretary-General Wu, City Chamber of Commerce Xu Jiqing, City Party Headquarters Wang Xianqing, Xie Dahuang, Finance Bureau Hu Wenyuan, Health Bureau Zhang Wei, General Labor Union Shui Xiangyun, Women's Association Qian Jianqiu, Education Association Zhou Feicheng, and others served on the presidium of the conference. After performing the ceremony, a three-minute silence was held for the revolutionary martyrs and the war dead in Hangzhou, followed by a speech by Chairman Wu, who said: "The history of China in recent years can be divided into three stages. The first is the revolutionary stage, in which the Father of the Nation led the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the establishment of the Republic of China, and the defeat of the warlords. The second is the anti-Japanese war stage, in which President Chiang led the resistance against aggression, defeated Japanese imperialism, and achieved final victory. The third is the stage of national reconstruction. I hope that the youth of the country will specialize in academic research to complete this task of national reconstruction. Revolution requires great courage, the anti-Japanese war emphasized sacrificing oneself for righteousness, while the national reconstruction stage relies on intelligence, so that science and industry are developed, culture and education are popularized, catching up from behind to restore the glorious history of China over the past five thousand years, and shouldering the responsibility of leading world culture to move forward." Mayor Wu giving a speech at the memorial meeting

Speaker Pan then gave a speech, saying: "Chinese youth have shouldered the three missions of revolution, the Northern Expedition, and the anti-Japanese war in the past, sacrificing and fighting to achieve success. As for today, the responsibility of Chinese youth is even greater, because they not only have to build the country, but also maintain world peace. We should open our eyes and see if there are any factors that could lead to a lack of peace in every corner of the world? Will China become a powder keg for a lack of peace after national reconstruction! To ensure that China does not become a powder keg, the youth need to fulfill their great responsibility. The Second World War broke out in the Balkans because there were weaknesses in that area that could be invaded by others. In fact, China's 'September 18th Incident' was a hidden cause, and the 'July 7th' Marco Polo Bridge Incident was a proximate cause. To avoid the outbreak of a third world war, we must at least ensure that China no longer has a weakness that can be invaded by others. Young people should pay special attention to their responsibilities and seek advanced knowledge. The Third Plenary Session declaration had instructions, and today's Youth Day President Chiang's message to the youth of the country also stated that to build the country, we must first seek advanced knowledge, instructing the youth on how to maintain world peace. I hope that the youth of the country will work together."

Wu Shaoshu said in his speech: "Today's youth in China, in addition to praying for peace and improving the standards of culture and physique, also hope that democratic politics can be truly implemented, and that both learning and life can be stabilized." Xie Dahuang, representative of the City Party Headquarters, said: "History is written by the hot blood of generations of young people. Starting from Huanghuagang, through the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, the May 30th Movement, and the eight-year anti-Japanese war, countless sacrifices were made to achieve glorious victory. As history progresses page by page, the historical tasks undertaken by the youth are also different. Today, what China needs is not destruction, but unification and stability. Therefore, I hope that the youth will exert their strength to stabilize society and unify the country." After the speeches, Mayor Wu presided over the distribution of awards to the winners of the youth cross-country race. Then, the entire audience shouted slogans and played music, completing the ceremony. After the meeting, there was also a motorcade parade.

In addition, the Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Special Party Department, and the Seamen's Party Department also held commemorative ceremonies yesterday.

### 10,000 Volunteer Police Officers Hold Grand Review

More than 12,700 volunteer police officers and team members in this city held a review at the Racecourse Square at 9:00 AM yesterday.

Director Tang of the Police Department then delivered a heartfelt speech, moving the audience. Finally, Secretary-General He delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu, and Commander Chuan Zhengmo of the Garrison District delivered a speech, both encouraging everyone to strengthen the organization and serve diligently. The ceremony was completed at 12:00 noon, and the troops paraded until about 1:00 PM before returning to the Racecourse for dismissal. In the afternoon, at 2:30 PM, the volunteer police officers performed a play at the Tianchan Theater. Director Tang, Director Han, Commander Xuan, and others all attended to watch. More than 10,000 volunteer police officers, in order to express their respect for the arduous and outstanding leadership of Director Xuan, who also served as the chief captain, specially presented a large banner with the words "Leading the Masses" during the review yesterday.

### Parks Open to Celebrate Children's Day

The Children's Welfare Organization's Preparatory Committee for Celebrating Children's Day, considering that there are many children in this city who leave early and return late, diligently studying, and have very few opportunities to visit parks, specifically sent a letter to the City Works Bureau's Park Management Office, requesting that all major parks be opened to children free of charge for one day on April 4, so that they could enjoy themselves all day long and make their bodies and minds happy. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Park Management Office stating: "For this year's Children's Day, this office has ordered all affiliated parks to be opened free of charge (including adults) for one day, in order to extend the celebration."

### Ruan Chengzhang Sent to Shanghai to Investigate the Truth of the Sunken Ship Case; Families of the Victims Establish a Post-Disaster Office

After the "Fubo" ship tragedy occurred, all parties attached great importance to it. Admiral Gui Yongqing, acting commander-in-chief of the Navy, specially sent Ruan Chengzhang, director of the Second Department of the Ministry, to Shanghai to investigate the truth and express condolences to the families of the deceased officers and soldiers on behalf of the Ministry.

### Two Fishing Boats from the Fishery Administration Set a New Fishing Record

[Our Own Report] Two fishing boats from the Executive Yuan Fishery Administration, the "Hoosier" and the "Stellapolis," recently caught 125,000 pounds of fish 150 miles south of the Yangtze River estuary, setting a new record.

### Ten Shanghai Vocational Groups Strive for National Assembly Delegate Seats

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Farmers Association, Fishermen's Association, Education Association, Lawyers Association, Accountants Association, Doctors Union, Shanghai Branch of the Industrial Association, and Labor Association, ten vocational groups, upon hearing news of a reduction in the number of vocational representatives to the National Assembly, jointly telegraphed the government yesterday, striving for the number of vocational representatives to the National Assembly.

The original text reads: "To the Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan, and Legislative Yuan: The originally scheduled quota of vocational representatives to the National Assembly is only 450, which, calculated according to the huge amount of taxes paid to the state by the agricultural, commercial, and industrial sectors, already feels inadequate. If it is further reduced, it would be obviously unfair, and our associations cannot accept it. We dare to ask you to pay attention to the importance of production and national construction. If you cannot increase the quota, you must maintain the original quota. If there is a reduction, we would rather leave the seats vacant. We apologize for our hasty words. Please consider our request."

### New Jiangsu Commissioner to Assume Office in Two Days; Meeting with Reporters and Sharing Thoughts, Hoping for Peace and Tranquility

[Our Report] The newly appointed Jiangsu Commissioner, Yan Zhuang, is scheduled to assume office on April 1st. Yesterday, during a meeting with reporters, he stated: "Jiangsu, being the area surrounding the capital, is the political, economic, and cultural center of our country, holding an extremely important position. I hope that in the future, the Commissioner's Office can be as peaceful and uneventful as the old-style government offices, as this would indicate that politics are on the right track. I studied in Shanghai in my early years and am quite familiar with the situation in this city. The situation in Shanghai is very complex, and its importance to the nation is unmatched by any other city. Every move in Shanghai leads and influences the entire country. If China wants to get on the right track, Shanghai must get on the right track first. This applies to both good and bad aspects. For example, if there is speculation fever in Shanghai, other places will follow suit. Moreover, there are numerous schools in this city, and the number of students is the highest in the country. If the current social situation is too unsatisfactory, young students will become radicalized due to dissatisfaction with reality, which would be a great loss to the country. Therefore, people from all walks of life in Shanghai bear a particularly heavy responsibility to the country. All responsible officials in this city, starting with Mayor Wu, are exceptionally talented, which is why they have achieved remarkable political achievements that are praised both domestically and internationally. After I take office, I will have many opportunities to interact with them."

When asked about the financial difficulties of the Commissioner's Office, Mr. Yan replied: "In terms of regular expenses, the monthly budget is only 1.7 million yuan, which makes it difficult to carry out our work. However, I understand that the Control Yuan has now approved an investigation fund of nearly 200 million yuan. Once it is allocated, this office can expect to receive a portion of it, and we will be able to actively carry out all inspection and investigation work. As far as Jiangsu Province is concerned, after the recovery of Northern Jiangsu, order has not been fully restored, and there are still many problems. Therefore, there is a need to first inspect the counties in Northern Jiangsu."

### Lost Nephew Sought Through Newspaper Advertisement; Thug Takes the Opportunity to Extort Money

[Our Report] Li Jinfu, a leather craftsman from Nanjing living at No. 19 Deshou Lane, Anqing Road, lost his nephew, Xiao Hu, at 5:00 PM on the 15th of this month while he was playing outside his home.

### China's Largest Warship, the Emei, Open for Tours; Equipped with Radar and Other Latest Equipment; Hospital, Workshop, and Kitchen are Exquisitely Equipped

[Our Report] China's largest warship, the Emei, with a displacement of 15,000 tons, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last month and is docked at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Gaochangmiao Navy for repairs to its machinery and cleaning of its hull. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the ship invited members of the Shanghai news media for a tour. Captain Liang Xuzhao and other officers warmly welcomed the visitors. After the tour, the reporters were sent back by landing craft at around 5:00 PM.

The Emei warship was originally the US Navy oil tanker USS Mamie. US Navy Admiral Nimitz served as the ship's first chief engineer. During his tenure, he injured a finger in the ship's engine room, which is still a popular anecdote. The ship was commissioned in October 1916 and participated in World War I, becoming the first US Navy transport ship to use diesel fuel. In 1942, with the outbreak of World War II, the ship was re-equipped, so all the equipment on board, such as the main engine, various combat instruments, radar, depth sounder, and long-range direction finder, are the latest modern equipment.

Last summer, the United States donated eight ships, including the Taikang, which were escorted by the Emei on their voyage across the Pacific back to China to provide supplies and repairs. After arriving in China, the US government ordered the ship to be transferred to China. The Chinese Navy Bureau sent outstanding officers and soldiers to Qingdao in November last year to take over the ship and renamed it the Emei.

The Emei is a mixed-use supply ship with a total displacement of 14,750 tons, a length of 475 feet, a width of 16.5 feet, and a maximum speed of 13 knots. It is equipped with five 3-inch guns, two 40-mm anti-aircraft guns, and eight 20-mm anti-aircraft guns. The ship has a small hospital with medical facilities such as an operating room, pharmacy, and wards, staffed by two medical officers. There is also a repair workshop with more than ten machine tools, iron beds, sawing machines, and lathes from 1942. There is also a refined small kitchen that specializes in making Chinese and Western pastries. The ship also has washing machines and ironing machines, which are not easily seen on land.

There are 363 officers, soldiers, and naval academy students on board for shipboard training. The organization consists of the captain and deputy captain, followed by seven groups: ship affairs, communications, gunnery, supply, engineering, medical, and repair, each responsible for the affairs of the entire ship. All officers and soldiers on the ship rise at 5:30 AM for morning exercises and cleaning, and then have breakfast at 6:45 AM before going to their respective posts. Lunch is at 11:45 AM, followed by a rest, nap, or reading books and magazines in the library. Dinner is at 5:45 PM, and bedtime is at 9:30 PM. The ship has projection equipment, but it is difficult to rent films. Although there are a few movies, they have been watched by all the officers and soldiers on the ship, so the captain hopes that the Central Film Studio can lend some new films to alleviate the monotonous life on board. When asked about their salaries, all the officers and soldiers shook their heads and smiled bitterly. Enlisted men receive only 20,000 yuan per month, naval soldiers receive 80,000 yuan per month, and officers receive no more than 160,000 yuan per month, which is far less than the US$300-400 per month that officers received while training in the United States (all officers and soldiers were trained in the United States), making them keenly aware of the difference between then and now. (The picture below shows the majestic appearance of the Emei. Photo by our newspaper.)

Some parties also criticize the students for being stubborn, not listening to advice, missing the opportunity, and inevitably regretting it later. Currently, Director Zhou Bangdao of the Jiangxi Education Department plans to make a third and final effort.

### The Fate of Children is in Your Hands

— Chen Heqin

In Commemoration of the 36th Teachers' Education Movement Week

Respected Teachers:

Have you ever thought that the fate of children is in your hands?

This means that you are very capable of controlling everything about the children.

Let's first talk about the situation of children in school.

School is the children's small world. Children should be very happy there. They learn various subjects there, obtain knowledge from all sources, and prepare to dedicate themselves to the big world of the future. However, it is undeniable that we can often see or hear that some children are not very interested in the school's courses. Some children hate arithmetic, some dislike social studies, and some children dislike music and other subjects. The root cause of these problems can be summed up in one sentence: "The teacher harmed him!"

Ask your own or someone else's child: "Why are you not happy to learn arithmetic?" He will definitely answer you, "The teacher doesn't teach well!" Ask another one, and he will squint his eyes and grumble to you in the same way: "It's not that I don't like social studies, it's that the teacher didn't teach well. I don't understand, so I'm not happy to learn it!"

This is the "problem". Have you ever planned for your own or someone else's child? It is a natural right for children to receive knowledge of nature and society. We should help him, and never let him give up naturally.

Good teachers make good children, and teachers who teach well naturally make children learn well. A teacher with appropriate teaching methods can definitely avoid increasing the child's difficulties. Similarly, a child who is good in all subjects must have received reasonable guidance from an excellent teacher. All of this determines everything about the child, so I want to say that the success or failure of children in learning is entirely in the hands of teachers or parents; it's on you.

The fate of children is in your hands, this is the first point.

Let's talk about how to teach children to be good people.

You must first do what you want the children to do. Children are born ignorant and don't know what is good and what is bad. Their every move can be said to be influenced by heredity, constrained by the environment, and governed by education. In his entire educational stage, the most important thing is of course the teacher. If you want children to be polite, you must first look at your own politeness. You must first treat people the way you want children to treat people. Children are your mirror. Your every move can be reflected in the children's mirror. For example, if you are a pessimistic person, looking at things with pessimistic eyes, then the children you teach will definitely be pessimistic. If your attitude is optimistic, then the children you teach will also be optimistic.

Don't underestimate these aspects! Even in very small places, we teachers or parents must set an example in everything we do, and set an example for the children to see. Treat people, not only in words and actions, but even in your thoughts and emotions, you must set an example.

That's the second point. Enough, we can count a lot more, I'll leave it to you to think about and appreciate.

Whether your own or someone else's child becomes a good citizen or is harmful to society is entirely up to you to decide. Please remember my words:

"The fate of children is in your hands!"

### Lou Wen'ao Wins Youth Cross-Country Race; Qiu Xingqing Second Place; Lu Honggao Third Place; Time 33 Minutes 29 Seconds

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, in commemoration of the revolutionary martyrs and to celebrate Youth Day, jointly organized a youth cross-country race with the Municipal Stadium and the Municipal Youth League. The route was approximately 10,000 meters. It started at 7:52 AM in front of the Youth League branch on Zhongzheng South Road. The city police patrol team and the Boy Scouts from Siwei, Gezhi, and Shibei schools assisted along the way. Tens of thousands of spectators lined the streets. Roll call was at 7:30 AM, with 34 participants. After a strenuous 10,000-meter race, Lou Wen'ao won with a time of 33 minutes and 29 seconds, breaking his own record of 36 minutes and 40 seconds from the previous year (the previous year's race involved wading through water on a section of Daxilu after rain). Qiu Xingqing came in second with 37 minutes and 54 seconds, and Lu Honggao came in third with 38 minutes and 39 seconds. Commemorative medals were awarded to all 30 finishers. The top ten were also awarded prizes. Details are as follows:

Competition Details

In the warm spring weather, the starting gun fired at 7:52 AM, and 68 swift feet sprinted out. At that time, the racers were in high spirits, all with the ambition and posture to take the lead. Lou Wen'ao took the lead from Zhongzheng South to Fuxing Road. Qiu Xingqing, Lu Honggao, and others stayed close behind. As they turned onto Maoming Road, Lou was running alone alongside the guide car. By the time they reached Nanjing West Road, only 30 people remained. Qiu, Lu, and Lin Canran and others were already hundreds of meters behind. Lou looked quite relaxed. As they entered Huashan Road via Jiangsu Road, the mute Lou led by a clear 1,000 meters. As the racers approached the willow branches along Beidang Road, they were increasingly energized knowing that the destination was not far away, and the competition intensified.

Turning onto Shaanxi South Road from Avenue Lafayette, they were already very close to the finish line. Lou strode forward and made a 50-meter sprint, reaching the entrance of the Municipal Stadium first, finishing the 33 minutes and 29 seconds, the audience applauded.

Mr. Yang Wangde finished last, with a time of one hour, four minutes, and forty seconds, and the audience applauded.

### Reliable Guarantee of US Dollar Bonds; Subscription and Sales Methods Agreed Upon; Central Bank Commissioned by the Ministry, Guaranteeing No Mandatory Allocation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago, immediately discussed public debt matters with Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank. Mr. Chen met with our newspaper's reporter yesterday and spoke about the government's issuance of US dollar treasury bonds, stating: "I was ordered to come to Shanghai this time to discuss the subscription and sales methods of the US dollar treasury bonds with President Zhang of the Central Bank, as well as the organization of the fund management committee. I met with President Zhang for two hours on the morning of the 29th, and we have largely reached an agreement. I am scheduled to return to Beijing today (the 30th) to report to Minister Yu for approval." The discussions with President Zhang included: (1) Rules for the receipt and issuance of invoices for treasury bond subscriptions and sales. (2) Organizational regulations for the fund management committee. (3) Organizational rules for local subscription and sales committees, and other related matters. It is planned to announce these after approval before April 1st. Regarding the fund management committee, we will strive to strengthen its organization to consolidate creditworthiness and protect the rights and interests of bondholders. As for the candidates for the fund management committee, in addition to the regulations stipulating that various agencies and organizations will recommend a certain number of representatives, the Ministry of Finance will separately invite responsible persons from other relevant agencies and organizations to participate and jointly bear responsibility.

As for the subscription and sales of treasury bonds, it is planned that the Ministry will commission the Central Bank to handle them. The Central Bank may establish subscription and sales committees in various locations to promote them. In terms of collection, in addition to Central Banks in various locations, other banks and firms may be designated to collect bond payments on behalf of the Ministry. We will strive for universal sales so that all sectors in all regions have the convenience of purchasing. These treasury bonds will all be freely subscribed and will definitely not be allocated mandatorily. The government's issuance of treasury bonds this time aims to solve economic problems through economic means, that is, to improve the economic conditions of issuance as much as possible. For example: (1) A principal-protected method will ensure that bondholders can maintain the actual value of their investment in public debt. (2) The interest rate is generous, unprecedented. (3) All subscription and sales and fund management will be conducted openly to demonstrate great trust. (4) The proceeds from the treasury bonds will all be used for productive construction. (5) It is determined that the funds securing the treasury bonds all have reliable collateral. For example, the treasury bonds are secured by state-owned production enterprises and seized enemy and puppet assets. The public debt is secured by the Central Bank's foreign exchange fund, all of which are extremely reliable. (6) A fund committee will be established to be responsible for handling fund management matters, in order to consolidate the bonds and protect the rights and interests of bond purchasers.

In short, the government's issuance of treasury bonds this time aims to absorb the floating capital of the people at home and abroad to reduce issuance, stabilize finance, enrich the foreign exchange fund, and regulate foreign trade. If sales can proceed smoothly, it will greatly benefit the country's current financial and economic difficulties. This measure is beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people, and I believe that all sectors will definitely subscribe enthusiastically. All the regulations for issuance can demonstrate that the government has made its greatest efforts. When bidding farewell to the reporter, Mr. Chen solemnly stated again: "During the Legislative Yuan's meeting to discuss the US dollar treasury bond regulations, Minister Yu also attended to explain and earnestly told the legislators: 'I am willing to use the position of Minister of Finance to guarantee the credit of these treasury bonds.'"

### The City's Jewelry Industry Held a Temporary Discussion Meeting Yesterday; Decided to Resume Business on the 1st; Plans to Petition Again

The city's jewelry industry has been temporarily suspended since the implementation of the economic emergency measures on the 17th of last month, and more than a month has passed in an instant. After petitioning in Beijing twice, the Ministry of Finance has now announced the measures for the sale of gold jewelry. The industry held a temporary discussion meeting at the industry association at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Yao Lianfang, with more than a dozen representatives from large and small businesses participating. The following key matters were discussed and decided: (1) All jewelry stores in the city will officially resume business on April 1st. (2) The purchase price of gold jewelry will be 4.8 million yuan per tael based on the Central Bank's listed price, and the selling price will follow the Mayor Wu's approved profit of 90,000 yuan per tael, totaling 5.7 million yuan. (3) The labor cost is tentatively set at 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per mace for rough work, and fine work will be discussed separately.

Preparing to Petition

According to the person in charge of the industry association, the industry has decided to reluctantly resume business first in order to maintain the livelihood of its employees. The biggest difficulty in future business is the extreme shortage of original gold. It is hoped that the authorities can provide it appropriately; otherwise, if the gold jewelry stored by the industry is sold, it will inevitably be impossible to replenish it, and business will be difficult to develop. Now, after resuming business, they are preparing to continue petitioning the central government.

Representatives Leave Shanghai

After the jewelry industry was suspended this time, representatives from the same industry in various provinces, cities, and counties across the country came to Shanghai to connect and collectively petitioned in Beijing. Now that the problem has come to an end, and the jewelry industries in Beijing and Shanghai have successively resumed business, all the representatives from various places such as Beiping, Tianjin, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Jiangsu are leaving Shanghai separately in recent days. As of yesterday, only Hunan representative Gan Yiting and Hankou representative Zou Jingxuan are scheduled to return next week.

### A Large Amount of Gold is About to Arrive in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is learned that an American ship is carrying as much as thirteen tons of gold from San Francisco, setting a new record for gold imports in the past. The company carrying the gold has notified the Central Bank to pick it up.

### To Improve the Reputation of Domestic Cotton, Strict Crackdown on Adulteration is Needed

People in the cotton industry in the city said that all cotton markets in China have the bad habit of adulterating and counterfeiting. As a result of the counterfeiting of domestic cotton, the moisture content can reach 35%, and the impurity content can reach 20%. The excessive amount of water and impurities is the highest in the world, which causes the fiber to deteriorate and rot, wastes transportation labor, causes many disputes, destroys trade ethics, and reduces trade reputation. The losses suffered by the country and manufacturers are difficult to calculate in numbers. The root cause of the counterfeiting is that vendors sell it to seek illegal profits. The methods for cracking down on counterfeiting can be divided into two aspects: temporary and fundamental. In terms of temporary measures, the government should restore the cotton inspection institutions in various places to handle the work of cracking down on adulteration and counterfeiting. It is forbidden for the water and impurity content to exceed the legal limit. At the same time, vendors who adulterate and counterfeit should be investigated and punished to crack down on their attempts to seek illegal profits. In terms of fundamental measures, efforts should be made to increase production, circulate finance, organize production and marketing cooperatives, implement centralized management of ginning and packaging, and implement fair inspection of cotton grading and water and impurity content.

### To Save the Entire Commercial Crisis, Relax Credit and Loan Restrictions; The City Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Legislative Yuan

The City Chamber of Commerce recently submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan, stating that the government's revision of the Banking Law places extremely strict restrictions on credit loans, and requested that the above-mentioned regulations be relaxed to alleviate commercial difficulties. We are exploring its original presentation as follows: "The Banking Law promulgated but not implemented on March 28, 1931, has very strict restrictions on credit loans in Article 34, and merchants already felt many obstacles at that time. Now, we hear that the draft Banking Law being drafted by Your Yuan has stricter restrictions on credit loans than the old Banking Law. If implemented, the channels for merchants to use credit loans will be almost cut off, which is a major concern. The production loans of factories can be mortgaged with raw materials and machines, and international trade for import and export can use documentary bills. Commodities purchased in other ports or sold in other ports can use acceptance bills. However, the vast majority of stores that purchase goods locally and sell them in local stores, sell goods for cash, cannot store commodities in warehouses as collateral, nor can they use documentary bills and acceptance bill methods. Therefore, financial institutions can only use current account overdrafts as credit loans to accommodate funds. For example, pawnshops are lending institutions that accept pledges themselves, but due to the scattered nature of items, they cannot use the transfer and mortgage method to establish dealings with financial institutions. In addition, industries such as hotels, restaurants, and entertainment have no raw materials or commodities that can be mortgaged for loans, and they can only rely on credit loans. These are just examples, and there are many others. If credit loans are on the verge of being cut off, the above-mentioned commercial sectors can only borrow from private individuals to raise funds. I am sincerely afraid that the current trend of high-interest discounting will never be reformed, there is no hope of centralized funds, and there is no opportunity to suppress interest rates. This matter concerns the financial industry in detail, but it concerns all commercial sectors in general. Since this association has vaguely heard about it, in order to save the commercial crisis and relieve commercial suffering, it dares to report the facts truthfully, and earnestly prays that the regulations in the Banking Law being formulated will slightly relax the restrictions on credit loans so that commerce can have sufficient turnover, which is truly convenient for the public."

### Flour Factories Consult with the Four Joint Offices on Loans for Purchasing New Wheat; The Total Amount Required is Approximately 160 Billion Yuan

In order to stabilize flour prices, the authorities specially stipulated in March that the price limit in this city applies to the Beijing-Shanghai line, and it has been implemented for a month. According to the person in charge of the 4th District Flour Industry Association, due to the different situations in various places, only Nanjing, Wuxi, and Shanghai are currently being uniformly distributed by the China Trust Bureau. In other ports, retail businesses have not applied to the China Trust Bureau due to cumbersome application procedures, delayed dates, and a shortage of funds, which is insufficient for turnover. Now that the bureau has not allocated it, the local price is controlled by market supply and demand. For this reason, the four major flour factories in the city have not been able to purchase wheat from producing areas in accordance with their expectations. The new wheat this year will be available on the market in mid-June at the earliest, although the date is far away, but to avoid repeating the same mistakes as when the new wheat was available on the market last year when various factories had no funds to purchase it, they are now informally consulting with the Four Joint Offices on loans. Assuming a production volume of 2 million dan, calculated at the current market price of 80,000 yuan per zu, the total amount would be 160 billion yuan. Although funds can be alleviated by increasing the turnover resolution, private manufacturers have limited capabilities, and it is highly hoped that the government will provide assistance.

### Daily Production of Yarn by Private Textile Industry is Over 80,000 Pieces; Cloth is 1.9 Million Bolts

The current daily production of cotton yarn is 86,056 pieces (calculated with 20-count yarn). As for the machine dyeing and weaving industry, there are 650 large and small factories in the city, with a total of 24,754 looms, about 70% of which are in operation.

### The Chicken and Duck Industry is Preparing for Joint Operations; Methods of Implementation Have Been Agreed Upon

The Chicken and Duck Business Association of this city once suggested to the municipal authorities to improve the chicken and duck business. As a result of consultations with relevant bureaus and associations this month, it is proposed to change this type of chicken and duck industry into a local public business in Shanghai in order to enrich the municipal treasury. The decided methods of implementation are as follows: (1) Funds will be raised by the promoters themselves, and the municipal bank will provide loans. (2) Business locations will be selected and established in districts according to actual sales needs. (3) Members will join the joint operation completely voluntarily. (4) The commission is tentatively set at 13%. If there are any changes, they need to be approved by the authorities. (5) The commission will be distributed into ten shares: 30% for expenses, 40% for profits, 1.5% for municipal construction subsidies, and 1.5% for social welfare undertakings. It has also been approved by the municipal government for the industry association to implement. If this measure is realized, it will be beneficial to public health, material management, and improvement of chicken and duck breeding.

### New Tides Surge, Ancient City Roars: A Rights Protection Movement in Chengdu

— Airmail dispatch on March 21st, by our correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan

As spring deepens and the Jin River flows calmly, the peaceful society of Chengdu has been stirred by the rising national tide of rights protection and patriotism, igniting fervent patriotic sentiments in nearly a million citizens. The call for rights protection resounds throughout every corner of society, particularly within educational and cultural circles. This surge of impassioned patriotism marks the most significant expression of popular will in Chengdu in over a decade, a revival of the spirit of the May Fourth Movement. This instance of rights protection is widely recognized as a new May Fourth Movement.

Passionate Patriotic Sentiments for Rights Protection: The People of Sichuan Lead the Way

Throughout history, the people of Chengdu have often led the nation in their patriotic sentiments and national consciousness. The opening act of the Xinhai Revolution was the Railway Protection Movement in Chengdu. During the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, the people of Chengdu endured hardships, contributed their wealth and efforts, and wrote a page of glorious history of national victory and revival through eight years of struggle. The proposal by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to interfere in China's internal affairs is the greatest insult to the entire Chinese nation. China, as a victorious nation that contributed the most and sacrificed the most in the anti-aggression war, absolutely cannot tolerate any country using China's internal strife as an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs. This is the consensus of the people of the nation. The people of Chengdu, as members of the nation, are unwilling to lag behind in patriotism. The theory of international interference, upon reaching Chengdu, ignited the righteous anger of millions of people.

The rights protection movement first broke out nationally in Chengdu. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly, representing seventy million people, roared, telegraphing Chairman Chiang and the National Government, demanding that they adhere to their position and lodging a serious protest with the Foreign Ministers Conference. Subsequently, the entire faculty of Chengdu University, Sichuan University, Huaxi University, Qilu University, Chenghua University, the National College of Science, and the three provincial vocational schools of arts, accounting, and physical education, including Xiao Gongquan, Wang Zhaorong, Zhang Linggao, and 187 others, jointly telegraphed the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to protest. A surge of anger swept across Sichuan. Successive telegrams of support were sent by approximately 148 county and city assemblies throughout Sichuan, the Chengdu Press Association and Journalists Association, the Sichuan-Kang National Assembly Representatives Association, the Sichuan Administrative Research Association, the Political and Economic Society, the Social Construction Society, academic research societies of universities and colleges, the Moral Promotion Society, and cultural organizations such as the China-America, China-Britain, China-Korea, China-France-Belgium-Switzerland Cultural Associations. In addition, social organizations such as the Wude Society, the Veterans Association, the Dazhong Society, the Minben Society, and the Datong Society, along with people's organizations such as farmers' associations, educational associations, labor unions, and chambers of commerce in Sichuan Province and its cities, totaling over 520 organizations, all called for justice and national dignity. This is the national voice and patriotic fervor of seventy million people in Sichuan, a solemn declaration to schemers and troublemakers: the Chinese people are not to be insulted.

Eight Thousand Students Form a Parade Line, Writing a Magnificent History of Youth Movement

As the vanguard of patriotism, the passionate sentiments of Chengdu's young students in this instance of rights protection are an unprecedentedly grand manifestation in Chengdu's student community in over a decade. The theory of interference in China, upon reaching Chengdu, ignited the students' patriotic anger. They immediately and swiftly organized the "Chengdu Municipal Schools Rights Protection Movement Joint Conference." From the 18th, all schools in the city went on strike for three days, and on the 18th, a National Rights Protection Conference was held. The conference included over 80,000 students from major and minor schools throughout the city, including Sichuan University, Huaxi University, Qilu University, and Chenghua University, totaling over 50 school units. This was an unprecedented grand gathering in Chengdu's student community.

The venue was Huaxi Dam in Chengdu's cultural district. Miss Li of Huaxi University was temporarily elected as the chair, and she passionately expressed the students' outrage at the Foreign Ministers Conference's unreasonable discussion of China's internal affairs. Subsequently, the deans of discipline of Sichuan University and Huaxi University encouraged the students to enrich the patriotic movement by studying national defense science in the laboratories. Renowned professor Liu Shichuan pointed out, from the perspective of international law, that international interference is an illegal act of infringing on rights. Finally, amidst thunderous applause, the conference passed a declaration and two telegrams addressed to the Foreign Ministers Conference and Chairman Chiang of the National Government, proclaiming: "China's internal affairs issues will be handled legitimately by the government itself. We will use action to safeguard the independence and freedom of national sovereignty. We firmly oppose scheming groups who are intent on selling out the motherland. Therefore, we roar to safeguard national sovereignty, oppose international interference, concentrate the strength of youth, and eradicate obstacles to unification."

After the conference, a parade was held. The magnificent procession of 80,000 people constituted a new Great Wall of the nation. The patriotic cries of 80,000 people resonated through the clouds. The route followed the prosperous areas of the city. Hundreds of thousands of onlookers on both sides were filled with anger and joined in the chorus, shouting slogans such as: "Youth of the nation, unite!" "Oppose parties who collude with foreign bandits to harm the nation!"... The passionate and慷慨的情緒 (kāng kǎi de qíng xù - generosity) was so moving that some onlookers were moved to tears. This supreme manifestation of youthful spirit is where the soul of the Chinese nation resides, and it is also a symbol of the glorious history of the Chinese nation created over thousands of years. After the 18th, major and minor schools and people from all walks of life spontaneously paraded for three consecutive days, telling the world that the Chinese nation will never be subjugated.

Youth are the backbone of the nation, the core of the race. The vibrancy of the spirit of the youth of the times represents the rise and fall, survival and demise of the nation. Looking back in history, there was the movement of the students of the Imperial Academy in the Northern Song Dynasty, followed by the Southern Song Dynasty's revival. The May Fourth Movement in the early Republic of China inspired the national revolutionary sentiments of the Northern Expedition. This time, the rights protection movement of Chengdu's educational circles and young students is a rebirth of the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and it is also a decisive new May Fourth Movement. In the future history of China's nation-building and revival, a splendid and glorious chapter of youth movement history will surely be written.

Spring and Autumn Annals

### The Early Life of Michelangelo

— Xu Fan

When you see a marble sculpture, you will never again think of it as a lifeless piece of marble. What amazing skill it is! The person with this skill is called a sculptor. Michelangelo was an immortal sculptor.

He was born in Italy four hundred years ago. He had many siblings, all of whom were called upon to run the pawnshop, but he alone was sent to school, where his father hoped he would become a scholar.

But this child did not like his lessons. He abandoned his books and spent his time in the art studio. At home, he was always drawing, keeping many small scraps of sketches. He even tried to preserve sketches drawn on the walls with charcoal.

His father did not like this. He did not want his child to become an artist, because artists were often impoverished at that time. He punished his child for drawing. But this was useless; nothing interested Michelangelo except drawing.

Michelangelo lived in a school in Florence, where his parents lived in the city. At school, there was a child who loved drawing as much as Michelangelo. They became good friends. They ran around Florence, enjoying watching artists work.

This child's friend knew of a very famous artist in Florence. Michelangelo and his friend went to visit the artist's studio. Michelangelo wanted to study painting there for a long time, but he was afraid his father would not allow it.

Finally, Michelangelo's father agreed. One day, he discussed it with the artist, showing him his child's sketches. The artist exclaimed in delight, "I am willing to take him. Let your child come here to study painting!" Thus, the discussion was successful.

Now, there was a happy child in Florence. Michelangelo's mind was immersed in the excitement of studying painting. He devoted all his time to this initial work. He worked alongside other students for three years.

One day, Michelangelo was watching a student paint, copying a picture by the teacher. He felt that the teacher's picture was not well done, so he quickly sketched an outline to correct it. After copying it, the student returned it to the teacher, who saw the new lines added to the painting and asked, "Who changed this picture?" The child replied, "Michelangelo." "Yes," the teacher exclaimed, "I know no one else could have modified it like this!"

In those times, public places often had paintings on the walls. Michelangelo's teacher was painting a decoration on a church wall, and some of the best students climbed the ladders to help with the work. One day, the teacher was absent, and the students continued to work. Michelangelo made a drawing depicting the interior of the church and the young people and workers. When the teacher returned and saw the drawing, he was amazed by the compact composition. He exclaimed, "This child already knows more than I do!"

At the same time, a noble prince lived in Florence. His home was a palace surrounded by gardens. The palace and park were called St. Mark's. This prince loved beautiful sculptures. He had traveled all over the world to collect them, and many were placed in the St. Mark's gardens.

The prince was generous and willing to let others appreciate the sculptures. He wrote to all the painters in Florence, saying, "Choose two of your best students and bring them to the St. Mark's gardens. They can study sculpture here. A good teacher will be waiting for them!"

When Michelangelo's teacher received the letter, he read it to the students. Every student in the room wanted to go, but only two could go. They all thought Michelangelo would be chosen, as they knew he was the best student. Indeed, Michelangelo and his friend were taken to the palace to study.

In the St. Mark's gardens, Michelangelo first devoted all his time to painting. At that time, he saw a young man sculpting with clay and wanted to do the same. Therefore, Michelangelo tried clay modeling.

He often watched the stonemasons carve stones and marble, as they were building a large library. The young artist became friends with these stonemasons. He asked for some of their unused pieces of marble. From those few pieces of stone, he tried to carve figures, beginning his great career as a sculptor.

### A Brief Account of the Joint Exhibition at the Capital Art Festival

— Qian Dongsheng

The Art Festival commemoration, held in Nanjing on March 25th, took place at the Central Cultural Auditorium in Xiangpu Camp, Guofu Road. At the same time, works by artists from various regions were exhibited, including Chinese paintings, oil paintings, watercolors, sketches, sculptures, designs, calligraphy, and photography, totaling over 300 pieces. The artists included Liu Haisu, Chen Shuren, Chen Zhifo, Xu Beihong, Fu Baoshi, Wang Yachen, Qin Xuanfu, Lü Sibai, Qi Baishi, Lü Fengzi, Pu Xinyu, Wu Zuoren, Zhu Rizhang, Li Ruinian, Yu Feng, Xue Zhen, and others, as well as two watercolor paintings by Mr. Zhang Daofan, which were the most eye-catching works at the event.

The exhibits were all carefully crafted masterpieces by artists from various regions. Haisu's "Four Banks Warehouse" was a huge oil painting with a composed and powerful composition and coloring, reminding people of the heroic sacrifice of the eight hundred warriors, with profound intention. Shuren's "Wisteria and Little Crow" used casual strokes, floating like the artist himself, with vibrant colors and lifelike resemblance. Zhifo's "Peach Blossom and Crow" used rich colors and was vividly lifelike. Beihong's "Galloping Horse" and Baoshi's "Landscape" had reached a realm of divine transformation. Their brushwork and ink usage were unprecedented and could be called the best. Yachen's "Goldfish" consisted of a few fish swimming up and down, seemingly in the water, with elegant and beautiful coloring and brushwork. Qin Xuanfu's oil paintings, with their bright and rich colors, depicted the vast and serene beauty of the Sichuan landscape with terraced fields and mountains. Lü Sibai's oil portraits and landscapes, with their color tones and brushstrokes, had reached a realm of truth, goodness, and beauty, and could be called masterpieces. Qi Baishi's "Pumpkins by an Eighty-Six-Year-Old Child" used deep indigo to dye the light yellow skin of the pumpkins, adding dark ink for the green leaves, resulting in an aged, vigorous, antique, and fragrant work. Lü Fengzi's "Arhats and Ladies" depicted the inner world of the characters, with iron-wire outlines and a unique style, ancient, vigorous, and undoubtedly unique. Pu Xinyu's landscapes were light, simple, and distant, with elegant coloring, giving a sense of detachment from the world. Wu Zuoren's oil portrait, depicting the female painter Yu Feng, used lively and vivid facial light tones and brushstrokes. Rizhang's watercolor landscapes used simple brushstrokes to depict the maritime scenery, smoke, clouds, and waves realistically. Li Ruinian's oil painting of withered trees by a lake used refined and masterful coloring. Other artists such as Yu Feng and Xue Zhen, with their watercolors, were all excellent artists in the art exhibition. There were so many outstanding works that it is impossible to describe them all. Famous artists gathered, leaving nothing out, concentrating the essence of the country, and exhibiting it in one room. It was truly the most complete art exhibition after the victory, adding a great deal of splendor to the annual Art Festival.

### A Stroll Through the Art Festival Exhibition

— Zhu Bi

Recently, due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce and the difficulty of transportation, art exhibitions in Shanghai do not seem as prosperous as before. Joint exhibitions, in particular, are even harder to see. Seeing the news in the newspapers about the joint exhibition celebrating the Art Festival, with a large-scale exhibition at two venues and no admission fee, shows the enthusiasm of the promoters in promoting art, and also aroused my interest in visiting.

On the day of the Art Festival, I stepped onto the second floor of the National Goods Company. A large venue, connecting more than ten rooms, was arranged neatly and appropriately, in perfect order, giving me a sense of reverence. Upon entering, there were calligraphies by Ye Yuhu, Zhang Ji, Ma Gongyu, and others, as well as Wu Hufan's landscape masterpiece "High Altitude Strange Peak." Zhang Daqian's Dunhuang Grottoes copy, a huge Buddha image reaching a height of over ten feet, painted on cloth with powder color, was brilliant and vivid, as if we were seeing the original murals in person. Wang Yachen, who excels in fish paintings, presented a work that was particularly outstanding, showing that the beauty of an artist who understands nature is not limited to brush and ink. The fish paintings by Liu Shi and others were all works that imitated nature. Wang Jinshan's figure painting "Old Man Waving a Fan" showed great sketching skills. Among the Chinese paintings, there were works with pandas as the theme. The artists were unwilling to be limited by the themes of the ancients; they used their own immediate intuition as the starting point for creation, which is also commendable.

In the Western painting section: Liu Haisu's landscapes and flowers were all completed quickly with bold and unrestrained brushstrokes, with a majestic and vigorous spirit. Yan Wenliang's landscapes, with an extremely meticulous and careful approach, gave people a sense of the preciousness of rules and order. The largest painting in the oil painting section, "Scarred and Broken," was Zhang Chongren's latest creation. He depicted industry destroyed by war, and we must raise the spirit of construction. The enthusiasm of the colors, the magnificence of the brushstrokes, and the implicit composition that Zhang showed on the screen all revealed inner strength. The still life by female writer Zhou Ruying, with red dahlias casually scattered on a white table and a porcelain urn hidden behind, was able to express the nature of the objects and the contrast of colors appropriately. Harding's Yongcai used the charm of dry and wet, real and virtual in watercolor to the fullest. His "The Beginning of the Year" and Wang Hui's "Plan for the Year" both fully demonstrated the spirit of creation. In the midst of the troubled times, we can see the efforts of our young painters; they truly exist. Liu Xucang's "Flower" and "Summer" used delicate yet unrestrained colors and brushstrokes, while Ran Xi's watercolors used all wet washes, and Li Yongsen's watercolors all used dry wrinkles, both full of fun. Gu Tingkang was known for his precision, and Shen Yinying was known for his freedom, each showing their strengths. Other female writers such as Fang Junbi and Shen Yan also presented fine works. In short, the Western paintings in this exhibition were more numerous and of a higher standard than the exhibits at last year's Victory Exhibition.

In the sculpture section, Zhang Chongren's "Sculpture of Wu Hufan" was the most eye-catching for its vivid expression. Zhou Ruying's "The People Take Food as Heaven" had a novel theme and skillful technique. Xu Shiqi's "Portrait" was exquisite and lovely. Liu Kaiqu and Ge Yongliang also had masterpieces on display.

The second venue, the Xu Gengtang of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, was dedicated to photography. Perhaps due to its small size, the number of exhibits was not large, but they were all famous works; some had already been published in the World Photography Yearbook, such as Liu Xucang and Lang Jingshan's proud works. Other famous artists, such as Lin Hanlun, Lu Shifu, and Zhuang Xueben, also had masterpieces on display, providing a good opportunity for those who study photographic art to not miss.

Art is the crystallization of human wisdom and the expression of culture. The rise and fall of a nation and the degree of its evolution are all evidenced by art. However, those engaged in artistic work are often neglected by the material society, and therefore often live in poverty. In this modern era of difficult living, it is truly admirable to have so many beautiful masterpieces for us to appreciate. Although my mind was refreshed after seeing this exhibition, I could not help but feel infinite sympathy for the noble lives of artists.

### Integrated Art

— Yu Jianhua

Du Jun Bingruben, who specializes in applied art, is proficient in patterns, decorations, and advertising paintings. He has made rapid progress and reached a state of perfection; moreover, his thoughts are so wonderful that they inspire awe.

Integrated art generally takes poetry as its main framework. The plot of the poem is divided into several sections, and each section is painted in a picture. The techniques used in the pictures are either Chinese or Western, ancient or modern, each different and with its own charm. Each picture also includes a section of the poem written in various fonts, resembling landscapes, bronze vessels, or steles, with the Cuan Baozi script being the most common. It combines metallurgy, stone carving, calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose into one, opening up a new path for art in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. The name "integrated art" is not an exaggeration.

The most intriguing works are the thirty-eight paintings and poems of "Song of Everlasting Regret," the ten paintings of "Incense Burner and Bell Rhythm," the nine paintings of "Stabbing the Tiger," the sixteen paintings of "Mulan Joins the Army," the eight paintings of "Palindrome Poems," the seven paintings of "Red Bean Poems," the four paintings of "Full Moon and Blooming Flowers," and the one large painting of "Song of Righteousness." They can be read as poetry and prose, as rubbings from stone inscriptions, as Chinese paintings, as Western paintings, or as patterns. There are many painters in Shanghai, but none have ever done this before. It is truly a unique and innovative work of art. Now, Du Jun will publicly exhibit dozens of his masterpieces in the Ningbo Fellow Association Hall. Those who want to understand the face of integrated art and broaden their horizons must see them as soon as possible. Calligraphy belongs to art and requires a talent for art, as well as years of effort, immersing oneself in it, in order to achieve mastery through self-denial and training.

### Lu Shixiong's Calligraphy

— Zhizhi

Calligraphy belongs to art and requires a talent for art, as well as years of effort, immersing oneself in it, in order to achieve mastery through self-denial and training.

My friend Lu Shixiong comes from Jinshan, Jiangsu. His ancestors opened a bookstore there, so he has been sitting in the bookstore since he was a child. He has a natural love for art, and he often browses various steles and inscriptions. He always prepares ink and writes couplets for others, so Lu has many opportunities to practice calligraphy.

Today's young people often have a bias against Chinese and Western literature, excelling in one but lacking in the other. Because of his family background and his education at a church university, he is proficient in both Chinese and English. He has also been working in the insurance industry for a long time, so he has written many books and publications on insurance. Cai Yuanpei, the former president of the Academia Sinica, and Song Hanzhang, the general manager of the Bank of China, both praised Lu's writings.

Lu is taciturn, rarely smiling, decisive, bold but meticulous, sincere and responsible. General Wu Peifu personally wrote "Mountains and rocks do not flow, the sun and moon are naturally high and bright" to describe his character and calligraphy, which can be said to be perfectly suited to his identity.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 208

— Ye Jingfeng

As soon as he finished speaking, he let go, and something about the size of a mothball hit the chest of the young man in the car with a thud, rolling down his clothes. The men and women in the car were startled and looked out of the car, only to see the ragged boy had already retreated a few yards away, still showing his full set of white teeth, smiling, and giving a salute, before turning around and leaving.

"What is this thing?" the woman asked in surprise.

"Probably no malice," the man seemed very calm. After the attendant put away the suitcase and busied himself getting in the car and starting the engine, as the car was already moving, the young man picked up the object; it turned out to be a small paper ball. Unfolding the paper ball, he saw four very vigorous Chinese characters written on it, with a number attached:

"Cathay Hotel...0915."

"Is it a Chinese secret agent?" the woman whispered.

"Maybe," the man seemed too busy smoking a cigarette.

"Are you tired?"

"Why wouldn't I be tired?...Ever since 10:50 last night, three hours in a car, followed by more than four hours of flying, the engine has been running non-stop, and then an hour in a speedboat, so noisy that I couldn't close my eyes."

"I think we women have more endurance, don't you think?" the woman said, taking the piece of paper from the man's hand, looking at it again and again; then, holding it up to the light of the car window, she shined the paper again and again, as if she wanted to study the secret of the paper.

Twenty minutes later, they were already settled in the Banzai Hotel.

"What's on the program, Brother?"

"You haven't announced your program to me...As for my personal program; first, a bath, second, breakfast, third, sleep."

### Unemployed Workers Petition and Resort to Violence

— Xuan Shi

Unemployment is a bitter thing, and it is an even bitterer thing to be unemployed when prices are high. After suffering the torment of unemployment for a long time, one's mood is bound to be bad, and therefore, when interacting with others, one is likely to resort to fighting with fists as long as there is a slight dispute. If these disputes touch one's emotions, they will erupt at the slightest touch, and one's reason will be unable to restrain them.

A few days ago, more than two hundred unemployed workers in a certain industry went to the industry association to petition. It is not known why, but in the middle of the discussion, a verbal conflict suddenly occurred, and the unemployed workers became angry and resorted to violence. In terms of reason, they belong to the same industry and have the same identity. When someone is unemployed, they should be harmonious and work together to find ways to help. However, at this time, although they belong to the same industry, there is a chasm between those who have jobs and those who do not, which separates them. Those who have jobs may not be able to provide much help due to the reality, while those who do not have jobs feel that the other party lacks sympathy and are inevitably unhappy seeing themselves starving. Because of this unhappiness, as long as there is a disagreement, a conflict will erupt. Outsiders think they have a bad temper, but in fact, it is because their mood is too bad. Once there is a fuse, it will explode immediately.

Furthermore, the majority of those who have jobs are not in a good mood either. They are not full, but they are not starving to death, and they harbor a bellyful of resentment all day and night. Given the opportunity, they will also make a big fuss to vent their hatred. Some time ago, someone reported that there were more than a million unemployed people in Shanghai, struggling to survive on the starvation line. In fact, those who have jobs are also struggling. For the past hundred years, we have been struggling in poverty, but in recent years, after a long period of war, life has become more difficult, and therefore, the situation of struggle has become more tragic. The more tragic it is, the stronger the fire in our hearts.

We often hear moralists say, "People's hearts have changed greatly!" In fact, people's hearts have not changed; they have only added a ball of fire. This ball of fire was once used in the War of Resistance, allowing us to persevere to the end and defeat the tyranny. How should we use this ball of fire now? If used well, it can emit a great light; if used poorly, it will forever be a ball of resentment.

### Thoughts on Youth Day

— Tang Shan

Some say that Chinese youth are lucky because they have the opportunity to see this magnificent era; but at the same time, some say that we are unfortunate to be Chinese youth, having experienced hardships and tasted bitterness. Neither this optimistic nor pessimistic view sees the fortune or misfortune of Chinese youth: those who face a great era but have not infused it with a drop of their own blood and sweat are merely spectators in front of a stage, passersby in life; those who have suffered and endured hardships, if it is to bear the pain of this era, should have no complaints and be happy!

The hot blood of youth must flow through the pulse of the times. We have nothing to do with luck or misfortune; we should only have joy and greater joy.

Life cannot be said to be without depression, and the depression of youth is naturally greater: economic, political, romantic, and domestic… but depression is not physiological, but pathological. Understanding this, he should heal himself and also heal those who suffer from the same disease. Do not lose the will to live first; depression is merely a process of transformation, and the joy of rebirth is expected.

Depression is a symbol of all construction: art is like this, and life is like this.

The previous generation told us: "You are young people, you should do this and that": they see themselves as dead souls! But we must never again advise the next generation in the same way: "We are about to get old, all hope is on you": separating ourselves from reality, shirking responsibility, and hoping for others, this kind of youth is the most useless.

Youth and non-youth are not divided by time, but by the soundness of mental strength.

"March 29" is designated as "Youth Day," intending to remind people to cherish the memory of the martyrs and invigorate the spirit of the yellow flowers and green blood. The previous generation of youth shed blood to save the motherland, and this generation of youth sweats to build the motherland. With blood and sweat intermingling, we can complete the magnificent building.

Young people should not weep or retaliate against hatred, nor should they become narrow-minded and violate their nature and aspirations because of hatred. Tolerance, solemnity, purity, and perseverance are the qualities that Chinese youth must possess. (Written two days before the Youth Day of the 36th year)

### Rouge Lips

— Hu Lu

Imported Lipstick

Like Cupid's bow, lipstick skillfully dyes for charm! Worshiping foreign psychology: "Foreign lipsticks are beautiful"!

Alarms smuggling much, national goods have no business; cherry mouth, wiping workers' tears, swallowing up the factory!

Note: Lip makeup is called the "Cupid's Bow Style," see the New York makeup expert's interview in this newspaper a few months ago. In fact, it is what we call the "菱角式" (diamond-shaped style).

### Monks and Nuns Living Together

— Lu Chen

Monks and nuns in Hangzhou openly live together. Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie, indignant at this corruption of customs, exclaimed "Psychological Construction" and intends to "strictly rectify" it. In fact, I think it is "completely unnecessary," because monks are men, and nuns are women, "Yin and Yang harmony is inherently a beautiful thing." To improve customs, there are many things that need "psychological construction" in the whole country, in one province. "Monks" and "nuns" "openly living together," to put it bluntly, is "just a small matter."

Zhou Fohai was actually spared from death, which shows the country's utmost intention to cherish talent. "As far as I know," the central government has always been generous to him in the past, but it could not enable him to "compete with the wealth and position of Kong and Song," so he "turned to Wang." What Zhou Fohai wanted was to "compete with the wealth and position of Kong and Song." After "following Wang," his "wealth and position" reached its "peak." Now, as a man awaiting death, he has actually been spared. Chen and Chu, if they knew, would appear "inferior" in comparison. As they say in Shanghai: "This is Zhou Fohai's trick." Who says it's not true?

### Record of Yang Shixiang

— A Chrysanthemum Lover

The Governor-General of Zhili was the leader of the governors-general and governors of all provinces. Therefore, after the pacification of the Cantonese bandits, Zeng Wenzheng and Li Wenzhong were both seated as prime ministers with noble titles. After the Jiawu War, it was Wang Wenshao. The most昏憤 one was Yu Yan during the Gengzi era. Renhe entered the Grand Council and Ronglu succeeded him. Yu then succeeded Rong, catering to Empress Dowager Cixi and worshiping the Boxers. His misdeeds that harmed the country and the people were the lowest of the low even among the Manchus. Among the Han Chinese governors-general of Zhili, there were two who considered themselves outstanding: one was Yang Shixiang. Lianfu was the son of a famous father and started his career in the Hanlin Academy. He changed his official position to the Daotai of Zhili. During the Gengzi year, he also made some contributions in the siege of Tianjin. When foreign soldiers entered Tianjin, he even suffered serious injuries. Compared with those who now avoid the rear and speak of resistance, it seems that he was still a better option. During the peace talks, he participated in the staff of the Prime Minister of Hefei, and surprisingly became a judicial commissioner and then a governor, suddenly ascending to high positions. His elder brother, Yang Dalang Shixie (Weichun), was a vice minister of the Ministry of Works. Weichun and Lianfu were classmates in the Renwu and Yiyou imperial examinations respectively, so I knew them very well. His political achievements are set aside for the moment, but there are many anecdotes about him that can be told. He was famous for being henpecked throughout his life. As soon as he heard his wife's shrewish roar, he was like Fang Shanzi (Chen Cao, who prostrated himself in the dressing pool), his cane falling to the ground, his heart bewildered. He was genuinely fond of Peking Opera. Except for official business, whether walking, chanting, sitting, or lying down, he would hum. What he hummed was either the "anti-tune" or the "slow board." Therefore, on the day of his death, he sang a high-pitched song and then passed away peacefully. A certain famous scholar jokingly wrote an elegy for him, saying: "Throughout his life, he loved to practice with strings and pipes, and until his death, he never smelled the fragrance of beautiful women." This was because his wife was extremely jealous, and he never had concubines or servants throughout his life, hence the saying. It was widely circulated at the time as a topic of conversation.

The Yang brothers were all talented. Lianfu was Yang the Fourth Brother. In addition to Yang the Fifth Brother Xingcheng, and Qian Qiancheng, who were Xu Shichang's "Hem and Haw Generals," Yang the Third Brother Shichen was also a Jinshi of the Ren Chen year. The Eighth Brother Zhiqing and I took the autumn examination together four times. Because of the official papers, we often had the same examination number. His talent was also very rich and comprehensive, but it was a pity that he did not get the opportunity.

Lianfu's writing style was very appropriate, and his poetry and prose were famous for sale. The Eighth Brother had a love for a singing girl named Suyun. His elder brother wrote a couplet of Du Fu's poems for her, saying: "Deep in the heart, entrust heroic simplicity; Stirring the chest, rise layered clouds." Later, he fell in love with another woman named Hongyu. His elder brother also wrote a couplet for her: "There are plenty of red gorge butterflies surrounding spring; No one recognizes the jade toad." Suyun and Hongyu, both names are extremely familiar and common, but the two couplets are not only well-structured, but also have beautiful diction. They were able to present them in a complete and natural manner, which is truly the work of a talented person. All of this was told to me by the Eighth Brother, so I have included it here.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

"Two very big ears, big ears!" Rong'er, who was crying, suddenly wiped away her tears with the back of her hand and turned around to tell them. He heard A Shi vividly describing his "Bunny Daddy," and his heart was so happy that he temporarily forgot everything in front of him.

"Really! Really! Two big ears, shiny and smooth big ears!" A Shi, who was in his twenties, still had some innocence. "That pair of eyes is also very energetic, making people love it!..."

Although he spoke with enthusiasm, his master understood that it was neither made of gold nor inlaid with any diamonds, so he was no longer interested.

"Stop talking! Be careful with that box!" He interrupted A Shi as if scolding him.

Xiao Shen, however, was unwilling to miss this opportunity.

"Little brother, don't worry, I'll buy you another one tomorrow!" He said to Rong'er, who was staring blankly at Xu the Fat, with a gentle voice that humans rarely possess.

"You can't buy one!" Rong'er replied with a pout.

Outside, there was another violent explosion, and Lan tightly gripped her cold, sweaty hands.

"I'll have one custom-made for you!" Xiao Shen was determined to make this five-year-old child happy. "If we can't have it custom-made here, we'll go to Chongqing to have it custom-made, or to Kunming! If we can't have it custom-made in China, we'll go to America!"

He thought that this would definitely make the child happy.

"You haven't even seen Bunny Daddy, how would you know what he looks like!" Unexpectedly, Xiao Rong said a few words that were even more fierce than an adult's.

This made Xiao Shen feel a little embarrassed.

"Hahaha!" Shen the Fat laughed gleefully. Lan, who had been trying to maintain her composure, had been waiting for so long without seeing 　　 and Zhu Zhaonian's shadows. Her nerves had been so tense that they were numb. She didn't hear Xiao Shen and Rong'er's reply, so she didn't express anything, making Xiao Shen feel that it was really difficult to step down.

There were more explosions and machine gun fire.

"Today, the Japanese devils are deliberately here to 　　　, dropping so many bombs and not running away," 　　　 several people hiding from the air raid said, finally managing to 　　 relieve Xiao Shen's embarrassment.

"It's because our air force has retreated to 　Zhou," Xiao Shen immediately seized this opportunity and started to 　 with them, temporarily having to give up attacking 　. (29)
